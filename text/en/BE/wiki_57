<text>The Xin dynasty (; ), also known as Xin Mang () in Chinese historiography, was a short-lived Chinese imperial dynasty which lasted from 9 to 23 AD, established by the Han dynasty consort kin Wang Mang, who usurped the throne of the Emperor Ping of Han and the infant &quot;crown prince&quot; Liu Ying. The Xin dynasty ruled for over a decade before it was overthrown by rebels. After Wang&#x27;s death, the Han dynasty was restored by Liu Xiu, a distant descendant of the Emperor Jing of Han; therefore, the Xin dynasty is often considered an interregnum of the Han, dividing it into the Western Han and the Eastern Han.

==Etymology==
Chinese dynasties were typically named after the fief of their founders, and this reading is consistent with Wang Mang&#x27;s pre-imperial position as Marquess of Xin. In 1950, C.B. Sargent suggested that the name of the dynasty should be read as meaning &quot;new&quot;, which J. J. L. Duyvendak rejected out of hand. Chauncey S. Goodrich argued that it would be possible to assign a semantic reading to &quot;xin&quot;, but that it ought to be read as &quot;renewed&quot; or &quot;renewal&quot;, not simply &quot;new&quot;.

== History ==
After the death of Emperor Wu of Han, the ruling Liu family was increasingly beset by factional struggles. As result, the power of the imperial clan declined. In contrast, the Wang family grew powerful during the rule of Emperor Cheng of Han, and its leading member Wang Mang used his influence to act as regent for several young puppet emperors. In contrast to other Wang family members who were content to rule the empire by influencing the Han emperors, Wang Mang had greater ambitions. He embarked on a programme of building and learning, creating much positive publicity and propaganda for himself. He openly presented himself as champion of Confucian virtues, and as guiding force of the empire. Following the death of Emperor Ping of Han in 6 AD, Wang Mang cemented his control over the empire. Rebellions against his &quot;de facto&quot; rule were crushed in 6 and 7 AD. Two years later, Wang usurped the throne and officially proclaimed the Xin (literally the &quot;New dynasty&quot;). Though he enjoyed no great support among the empire&#x27;s political class, Wang&#x27;s ascension was generally tolerated because the Han dynasty had lost most of their prestige. Regardless, much of the old bureaucracy and nobility was still loyal to the Han dynasty, but these loyalists did not openly oppose the establishment of the Xin regime.

In contrast, relations with the nomadic Xiongnu confederation quickly deteriorated, and the latter intended to intervene in China around 10/11 AD. Wang responded by mobilizing 300,000 soldiers along the northern border and prevented the Xiongnu from invading China. The continuing disputes with the northern confederation resulted in Wang setting up a rival Xiongnu government in 19 AD, while maintaining the great army at the border. This drained the Xin dynasty&#x27;s resources, weakening its grip on the rest of the empire. 

The new emperor initiated several radical social and political reforms. These aimed at strengthening the central government, restoring the failing economy, weakening the powerful noble families, and improving the livelihood of the empire&#x27;s peasants. The reforms enjoyed some initial successes, and provided a much-needed legitimacy boost to the Xin dynasty. At the same time, the reforms weakened the former imperial clan, as most of the redistributed resources had belonged to the Liu family. Furthermore, Wang patronized education based on Confucianism, taking the Duke of Zhou as his model for a good ruler. His policies were often not implemented by the old bureaucracy who resented his radical reforms. In contrast, the reforms found some acclaim among the empire&#x27;s peasants.

Soon after its inauguration, Wang&#x27;s regime was destabilized by several natural disasters, including the Yellow River changing course, which resulted in massive floods. Plagues of locusts further worsened the situation, and widespread famines broke out. The Xin dynasty&#x27;s economic policies failed to solve the ensuing crisis, and Wang Mang quickly lost the support which he had had among the peasantry as the latter struggled for survival. The desperate peasants in the eastern parts of the empire soon turned to banditry. The bandit groups grew in strength, and numbered tens of thousands of members by the 20s. The most powerful factions along the Yellow River reorganized into rebel armies, known as the Red Eyebrows. The insurgents allied with discontented nobles and descendants of the former imperial clan, resulting in large-scale civil war by 19 AD. Wang Mang was forced to shift troops from other areas to deal with the Red Eyebrows, whereupon the Protectorate of the Western Regions was overrun by the Xiongnu. Smaller rebellions broke out in other parts of China. The &quot;Troops from the Lower Yangtze&quot; operated along this river, while two insurgent bands in Hubei were recruited by Han loyalists. Led by Liu Bosheng, they became known as the Lulin.

As civil war engulfed the entire Xin Empire, Wang&#x27;s loyalist armies fought hard to keep the rebels at bay. The Xin armies scored several victories, but were completely defeated by Han restorationist armies in the Battle of Kunyang in June–July 23 AD. Upon hearing of this event, the irregular militias of Zhuang Ben and Zhuang Chun captured Chang&#x27;an in October 23, plundering the capital and killing Wang Mang. The various rebel armies subsequently fought each other to gain full control over the empire. In 25 AD, Liu Xiu was crowned as Emperor Guangwu of Han in Luoyang. The Red Eyebrows were defeated by Liu Xiu&#x27;s forces in 27 AD, and he also destroyed other rival claimants as well as separatist regimes including Wang Lang&#x27;s Zhao state, Gongsun Shu&#x27;s Chengjia empire, and warlord Wei Ao in the northwest. By 37 AD, the Han dynasty was fully restored.

== Government ==
Wang Mang implemented several reforms, systematically transforming the government of the Han dynasty based on his understanding of the Confucian classics and what turned out to be his faulty beliefs about the ancient Western Zhou&#x27;s government system. Sinologist Li Feng described these reforms as &quot;socialist and imperialist combined&quot;. In order to weaken the nobles, strengthen the central government, reform the economy, and improve the peasants&#x27; situation, Wang Mang redistributed land from the rich to those who owned nothing, introduced new taxes on slave owning, prohibited the sale of slaves, and implemented limits on how much farmland one family was allowed to own. He established the first income tax through a 10% tax of net earnings from wild herb and fruit collection, fishing, shepherding, and various nonagricultural activities and forms of trading. People were obligated to report their taxes to the government and officials would audit these reports. The penalty for evading this tax was one year of hard labor and confiscation of the entirety of a person&#x27;s property. Because it caused popular discontent, this income tax was abolished in 22 CE.

He also nationalized farmland, and restored the government&#x27;s old monopoly on the salt and iron industries. To further strengthen the empire&#x27;s struggling economy and restore the government&#x27;s fiscal stability, the Xin dynasty also implemented a new system to stabilize market prices, replaced the gold currency with a bronze currency, and forced nobles of marquis and lower rank to exchange all their gold for copper coins. These policies allowed the nearly-broke government to regain much-needed funds, and actually improved the economy, but caused great resentment among the nobility. Wang Mang also reduced the status of foreign vassal rulers in an attempt to strengthen the Xin empire&#x27;s control over its border regions.

In an attempt to return to an idealized past, the Xin regime also implemented architectural changes to the capital Chang&#x27;an. The &quot;Nine Temples&quot; were constructed where the emperor worshipped the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, breaking with the Han dynasty&#x27;s tradition to worship one&#x27;s own ancestors. At the &quot;Bright Hall&quot;, Wang Mang observed the change of the seasons in accordance with the Confucian traditions. He also opened up posts at the imperial academies, so far dominated by New Text Confucianism, for scholars who supported the Confucian Old Texts. Sinologist Hans van Ess has speculated that this was Wang Mang&#x27;s attempt at achieving a better balance between the competing schools of thought, although the emperor himself probably preferred the Confucian New Texts.

Historians who lived during the Han dynasty ridiculed Wang Mang&#x27;s movement to return to the order of the Zhou dynasty as neither practical nor successful, but the Xin dynasty&#x27;s attempted reforms served as an inspiration for later emperors. According to Li Feng, Wang Mang would have been &quot;the greatest reformer in Chinese history&quot; if his regime had survived.

<doc id="285554" wikidata="Q938926" url="?curid=285554" title="Masterpiece">
<text>A masterpiece, , or ; ; ) is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person&#x27;s career or a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship.

Historically, a &quot;masterpiece&quot; was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
== Etymology ==
The form &quot;masterstik&quot; is recorded in English or Scots in a set of Aberdeen guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas &quot;masterpiece&quot; is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a Ben Jonson play. &quot;Masterprize&quot; was another early variant in English.

In English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was &quot;in early use, often applied to man as the &#x27;masterpiece&#x27; of God or Nature&quot;.

== History ==
Originally, the term &quot;masterpiece&quot; referred to a piece of work produced by an apprentice or journeyman aspiring to become a master craftsman in the old European guild system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, painting, goldsmithing, knifemaking, leatherworking, or many other trades. 

In London, in the 17th century, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a &quot;workhouse&quot; in Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the &quot;true practise of the Art &amp; Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish &amp; perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings &amp; parts thereof without the help of many &amp; several hands...&quot;. The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.

In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce columbine cups, dies for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths&#x27; guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.

In its original meaning, the term was generally restricted to tangible objects, but in some cases, where guilds covered the creators of intangible products, the same system was used. The best-known example today is Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (1868), where much of the plot is concerned with the hero&#x27;s composition and performance of a &quot;masterpiece&quot; song, to allow him to become a &quot;meistersinger&quot; in the (non-commercial) Nuremberg guild. This follows the surviving rulebook of the guild.

The practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now reception piece. The Royal Academy in London uses the term &quot;diploma work&quot; and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.

== Modern use ==
In modern use, a masterpiece is a creation in any area of the arts that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person&#x27;s career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. For example, the novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens is generally considered a literary masterpiece. The term is often used loosely, and some critics, such as Edward Douglas of &quot;The Tracking Board&quot;, feel it is overused in describing recent films.

<doc id="285555" wikidata="Q378249" url="?curid=285555" title="William Clito">
<text>William Clito (25 October 110228 July 1128) was a member of the House of Normandy who ruled the County of Flanders from 1127 until his death and unsuccessfully claimed the Duchy of Normandy. As the son of Robert Curthose, the eldest son of William the Conqueror, William Clito was seen as a candidate to succeed his uncle King Henry I of England. Henry viewed him as a rival, however, and William allied himself with King Louis VI of France. Louis installed him as the new count of Flanders upon the assassination of Charles the Good, but the Flemings soon revolted and William died in the struggle against another claimant to Flanders, Thierry of Alsace.

==Youth==
William was the son of Duke Robert Curthose of Normandy and Sibylla of Conversano. His father was the first son of King William the Conqueror of England. His nickname &quot;Clito&quot; was a Medieval Latin term equivalent to the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Aetheling&quot; and its Latinized form &quot;Adelinus&quot; (used to refer to his first cousin, William Adelin). Both terms signified &quot;man of royal blood&quot; or, the modern equivalent, &quot;prince&quot;. It may have been derived from the Latin &quot;inclitus/inclutus&quot;, &quot;celebrated.&quot;

Robert was defeated and captured by his brother King Henry I of England at the Battle of Tinchebrai in 1106. Robert accompanied Henry to Falaise where Henry met his nephew William for the first time. Henry placed his nephew in the custody of Helias of Saint Saens, count of Arques, who had married a natural daughter of Duke Robert, his friend and patron. William stayed in his sister&#x27;s and Helias&#x27;s care until August 1110, when the king abruptly sent agents to demand the boy be handed over to him. Helias was at the time away from home, so his household concealed William and smuggled him to their master, who fled the duchy and found safety among Henry&#x27;s enemies.

==First Norman Rebellion, 1118–19==
William&#x27;s first refuge was with King Henry&#x27;s great enemy, Robert de Bellême, who had extensive estates south of the duchy. On Robert&#x27;s capture in 1112, William and Helias fled to the court of the young Count Baldwin VII of Flanders, William&#x27;s cousin. In 1118 a powerful coalition of Norman counts and barons was sufficiently disenchanted with King Henry to ally with Count Baldwin and rebel. They took up William Clito&#x27;s cause and commenced a dangerous rebellion.

The Norman border counts and Count Baldwin between them were too powerful for the king and seized much of the north of the duchy. But the promising campaign abruptly ended with Baldwin&#x27;s serious injury at the siege of Arques (September 1118). The next year the cause of William Clito was taken up by King Louis VI of France. He invaded the duchy down the river Seine, and on 20 August 1119 was met by the troops of King Henry at the Battle of Brémule, where the French were decisively defeated.

William had ridden as a new knight amongst the king&#x27;s guard that day, and barely escaped capture. His cousin, King Henry&#x27;s son William Adelin, the next day sent him back the horse he had lost in the battle with other &quot;necessities&quot; in a courtly gesture. The rebellion collapsed, but William continued to find support at the French court. Louis brought his case to the pope&#x27;s attention in October 1119 at Reims, and forced Henry I to justify his treatment of the exiled boy.

==Second Norman Rebellion, 1123–24==
The death by drowning in the &quot;White Ship&quot; disaster of William Adelin, Henry&#x27;s only legitimate son, on 25 November 1120 transformed William Clito&#x27;s fortunes. He was now a contender for the thrones of England and Normandy, and a significant party of Norman aristocrats adopted his cause. Henry&#x27;s problems became worse, as William Adelin had been betrothed to Matilda, daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou, and Fulk demanded the return of her dowry of several castles and towns in the county of Maine, between Normandy and Anjou. Henry refused. Fulk, in turn, betrothed his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, giving to him the entire county of Maine as her dowry. King Henry appealed astutely to canon law, however, and the marriage was eventually annulled in August 1124 on the grounds that the couple were within the prohibited degree of kinship.

In the meantime, a serious aristocratic rebellion broke out in Normandy in favour of William, but was defeated by Henry&#x27;s intelligence network and the lack of organisation of the leaders, who were defeated at the Battle of Bourgthéroulde in March 1124. Louis VI was distracted from active intervention as Henry I persuaded his son-in-law Emperor Henry V to threaten Louis from the east.

==Count of Flanders==
Louis VI made great efforts to further William&#x27;s cause in 1127. In January he granted him the royal estates in the French Vexin as a base to attack down the Seine into Normandy, and he was married to Joanna of Montferrat, a half-sister of Queen Adelaide of France. The murder of Count Charles the Good of Flanders on 2 March 1127 gave King Louis an even better chance to further William&#x27;s fortunes. He marched into Flanders at the head of an army and on 30 March got the barons of the province to accept William as their new count.

Initially, William did well, securing most of the county by the end of May. But English money and the emergence of a rival in Thierry of Alsace led to a deterioration in his position. In February 1128, Saint-Omer and Ghent declared against him, as did Bruges in March. In May 1128, Lille too welcomed Thierry, leaving William controlling little more than the southern fringe of Flanders. However, he struck back at Bruges and at the Battle of Axspoele south of the town on 21 June, William, with his Norman knights and French allies, defeated Thierry.

At this point, William was joined by Count Godfrey I of Louvain, and together their armies besieged Aalst on 12 July, with the probable intention of going on from there to reduce Ghent. During the course of the siege he was wounded in the arm in a scuffle with a foot soldier. The wound became gangrenous and William died at the age of twenty-five on 28 July 1128, attended to the end by his faithful brother-in-law, Helias of Saint-Saëns, whose wife was one of William&#x27;s illegitimate half-sisters.

William had written letters to his uncle, Henry I, asking for his followers to be pardoned; Henry did as requested. Some followers returned to Henry I while others set out for the crusade.

William&#x27;s body was carried to the abbey of St Bertin in St. Omer and buried there. He left no children and was survived by his imprisoned father by six years.

<text>Sterling was a brand name of automobiles marketed in the United States and Canada by Austin Rover Cars of North America (later renamed Sterling Motor Cars), a division of the Rover Group company of the United Kingdom. It was sold in North America from 1987 to 1991, during which time Rover was in collaboration with Honda of Japan. Models sold were the Sterling 825, Sterling 827 and a limited production Sterling Oxford Edition based on the 827.

== Model range ==

The only Sterling model that was sold was the 800 series, which was a rebadged Rover 800 series but with different specifications tailored for the North American market. In the United States and Canada, the Sterling was only available with a V6 gasoline engine.

===825 and 827===
In 1987 and 1988, only the sedan body-styled 825 (trims S or SL) was offered. In 1989, the hatchback was added alongside the sedan, coinciding with the introduction of a new, larger, Honda engine. The new models were called 827 and were available in S, SL, SL Limited or SLi trims in 1989; S, Si, SL or SLi trims in 1990; and Si or SLi trims in 1991.

===Oxford Edition===
350 limited production Oxford Editions were also available in 1990. Based on the Sterling 827 SL sedan, the Oxford Edition included upgraded interior trim and added various luxury/convenience items such as a built-in cellular phone.

==Experience in the market==


Sales in America were initially strong, due to the appeal of classic &#x27;British&#x27; interior design, combined with a clean and up to date exterior design, both of which compared well with its sister the Acura Legend. U.S. sales hit a high of just over 14,000 cars in 1987. All models came with extensive, real wood interior trim. The SL models also feature ABS, power Connolly leather seats, and two-tone paint as standard equipment. U.S. market Sterlings got motorized automatic seatbelts in the 1989 model year.

While dynamic characteristics and performance were broadly similar to the Legend, due to the shared platform, core structure and power units; detail spring and damper changes gave each model its own unique feel. The Sterlings were the sportier cars, with less float and an overall tighter feel than the Acura Legends. The ride/handling compromise was defined through the shared use of Honda&#x27;s double wishbone front suspension that allowed a very low hood line, but offered limited wheel travel. This meant that on poorer road surfaces, there was a greater possibility of reduced traction.

Early build quality of the 800 was demonstrably poor as measured by J.D. Power. The various problems included issues with interior trim – for example, the hood latch remained on the passenger side of the cabin the first year in production – problematic Lucas electronics, and paintwork. Corrosion problems in early models would also mar its reputation. All of this contributed to the eventual demise of Rover in the United States. The Sterling fell to the bottom of J.D. Power surveys, while its twin, the Japanese-built Acura Legend, had enjoyed top rankings its first year.

During its run, the instrumentation had been changed to gauges sourced from a different component builder (losing the oil pressure gauge and voltmeter in the process) and build quality had started to improve year to year. However, these changes were too late to prevent the U.S.-market version from later being withdrawn due to poor sales.

==Discontinuation==
Combined with the effects of the strong British currency, Rover was losing money, and recovering lost ground with the facelifted car and its coupe sister was not deemed possible, and Rover Cars announced its withdrawal from the North American market in August 1991. At the time of the announcement, the company had sold fewer than 2,000 units so far that year.

After the withdrawal from the U.S. market, the Rover 800 remained popular in Europe, especially following the major R17 facelift and was kept in production until 1999 when it was replaced by the Rover 75.

<text>Deheubarth (; , thus &#x27;the South&#x27;) was a regional name for the realms of south Wales, particularly as opposed to Gwynedd (Latin: &quot;Venedotia&quot;). It is now used as a shorthand for the various realms united under the House of Dinefwr, but that Deheubarth itself was not considered a proper kingdom on the model of Gwynedd, Powys, or Dyfed is shown by its rendering in Latin as &quot;dextralis pars&quot; or as &quot;Britonnes dexterales&quot; (&quot;the Southern Britons&quot;) and not as a named land. In the oldest British writers, &quot;Deheubarth&quot; was used for &quot;all&quot; of modern Wales to distinguish it from &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; (&quot;Y Gogledd&quot;), the northern lands whence Cunedda originated.

==History==

Deheubarth was united around 920 by Hywel Dda out of the territories of Seisyllwg and Dyfed, which had come into his possession. Later on, the Kingdom of Brycheiniog was also added. Caerleon was previously the principal court of the area, but Hywel&#x27;s dynasty fortified and built up a new base at Dinefwr, near Llandeilo, giving them their name.

After the high-water mark set by Hywel, Dinefwr was repeatedly overrun. First, by the Welsh of the north and east: by Llywelyn ap Seisyll of Gwynedd in 1018; by Rhydderch ab Iestyn of Morgannwg in 1023; by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Gwynedd in 1041 and 1043. In 1075, Rhys ab Owain and the noblemen of Ystrad Tywi succeeded in killing their lord Bleddyn ap Cynfyn. Although Rhys was quickly overrun by Gwynedd and Gwent, his cousin Rhys ap Tewdwr through his marriage into Bleddyn&#x27;s family and through battle reestablished his dynasty&#x27;s hegemony over south Wales just in time for the second wave of conquest: a prolonged Norman invasion under the Marcher Lords. In 1093, Rhys was killed in unknown circumstances while resisting their expansion into Brycheiniog and his son Gruffydd was briefly thrown into exile.

Following the death of Henry I, in 1136 Gruffydd formed an alliance with Gwynedd for the purpose of a revolt against Norman incursions. He took part in Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd&#x27;s victory over the Normans at Crug Mawr. The newly liberated region of Ceredigion, though, was not returned to his family but annexed by Owain.

The long and capable rule of Gruffydd&#x27;s son the Lord Rhys and the civil wars that followed Owain&#x27;s death in Gwynedd briefly permitted the South to reassert the hegemony Hywel Dda had enjoyed two centuries before. On his death in 1197, though, Rhys redivided his kingdom among his several sons and none of them ever again rivalled his power. By the time Llywelyn the Great won the wars in Gwynedd, in the first half of the 13th century, lords in Deheubarth merely appear among his clients.

Following the conquest of Wales by Edward I, the South was divided into the historic counties of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire by the Statute of Rhuddlan.

==Religion==
In the arena of the church, Sulien was the leader of the monastic community at Llanbadarn Fawr in Ceredigion. Born ca. 1030, he became Bishop of St David&#x27;s in 1073 and again in 1079/80. Both of his sons followed him into the service of the church. At this time the prohibition against the marriage of clerics was not yet established. His sons produced a number of manuscripts and original Latin and vernacular poems. They were very active in the ecclesiastical and political life of Deheubarth. One son, Rhygyfarch (Latin: &quot;Ricemarchus&quot;) of Llanbadarn Fawr, wrote the &quot;Life of Saint David&quot; and another, Ieuan, was a skilful scribe and illuminator. He copied some of the works of Augustine of Hippo and may have written the &quot;Life of St. Padarn&quot;.

== List of rulers ==

The kingdom of Deheubarth was formed by the union of the kingdoms of Ceredigion, Seisyllwg and Dyfed. Ceredigion was absorbed into Seisyllwg and Dyfed was merged with Seisyllwg to form Deheubarth in 909.

<text>The Lorelei ( ; or , ; also found as &quot;Loreleï&quot;, &quot;Lore Lay&quot;, &quot;Lore-Ley&quot;, &quot;Lurley&quot;, &quot;Lurelei&quot; and &quot;Lurlei&quot; throughout history) is a , steep slate rock on the right bank of the River Rhine in the Rhine Gorge (or Middle Rhine) at Sankt Goarshausen in Germany, part of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley UNESCO World Heritage Site. The 1930s Loreley Amphitheatre is on top of the rock.

It has been an infamous maritime disaster site since its first records during the 10th century, with a varied mythos, ranging from dwarfs to a siren trying to explain the high number of ship wrecks and the loud echo inside the passage.

==Etymology==


The name comes from the old German words , Rhine dialect for &quot;murmuring&quot;, and the Old German term &quot;rock&quot;. The translation of the name would therefore be &quot;murmur rock&quot; or &quot;murmuring rock&quot;. The heavy currents, and a small waterfall in the area (still visible in the early 19th century) created a murmuring sound, and this combined with the special echo the rock produces to act as a sort of amplifier, giving the rock its name. The murmuring is hard to hear today owing to the urbanization of the area. Other theories attribute the name to the many boating accidents on the rock, by combining the German verb (&#x27;to lurk, lie in wait&#x27;) with the same &quot;ley&quot; ending, with the translation &quot;lurking rock&quot;.

After the German spelling reform of 1901, in almost all German terms, the letter &quot;y&quot; was changed to the letter &quot;i&quot;.

==Original folklore and modern myth==

The rock and the murmur it creates have inspired various tales. An old legend envisioned dwarfs living in caves in the rock.

In 1801, German author Clemens Brentano composed his ballad &quot;Zu Bacharach am Rheine&quot; as part of a fragmentary continuation of his novel &quot;Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter&quot;. It first told the story of an enchanting woman associated with the rock. In the poem, the beautiful Lore Lay, betrayed by her sweetheart, is accused of bewitching men and causing their death. Rather than sentence her to death, the bishop consigns her to a nunnery. On the way thereto, accompanied by three knights, she comes to the Lorelei rock. She asks permission to climb it and view the Rhine once again. She does so, and, thinking that she sees her love in the Rhine, falls to her death; the rock ever afterward retaining an echo of her name. Brentano had taken inspiration from Ovid and the Echo myth.

In 1824, Heinrich Heine seized on and adapted Brentano&#x27;s theme in one of his most famous poems, &quot;Die Lorelei&quot;. It describes the eponymous female as a sort of siren who, sitting on the cliff above the Rhine and combing her golden hair, unwittingly distracted shipmen with her beauty and song, causing them to crash on the rocks. In 1837 Heine&#x27;s lyrics were set to music by Friedrich Silcher in the art song &quot;Lorelei&quot; that became well known in German-speaking lands. A setting by Franz Liszt was also favored and dozens of other musicians have set the poem to music. During the Nazi regime and World War II, Heinrich Heine (born as a Jew) became discredited as author of the lyrics, in an effort to dismiss and hide Jewish contribution to German art. Loreley also appears in the poem &quot;Waldesgespräch&quot; which appears as a dialog in Joseph von Eichendorff&#x27;s first novel, &quot;&quot; (1812); that poem was set by Robert Schumann in his &quot;Liederkreis&quot;, Op. 39.

The Lorelei character, although originally imagined by Brentano, passed into German popular culture in the form described in the Heine–Silcher song and is commonly but mistakenly believed to have originated in an old folk tale. The French writer Guillaume Apollinaire took up the theme again in his poem &quot;La Loreley&quot;, from the collection &quot;Alcools&quot; which is later cited in Symphony No. 14 (3rd movement) of Dmitri Shostakovich. The character continues to be referenced in pop culture, such as the 1998 Eagle-Eye Cherry single &quot;When Mermaids Cry.&quot;

==Accidents==
A barge carrying 2,400 tons of sulphuric acid capsized on 13 January 2011, near the Lorelei rock, blocking traffic on one of Europe&#x27;s busiest waterways.

<text>Feeling Minnesota is a 1996 American crime comedy film written and directed by Steven Baigelman. It stars Keanu Reeves, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Cameron Diaz, Tuesday Weld, Dan Aykroyd, and Delroy Lindo.

==Plot==
Ex-stripper Freddie Clayton is marrying Sam to repay a debt owed to nightclub owner Red. At the wedding, Freddie meets Jjaks, Sam&#x27;s brother, and they instantly fall in love. Jjaks and Freddie decide to run off together, eventually staying in a motel. After realizing that they do not have any money, Freddie and Jjaks decide to go back and steal some of Sam&#x27;s money. Sam catches Jjaks in the act and they fight. After escaping, Jjaks returns to the motel, unaware that Sam has been following him. After Jjaks passes out due to the fight, Sam ends up shooting Freddie in the stomach in Jjaks&#x27;s car, and tries to frame the killing on him by returning Freddie&#x27;s body to the motel room along with the murder weapon.

The next morning, Jjaks awakens, unable to recall anything that happened after his fight with Sam. Seeing Freddie&#x27;s body in the room along with the gun, he briefly thinks that maybe he killed Freddie. After being tipped off by Sam, the police arrive but Jjaks hastily avoids capture, driving Freddie&#x27;s body to a remote area in the woods to lay her to rest. All the while, Sam has been watching these events from afar, hoping for Jjaks&#x27;s arrest.

Sam now calls a friend, Detective Ben Costikyan, who promptly arrests Jjaks. The trio, along with Costikyan&#x27;s partner Lloyd, drive to where Freddie was supposedly buried. However, upon arrival, they are unable to find her. Angered at Sam for misleading him, Costikyan drives off with Lloyd, leaving the brothers beside the road.

Upon returning home, the brothers receive a phone call from the motel manager, who, based on seeing Sam carrying Freddie&#x27;s body &quot;into&quot; the motel room and Jjaks carrying the body &quot;out of&quot; the room, wants $50,000 to keep quiet. Jjaks now realizes that Sam was setting him up for Freddie&#x27;s murder. After another fight, they decide that Jjaks will go to the motel to talk to the manager while Sam will see Red, hoping for a loan.

At this point, Red has learned that Sam has been stealing money from him for the past year. Sam ends up shooting and killing Red after a brief skirmish and collects the $50,000 from a safe. Jjaks meets with the motel manager but sees Freddie&#x27;s necklace on the floor of the manager&#x27;s apartment. Confused and angry, Jjaks throws the manager outside and threatens to kill him. Suddenly out of nowhere, an alive Freddie walks towards them, calling for Jjaks, who faints. When he revives, she shows Jjaks her bullet wound and tells him that Sam is a bad shot and that someone picked her up from the side of the road where he had left her body.

The next morning, Sam calls Jjaks and tells him he got the money. However, after seeing Freddie alive from a nearby diner, he confronts Jjaks and Freddie in the manager&#x27;s apartment. Sam ends up getting shot when the couple try to defend themselves. Costikyan enters the hotel room and suffocates Sam by holding his hand against his mouth. It turns out that Freddie had called Costikyan after being rescued and used him to help her get the $50,000. A betrayed and wounded Jjaks is left helpless.

Some time later, Costikyan is arrested in his underwear inside a hotel, as Freddie had tipped off the cops and left with the money. She and Jjaks have since fallen out, but Jjaks, recalling her dream of being a dancer in Las Vegas, hitchhikes there. When he finds her living her dream, she happily says, &quot;What took you so fucking long?&quot; before they embrace.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; has a 14% approval rating based on 21 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Clumsily derivative, shoddily assembled, and fundamentally miscast, &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; sets out for romantic comedy and gets irrevocably lost along the way.&quot;

Negative reviews said the plot felt too reminiscent of other films, particularly those of &quot;Quentin Tarantino and the recent cycle of indies about lowlifes, petty criminals and wannabes&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Emanuel Levy wrote, &quot;Meant to be an offbeat, darkly comic tale of a triangle of losers desperately clinging to their versions of the American dream, pic comes across as a charmless high-concept indie.&quot; In contrast, Siskel &amp; Ebert gave the film &quot;two thumbs up.&quot; In his review, Roger Ebert awarded 3 out of 4 stars to the film and wrote, &quot;[Baigelman] creates a whimsical, grungy reality in which whenever the steamy love affair threatens to get boring, it is interrupted by an action scene&quot;. He praised Diaz&#x27;s &quot;range and comic ability&quot; and said that the film, along with &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot;, &quot;establishes [Reeves] as one of the most gifted romantic leads of his generation&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack for the film was released in August 1996 through Atlantic Records. The film&#x27;s title was derived from lyrics in the 1991 song &quot;Outshined&quot; by the band Soundgarden although neither the band nor the song appear on the soundtrack. The album received a mixed review from AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who ended his review with &quot;the overall effect of the whole &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; juggernaut can&#x27;t help but make you feel a little &#x27;sick.&#x27; &quot;

<text>Mystery Island is a live-action science fiction adventure television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that originally aired as a segment on &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; from September 10, 1977, to January 21, 1978, on CBS.

In the fall of 1979, &quot;Mystery Island&quot; continued to air on &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; when the show returned to CBS in a shortened half-hour version on Sunday mornings until January 25, 1981. In September 2005, episodes resurfaced on Boomerang and were rebroadcast as part of &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot;.

==Summary==
The series follows the adventures of three young people: Chuck Kelly (Stephen Parr), a pilot; Sue Corwin (Lynn Marie Johnston), a computer expert; her younger brother Sandy (Larry Volk) and their computer robot called P.O.P.S. (voiced by Frank Welker). The trio become stranded on a remote island after the evil mad scientist Dr. Strange (Michael Kermoyan) uses his projector beam ray to crash their plane. Dr. Strange hopes to capture P.O.P.S. and use it in his quest for world domination.

&quot;Mystery Island&quot; was very similar in scope to Sid and Marty Krofft&#x27;s 1976 live-action series &quot;Dr. Shrinker&quot; (from &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;) which also saw a trio of humans on a plane brought down to the island of a different mad scientist. A total of sixteen episodes of &quot;Mystery Island&quot; were produced, each running ten minutes and included a cliffhanger that was resolved in the next installment.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Chuck Kelly (portrayed by Stephen Parr) - A dedicated young pilot stranded on Mystery Island with Sue and Sandy Corwin and their robot P.O.P.S. He is determined to get the group safely back to civilization, and though sometimes prone to rash decisions, often sticks his neck out for the others.
* Sue Corwin (portrayed by Lynn Marie Johnston) - A pretty and feisty young computer expert whose scientist father created the robot P.O.P.S. Though she is skeptical about P.O.P.S.&#x27; claims of having feelings, she does care for the robot&#x27;s well-being, as well as for her brother and Chuck.
* Sandy Corwin (portrayed by Larry Volk) - Her likeable adolescent brother. Though he frequently argues with his sister, the two care for each other. He looks up to Chuck, and has a good rapport with P.O.P.S., often defending the robot&#x27;s claims to feeling emotions. He is also an accomplished high school gymnast.
* P.O.P.S. (voiced by Frank Welker) - The robot whose vast intelligence and ability to speak many languages has made him the target of Dr. Strange. He is similar to C-3PO in that both function as comic relief, and have a prim and fussy British butler type of personality, and a tendency to fret whenever a dangerous situation arises. He claims to be capable of feelings. The P.O.P.S. prop costume was a re-use of the original Robot B-9 from the 1960s television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, modified with a bubble on its shoulders, a cylindrical (rather than bubble) head, a blue-and-white paint job, and other minor changes (P.O.P.S. image.). It has since been restored to its original Robot B-9 appearance.

===Villains===
* Dr. Strange (portrayed by Michael Kermoyan) - The principal villain of the series. He is a mad scientist obsessed with obtaining P.O.P.S. and using his vast knowledge to give him world domination. Doctor Strange&#x27;s full real name, if he even had one, was never revealed throughout the series&#x27; run. He should not be confused with the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name.
** Krieg (portrayed by Henry Corden) - Dr. Strange&#x27;s nasty but inept chief henchman. He wants very much to impress his boss but usually falls short.
** Sly (actor unknown) - A bald-headed oaf who is unofficially Krieg&#x27;s second-in-command and somewhat smarter, usually the first to question his superior&#x27;s dubious decisions.
** Crunch (actor unknown) - Another of Dr. Strange&#x27;s thuggish henchmen, and their unofficial clown. He&#x27;s usually the first to be &quot;volunteered&quot; whenever Dr. Strange needs a human &quot;guinea-pig&quot; to test a new weapon on.
** The Parrot - Dr. Strange&#x27;s pet which appears occasionally. It seems to be the one thing Dr. Strange shows any affection for, similar to Ernst Stavro Blofeld with his cat.

There are at least two other henchmen, but they are never named and never speak, and are played by two sets of actors who switch from episode to episode.

===Other characters===
* The Mud People - The mud-covered island natives who pursue P.O.P.S., believing the robot to be a god. They speak in some kind of primitive language that only P.O.P.S. and Titan can understand and translate.
* The Bird Men - A race of humanoid birds from the planet Falconia who were transported to Mystery Island by Dr. Strange prior to the beginning of the series.
** Wark (actor unknown) - A Bird Man who can speak in English. He is determined to turn Sue Corwin into a bird-woman to serve his people as their new princess and oracle.
* The Lava Man (actor unknown) - A huge, hulking creature made of lava who befriends the Corwins and Chuck after they save his life. He communicates mainly in grunting and a kind of gibberish which only P.O.P.S. can translate. The Lava Man has a bit of a crush on Sue.
* The Ape Men - A race of super-intelligent apes that are the result of an experiment in evolution by Dr. Strange to whom they are very loyal as they wish him to advance them into human beings. The Ape Men are shown to be afraid of the Mud People.
** Korba - The leader of the Ape Men.
* Titan (voice actor unknown) - A massive computer with artificial intelligence who considers all humans inferior, except possibly its creator Dr. Strange.

<doc id="285561" wikidata="Q1525061" url="?curid=285561" title="Government National Mortgage Association">
<text>The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), or Ginnie Mae, is a government-owned corporation of the United States Federal Government within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It was founded in 1968 and works to expand affordable housing by guaranteeing housing loans (mortgages) thereby lowering financing costs such as interest rates for those loans. It does that through guaranteeing to investors the on-time payment of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) even if homeowners default on the underlying mortgages and the homes are foreclosed upon. 

Ginnie Mae guarantees only securities backed by single-family and multifamily loans insured by government agencies, including the Federal Housing Authority, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Public and Indian Housing, and the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development. Ginnie Mae neither originates nor purchases mortgage loans nor buys, sells or issues securities. The credit risk on the mortgage collateral underlying its mortgage-backed securities primarily resides with other insuring government agencies. 

Ginnie Mae is similar to Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) with the difference being that Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned government corporation whereas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are &quot;government-sponsored enterprises&quot; (GSEs), which are federally chartered corporations privately owned by shareholders. Today, Ginnie Mae securities are the only mortgage-backed securities that are backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; guaranty of the United States Federal Government, although some have argued that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities are &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; beneficiaries of this guarantee after the Federal Government rescued them from insolvency and placed them under government conservatorship in September 2008 during the Great Recession.

==History==
In 1934, during the depths of the Great Depression, the United States Congress responded to the crisis by passing the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). One of the principal objectives of the FHA was to increase the flow of capital to the housing markets by insuring private lenders against the risk of mortgage default. FHA also was tasked with chartering and regulating a national mortgage association that would buy and sell FHA-insured mortgages. In 1938, Congress amended the act to create the Federal National Mortgage Association, more commonly known as &quot;Fannie Mae&quot;, to help mortgage lenders gain further access to capital for mortgage loans.

The provisions of the act changed gradually over the years. It was not until 1968, however, in response to a perceived need to further broaden the capital base available for mortgages, that the housing finance system began to resemble its current form. As part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Congress partitioned Fannie Mae into two entities:
* Fannie Mae, which was originally restricted to purchasing Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration (VA) mortgages (Fannie Mae was permitted to deal in conventional mortgages in 1970), and
* Ginnie Mae, formerly the Government National Mortgage Association, which originally only provided insurance for bonds issued by FHA and VA mortgages in special affordable housing programs.

In 1970, Ginnie Mae became the first organization to create and guarantee MBS products and has continued to provide mortgage funds for homebuyers ever since. 

Today, Ginnie Mae securities are the only mortgage-backed securities that are backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; guaranty of the United States government, although some have argued that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities are &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; beneficiaries of this guarantee after the US government rescued them from insolvency in 2008.

==Business==
Ginnie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest payments on residential mortgage-backed security (MBS) instruments to institutional investors worldwide. These securities, or “pools” of mortgage loans, are used as collateral for the issuance of securities on Wall Street. MBS instruments are commonly referred to as &quot;pass-through&quot; certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is &quot;passed through&quot; to investors; because of Ginnie Mae&#x27;s financial backing, these MBS instruments are particularly attractive to investors and, like other Agency MBS instruments, are eligible to be traded in the &quot;to-be-announced,&quot; or &quot;TBA&quot; market.

Ginnie Mae guarantees only securities backed by single-family and multifamily loans insured by government agencies, including the FHA, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Public and Indian Housing, and the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development. One of the newer mortgage types they insure is the RG pool, a new pool type being deployed by Ginnie Mae to securitize the Re-performing Loans affected by the Special Restrictions on Re-performing Loans Related to COVID-19 Pandemic
published in APM 20-07.

Ginnie Mae neither originates nor purchases mortgage loans. It does not purchase, sell, or issue securities. Accordingly, Ginnie Mae does not use derivatives to hedge and it does not carry long-term debt (or related outstanding securities liabilities) on its balance sheet. Instead, private lending institutions approved by Ginnie Mae originate eligible loans, pool them into securities, and issue the Ginnie Mae MBS instruments. These institutions include geographically diverse mortgage companies, commercial banks, and thrifts of all sizes, as well as state housing finance agencies.

<doc id="285563" wikidata="Q2998293" url="?curid=285563" title="Eleanor de Montfort">
<text>Eleanor de Montfort, Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon (1252 – 19 June 1282) was an English noblewoman and Welsh princess through her marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who was Prince of Gwynedd, and later, Prince of Wales. She was the daughter of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and Eleanor of England. She was also the second woman who can be shown to have used the title Princess of Wales.

==Early life==
Eleanor&#x27;s maternal grandparents were King John of England and his Queen consort, Isabella of Angoulême. 
Her maternal uncles included the King of England, Henry of Winchester, and the King of the Romans, Richard of Cornwall. Her maternal aunts included the Queen of Scotland, Joan of England; the Holy Roman Empress, Queen of Germany and Queen of Sicily, Isabella of England; and the wife of the Prince of Wales, Joan, Lady of Wales.

When Eleanor was thirteen years old, her father Simon de Montfort, and brother Lord Henry were killed at the Battle of Evesham (4 August 1265). According to the chroniclers, Nicholas Trivet, William Rishanger and others, Earl Simon had earlier made an alliance with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, whereby it was agreed that Llywelyn and Eleanor would marry.
After Earl Simon&#x27;s death, his family was forced to flee the Kingdom of England: Countess Eleanor took her daughter to the safety of the Dominican nunnery at Montargis, France, a Montfort foundation.

==Marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffydd==
Eleanor’s mother Countess Eleanor died in the Spring of 1275. Shortly after, Eleanor de Montfort married Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, by marriage per nuncios (proxy marriage) or &quot;per verba de presenti&quot;, which was endorsed by Canon Law.

==Capture and imprisonment by Edward I==
Eleanor began the sea voyage from France to north Wales, avoiding making a land passage through England.
The two ships carrying Eleanor, her brother Amaury and their entourage, sailing off the south coast of England, were captured by sailors from the port of Bristol, just off the Isles of Scilly. 
Six named men together with the crews of four ships of Bristol were rewarded with a payment of 220 marks.
&#x27;Thomas Larchdeacon&#x27;, &#x27;Thomas the Archdeacon&#x27;, who masterminded the capture on behalf of her first cousin Edward I of England was paid £20 in May 1276 by the king&#x27;s orders, through the sheriff of Cornwall.

Eleanor was taken by ship to Bristol, then held prisoner at Windsor for nearly three years.
She was released in 1278 following the signing of the Treaty of Aberconwy between Edward I of England and Llywelyn ap Gruffydd.

==Married life==
Eleanor and Llywelyn were formally married (&quot;secundum formam ecclesie&quot;) at the cathedral door, as was the custom, of the cathedral church at Worcester, on the Feast Day of St Edward, 1278; Edward gave the bride, his cousin, away and paid for the wedding feast. 
Before the wedding mass was celebrated, Edward insisted that Llywelyn should put his seal to an adjustment to the agreement that they had previously made. 
Llywelyn had no alternative but to comply, and he later stated that he did it under duress, &#x27;moved by the fear that can grip a steadfast man&#x27;.

Following the ceremony, Eleanor became officially known as Princess of Wales and Lady of Snowdon. Eleanor was documented as having a daughter from this marriage named Catherine, who became the ancestor of Owain Glyndwr.

==Death and legacy==
Eleanor had a daughter, Gwenllian of Wales, whom she died giving birth to on 19 June 1282 at the royal palace in Abergwyngregyn, on the north coast of Gwynedd. Her body was taken across the Lafan Sands to the Franciscan Friary at Llanfaes, Anglesey. 
The Friary had been founded by Llywelyn the Great, the grandfather of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, in memory of his wife Joan (Eleanor&#x27;s aunt).

On 12 July 1282, members of Eleanor&#x27;s personal household were given safe-conduct while travelling back into England. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was killed on 11 December 1282. His one-year-old daughter, Gwenllian, was captured the following year by English forces. Edward I had the child banished to the remote Sempringham Priory in Lincolnshire, where she remained until her death in 1337.

<doc id="285567" wikidata="Q1052353" url="?curid=285567" title="Purusha">
<text>Purusha (, , ) is a complex concept whose meaning evolved in Vedic and Upanishadic times. Depending on source and historical timeline, it means the cosmic being or self, awareness, and universal principle. 

In early Vedas, &quot;Purusha&quot; was a cosmic being whose sacrifice by the gods created all life. This was one of many creation myths discussed in the Vedas. In the Upanishads, the &quot;Purusha&quot; concept refers to the abstract essence of the Self, Spirit and the Universal Principle that is eternal, indestructible, without form, and all-pervasive. 

In Samkhya philosophy, &quot;Purusha&quot; is the plural immobile cosmic principle, pure consciousness, unattached and unrelated to anything, which is &quot;nonactive, unchanging, eternal, and pure&quot;. &quot;Purusha&quot; uniting with &quot;Prakṛti&quot; (matter) gives rise to life.

In Kashmir Shaivism, &quot;Purusha&quot; is enveloped in five sheaths of time (&quot;kāla&quot;), desire (&quot;raga&quot;), restriction (&quot;niyati&quot;), knowledge (&quot;vidyā&quot;) and separatedness (&quot;kalā&quot;); it is the universal Self (&quot;paramātman&quot;) under limitations as many individual Selfs (&quot;jīvātman&quot;).

==Definition and general meaning==
There is no consensus among schools of Hinduism on the definition of &quot;Purusha&quot;, and it is left to each school and individual to reach their own conclusions. For example, one of many theistic traditions script such as Kapilasurisamvada, credited to another ancient Hindu philosopher named Kapila, first describes &quot;Purusha&quot; in a manner similar to Samkhya-Yoga schools, but then proceeds to describe buddhi (intellect) as second &quot;Purusha&quot;, and &quot;ahamkara&quot; (egoism) as third &quot;Purusha&quot;. Such pluralism and diversity of thought within Hinduism implies that the term &quot;Purusha&quot; is a complex term with diverse meanings.

The animating causes, fields, and principles of nature are &quot;Purusha&quot; in Hindu philosophy. Hinduism refers to &quot;Purusha&quot; as the soul of the universe, the universal spirit present everywhere, in everything and everyone, all the time. &quot;Purusha&quot; is the Universal Principle that is eternal, indestructible, without form, and all-pervasive. It is &quot;Purusha&quot; in the form of nature’s laws and principles that operate in the background to regulate, guide, and direct change, evolution, cause, and effect. It is &quot;Purusha&quot;, in the Hindu concept of existence, that breathes life into matter, is the source of all consciousness, one that creates oneness in all life forms, in all of humanity, and the essence of Self. According to Hinduism, it is &quot;Purusha&quot; why the universe operates, is dynamic and evolves, as against being static.

==Vedas==
During the Vedic period, the &quot;Purusha&quot; concept was one of several mythemes offered for the creation of the universe. &quot;Purusa&quot;, in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, was described as a being who becomes a sacrificial victim of the gods, and whose sacrifice creates all life forms including human beings.

In the &quot;Rigveda,&quot; &quot;Puruṣa is all that yet hath been and all that is to be&quot; (पुरुष एवेदगं सर्वं यद्भूतं यच्च भव्यम्।).

===Varna system===
In the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot;, the 90th hymn of the 10th book of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;varna&quot; is portrayed as a result of human beings created from different parts of the body of the divinity &quot;Purusha&quot;. This Purusha Sukta verse is controversial and is believed by many scholars, such as Max Müller, to be a corruption and medieval or modern era insertion into Veda, because unlike all other major concepts in the Vedas including those of &quot;Purusha&quot;, the four varnas are never mentioned anywhere else in any of the Vedas, and because this verse is missing in some manuscript prints found in different parts of India.



==Upanishads==
The abstract idea of &quot;Purusha&quot; is extensively discussed in various Upanishads, and referred interchangeably as Paramatman and Brahman (not to be confused with Brahmin). In the Upanishads and later texts of Hindu philosophy, the &quot;Purusha&quot; concept moved away from the Vedic definition of &quot;Purusha&quot; and was no longer a person, cosmic man or entity. Instead, the concept flowered into a more complex abstraction:
In the Upanishads, the &quot;Purusha&quot; concept refers to the abstract essence of the Self, Spirit and the Universal Principle that is eternal, indestructible, without form and is all pervasive. The &quot;Purusha&quot; concept is explained with the concept of &quot;Prakrti&quot; in the Upanishads. The Universe is envisioned in these ancient Sanskrit texts as a combination of the perceivable material reality and non-perceivable, non-material laws and principles of nature. Material reality (or &quot;Prakrti&quot;) is everything that has changed, can change and is subject to cause and effect. &quot;Purusha&quot; is the universal principle that is unchanging, uncaused but is present everywhere and the reason why &quot;Prakrti&quot; changes, transforms and transcends all of the time and which is why there is cause and effect.

Rishi Angiras of the &quot;Atma Upanishad&quot; belonging to the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; explains that &quot;Purusha&quot;, the dweller in the body, is three-fold: the Bahyatman (the Outer-Atman) which is born and dies; the Antaratman (the Inner-Atman) which comprehends the whole range of material phenomena, gross and subtle, with which the Jiva concerns himself, and the Paramatman which is all-pervading, unthinkable, indescribable, is without action and has no Samskaras.

== In Samkhya and Yoga ==
Both Samkhya, a school of Hindu philosophy that considers reason, as against Nyaya school&#x27;s logic or Mīmāṃsā school&#x27;s tradition, as the proper source of knowledge, and Yoga philosophy state that there are two ultimate realities whose interaction accounts for all experiences and universe, namely Purusha (spirit) and Prakrti (matter). The universe is envisioned as a combination of perceivable material reality and non-perceivable, non-material laws and principles of nature. Material reality, or &quot;Prakrti&quot;, is everything that has changed, can change and is subject to cause and effect. Universal principle, or &quot;Purusha&quot;, is that which is unchanging (aksara) and is uncaused. 

Puruṣa is the transcendental self or pure consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable through other agencies, above any experience by mind or senses and beyond any words or explanations. It remains pure, &quot;nonattributive consciousness&quot;. Puruṣa is neither produced nor does it produce. It is held that unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mīmāṃsā, Samkhya believes in a plurality of the puruṣas.

Yoga philosophy holds that, in addition to the purusha of each individual, there is a special purusha called Ishvara, which is free of all kleshas and karmas.

Both Samkhya and Yoga school holds that the path to moksha (release, Self-realization) includes the realization of &quot;Purusha&quot;.

==Puranas==
In the Puranas, &quot;The Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata boldly proclaim Vishnu as ultimate Purusha described in Purusha Sukta prayer&quot;, whereas Shiva is described as ultimate Purusha (cosmic male) in Shiva Purana. According to Indologist W. Norman Brown, &quot;The verses of Purusha Sukta are definitely a reference to Vishnu, who, through his three steps, is all-pervading (i.e. he spreads in all directions)&quot;.

The Bhagavata Purana explains the origin of the four varnas from the body of Purusha, identified as Vishnu:

==Vedanta==

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
In the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;purusha&quot; is used to refer to Supreme Being in several instances:

Arjuna refers to Krishna as &quot;purusha&quot; in several verses, such as Chapter 10 verse 12, Chapter 11 verse 18, Chapter 11 verse 38.

In Chapter 15 verse 16 Krishna refers to two types of &quot;purushas&quot;: &quot;kshara&quot; (perishable), &quot;akshara&quot; (imperishable). In verse 17, he identifies himself as &quot;highest &quot;purusha&quot;&quot; (&quot;paramatman&quot;), superior to both &quot;kshara&quot; and &quot;akshara&quot;.

===Brahma Sutras===
The Brahma Sutra 1.2.13 references Chandogya Upanishad 4.15.1, which describes the purusha that is seen in the eye:

The Brahma Sutra 1.2.13 clarifies that this person is the highest self, Brahman:

<doc id="285571" wikidata="Q534279" url="?curid=285571" title="Ogata Kenzan">
<text>, originally , was an Edo period Japanese potter, painter, and calligrapher. He was also known by the pseudonyms Shisui, Shōkosai, Shuseidō, Tōin, and Shinshō. He is associated with Kyō ware and Kiyomizu ware.

== Biography ==
Ogata Kenzan was the third son born into a rich kimono merchant family in Kyoto. The family&#x27;s shop, the Kariganeya, was patronized by Oeyo, the wife of Tokugawa Hidetada, and Tokugawa Masako. His father was Ogata Sōken (1621–1687), a calligrapher and patron of Noh. His older brother was the painter Ogata Kōrin (1658–1716). Following his father&#x27;s death, the eldest of the Ogata brothers took over the Kariganeya, allowing Kenzan and Kōrin to enjoy their inheritance and pursue pottery and painting. From a young age, Ogata received lessons in pottery from Koho and Rakuichi, grandchildren of Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu. 

In 1689, Ogata established Shuseidō hall south of Ninna-ji. Ogata studied with the potter Nonomura Ninsei whose Omuru kiln was located at the front gate of Ninna-ji. In 1699, Kugyō Nijō Tsunahira provided Ogata with a mountain villa in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto where Kenzan established his own kiln. In 1731, Kenzan was invited by Cloistered Imperial Prince Rinnojinomiya Kinkan to move to Edo where he spent the remainder of his life. He died at the age of 81.

Ogata produced a distinctive style of freely brushed grasses, blossoms, and birds as decorative motifs for pottery. His pieces were noted for their perfect relation between design and shape. He often collaborated on the decoration of pottery with his older brother, Ogata Kōrin, after whom the style known as Rinpa was named.

<text>House dust mites (HDM, or simply dust mites) are various species of acariform mites belonging to the family Pyroglyphidae that are found in association with dust in dwellings. They are known for causing allergies.

==Biology==

===Species===
The currently known species are:
* &quot;Blomia tropicalis&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides farinae&quot; (American house dust mite)
* &quot;Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus&quot; (European house dust mite)
* &quot;Dermatophagoides evansi&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides microceras&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides halterophilus&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides siboney&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides neotropicalis&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides alexfaini&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides anisopoda&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides chirovi&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides deanei&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides rwandae&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides scheremeteroskyi&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides scheremetewskyi&quot;
* &quot;Dermatophagoides simplex&quot;
* &quot;Euroglyphus maynei&quot; (Mayne&#x27;s house dust mite)
* &quot;Euroglyphus longior&quot;
* &quot;Hirstia domicola&quot;
* &quot;Malayoglyphus carmelitus&quot;
* &quot;Malayoglyphus intermedius&quot;
* &quot;Pyroglyphus africanus&quot;
* &quot;Sturnophagoides brasiliensis&quot;
* &quot;Suidasia pontifica&quot;

===Taxonomy===
The dust mites are cosmopolitan members of the mite family Pyroglyphidae.

===Characteristics===
House dust mites, due to their very small size and translucent bodies, are barely visible to the unaided eye. A typical house dust mite measures 0.2–0.3 mm in length. The body of the house dust mite has a striated cuticle.

House dust mite faecal pellets range from 10 to 40 μm.

===Diet===
Dust mites feed on skin flakes from humans and other animals, and on some mold. &quot;Dermatophagoides farinae&quot; fungal food choices in 16 tested species commonly found in homes was observed &quot;in vitro&quot; to be &quot;Alternaria alternata&quot;, &quot;Cladosporium sphaerospermum&quot;, and &quot;Wallemia sebi&quot;, and they disliked &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus versicolor&quot;, and &quot;Stachybotrys chartarum&quot;.

===Predators===
The predators of dust mites are other allergenic mites (&quot;Cheyletiella&quot;), silverfish and pseudoscorpions.

===Reproduction===
The average life cycle for a house dust mite is 65–100 days. A mated female house dust mite can live up to 70 days, laying 60 to 100 eggs in the last five weeks of her life. In a 10-week life span, a house dust mite will produce approximately 2,000 fecal particles and an even larger number of partially digested enzyme-covered dust particles.

=== Distribution ===
Dust mites are found worldwide, but are more common in humid regions. The species &quot;Blomia tropicalis&quot; is typically found only in tropical or subtropical regions. Detectable dust mite allergen was found in the beds of about 84% of surveyed United States homes. In Europe, detectable Der p 1 or Der f 1 allergen was found in 68% of surveyed homes.

==Health issues==
===Asthma===
House dust mite antigens are strongly associated with asthma development and severity; they are estimated to contribute to 60–90% of cases. 

===Allergies===
Tropomyosin, the major allergen in dust mites, is also responsible for shellfish allergy.

===Oral mite anaphylaxis===
&quot;Dermatophagoides spp.&quot; can cause oral mite anaphylaxis (AKA pancake syndrome) when found in flour.

<text>The Cuyahoga River ( or ) is a river located in Northeast Ohio that bisects the City of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie.

As Cleveland emerged as a major manufacturing center, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it caught fire at least 14 times. When it did so on June 22, 1969, news coverage of the event helped to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland&#x27;s city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga &quot;River of the Year&quot; in honor of &quot;50 years of environmental resurgence&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; is believed to mean &quot;crooked river&quot; from the Mohawk name , although the Mohawk were never in the region alongside European settlers, so this explanation is questionable. Some think that it comes from the Seneca word for &quot;jawbone&quot;. This explanation, however, is as uncertain as the Mohawk explanation. A close match in the Seneca language is , meaning &quot;on your chin&quot;; the river&#x27;s crooked form does vaguely resemble an animal&#x27;s jawbone. It is possible that Europeans once wished to call it that, but the name &quot;Cuyahoga&quot; ended up becoming more prevalent and folk etymology took over, creating an accidental link between the two names that did not actually exist.

Early maps from the era of French control of the region, when the Wyandot were the only tribe there, mark the river as &quot;Cuyahoga&quot;, although the Wyandot name for the river is .

== Course ==

The Cuyahoga watershed begins its journey in Hambden, Ohio, flowing southward to the confluence of the East Branch Cuyahoga River and West Branch Cuyahoga River in Burton, where the Cuyahoga River officially begins. It continues on its journey flowing southward to Akron and Cuyahoga Falls, where it turns sharply north and flows through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park in northern Summit County and southern Cuyahoga County. It then flows through Independence, Valley View, Cuyahoga Heights, Newburgh Heights and Cleveland to its northern terminus, emptying into Lake Erie. The Cuyahoga River and its tributaries drain of land in portions of six counties.

The river is a relatively recent geologic formation, formed by the advance and retreat of ice sheets during the last ice age. The final glacial retreat, which occurred 10,000–12,000 years ago, caused changes in the drainage pattern near Akron. This change in pattern caused the originally south-flowing Cuyahoga to flow to the north. As its newly reversed currents flowed toward Lake Erie, the river carved its way around glacial debris left by the receding ice sheet, resulting in the river&#x27;s winding U-shape. These meanderings stretched the length of the river (which was only 30 miles (50 km) when traveled directly) into a 100-mile (160 km) trek from its headwaters to its mouth. The depth of the river (except where noted below) ranges from .

== History ==
The river was one of the features along which the &quot;Greenville Treaty Line&quot; ran beginning in 1795, per the Treaty of Greenville that ended the Northwest Indian War in the Ohio Country, effectively becoming the western boundary of the United States and remaining so briefly. On July 22, 1796, Moses Cleaveland, a surveyor charged with exploring the Connecticut Western Reserve, arrived at the mouth of the Cuyahoga and subsequently located a settlement there, which became the city of Cleveland.

===Native Americans===
It appears that, in more ancient times, the river was inhabited by some branch of Mound Building culture related to the Hopewell. The only mound formally excavated was Towner&#x27;s Mound outside of Kent, which appears identical in construction to two other mounds excavated in North Benton, OH and Warren, PA that are related to the New York Hopewell offshoot. The Iroquois say that, when the Erie first moved into western Pennsylvania, they pushed out a mound building people, which may show a continuity of such people for a few hundred years after the Hopewell Culture collapsed. Many other suspected mounds are also known and several other suspected mounds have been destroyed by industry since the 1790s.

When the French first began exploring and mapping the Great Lakes region in the 17th century, it comes across that the entire area of northern Ohio belonged to the Erie, but archaeology has since shown that the French, who only saw abandoned villages on the lake shore and never met any of the inhabitants, were mistaken. The entire Cuyahoga River Valley and last west of it actually belonged to a presumably Algonquian people never encountered by whites which we call the Whittlesey culture. They were destroyed during the Beaver Wars (1630–1701). Afterwards, the Iroquois stationed a group of captured Hurons in this areas, who later broke free after the French aided several Native groups from the Mississippi River in pushing the Iroquois all the way back to what is now Pittsburg, and established themselves as their own tribe- the Wyandot.

The Wyandot chose to set aside the entire region from the Cuyahoga River to the PA border and the Mahoning River to Lake Erie as a communal hunting ground, to be enjoyed by all tribes in the region, causing it to be regularly frequented by themselves, the Lenape, Shawnee and Seneca. The Ottawa, who lived clear at the western end of Lake Erie and who, themselves, had formed out of a similar circumstance to the Wyandot- captured Anishinaabeg stationed in the vicinity of what is now Detroit by the Iroquois- were apparently allowed to establish communities in the area, given the tribe&#x27;s distance from it, with one noted in what is now Conneaut and several others noted along the Cuyahoga. But, it is historically established that not all the villages along the Cuyahoga at this time were Ottawa, with a Seneca community noted around Streetsboro under a chief named Big John and possibly some Wyandots nearby.

During the Northwest Indian War (1785–1795), all the tribes in Ohio were ordered to give up most of Ohio for settlement, leading to a mass military revolt of all tribes in the Great Lakes region under a war chief named Little Turtle, with most of the fighting occurring along the Ohio-Indiana border. At this time, some Moravian missionaries who had been looking to establish a mission amongst the Ottawa were warned away due to the conflict, so they appear to have chosen to settle amongst the Ottawa in northeast Ohio at a site called Pilgeruh, but mistakenly noted all the villages in the area were Ottawa. After the war, the military ordered the Natives to evict the region, but most of them stayed during the early decades of settlement, with the last of the local natives concentrating in the Cuyahoga River Valley before leaving between 1811 and 1813. While there is a chance some may have gone to southern Ohio and joined Tecumseh&#x27;s brother&#x27;s pan-Indian cult at his Prophetstown compound, as the New Madrid Earthquake of 1811 was interpreted as a sign in his favor by many tribes across the eastern US, it appears the last of them in 1813 were leaving to migrate west, into the Great Black Swamp region- the last of Ohio&#x27;s guaranteed Indian Territory- to live amongst the bulk of the Ottawa and Wyandot who were settled there.

=== Environmental cleanup ===
The Cuyahoga River, at times during the 20th century, was one of the most polluted rivers in the United States. The reach from Akron to Cleveland was devoid of fish. A 1968 Kent State University symposium described one section of the river:

At least 13 fires have been reported on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868. The largest river fire, in 1952, caused over $1 million in damage to boats, a bridge, and a riverfront office building.

Things began to change in the late 1960s, when new mayor Carl Stokes and his utilities director rallied voters to approve a $100 million bond to rehabilitate Cleveland&#x27;s rivers. Then, the mayor seized the opportunity of a June 22, 1969 river fire triggered by a spark from a passing rail car igniting an oil slick to bring reporters to the river to raise attention to the issue. The 1969 fire caused approximately $50,000 in damage, mostly to an adjacent railroad bridge, but despite Mayor Stokes&#x27; efforts, very little attention was initially given to the incident, and it was not considered a major news story in the Cleveland media.
However, the incident did soon garner the attention of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which used a dramatic photo of the even larger 1952 blaze in an article on the pollution of America&#x27;s waterways. The article described the Cuyahoga as the river that &quot;oozes rather than flows&quot; and in which a person &quot;does not drown but decays&quot; and listed other badly-polluted rivers across the nation. (No pictures of the 1969 fire are known to exist, as local media did not arrive on the scene until after the fire was under control.) The article launched &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s new &quot;Environment&quot; section, and gained wide readership not only on its own merit, but because the same issue featured coverage of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing on the Moon the previous week in the Apollo 11 mission, and had Senator Ted Kennedy on the cover for a story on the Chappaquiddick incident in which Kennedy&#x27;s automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, had drowned.

The 1969 Cuyahoga River fire helped spur an avalanche of water pollution control activities, resulting in amendments extending the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). Mayor Stokes gave Congressional testimony on his and other major big cities&#x27; struggles with polluting industries to restore the environmental health of their communities. As a result, large point sources of pollution on the Cuyahoga have received significant attention from the OEPA in subsequent decades. These events are referred to in Randy Newman&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Burn On&quot;, R.E.M.&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Cuyahoga&quot;, and Adam Again&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;River on Fire&quot;. Great Lakes Brewing Company of Cleveland named its &quot;Burning River Pale Ale&quot; after the event.

In December 1970 a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio; it was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell, gave a Press Conference December 18, 1970 referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the new Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in District Court, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act. There were multiple other suits filed by Jones.
Water quality has improved and, partially in recognition of this improvement, the Cuyahoga was designated one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998. Despite these efforts, pollution continues to exist in the Cuyahoga River due to other sources of pollution, including urban runoff, nonpoint source problems, combined sewer overflows, and stagnation due to water impounded by dams. For this reason, the Environmental Protection Agency classified portions of the Cuyahoga River watershed as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The most polluted portions of the river now generally meet established aquatic life water quality standards except near dam impoundments. The reasons for not meeting standards near the dam pools are habitat and fish passage issues rather than water quality. River reaches that were once devoid of fish now support 44 species. A survey in 2008 revealed the two most common species in the river were hogsuckers and spotfin shiners, both moderately sensitive to water quality. Habitat issues within the navigation channel still preclude a robust fishery in that reach. Recreation water quality standards (using bacteria as indicators) are generally met during dry weather conditions, but are often exceeded during significant rains due to nonpoint sources and combined sewer overflows. In March 2019 the OEPA declared fish caught in the river safe to eat. Consequently, in 2024 the first ever steelhead trout stocking in the river occurred.

=== Modifications ===

The lower Cuyahoga River, just west of present-day downtown Cleveland, has been subjected to numerous changes. Originally, the Cuyahoga river met Lake Erie approximately west of its current mouth, forming a shallow marsh. The current mouth is human-made, created in 1827, and allows shipping traffic to flow freely between the river and the lake. Additionally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers periodically dredges the navigation channel of the otherwise shallow river to a depth of , along the river&#x27;s lower , from its mouth up to the Mittal Steel Cleveland Works steel mills, to accommodate Great Lakes freighter traffic which serves the bulk (asphalt, gravel, petroleum, salt, steel, and other) industries located along the lower Cuyahoga River banks in Cleveland&#x27;s Flats district. The Corps of Engineers has also straightened river banks and widened turning basins in the federal navigation channel on the lower Cuyahoga River to facilitate maritime operations.

==== Ice-breaking ====
The United States Coast Guard sometimes conducts fall and spring ice-breaking operations along Lake Erie and the lower Cuyahoga River to prolong the Great Lakes shipping season, depending on shipping schedules and weather conditions.

==== Flooding ====
Some attempts (including dams and dredging) have been made to control flooding along the Cuyahoga River basin. As a result of speculative land development, buildings have been erected on many flat areas that are only a few feet above normal river levels. Sudden strong rain or snow storms can create severe flooding in these low-lying areas.

The upper Cuyahoga River, starting at over from its mouth, drops in elevation fairly steeply, creating falls and rapids in some places; the lower Cuyahoga River only drops several feet along the last several miles of the lower river to at the mouth on Lake Erie, resulting in relatively slow-moving waters that can take a while to drain compared to the upper Cuyahoga.


Some tributary elevations above are higher than the Cuyahoga River elevation, because of small waterfalls at or near their confluences; and distances are measured in &quot;river miles&quot; along the river&#x27;s length from its mouth on Lake Erie.

=== Accidents ===
On August 25, 2020, a Holland Oil and Gas fuel tanker crashed on Route 8 near Akron and Cuyahoga Falls, killing one individual and causing a fire that leaked fuel into the southern section of the river. The fire was extinguished by the Akron Fire Department and the river section and surrounding area were promptly cleaned up. The fatal road crash marked the first and only river fire incident on the Cuyahoga since June 1969. However, as scholar Anne Jefferson notes:

== Dams ==

=== Former Ohio and Erie Canal diversion dam ===
The Brecksville Dam at river mile 20 was the first dam upstream of Lake Erie. It affected fish populations by restricting their passage. The dam was removed in 2020.

=== Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam ===

The largest dam is the Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam, also known as the FirstEnergy Dam, on the border between Cuyahoga Falls and Akron. This dam has for over 90 years submerged the falls for which the City of Cuyahoga Falls was named; more to the point of water quality, it has created a large stagnant pool with low dissolved oxygen.

On April 9, 2019, officials from the U.S. EPA and Ohio EPA announced a plan to remove the Gorge Metropolitan Park Dam by 2023 at a cost of $65 to $70 million. Funding for the project was authorized through the Great Lakes Legacy Act with funds coming from the City of Akron and members of the Gorge Dam Stakeholder Committee, including Summit Metro Parks, FirstEnergy, and the City of Cuyahoga Falls. the planned date of removal is 2026.

The FirstEnergy Dam was built by the Northern Ohio Traction and Light Co. in 1912 to serve the dual functions of generating hydropower for its local streetcar system and providing cooling-water storage for a coal-burning power plant; however, the hydropower operation was discontinued in 1958, and the coal-burning plant was decommissioned in 1991. Some environmental groups and recreational groups want the dam removed. Others contend that such an effort would be expensive and complicated, for at least two reasons: first, the formerly hollow dam was filled in with concrete in the early 1990s, and second, because of the industrial history of Cuyahoga Falls, the sediment upstream of the dam is expected to contain hazardous chemicals, possibly including heavy metals and PCBs. The Ohio EPA estimated removal of the dam would cost $5–10 million, and removal of the contaminated sediments, a further $60 million. The dam is licensed through 2041. In 2023 however, after funding was secured, the decision was made to remove the dam

=== Dams in Cuyahoga Falls ===
In late 2012, two dams in Cuyahoga Falls, the Sheraton and LeFever Dams, were scheduled for demolition, as the result of an agreement between the City of Cuyahoga Falls, which owns the dams, and the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, which will provide $1 million of funding to remove the dams. On December 12, 2012, the ACOE issued a permit, allowing the demolition to proceed. As part of the project, a water trail was developed. In early June 2013, dam removal began, and ended on August 20, 2013. This brought about a mile of the river back to its natural state, removed of structures, and exposed an equivalent quantity of whitewater for recreation. In 2019, attempts by the city to address increased erosion as a result of the removal of these and other area dams were publicized.

=== Munroe Falls Dam ===
Two other dams, in Kent and in Munroe Falls, though smaller, have had an even greater impact on water quality due to the lower gradient in their respective reaches. For this reason, the Ohio EPA required the communities to mitigate the effects of the dams.

The Munroe Falls Dam was modified in 2005. Work on this project uncovered a natural waterfall. Given this new knowledge about the riverbed, some interested parties, including Summit County, campaigned for complete removal of the dam. The revised plan, initially denied on September 20, 2005, was approved by the Munroe Falls City Council a week later. The sandstone dam has since been removed, and in its place now is a natural ledge with a drop at its greatest point.

=== Kent Dam ===

The Kent Dam was bypassed in 2004 and was the first dam modification project in the state of Ohio that was made solely for water quality issues. The modification resulted in the river fully attaining the designated Ohio water quality standards.

<doc id="285586" wikidata="Q179839" url="?curid=285586" title="Golden Horn">
<text>The Golden Horn ( or ) is a major urban waterway and the primary inlet of the Bosphorus in Istanbul, Turkey. As a natural estuary that connects with the Bosphorus Strait at the point where the strait meets the Sea of Marmara, the waters of the Golden Horn help define the northern boundary of the peninsula constituting &quot;Old Istanbul&quot; (ancient Byzantium and Constantinople), the tip of which is the promontory of Sarayburnu, or Seraglio Point. This estuarial inlet geographically separates the historic center of Istanbul from the rest of the city, and forms a horn shape, sheltered harbor that in the course of history has protected Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and other maritime trade ships for thousands of years.

Throughout its history, the Golden Horn has witnessed many tumultuous historical incidents, and has been depicted in numerous works of art.

An hourly Golden Horn ferry service connects Üsküdar and Karaköy with most of the suburbs along the estuary. In 2021 the T5 tramline opened on the western shore of the Golden Horn. It runs from the Alibeyköy bus station as far as Cibali, beside the Atatürk Bridge, and an extension already in the making will continue it to Eminönü where it will intersect with the T1 tramline and several ferry services.

==Description==
The Golden Horn is the estuary of the Alibey and Kağıthane Rivers. It is long, and across at its widest. Its maximum depth, where it flows into the Bosphorus, is about . While the reference to a &quot;horn&quot; is understood to refer to the inlet&#x27;s aerial silhouette, the significance of the designation &quot;golden&quot; remains more obscure, with historians believing it to refer to either the riches brought into the city through the bustling historic harbor located along its shores, or to romantic artistic interpretations of the rich yellow light blazing upon the estuary&#x27;s waters as the sun sets over the city. Its Greek and English names mean the same, while its Turkish name, &quot;&quot;, simply means &quot;estuary&quot;, and derives from the Arabic word &quot;khaleej&quot;, meaning &quot;gulf&quot;.
The following districts line the western shore of the Golden Horn from south to north: Cibali, Fener, Balat, Ayvansaray, Eyüp, Silahtarağa, Sakarya and Alibeyköy. The following districts line the eastern shore of the Golden Horn from south to north: Kasımpaşa, Hasköy, and Sütlüce.

At present, the Golden Horn is spanned by four bridges. Moving from upstream to downstream (i.e. northwest to southeast), these are as follows:

# Haliç Bridge, completed in 1974, which connects the neighborhoods of Sütlüce and Defterdar
# Atatürk Bridge, aka Unkapanı Bridge, completed in 1940, which connects Kasımpaşa and Unkapanı
# Golden Horn Metro Bridge, a pedestrianized railway crossing, completed in 2014, that extends subway line M2 of the Istanbul Metro across the Golden Horn 
# Galata Bridge (its fifth incarnation, completed in 1994), between Karaköy and Eminönü
The Eski Galata Bridge (literally, &quot;Old Galata Bridge&quot;), now-defunct, used to connect the downstream neighborhoods of Karaköy and Eminönü, but was disassembled and relocated upstream between Ayvansaray and Keçeci Piri following extensive damage in 1992 caused by a fire originating in the kitchen of one of the restaurants located on the bridge&#x27;s lower level. Originally dating back to 1912, the now-retired structure is no longer used for vehicular or pedestrian traffic, but functions as a seasonal outdoor exhibit and event space attached to Haliç Park.

== History ==

Archaeological records show a significant urban presence on and around the Golden Horn dating back to at least the 7th century BC, with smaller settlements going as far back as 6700 BC as confirmed by recent discoveries of ancient ports, storage facilities, and fleets of trade ships unearthed during construction work for the Yenikapı subway station and the Marmaray tunnel project.

Indeed, the deep natural harbor provided by the Golden Horn has always been a major economic attraction and strategic military advantage for inhabitants of the area. Emperor Constantine I established &quot;Nova Roma&quot; (later Constantinople) on top of the existing city of Byzantium to capitalize on the same benefits, as did the founders of the previous settlement and its modern successor, Istanbul.

The Eastern Roman Empire had its naval headquarters there, and walls were built along the shoreline to protect the city of Constantinople from naval attacks.
=== The Great Chain of the Golden Horn ===

At the entrance to the Horn on the northern side, a large chain was pulled across from Constantinople to the old Tower of Galata to prevent unwanted ships from entering. Known among the Byzantines as the &quot;Megàlos Pyrgos&quot; (meaning &quot;Great Tower&quot; in Greek), this tower was largely destroyed by the Latin Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In 1348, the Genoese built a new tower nearby which they called &quot;Christea Turris&quot; (Tower of Christ), now called Galata Tower.

There were three notable times when the chain across the Horn was either broken or circumvented. In the 10th century the Kievan Rus&#x27; dragged their longships out of the Bosphorus, around Galata, and relaunched them in the Horn; the Byzantines defeated them with Greek fire. In 1204, during the Fourth Crusade, Venetian ships were able to break the chain with a ram. In 1453, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, having failed in his attempt to break the chain with brute force, instead used the same tactic as the Rus&#x27;; towing his ships across Galata over greased logs and into the estuary.

After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II resettled ethnic Greeks along the Horn in the Phanar (today&#x27;s Fener). Balat continued to be inhabited by Jews, as during the Byzantine age, though many Jews decided to leave following the takeover of the city. This area was repopulated when Bayezid II invited the Jews who were expelled from Spain to resettle in Balat.

In 1502, Leonardo da Vinci produced a drawing of a single-span bridge over the Golden Horn as part of a civil engineering project for Sultan Bayezid II. Leonardo&#x27;s drawings and notes regarding this bridge are currently displayed at the Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia in Milan, Italy. While the original design was never executed, the vision of Leonardo&#x27;s Golden Horn Bridge was resurrected in 2001, when a small footbridge based on Leonardo&#x27;s design was constructed near Ås in Norway by Vebjørn Sand.

Until the 1980s, the Horn was polluted with industrial waste from the factories, warehouses, and shipyards along its shores. It has since been cleaned, and the local fish, wildlife, and flora have been largely restored. The clean-up happened in two main phases under Mayor Bedrettin Dalan in the 1980s and under Mayor Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the 1990s.

Nowadays, the Golden Horn is settled on both sides, and there are parks along each shore. The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is also located along the shore, as are several Muslim, Jewish and Christian cemeteries. Other institutions along the Horn&#x27;s banks include museums, congress and cultural halls, supporting facilities of the Turkish Navy, and campuses of various universities.

Today, the Horn&#x27;s history and natural environment make it a popular tourist attraction in Istanbul, visited by 10 million international vacationers annually.

== Tersane Istanbul ==
Sometimes claimed as the oldest shipyard in the world, the Haliç Shipyard (&quot;Haliç Tersanesi&quot; in Turkish) was founded by Sultan Mehmed II in 1455. It remained in operation both for shipbuilding and repairs into the 1960s but then fell into disrepair. The site is now being redeveloped as the giant Tersane Istanbul project which will bring hotels, museums, art galleries, shops and restaurants to a very rundown area. In February 2019 President Erdoğan announced the start of the project and in October 2021 it started to open when the Contemporary Istanbul art fair was staged there. It is intended that the Sadberk Hanım Museum will relocate to Tersane Istanbul from Sarıyer as part of the project.

==In popular culture==
The Golden Horn is featured in many works of literature dealing with classical themes. For example, G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s poem &quot;Lepanto&quot; contains the memorable couplet &quot;From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun, / And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.&quot;

<doc id="285588" wikidata="Q160541" url="?curid=285588" title="Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany">
<text>Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany (Leopold George Duncan Albert; 7 April 185328 March 1884) was the eighth child and youngest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Leopold was later created Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence, and Baron Arklow. He had haemophilia, which contributed to his death following a fall at the age of 30.

==Early life==

Leopold was born on 7 April 1853 at Buckingham Palace, London, the eighth child and youngest son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. During labour, Queen Victoria chose to use chloroform and thereby encouraged the use of anesthesia in childbirth, recently developed by Professor James Young Simpson. The chloroform was administered by John Snow. As a son of the British sovereign, the newborn was styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Prince Leopold&quot; at birth. His parents named him Leopold after their common uncle, King Leopold I of Belgium.

He was baptised in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on 28 June 1853 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner. His godparents were his first cousin once removed, King George V of Hanover; his fourth cousin once removed, Princess William of Prussia; his first cousin once removed, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge; and his maternal uncle by marriage, Prince Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

Leopold inherited the disease haemophilia from his mother, Queen Victoria, and was a delicate child. There was speculation during his life that Leopold also had mild epilepsy, like his great-nephew Prince John.

==Education and career==
The Prince&#x27;s intellectual abilities were evident as a boy; Poet Laureate, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and his friend, philosopher James Martineau, were familiar with the Queen&#x27;s children and had noted that Leopold, who had often &quot;conversed with the eminent Dr. Martineau, was considered to be a young man of a very thoughtful mind, high aims, and quite remarkable acquirements&quot;. His daughter, Princess Alice, wrote in her memoirs that his &quot;literary and artistic inclinations were encouraged and developed by his beloved tutor, Robert Collins&quot;. He was also tutored by Canon Duckworth and for two years before that, by a young Eton master called Mr. Shuldam.

===Oxford University===

In 1872, Prince Leopold entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied a variety of subjects and became president of the Oxford University Chess Club. On coming of age in 1874, he was made a privy councillor and granted an annuity of £15,000. He left the university in 1876 with an honorary doctorate in civil law (DCL), and then travelled in Europe. In 1880, he toured Canada and the United States with his sister, Princess Louise, whose husband John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, was Governor General of Canada. Leopold was a prominent patron of chess, and the London 1883 chess tournament was held under his patronage.

Incapable of pursuing a military career because of his haemophilia and the need to avoid even minor injuries, Leopold instead became a patron of the arts and literature and served as an unofficial secretary to his mother. &quot;Leopold was the favourite son, and through him her relations with the Government of the day were usually kept up.&quot; Later he pursued vice-regal appointments in Canada and the Colony of Victoria, but his mother refused to appoint him, to his great unhappiness.

===British Army===
Despite his inability to pursue an active military role, he had an honorary association with the 72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany&#x27;s Own Highlanders, and from 1881 served as the first Colonel-in-Chief of the Seaforth Highlanders, when that regiment was formed through the merger of the 72nd regiment with the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. A portrait of Prince Leopold in military uniform is held in the Royal Collection. The Seaforth Highlanders paraded at Prince Leopold&#x27;s funeral, a fact recorded by William McGonagall in his poem &quot;The Death of Prince Leopold&quot;.

===Freemasonry===
Prince Leopold was an active Freemason, being initiated in the Apollo University Lodge, Oxford, whilst resident at Christ Church. He was proposed for membership by his brother, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who was at the time the Worshipful Master of the Lodge, and was initiated in a joint ceremony with Robert Hawthorne Collins, his friend and tutor, who later became Comptroller of his Household.

Leopold served as Master of the Lodge from 1876 to 1877, and was later the Provincial Grand Master for Oxfordshire, still holding that office at the time of his death. In 1882 he laid the foundation stone of the Masonic Hall on Marlborough Street in Banbury.

==Marriage==
Prince Leopold, stifled by the desire of Queen Victoria to keep him at home, saw marriage as his only hope of independence. Due to his haemophilia, he had difficulty finding a wife. He was acquainted with Alice Liddell, the daughter of Henry Liddell, the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford for whom Lewis Carroll wrote &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Leopold was the godfather of Alice&#x27;s second son, who was named after him. It has been suggested that he considered marrying her, though others suggest that he preferred her sister Edith (for whom he later served as pallbearer on 30 June 1876).

Leopold also considered his second cousin Princess Frederica of Hanover as a bride; they instead became lifelong friends and confidantes. Other royal and aristocratic women he pursued included heiress Daisy Maynard, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse-Kassel, Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, Princess Stéphanie of Belgium and Princess Victoria of Baden. Leopold was very fond of Mary Baring, daughter of Lord Ashburton, but though she was equally fond of him, at 19, she felt she was too young to marry.

After rejection from these women, Victoria stepped in to bar what she saw as unsuitable possibilities. Insisting that the children of British monarchs should marry into other reigning Protestant families, Victoria suggested a meeting with Princess Helen Frederica, the daughter of George Victor, reigning Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont, one of whose daughters had already married King William III of the Netherlands. On 27 April 1882, Leopold and Helen were married at St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle, and his income was raised by parliament to £25,000. They enjoyed a happy, albeit brief marriage. In 1883, Leopold became a father when his wife gave birth to a daughter, Alice. However, he did not live to see the birth of his son, Charles Edward.

==Illness and death==
Prince Leopold had haemophilia diagnosed in childhood, and in early years had various physicians in permanent attendance, including Arnold Royle and John Wickham Legg. In February 1884, Leopold went to Cannes on doctor&#x27;s orders: joint pain is a common symptom of haemophilia and the winter climate in the United Kingdom was always difficult for him. His wife, pregnant at the time, stayed at home but urged him to go. On 27 March, at his Cannes residence, the &#x27;Villa Nevada&#x27;, he slipped and fell, injuring his knee and hitting his head. He died in the early hours of the next morning, apparently from a cerebral haemorrhage. His remains were interred in the Royal Vault and later buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel at Windsor. The court observed official mourning from 30 March 1884 to 11 May 1884.

Having died six years after his older sister Alice, Leopold was the second, but the youngest of Queen Victoria&#x27;s children to die, being only 30 years old at the time of his death. His mother outlived him by seventeen years, by which time she had also outlived a third child, Alfred. Leopold&#x27;s passing was lamented by the Scottish &quot;poet and tragedian&quot; William McGonagall in the poem &quot;The Death of Prince Leopold&quot;. Queen Victoria wrote in her journal:


The haemophilia gene is carried on the X chromosome, and is normally passed through female descent, as in the past few haemophiliac men survived to beget children. Any daughter of a haemophiliac is a carrier of the gene. Leopold&#x27;s daughter Alice inherited the haemophilia gene, and passed it to her elder son Rupert.

Leopold&#x27;s posthumous son, Prince Charles Edward, succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Albany upon birth four months later. Charles Edward succeeded his uncle Alfred as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900.

<doc id="285589" wikidata="Q60747" url="?curid=285589" title="Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont">
<text>Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont (Helen Frederica Augusta; 17 February 1861 – 1 September 1922), later Duchess of Albany, was a member of the British royal family by marriage. She was the fifth daughter and child of George Victor, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and his first wife, Princess Helena of Nassau.

==Family==
Helen was born in Arolsen, capital of the Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont, in Germany. She was the sister of Friedrich, last reigning Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont; Marie, the first wife of William II of Württemberg; and of Emma, queen consort of William III of the Netherlands (and mother of Queen Wilhelmina).

==Marriage==
Along with Emma and a third sister, Pauline, Helen was considered as a second wife for William III of the Netherlands. She later met with Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, youngest son of Queen Victoria, at the suggestion of his mother. The two became engaged in November 1881.

On 27 April 1882, Leopold and Helen married in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. After their wedding, Leopold and Helen resided at Claremont House. The couple had a brief, but happy marriage, ending in the hemophiliac Leopold&#x27;s death from a fall in Cannes, France, in March 1884. At the time of Leopold&#x27;s death, Helen was pregnant with their second child.

The couple had two children:
* Princess Alice of Albany (1883–1981), later Countess of Athlone
* Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany (1884–1954), later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha

==Personality and social work==

According to the memoirs of Helen&#x27;s daughter, Princess Alice, Helen was very intelligent, had a strong sense of duty, and a genuine love of welfare work. Queen Victoria, initially worried that Helen might turn out to be a stereotypically remote German princess, remarked in a letter to her eldest daughter, German Crown Princess Victoria, that she was pleased Helen liked &quot;to go among the people&quot;. The Queen soon came to regard her young daughter-in-law with great respect and affection, notwithstanding her initial concerns upon hearing from the match-making Vicky that Helen was an &#x27;intellectual&#x27;, being unusually well-educated for a princess. Before her marriage, Helen&#x27;s father had made her superintendent of the infant schools in his principality, and in this position the Princess had devised the pupils&#x27; educational curriculum. Helen particularly enjoyed solving mathematical problems and reading philosophy: during their tragically brief marriage, Prince Leopold proudly introduced his wife to the circle of academics he had befriended at Oxford University. Helen maintained these friendships for the rest of her life.

In 1894, Helen was one of the founders of the Deptford Fund, which instigated many projects to help the local community in Deptford. In 1899, Helen opened the Albany Institute. This later expanded into a combined community/performance centre with the theatre venue known as the Albany Empire. A centre of 1970s anti-fascist activity and Rock Against Racism, the Empire and Institute buildings were destroyed in an arson attack in 1978. A new Albany Theatre was opened by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1982.

Helen was also involved in several hospital charities and with those dedicated to ending human trafficking. During World War I, she organised much of her charity work along with that of her sister-in-law Princess Beatrice and niece Princess Marie Louise to avoid the not-uncommon problem of conflicting (and sometimes misguided) royal war-work projects.

==Later life==
After Leopold&#x27;s death, Helen and her two children, Alice and Charles Edward, continued to reside at Claremont House. After the death of her nephew, the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1899, Helen&#x27;s sixteen-year-old son was selected as the new heir to the German duchy, and was parted from his mother and sister in order to take up residence there. When the First World War broke out 14 years later, Charles Edward found himself fighting in the German Army. As a result, he was stripped of his British titles by an act of Parliament in 1917. By contrast, Helen&#x27;s daughter Alice remained in England and by marriage to Prince Alexander of Teck in 1904 became a sister-in-law of Queen Mary.

Helen died on 1 September 1922 of a heart attack in Hinterriss in Tyrol, Austria, while visiting her beloved son, Charles Edward. Through her son, she is the great-grandmother of the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf.

On her death her estate was valued at £177,312 (resworn £183,053 and equivalent to £7.2 million in 2022).

The Chiswick streets Waldeck Road and Pyrmont Road were named in honour of her.

<doc id="285592" wikidata="Q176564" url="?curid=285592" title="Tetracyclic antidepressant">
<text>Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) are a class of antidepressants that were first introduced in the 1970s. They are named after their tetracyclic chemical structure, containing four rings of atoms, and are closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which contain three rings of atoms.

==List of TeCAs==

===Marketed===
* Maprotiline (Ludiomil) – can also be classified as a TCA and grouped with the secondary amines
* Mianserin (Tolvon)
* Mirtazapine (Remeron)
* Setiptiline (Tecipul)

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but are sometimes still classified as TeCAs include:

* Amoxapine (Asendin) – often classified as a TCA and grouped with the secondary amines
* Quetiapine (Seroquel) - an atypical antipsychotic sometimes used as an adjunct antidepressant

====Miscellaneous====
* Benzoctamine (Tacitin) – a tetracyclic compound and is closely related to maprotiline, with the two compounds differing only in the length of their side chain, but benzoctamine is not used as an antidepressant and is instead used as an anxiolytic
* Loxapine (Adasuve, Loxitane) – a typical antipsychotic that produces amoxapine as a major metabolite and is said to have antidepressant effects, but it is not usually regarded as a TeCA

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but could still be classified as tetracyclic include:

* Mazindol (Mazanor, Sanorex) – a monoamine reuptake inhibitor used as an appetite suppressant and with potential antidepressant effects, but not classified as a TeCA

===Never marketed===
* Aptazapine (CGS-7525A) – a close analogue of mirtazapine
* Esmirtazapine (ORG-50,081) – the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine
* Oxaprotiline (C 49-802 BDA) – a close analogue of maprotiline

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but could still be classified as tetracyclic include:

* Ciclazindol (WY-23,409) – a close analogue of mazindol

==Pharmacology==
TeCAs have diverse pharmacology and differ from TCAs in a number of ways. With the exception of amoxapine, TeCAs do not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. However, aside from mirtazapine, they do inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. TeCAs block the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors similarly to TCAs. Besides mirtazapine, they also block the α1-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, whereas TCAs have relatively low affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor, mianserin and mirtazapine potently antagonize this receptor, and this action is thought to be involved in their antidepressant effects. TeCAs block the histamine H1 receptor similarly to the TCAs, but tend to be even stronger antihistamines than TCAs. On the other hand, in contrast to almost all TCAs, TeCAs have only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and for this reason, are associated with few or no anticholinergic side effects. Mianserin and mirtazapine are far less toxic than TCAs in overdose.

===Binding profiles===
The binding profiles of various TeCAs in terms of their affinities (, ) for various receptors and transporters are as follows:

The TeCAs act as antagonists or inverse agonists of the receptors and as inhibitors of the transporters.

<doc id="285595" wikidata="Q1814838" url="?curid=285595" title="Parallel transport">
<text>In differential geometry, parallel transport (or parallel translation) is a way of transporting geometrical data along smooth curves in a manifold. If the manifold is equipped with an affine connection (a covariant derivative or connection on the tangent bundle), then this connection allows one to transport vectors of the manifold along curves so that they stay &quot;parallel&quot; with respect to the connection.

The parallel transport for a connection thus supplies a way of, in some sense, moving the local geometry of a manifold along a curve: that is, of &quot;connecting&quot; the geometries of nearby points. There may be many notions of parallel transport available, but a specification of one way of connecting up the geometries of points on a curve is tantamount to providing a &quot;connection&quot;. In fact, the usual notion of connection is the infinitesimal analog of parallel transport. Or, &quot;vice versa&quot;, parallel transport is the local realization of a connection.

As parallel transport supplies a local realization of the connection, it also supplies a local realization of the curvature known as holonomy. The Ambrose–Singer theorem makes explicit this relationship between the curvature and holonomy.

Other notions of connection come equipped with their own parallel transportation systems as well. For instance, a Koszul connection in a vector bundle also allows for the parallel transport of vectors in much the same way as with a covariant derivative. An Ehresmann or Cartan connection supplies a &quot;lifting of curves&quot; from the manifold to the total space of a principal bundle. Such curve lifting may sometimes be thought of as the parallel transport of reference frames.

==Parallel transport of tangent vectors==

Let formula_1 be a smooth manifold. For each point formula_2, there is an associated vector space formula_3 called the tangent space of formula_1 at formula_5. Vectors in formula_3 are thought of as the vectors tangent to formula_1 at formula_5. A Riemannian metric formula_9 on formula_1 assigns to each formula_5 a positive-definite inner product formula_12 in a smooth way. A smooth manifold formula_1 endowed with a Riemannian metric formula_9 is a Riemannian manifold, denoted formula_15.

Let formula_16 denote the standard coordinates on formula_17 The Euclidean metric formula_18 is given by
: formula_19.
Euclidean space is the Riemannian manifold formula_20.

In Euclidean space, all tangent spaces are canonically identified with each other via translation, so it is easy to move vectors from one tangent space to another. Parallel transport of tangent vectors is a way of moving vectors from one tangent space to another along a curve in the setting of a general Riemannian manifold. Note that while the vectors are in the tangent space of the manifold, they might not be in the tangent space of the curve they are being transported along.

An affine connection on a Riemannian manifold is a way of differentiating vector fields with respect to other vector fields. A Riemannian manifold has a natural choice of affine connection called the Levi-Civita connection. Given a fixed affine connection on a Riemannian manifold, there is a unique way to do parallel transport of tangent vectors. Different choices of affine connections will lead to different systems of parallel transport.

===Precise definition===

Let be a manifold with an affine connection . Then a vector field is said to be parallel if for any vector field , . Intuitively speaking, parallel vector fields have &quot;all their derivatives equal to zero&quot; and are therefore in some sense &quot;constant&quot;. By evaluating a parallel vector field at two points and , an identification between a tangent vector at and one at is obtained. Such tangent vectors are said to be parallel transports of each other.

More precisely, if a smooth curve parametrized by an interval and , where , then a vector field along (and in particular, the value of this vector field at ) is called the parallel transport of along if
#, for all 
Formally, the first condition means that is parallel with respect to the pullback connection on the pullback bundle . However, in a local trivialization it is a first-order system of linear ordinary differential equations, which has a unique solution for any initial condition given by the second condition (for instance, by the Picard–Lindelöf theorem).

The parallel transport of formula_21 to the tangent space formula_22 along the curve formula_23 is denoted by formula_24. The map
: formula_25
is linear. In fact, it is an isomorphism. Let formula_26 be the inverse curve formula_27. Then formula_28 is the inverse of formula_29.

To summarize, parallel transport provides a way of moving tangent vectors along a curve using the affine connection to keep them &quot;pointing in the same direction&quot; in an intuitive sense, and this provides a linear isomorphism between the tangent spaces at the two ends of the curve. The isomorphism obtained in this way will in general depend on the choice of the curve. If it does not, then parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on , which can only happen if the curvature of is zero.

A linear isomorphism is determined by its action on an ordered basis or frame. Hence parallel transport can also be characterized as a way of transporting elements of the (tangent) frame bundle along a curve. In other words, the affine connection provides a lift of any curve in to a curve in .

===Examples===

The images below show parallel transport induced by the Levi-Civita connection associated to two different Riemannian metrics on the punctured plane formula_30. The curve the parallel transport is done along is the unit circle. In polar coordinates, the metric on the left is the standard Euclidean metric formula_31, while the metric on the right is formula_32. This second metric has a singularity at the origin, so it does not extend past the puncture, but the first metric extends to the entire plane.

Warning: This is parallel transport on the punctured plane &quot;along&quot; the unit circle, not parallel transport &quot;on&quot; the unit circle. Indeed, in the first image, the vectors fall outside of the tangent space to the unit circle. Since the first metric has zero curvature, the transport between two points along the circle could be accomplished along any other curve as well. However, the second metric has non-zero curvature, and the circle is a geodesic, so that its field of tangent vectors is parallel.

===Metric connection===

A metric connection is any connection whose parallel transport mappings preserve the Riemannian metric, that is, for any curve formula_33 and any two vectors formula_34,
:formula_35

Taking the derivative at &quot;t&quot; = 0, the operator ∇ satisfies a product rule with respect to the metric, namely
:formula_36

====Relationship to geodesics====

An affine connection distinguishes a class of curves called (affine) geodesics. A smooth curve &quot;γ&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → &quot;M&quot; is an affine geodesic if formula_37 is parallel transported along formula_33, that is
:formula_39

Taking the derivative with respect to time, this takes the more familiar form
:formula_40

If ∇ is a metric connection, then the affine geodesics are the usual geodesics of Riemannian geometry and are the locally distance minimizing curves. More precisely, first note that if &quot;γ&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → &quot;M&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; is an open interval, is a geodesic, then the norm of formula_37 is constant on &quot;I&quot;. Indeed,
:formula_42

It follows from an application of Gauss&#x27;s lemma that if &quot;A&quot; is the norm of formula_43 then the distance, induced by the metric, between two &quot;close enough&quot; points on the curve &quot;γ&quot;, say &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1) and &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;2), is given by
:formula_44
The formula above might not be true for points which are not close enough since the geodesic might for example wrap around the manifold (e.g. on a sphere).

==Parallel transport on a vector bundle==
Parallel transport of tangent vectors is a special case of a more general construction involving an arbitrary vector bundle formula_45. Specifically, parallel transport of tangent vectors is the case where formula_45 is the tangent bundle formula_47.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a smooth manifold. Let &quot;E&quot; → &quot;M&quot; be a vector bundle with connection ∇ and &quot;γ&quot;: &quot;I&quot; → &quot;M&quot; a smooth curve parameterized by an open interval &quot;I&quot;. A section formula_48 of formula_45 along &quot;γ&quot; is called parallel if

:formula_50

In the case when formula_45 is the tangent bundle whereby formula_48 is a tangent vector field, this expression means that, for every formula_53 in the interval, tangent vectors in formula_48 are &quot;constant&quot; (the derivative vanishes) when an infinitesimal displacement from formula_55 in the direction of the tangent vector formula_56 is done. 

Suppose we are given an element &quot;e&quot;0 ∈ &quot;E&quot;&quot;P&quot; at &quot;P&quot; = &quot;γ&quot;(0) ∈ &quot;M&quot;, rather than a section. The parallel transport of &quot;e&quot;0 along &quot;γ&quot; is the extension of &quot;e&quot;0 to a parallel &quot;section&quot; &quot;X&quot; on &quot;γ&quot;.
More precisely, &quot;X&quot; is the unique part of &quot;E&quot; along &quot;γ&quot; such that 
#formula_57
#formula_58
Note that in any given coordinate patch, (1) defines an ordinary differential equation, with the initial condition given by (2). Thus the Picard–Lindelöf theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the solution.

Thus the connection ∇ defines a way of moving elements of the fibers along a curve, and this provides linear isomorphisms between the fibers at points along the curve:
:formula_59
from the vector space lying over γ(&quot;s&quot;) to that over γ(&quot;t&quot;). This isomorphism is known as the parallel transport map associated to the curve. The isomorphisms between fibers obtained in this way will, in general, depend on the choice of the curve: if they do not, then parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel sections of &quot;E&quot; over all of &quot;M&quot;. This is only possible if the curvature of ∇ is zero.

In particular, parallel transport around a closed curve starting at a point &quot;x&quot; defines an automorphism of the tangent space at &quot;x&quot; which is not necessarily trivial. The parallel transport automorphisms defined by all closed curves based at &quot;x&quot; form a transformation group called the holonomy group of ∇ at &quot;x&quot;. There is a close relation between this group and the value of the curvature of ∇ at &quot;x&quot;; this is the content of the Ambrose–Singer holonomy theorem.

===Recovering the connection from the parallel transport===

Given a covariant derivative ∇, the parallel transport along a curve γ is obtained by integrating the condition formula_60. Conversely, if a suitable notion of parallel transport is available, then a corresponding connection can be obtained by differentiation. This approach is due, essentially, to ; see . also adopts this approach.

Consider an assignment to each curve γ in the manifold a collection of mappings
:formula_59
such that
# formula_62, the identity transformation of &quot;E&quot;γ(s).
# formula_63
# The dependence of Γ on γ, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; is &quot;smooth.&quot;
The notion of smoothness in condition 3. is somewhat difficult to pin down (see the discussion below of parallel transport in fibre bundles). In particular, modern authors such as Kobayashi and Nomizu generally view the parallel transport of the connection as coming from a connection in some other sense, where smoothness is more easily expressed.

Nevertheless, given such a rule for parallel transport, it is possible to recover the associated infinitesimal connection in &quot;E&quot; as follows. Let γ be a differentiable curve in &quot;M&quot; with initial point γ(0) and initial tangent vector &quot;X&quot; = γ′(0). If &quot;V&quot; is a section of &quot;E&quot; over γ, then let
:formula_64
This defines the associated infinitesimal connection ∇ on &quot;E&quot;. One recovers the same parallel transport Γ from this infinitesimal connection.

==Generalizations==
The parallel transport can be defined in greater generality for other types of connections, not just those defined in a vector bundle. One generalization is for principal connections . Let &quot;P&quot; → &quot;M&quot; be a principal bundle over a manifold &quot;M&quot; with structure Lie group &quot;G&quot; and a principal connection ω. As in the case of vector bundles, a principal connection ω on &quot;P&quot; defines, for each curve γ in &quot;M&quot;, a mapping
:formula_65
from the fibre over γ(&quot;s&quot;) to that over γ(&quot;t&quot;), which is an isomorphism of homogeneous spaces: i.e. formula_66 for each &quot;g&quot;∈&quot;G&quot;.

Further generalizations of parallel transport are also possible. In the context of Ehresmann connections, where the connection depends on a special notion of &quot;horizontal lifting&quot; of tangent spaces, one can define parallel transport via horizontal lifts. Cartan connections are Ehresmann connections with additional structure which allows the parallel transport to be thought of as a map &quot;rolling&quot; a certain model space along a curve in the manifold. This rolling is called development.

==Approximation: Schild&#x27;s ladder==

Parallel transport can be discretely approximated by Schild&#x27;s ladder,
which takes finite steps along a curve, and approximates
Levi-Civita parallelogramoids by approximate parallelograms.

<doc id="285600" wikidata="Q467835" url="?curid=285600" title="Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria">
<text>Dioscorus I (), also known as Dioscorus the Great, was the pope of Alexandria and patriarch of the See of St. Mark who was deposed by the Council of Chalcedon in 451. He was recognized as patriarch by the Coptic Church until his death. He died in Gangra, Paphlagonia, in September 454. He is venerated as a saint by the Coptic and other Oriental Orthodox Churches.

==Early life==
Dioscorus was a Copt from Alexandria. Dioscorus served as the dean of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, and was the personal secretary of Cyril of Alexandria, whom he accompanied to the Council of Ephesus in 431. He eventually rose to the position of archdeacon. He had been made Cyril&#x27;s designated successor.

==Opposition to Nestorius==
In his struggle against Nestorius, Cyril explained the union between the divine and human natures of Christ as &quot;inward and real without any division, change, or confusion.&quot; He rejected the Antiochene theory of &quot;indwelling&quot;, or &quot;conjunction&quot; or &quot;close participation&quot;, as insufficient. Thus the Alexandrian formula adopted by Cyril and Dioscorus was, in Greek, , which translates into &quot;one nature of God the Word Incarnate&quot;, by which Cyril meant &quot;one nature&quot;—that Christ is at once God and man. On the other hand, the Antiochene formula was &quot;two natures after the union&quot;, or &quot;in two natures&quot;, which translates to . This formula explained Christ as existing in two natures, God and man.

Nestorius was condemned and deposed by the First Council of Ephesus, which approved of the Second Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius.

==Patriarch of Alexandria==
Dioscorus succeeded Cyril as Patriarch of Alexandria in the summer of 444.

Soon after Dioscorus&#x27; consecration, Theodoret sent a letter (&quot;Letter 60&quot;) to him. In this letter he praises Dioscorus&#x27; modesty and humility, stating: &quot;you do not behold the multitude of your subjects nor the exaltation of your throne, but you see rather human nature, and life&#x27;s rapid changes, and follow the divine laws whose observance gives us the kingdom of heaven&quot;. Though being theologically opposed to him, Theodoret always positively represents Dioscorus&#x27; qualities. Theodoret had written against the 12 Anathemas of Saint Cyril and did not condemn Nestorius until the Council of Chalcedon. W. Bright states that Theodoret&#x27;s: &quot;testimony in his favour cannot be suspected&quot;.

Cyril&#x27;s nephew Athanasius, who C. Haas describes as a &quot;wealthy Alexandrian priest and potential rival&quot; was a fierce critic of Dioscorus. Immediately after his accession Dioscorus was worried that the influential group of Cyril&#x27;s relatives would be tempted to sabotage his tenure. He was also legally obliged to persecute them for misappropriating church property. Dioscorus regained property (including boats) for the Church, and destroyed property and fruit trees that had been illegally situated on land belonging to the Church. Athanasius claimed that from the outset of his episcopate, Dioscorus harassed him and his brother by using influence with the court, so that the brother died of distress, and Athanasius, with his aunts, sister-in-law, and nephews, were bereft of their homes by the patriarch&#x27;s malignity. According to the deacon Ischyrion in the third session of the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Dioscorus had laid waste to property, inflicted fines and exile, as well as buying up and selling at a high price the wheat sent by the government to Libya. In &quot;Patriarch Dioscorus of Alexandria: The Last Pharaoh and Ecclesiastical Politics in the Later Roman Empire&quot;, V.L. Menze writes that illegal property had been &quot;bearing income to the deacon Ischyrion&quot;.

==Reception of Eutyches==
Eutyches was an archimandrite in Constantinople. In his opposition to Nestorianism, he seemed to take an equally extreme, although opposite view. Eutyches claimed to be a faithful follower of Cyril. In November 448, Flavian, Bishop of Constantinople held a synod regarding a point of discipline connected with the province of Sardis. Eutyches had been accusing various personages of covert Nestorianism, and at the end of the session of this synod one of those inculpated, Eusebius, Bishop of Dorylaeum, brought the question forward, and proffered a counter charge of heresy against the archimandrite. Eutyches was summoned to clarify his position regarding the nature of Christ. When asked whether Christ was in two natures after the union, Eutyches responded by stating: &quot;I confess that our Lord was of two natures before the union, but after the union, one nature... I follow the teaching of the blessed Cyril and the holy Fathers and the holy Athanasius, because they speak of two natures before the union, but after the union and incarnation, they speak not of two natures but of one nature.&quot; Flavian had demanded that Eutyches confess two natures. Finding his response unsatisfactory, the synod condemned and exiled Eutyches as well as excommunicating anyone associated with him.

Eutyches appealed against this decision, labeling Flavian a Nestorian, and received the support of Dioscorus. In his famous &quot;Tome&quot;, Pope Leo I confirmed Flavian&#x27;s theological position but as he concluded that Eutyches had erred through ignorance, he also requested that Eutyches should be readmitted if he repented.

==Second Council of Ephesus==
Through the influence of the court official Chrysaphius, the godson of Eutyches, in 449, Emperor Theodosius II convened the Second Council of Ephesus. In remembrance of Cyril&#x27;s role during the council of 431, the emperor asked Dioscorus to preside over the meetings. The council subsequently decided to reinstate Eutyches and to depose Flavian, as well as Eusebius of Dorylaeum, Theoderet of Cyrrus, Ibas of Edessa, and Domnus II of Antioch. Leo&#x27;s legates protested but were ignored. Dioscorus and his council proceeded to depose Theodoret and several other bishops. Pope Leo called the council a &quot;robber synod&quot;. In the spring of 450 at Nicaea, Dioscorus, while on his way to the court, caused ten bishops whom he had brought from Egypt to sign a document excommunicating Pope Leo. Flavian was sent into exile. Anatolius, who had been the agent of Dioscorus at Constantinople, was appointed his successor.
The common narrative is that Dioscorus partook in and/or ordered an assault on Flavian who passed away three days later. However, there are varying accounts at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 of who killed Flavian. Those accused included Dioscorus himself (Session I, Line 30, and many other lines), his soldiers (Session I, Line 54), his personal clerics (Session III, 54), the Bishops of Egypt, Illyricum, and Palestine (Session I, Line 32, 38), Barsauma (Session IV, Line 77, 81), Barsauma&#x27;s monks (Session I, Line 851), the Parabalani (Session I, Line 851), the Bishops who opposed Dioscorus (Session I, Line 853), a miscellaneous mob (Session I, Line 62, 851) and Juvenal of Jerusalem (Session I, Line 62). In &quot;The Exile and Death of Flavian of Constantinople: A Prologue to the Council of Chalcedon&quot;, H. Chadwick claims that Pulcheria and possibly Anatolius were most likely responsible because she planned &quot;reunion with Rome&quot; and a council that would overturn unfavourable results at the Second Council of Ephesus. Given they wanted to overturn the results of the council, he notes that Pope Leo I would never have been willing to recognise Anatolius as bishop if Flavian were still alive. Given Flavian was being exiled he would be incapable of pursuing their objectives. Chadwick states that: &quot;Nothing could have been easier than to arrange an unfortunate &#x27;accident&#x27;. Nothing would have been more convenient to Pulcheria and the patriarch than his removal from the scene.&quot; When Flavian is killed and Anatolius comes to power, Chadwick notes a &quot;dramatic decision to throw Dioscorus aside, to reassert the claims of his see to be the second see of Christendom, and to accept, as a necessary bargain, the Tome of Leo.&quot; He sees these facts as indicating Flavian&#x27;s death was ultimately in Pulcheria and Marcian&#x27;s best interest.

Additional, possibly embellished details about Flavian&#x27;s death only appear in later authors. The earliest source on Flavian&#x27;s death, Nestorius, describes how Flavian was beaten at Ephesus, though not to death, and then banished to his home city of Hypaepa. However, the soldiers rushed him to his place of exile (with murderous intent, according to Nestorius), so that Flavian&#x27;s injuries combined with the fatigue of the journey led to his death after four days. Prosper of Aquitaine, another contemporary, affirms that Flavian was killed by the soldiers taking him to his place of banishment. In a disputed letter to Theodoret dated 11 June 453, Pope Leo blamed Dioscorus in a general sense for Flavian&#x27;s death. Liberatus of Carthage relates that Flavian suffered blows and died as a result. According to Evagrius Scholasticus, Eusebius of Dorylaeum complained at the council that Dioscorus himself, along with Barsauma&#x27;s monks, beat and kicked Flavian. Theophanes the Confessor, writing three centuries after the event, mentions that Dioscorus personally struck Flavian &quot;both with hands and feet&quot;. The detail of Flavian clutching the altar as he was beaten is also a later invention.

Theodosius supported the council&#x27;s decisions until he died on 28 July 450. His sister Pulcheria returned to power and made the officer Marcian her consort and emperor. She consulted with Pope Leo on convoking a new council, gathering signatures for his &quot;Tome&quot; to be introduced as the basic paper for the new council, but also insisted, against Leo&#x27;s wishes, that the council should be held not in Italy but in the East. Meanwhile, the new imperial couple brought Flavian&#x27;s remains back to Constantinople and exiled Eutyches to Syria.

==Council of Chalcedon==

The Council of Chalcedon in October 451 dealt with the Christological views of Eutyches but also with Dioscorus&#x27; views and earlier behaviour; specifically, his condemnation of the bishop Flavian in Ephesus II was questioned. When, at the Council of Chalcedon, he was asked why he had deposed Flavian, he, according to the minutes of Chalcedon, responded, &quot;Flavian was deposed for this reason, that he spoke of two natures after the union. But I have quotations from the holy fathers Athanasius, Gregory and Cyril saying in numerous places that one should not speak of two natures after the union&quot;.

At the council, Dioscorus expressed a willingness to condemn Eutyches. According to the minutes of the council of Chalcedon, Dioscorus stated: &quot;If Eutyches holds opinions contrary to the doctrines of the church, he deserves not only punishment but hell fire. For my concern is for the apostolic faith and not for any human being.&quot;

The council deposed Dioscorus and other bishops that had been responsible for the decisions of 449 for violations of canon law rather than of heresy; Dioscorus had not attended the council of Chalcedon from the third session onward despite an imperial call to do so, which was a deposable offence. According to the minutes of the council of Chalcedon, Dioscorus had given the reason of ill health for his nonattendance from the third session. However, historical accounts from the Eastern Orthodox Church note that Dioscorus was put under solitary arrest. As a result, he was condemned, but by an underwhelming amount (more than half the bishops present for the previous sessions did not attend his condemnation), and all of his decrees were declared null. Empress Pulcheria (Marcian&#x27;s wife) told Dioscorus &quot;In my father&#x27;s time, there was a man who was stubborn (referring to St. John Chrysostom) and you are aware of what was made of him&quot;, to which Dioscorus famously responded &quot;And you may recall that your mother prayed at his tomb, as she was bleeding of sickness&quot;. Pulcheria is said to have slapped Dioscorus in the face, breaking some of his teeth, and ordered the guards to confine him, which they did pulling his beard hair. Dioscorus is said to have put these in a box and sent them back to his Church in Alexandria noting &quot;this is the fruit of my faith.&quot; Marcian responded by exiling Dioscorus to Gangra.

==Exile==
Following Dioscorus&#x27;s deposition and exile, an Alexandrian priest named Proterius was appointed Patriarch in his stead, with the approval of the emperor. When Proterius returned to Alexandria, he was met by a riot. The native Christians continued to support Dioscorus as the legitimate Patriarch.

Dioscorus died in exile in 454. When the news reached Egypt, his supporters assembled and elected Timothy, a disciple of his, to be the new Patriarch. Timothy immediately went into hiding, but was recognized among the Coptic inhabitants of the countryside, creating the split between the Coptic and the Melchite (i.e. Royal) Church.

==Legacy==
Oriental Orthodox Churches remain in disagreement with Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches regarding Dioscorus&#x27;s character and positions. He is considered a saint by the Coptic, Syriac, and other Oriental Orthodox Churches, while Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches have frequently deemed him a heretic.

Certain modern theologians (as well as ancient ones like Basil of Seleucia) suggest that both Leo and Dioscorus were orthodox in their agreement with Saint Cyril&#x27;s Twelve Chapters, even though both have been (and still are) considered heretical by some. Some commentators like Anatolius and John S. Romanides argue that Dioscorus was not deposed for heresy but for &quot;grave administrative errors&quot; at Ephesus II, among which they mention his restoration of Eutyches, his attack on Flavian, and afterwards, his excommunication of Pope Leo I. Defenders of Dioscorus argue that Eutyches was orthodox at the time of his restoration and only later lapsed into heresy, that Flavian was a Nestorian, and that Pope Leo had supported Nestorianism.

Another controversial aspect of Dioscorus&#x27;s legacy is the accusation, frequently levelled by Chalcedonian churches, that the Oriental Orthodox Churches accept Eutychianism. They deny this charge, arguing that they reject both the Monophysitism of Eutyches, whom they consider a heretic, as well as Dyophysitism espoused by the Council of Chalcedon, which they equate with Nestorianism, for a doctrine they term &quot;miaphysitism&quot;, or that in Jesus Christ, divinity and humanity exist as &quot;one incarnate nature&quot; (&quot;physis&quot;), as opposed to the Chalcedonian teaching of a divine and a human nature united in the one person (&quot;hypostasis&quot;) of Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, a doctrine called the &quot;hypostatic union&quot;.

In recent times, Oriental Orthodox churches have engaged in ecumenical dialogue with Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches on the issues of Dioscorus&#x27;s day. In May 1973 Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria visited Pope Paul VI in Rome and declared a common faith in the nature of Christ, the issue which caused the schism of the church in the Council of Chalcedon.

A similar declaration was reached between the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox churches in 1990 in Geneva, in which both agreed in condemnation of the Nestorian and Eutychian &quot;heresies&quot; and in rejection of interpretations of ecumenical councils which do not fully agree with the Horos of the Third Ecumenical Council and the letter (433) of Cyril of Alexandria to John of Antioch. They also agreed to lift the anathemas and condemnations of the past. In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other&#x27;s churches.

<doc id="285601" wikidata="Q3395198" url="?curid=285601" title="Foreign relations of Nauru">
<text>Nauru became a sovereign, independent republic on 31 January 1968, following the passage of the &quot;Nauru Independence Act 1967&quot; by the Parliament of Australia and the end of its status as a United Nations Trust Territory. Nauru has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including most of its Pacific neighbors with which it maintains economic, cultural and administrative ties.

==Membership in international organizations==

Nauru was admitted to the United Nations on 14 September 1999. Nauru&#x27;s application to the United Nations was questioned by the People&#x27;s Republic of China due to Nauru&#x27;s close diplomatic and trade links to Taiwan. Nevertheless, Nauru was granted UN full membership.

Nauru became a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations in May 1999. Since independence, Nauru had been a special member of the Commonwealth prior to 1999, but having fallen behind in payments, reverted to Special Member status on 1 July 2005, with no authoritative power. It then returned to be a full member again in June 2011.

Additionally outside the region, Nauru is a member or participant of the ACP (Lomé Convention), the Alliance of Small Island States, the Asian Development Bank, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the G-77, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the ITU, and the International Olympic Committee.

Nauru is notable for its lack of membership in several major international organizations. Nauru is one of only seven UN members that is not a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and one of 12 not part of the International Finance Corporation. Nauru also is not a member of the International Development Association and has no society associated with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Finally, as with many other nations in Oceania, Nauru is not a member of the International Hydrographic Organization.

==Membership in regional organizations==

Regional cooperation through various multilateral organizations is a key element in Nauru&#x27;s foreign policy. The country also hosted the regional meeting that resulted in the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest whose eight signatories (including Nauru) collectively controls 25–30% of the world&#x27;s tuna supply and approximately 60% of the western and central Pacific tuna supply. Additionally, Nauru is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission, the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.

==Hosting refugees==

In 2001 Nauru became host to approximately 867 refugees, mostly Afghan, who were intercepted while attempting to enter Australia illegally. This exchange was one of many which were collectively known as Australia&#x27;s Pacific Solution. In February 2008, the last of the refugees were resettled in Australia.

==Diplomatic relations==
List of countries which Nauru maintains diplomatic relations with:
== Bilateral relations ==
===Other countries===

Nauru has diplomatic relations with most states in Oceania. It also has ties with most major industrial countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, France, the UK, Germany, Spain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and South Africa. Nauru has diplomatic relations with the European Union, most of its member states and a few other states in Europe, including the Holy See (Vatican City).

In 1995, Nauru broke off relations diplomatic relations with France to protest French nuclear testing in the Pacific. Relations were resumed in 1997.

Nauru established diplomatic relations with Kosovo on 23 April 2008, which ended 13 November 2019 as Nauru withdrew its recognition.

Nauru established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 15 December 2009.

==Relations with partially recognised states==

Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) by changing its position on the political status of Taiwan. During 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC on 21 July. Nauru accepted $130m from the PRC for this diplomatic move. In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005, and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005. Similarly, Nauru recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic on 12 August 1981. Then, on 15 September 2000, Nauru withdrew recognition of the SADR, and signed accords with Morocco on the phosphates area, which are running out in the island. In 2008, Nauru recognized Kosovo as an independent country, but withdrew its recognition in 2019. Additionally, in 2009, Nauru became only the fourth country to recognize the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are both claimed by Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru $50m in humanitarian aid in return.

<doc id="285604" wikidata="Q335091" url="?curid=285604" title="Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone">
<text>Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone (Alexander Augustus Frederick William Alfred George; born Prince Alexander of Teck; 14 April 1874 – 16 January 1957), was a member of the extended British royal family, as a great-grandson of King George III, a brother of Queen Mary, uncle to the Kings Edward VIII and George VI, and the husband of Princess Alice of Albany. He was a British Army commander, who served as Governor-General of the Union of South Africa and Governor General of Canada.

Prince Alexander was born in London to Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge and was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1904, he married Princess Alice of Albany and rose in the military ranks through his service on the western front of the First World War, receiving numerous honours and decorations.

A cousin and also brother-in-law of King George V, Alexander relinquished his German titles in 1917, including that of Prince of Teck in the Kingdom of Württemberg, and was elevated to the peerage as the Earl of Athlone. In 1923, the King appointed Lord Athlone as Governor-General of South Africa, on the recommendation of British prime minister Stanley Baldwin, and he occupied the viceregal post until 1930. Athlone then served as Chancellor of the University of London until, in 1940, his nephew George VI appointed him as Governor General of Canada, on the recommendation of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. He occupied the post until 1946. Athlone helped galvanise the Canadian war effort and was a host to British and American statesmen during the Second World War.

After returning to the United Kingdom, Athlone sat on the organising committee for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, his great-niece. He died at Kensington Palace in 1957 and was interred in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore.

==Early life, education, and military career==
Prince Alexander of Teck was born at Kensington Palace on 14 April 1874, the fourth child and third son of Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. Although his mother was a granddaughter of King George III and first cousin to Queen Victoria, Athlone, as the son of a prince of Teck in Württemberg, was styled from birth as &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; and held the title &quot;Prince Alexander of Teck&quot;. He was known, however, to his family and friends as &quot;Alge&quot;, derived from the first two letters of &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;George&quot;, and was characterised as a meticulous individual with a quick, but short-lived, temper and an ability to be cautious and tactful.
When Prince Alexander was nine years old, his parents fled the United Kingdom for continental Europe to escape their high debts. They stayed there for two years. The Prince remained at Eton College before moving on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In October 1894, having completed his officer&#x27;s training, Prince Alexander was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, and shortly after served in the Second Matabele War. He was mentioned in despatches during the conflict and, after its cessation, was appointed on 8 December 1898 by Queen Victoria as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. He received a promotion to lieutenant in June 1899 and to captain the following April. For his actions in the Second Boer War, Alexander was, in April 1901, appointed by King Edward VII as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order.

The announcement came on 16 November 1903 that Prince Alexander had become engaged to his second cousin once removed, Princess Alice of Albany, daughter of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and thus a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and niece of the then soon-to-be Governor General of Canada, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. The two were wed at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, in Windsor Castle, on 10 February 1904 and, six days later, in celebration of the wedding, the Prince was promoted to the grade of a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order. The couple thereafter had three children: Princess May of Teck, born 1906; Prince Rupert of Teck, born 1907; and Prince Maurice Francis George of Teck. Maurice, however, lived only for less than six months, between 29 March and 14 September 1910.

In the same year, Prince Alexander was appointed Chairman of Middlesex Hospital.

==First World War==
Prior to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, Prince Alexander, who had been promoted to major in January 1911 and was a brevet lieutenant-colonel commanding the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards, was nominated by the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith to serve as Governor General of Canada. However, the Prince was called up for active service with his regiment. taking him to battle in France and Flanders. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, with the temporary rank of brigadier-general, in December 1915. For his service on the battlefields, in June 1917 Prince Alexander was appointed by his brother in law, King George V, as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

During the war, anti-German sentiment throughout the British Empire led the King to change the name of the royal house from the Germanic House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the more English House of Windsor, while simultaneously renouncing all Germanic titles for himself and all members of the Royal Family. Through a royal warrant issued on 14 July 1917, Alexander, along with his brother, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Teck, similarly relinquished all of his German titles, styles, and honours, choosing instead the name of &quot;Cambridge&quot;, after his grandfather, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. Alexander was then known simply as Sir Alexander Cambridge (being entitled to the honorific &quot;Sir&quot; through his knighthoods in the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the Bath), until, on 7 November 1917, the King created him Earl of Athlone and Viscount Trematon. Athlone had declined a marquessate, as he thought the title did not sound British enough. Athlone&#x27;s wife retained her royal style and title, while their surviving children became the Lady May Cambridge and Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon. Rupert was to inherit the title of Earl of Athlone, but he died on 15 April 1928 following a car crash, ten days shy of his twenty-first birthday, meaning the third creation of the title became extinct with the death of the first earl.

==Post-war career and Governor-General of the Union of South Africa==
Following the cessation of hostilities in Europe in 1918, Athlone was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel in June 1919, and retired from the army that November, with the honorary rank of brigadier-general. He took up posts in the civilian world, continuing at Middlesex Hospital. Because of his experience there, he was appointed in 1921 to chair an investigative committee on the needs of doctors. Known as the &quot;Athlone Committee&quot;, its work resulted in the creation of post-graduate schools for medical education and research, such as the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. In March 1922, he was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Regular Army Reserves, retaining his honorary rank of brigadier-general, and, in 1937, was appointed chair of a committee of inquiry into the arrangements for &quot;recruitment, training and registration and terms and conditions of service&quot; for nurses.

For their London residence, the Athlones used the grace and favour apartments of Princess Alice&#x27;s mother, the late Duchess of Albany, in the Clock House at Kensington Palace and, in 1923, they acquired a country residence, Brantridge Park, in West Sussex.

In December of the same year, Athlone was appointed by the King as both an honorary major-general and as the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa, replacing his wife&#x27;s cousin, Prince Arthur of Connaught. He arrived in Pretoria in January 1924 and was immediately at work with his viceregal duties, opening the newly finished parliament building, just weeks before his South African prime minister, Jan Smuts, suddenly advised him to prorogue the legislature.

In the ensuing election—the running of which forced Athlone to cancel the planned tour of Prince Edward, Prince of Wales—the National Party won a majority of seats in the House of Assembly, meaning Athlone appointed the party&#x27;s leader, James Barry Munnik Hertzog, as his new prime minister. At the time, Afrikaner nationalism was increasing in the dominion, and Hertzog was a republican who promoted the secession of South Africa from the British Empire. As such, he proposed the country adopt its own flag over the Union Flag. Athlone, however, proved sympathetic and tactful, and resolved the issue by advancing a flag that was unique to South Africa, but which still contained the Union Flag within it, despite opposition from numerous Afrikaners. He also gained popularity with South Africans of all races through his frequent tours of the country, performing a number of ceremonial duties, including opening Pioneers&#x27; Park in Johannesburg.

For his service to the Crown in South Africa, Athlone was appointed by George V as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter, on 17 April 1928, and, upon his return to the UK, was made on 4 August 1931 the Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle. The following year, he was also selected as the Chancellor of the University of London, which post he held until 1955.

In 1937 he led the Ministry of Health and Board of Education Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nursing Services, also known as The Athlone Report. It looked at nursing recruitment, retention and skills and included Dame Ellen Musson

In January 1939, Athlone was appointed president of The Football Association. The move represented the first time the FA had appointed someone that was not a football administrator to the position.

==Governor General of Canada==

In Canada in the late 1930s, there had been calls from government circles and the media alike for the King to appoint a Canadian-born individual as governor general. However, with the rush to fill the post after the unexpected death (on February 11, 1940) of the incumbent viceroy, Lord Tweedsmuir, and with the country embroiled in the Second World War, Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King advised King George VI that the time was not right for such a change in viceregal tradition.

Instead, it was George&#x27;s uncle, the Earl of Athlone, whose name Mackenzie King put forward and the Earl accepted. Subsequently, Athlone, along with his wife and his aide-de-camp, Alastair Windsor, Earl of Macduff, voyaged to Canada to take up his position, their liner using a submarine-evading zig-zag pattern across the Atlantic Ocean to Halifax, Nova Scotia. After travelling on to Ottawa by train, Athlone was sworn in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on 21 June 1940. The Athlones&#x27; three grandchildren, Anne, Richard, and Elizabeth (children of their daughter May), lived with them in Canada for the duration of the war.

Athlone immediately made himself active in the support of the war effort, travelling across the country and focusing much of his attention on the troops, either those training at military facilities or those injured and in hospital. Viewing his position as governor general as a link between Canadians and their monarch, Athlone also communicated in speeches that the King stood with them in their fight against Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.

The war was brought close to home for the Athlones also because many of those belonging to displaced European royal families sought refuge in Canada and resided at or near the royal and viceroyal residence, Rideau Hall. Among the royal guests were Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway; Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Luxembourg; King Peter II of Yugoslavia; King George II of Greece; Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma (Austria-Hungary) and her daughters; as well as Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and her daughter, Princess Juliana. Further, in December 1941, British prime minister Winston Churchill arrived at the residence, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via telephone from his bed.

It was Athlone&#x27;s duty to play host at Quebec City to his prime minister, still Mackenzie King, as well as Churchill and President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt, who all gathered to take part in what would become known as the Quebec Conferences, with the first taking place between 17 and 24 August 1943 at the viceregal residence in La Citadelle, and the second occurring from 12 to 16 September 1944 at the Château Frontenac. It was at these meetings that the four men discussed the Allied strategies that would eventually lead to victory over Nazi Germany and Japan. When Germany fell on 8 May 1945 and Japan on 15 August of the same year, Athlone led the national celebrations held on Parliament Hill and elsewhere. He thereafter spoke in speeches about Canada&#x27;s future being marked not by war but by a strong role in reconstruction and reconciliation.

During his time as the Canadian viceroy, Athlone also lent his status to various charitable and other social events, and mounted a number of activities of his own, such as tobogganing parties and skating lessons on the grounds of Rideau Hall, as well as skiing in Gatineau Park. When he departed Canada at the end of his time as the King&#x27;s representative, Athlone left as a legacy the Athlone Fellowship, awarded by the Engineering Institute of Canada.

==Post-viceregal life==

After Lord Athlone&#x27;s replacement as governor general was appointed on 21 March 1946, he returned to the United Kingdom to retirement, taking up residence again in a grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace and, on 1 September of that year, resigning as colonel of the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars. He did not completely remove himself from public activity, however, and was, along with his Canadian viceregal successor, Lord Alexander of Tunis, appointed to the committee charged with organising the coronation in 1953 of Athlone&#x27;s great-niece, Queen Elizabeth II, and continued to sit as Chancellor of the University of London until 1955.

The Earl of Athlone died at Kensington on 16 January 1957 at the age of 82, and was interred in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 January before being transferred to the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore on 15 May 1957. He was the last surviving great-grandchild of George III.

<doc id="285605" wikidata="Q704931" url="?curid=285605" title="Edmund Wilson">
<text>Edmund Wilson Jr. (May 8, 1895 – June 12, 1972) was an American writer, literary critic and journalist. He is widely regarded as one of the most important literary critics of the 20th century. Wilson began his career as a journalist, writing for publications such as &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He helped to edit &quot;The New Republic&quot;, served as chief book critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and was a frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. 

His notable works include &quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1931), described by Joyce Carol Oates as &quot;a groundbreaking study of modern literature.&quot; Oates writes that Wilson &quot;encroached fearlessly on areas reserved for academic &#x27;experts&#x27;: early Christianity in &quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; (1955), native American civilization in &quot;Apologies to the Iroquois&quot; (1960), and the American Civil War in &quot;Patriotic Gore&quot; (1962).&quot; 

Wilson also authored a novel, &quot;I Thought of Daisy&quot; (1929) and a collection of short stories, &quot;Memoirs of Hecate County&quot; (1946). He was a friend of many notable figures, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos and Vladimir Nabokov. His dream for a Library of America series of national classic works came to fruition through the efforts of Jason Epstein after Wilson&#x27;s death. He was a two-time winner of the National Book Award and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. He died in 1972 at age 77.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Red Bank, New Jersey. His parents were Edmund Wilson Sr., a lawyer who served as New Jersey Attorney General, and Helen Mather (née Kimball). Wilson attended The Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1912. At Hill, Wilson served as the editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Record&quot;. 

From 1912 to 1916, he was educated at Princeton University, where his friends included F. Scott Fitzgerald and war poet John Allan Wyeth. Wilson began his professional writing career as a reporter for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, and served in the army with Base Hospital 36 from Detroit, Michigan, and later as a translator during the First World War. His family&#x27;s summer home at Talcottville, New York, known as Edmund Wilson House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

==Career==
Wilson was the managing editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1920 and 1921, and later served as associate editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; and as a book reviewer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. His works influenced novelists Upton Sinclair, John Dos Passos, Sinclair Lewis, Floyd Dell, and Theodore Dreiser. He served on the Dewey Commission that set out to fairly evaluate the charges that led to the exile of Leon Trotsky. He wrote plays, poems, and novels, but his greatest influence was literary criticism.

&quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870–1930&quot; (1931) was a sweeping survey of Symbolism. It covered Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam (author of &quot;Axël&quot;), W. B. Yeats, Paul Valéry, T. S. Eliot, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein.

In 1931, monitoring the Coal War in Harlan County, with Mary Heaton Vorse and Malcolm Cowley he was run out of Kentucky by nightriders.

In 1932, Wilson pledged his support to the Communist Party USA&#x27;s candidate for president, William Z. Foster, signing a manifesto in support of CPUSA policies; however, Wilson did not identify personally as a communist. In his book &quot;To the Finland Station&quot; (1940), Wilson traced the course of European socialism, from the 1824 discovery by Jules Michelet of the ideas of Vico to the 1917 arrival of Vladimir Lenin at the Finland Station of Saint Petersburg to lead the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution.

In an essay on the work of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, &quot;Tales of the Marvellous and the Ridiculous&quot;, Wilson condemned Lovecraft&#x27;s tales as &quot;hackwork&quot;. Wilson is also well known for his heavy criticism of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which he referred to as &quot;juvenile trash&quot;, saying &quot;Dr. Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.&quot; He had earlier dismissed the work of W. Somerset Maugham in vehement terms (without, as he later boasted, having troubled to read the novels generally regarded as Maugham&#x27;s finest, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; and &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;).

In 1964, Wilson was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture. 

Wilson lobbied for the creation of a series of classic U.S. literature similar to France&#x27;s &quot;Bibliothèque de la Pléiade&quot;. In 1982, ten years after his death, The Library of America series was launched. Wilson&#x27;s writing was included in the Library of America in two volumes published in 2007.

==Peers and relationships==
Wilson&#x27;s critical works helped foster public appreciation for several novelists: Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Vladimir Nabokov. He was instrumental in establishing the modern evaluation of the works of Charles Dickens and Rudyard Kipling. Wilson was a friend of the novelist and playwright Susan Glaspell as well as the philosopher Isaiah Berlin.

He attended Princeton with Fitzgerald, a year-and-a-half his junior. In 1936 in the &quot;Crack-Up&quot; essays, Fitzgerald referred to Wilson as his &quot;intellectual conscience ... [f]or twenty years&quot;. After Fitzgerald&#x27;s early death (at the age of 44) from a heart attack in December 1940, Wilson edited two books by Fitzgerald (&quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; and &quot;The Crack-Up&quot;) for posthumous publication, donating his editorial services to help Fitzgerald&#x27;s family. Wilson was also a friend of Nabokov, with whom he corresponded extensively and whose writing he introduced to Western audiences. However, their friendship was marred by Wilson&#x27;s cool reaction to Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; and irretrievably damaged by Wilson&#x27;s public criticism of what he considered Nabokov&#x27;s eccentric translation of Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin.&quot;

Wilson had multiple marriages and affairs.
* His first wife was Mary Blair, who had been in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s theatrical company. Their daughter, Rosalind Baker Wilson, was born on September 19, 1923.
* His second wife was Margaret Canby. After her death in a freak accident two years after their marriage, Wilson wrote a long eulogy to her and said later that he felt guilt over having neglected her. Wilson, despondent over Canby&#x27;s death, moved to a rundown townhouse at 314 East 53rd Street in Manhattan for several years.
* From 1938 to 1946, he was married to Mary McCarthy, who like Wilson was well known as a literary critic. She enormously admired Wilson&#x27;s breadth and depth of intellect, and they collaborated on numerous works. In an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Louis Menand wrote, &quot;The marriage to McCarthy was a mistake that neither side wanted to be first to admit. When they fought, he would retreat into his study and lock the door; she would set piles of paper on fire and try to push them under it.&quot; This marriage resulted in the birth of their son, Reuel, on December 25, 1938.
* His fourth wife was Elena Mumm Thornton (previously married to James Worth Thornton). Their daughter, Helen Miranda Wilson, was born February 19, 1948.

He wrote many letters to Anaïs Nin, criticizing her for her surrealistic style, because it was opposed to the realism that was then deemed correct writing, and he ended by asking for her hand — &quot;I would love to be married to you, and I would teach you to write&quot; — which she took as an insult. Except for a brief falling-out following the publication of &quot;I Thought of Daisy&quot;, in which Wilson portrayed Edna St. Vincent Millay as Rita Cavanaugh, Wilson and Millay remained friends throughout life.

==Cold War==
Wilson was also an outspoken critic of US Cold War policies. He refused to pay his federal income tax from 1946 to 1955 and was later investigated by the Internal Revenue Service. After a settlement, Wilson received a $25,000 fine, rather than the original $69,000 sought by the IRS. He received no jail time. In his book &quot;The Cold War and the Income Tax: A Protest&quot; (1963), Wilson argued that as a result of competitive militarization against the Soviet Union, the civil liberties of Americans were being paradoxically infringed under the guise of defense from Communism. For those reasons, Wilson also opposed involvement in the Vietnam War.

Selected by John F. Kennedy to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Wilson, in absentia, was officially awarded the medal on December 6, 1963, by President Lyndon Johnson. However, Wilson&#x27;s view of Johnson was decidedly negative. Historian Eric F. Goldman writes in his memoir &quot;The Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson&quot; that when Goldman, on behalf of Johnson, invited Wilson to read from his writings at a White House Festival of the Arts in 1965, &quot;Wilson declined with a brusqueness that I never experienced before or after in the case of an invitation in the name of the President and First Lady.&quot;

For the academic year 1964–65, he was a Fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.

<text>The Bank of Scotland plc (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Banca na h-Alba&quot;) is a commercial and clearing bank based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is part of the Lloyds Banking Group. The bank was established by the Parliament of Scotland in 1695 to develop Scotland&#x27;s trade with other countries, and aimed to create a stable banking system in the country. It was the first bank to be established in Scotland, and is the oldest operational bank in the country, the ninth oldest bank in continuous operation globally, as well as the longest continuous issuer of banknotes in the world.

With a history dating to the end of the 17th century, the Bank of Scotland was the first bank to have been established in Scotland, and, it is the fifth-oldest extant bank in the United Kingdom (the Bank of England having been established one year earlier). It is the only commercial institution created by the Parliament of Scotland, when Scotland was an independent, sovereign state, to remain in existence. It was the first bank in Europe to successfully print its own banknotes, and it continues to print its own sterling banknotes under legal arrangements that allow Scottish banks to issue currency.

In June 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, allowing the bank&#x27;s structure to be simplified. As a result, The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland became Bank of Scotland plc on 17 September 2007. Bank of Scotland has been a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group since 19 January 2009, when HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB.

==History==

===Establishment===
During the 1690s, public finances and economic prospects of the country were largely uncertain, with credit proving difficult to gain and cash being in relative short supply. A group of merchants saw the establishment of a public bank as the solution to the financial issues facing the country at the time, with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland being established by an act of the Parliament of Scotland on 17 July 1695, the Act for erecting a Bank in Scotland, opening for business in February 1696. Although established soon after the Bank of England (1694), the Bank of Scotland was a very different institution. Whereas the Bank of England was established specifically to finance defence spending by the English government, the Bank of Scotland was established by the Scottish government to support Scottish business, and was prohibited from lending to the government without parliamentary approval.

The founding act granted the bank a monopoly on public banking in Scotland for 21 years, permitted the bank&#x27;s directors to raise a nominal capital of £1,200,000 pound Scots (£100,000 pound sterling), gave the proprietors (shareholders) limited liability, and in the final clause (repealed only in 1920) made all foreign-born proprietors naturalised Scotsmen &quot;to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever&quot;. John Holland was one of the bank&#x27;s founders, and its first chief accountant was George Watson. Following the establishment of the Bank of Scotland, and the raising of capital funds, the bank was able to provide loans in order to stabilise Scottish businesses and the Scottish economy.

During its early days of operation, the Bank of Scotland acted as a means of public financial support during tough economic situations. The condition of harvest conditions leading to poor harvests and crops led to food shortages in Scotland during the 1700s, with the Bank of Scotland providing interest-free loans to help purchase meal and grain as a result of the lack of food due to harvest conditions. The bank was the first bank in Europe to produce banknotes. Until the development of banknotes, coinage was the only means of cash, but it was largely scarce and unreliable. The bank devolved the idea of paper money, each with a set number of values. Banknotes were initially issued for £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100, all of which were issued from March 1696, with a £1 note being introduced into circulation later. The Bank of Scotland still produces its own banknotes, making the bank the longest continuous banknote issuer in the world.

===18th and 19th centuries===
The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies. Its first rival, the Royal Bank of Scotland, was formed by royal charter in 1727. This led to a period of great competition between the two banks as they tried to drive each other out of business. Although the &quot;Bank Wars&quot; ended in around 1751, competition soon arose from other sources, as other Scottish banks were founded throughout the country. In response, the Bank of Scotland itself began to open branches throughout Scotland.

Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the bank supervised the reminting of the old Scottish coinage into Sterling. It was one of the first banks in Europe to print its own banknotes, and it continues to print its own sterling banknotes under legal arrangements that allow Scottish banks to issue currency. The bank also took the lead in establishing the security and stability of the entire Scottish banking system, which became more important after the insolvency of Alexander Fordyce and collapse of the Ayr Bank in 1772, in the crisis following the collapse of the London house of Neal, James, Fordyce and Down.

Henry Dundas was Governor of the Bank of Scotland from 1790 to 1811. As well as governor, he was also Home Secretary in William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s government. In 1792, Dundas was successful in passing the Slave Trade Bill in the House of Commons. The bank was housed in the southern (1588) section of the Gourlay house on Melbourne Place before being moved to the customised bank building on the Mound in 1805.

The Western Bank collapsed in 1857, and the Bank of Scotland stepped in with the other Scottish banks to ensure that all the Western Bank&#x27;s notes were paid. The first branch in London opened in 1865.

===20th century===
In the 1950s, the Bank of Scotland was involved in several mergers and acquisitions with different banks. In 1955, the Bank merged with the Union Bank of Scotland. The Bank also expanded into consumer credit with the purchase of Chester-based, North West Securities (Later Capital Bank). In 1971, the Bank agreed to merge with the British Linen Bank, owned by Barclays Bank. The merger saw Barclays Bank acquire a 35% stake in the Bank of Scotland, a stake it retained until the 1990s.

In 1959, the Bank of Scotland became the first bank in the UK to install a computer to process accounts centrally. At 11:00 on 25 January 1985, the Bank of Scotland introduced HOBS (Home and Office Banking Services), an early example of remote access technology being made available to banking customers. This followed a small-scale service operated jointly with the Nottingham Building Society for two years but developed by the Bank of Scotland. The new HOBS service enabled customers to access their accounts directly on a television screen, using the Prestel telephone network.

The arrival of North Sea oil to Scotland in the 1970s allowed the Bank of Scotland to expand into the energy sector. The bank later used this expertise in energy finance to expand internationally. The first international office opened in Houston, Texas, followed by more in the United States, Moscow and Singapore. In 1987, the bank acquired Countrywide Bank of New Zealand (later sold to Lloyds TSB in 1998). In 1995 the bank expanded into the Australian market by acquiring Perth based Bankwest.

A controversial period in the bank&#x27;s history was the attempt in 1999 to enter the United States retail banking market via a joint venture with evangelist Pat Robertson. The move was met with criticism from civil rights groups in the UK, owing to Robertson&#x27;s controversial views on homosexuality. The bank was forced to cancel the deal when Robertson described Scotland as a &quot;dark land overrun by homosexuals&quot;.

===HBOS===

In the late 1990s, the UK financial sector market underwent a period of consolidation on a large scale. Many of the large building societies were demutualising and becoming banks in their own right or merging with existing banks. For instance Lloyds Bank and TSB Bank merged in 1995 to create Lloyds TSB. In 1999, the Bank of Scotland made a takeover bid for National Westminster Bank. Since the Bank of Scotland was significantly smaller than the English-based NatWest, the move was seen as an audacious and risky move. However, The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled a rival offer, and a bitter takeover battle ensued, with the Royal Bank the victor.

In 2000, the Bank of Scotland became the first bank in the United Kingdom to introduce the concept of mobile banking, using WAP mobile phones. A simple and basic concept, the system allowed customers to only access account information, but it has been credited since for paving the way for the advancement and increased usage of mobile banking. The Bank of Scotland was now the centre of other merger opportunities. A proposal to merge with the Abbey National was explored, but later rejected. In 2001, the Bank of Scotland and the Halifax agreed a merger to form HBOS (&quot;Halifax Bank of Scotland&quot;).

In 2006, HBOS secured the passing of the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006, a local act of Parliament that would allow the group to operate within a simplified structure. The act allowed HBOS to make the Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland a public limited company, Bank of Scotland plc, which became the principal banking subsidiary of HBOS. Halifax plc and Capital Bank plc transferred their undertakings to Bank of Scotland plc, and although the Halifax brand name was retained, Halifax then began to operate under the latter company&#x27;s UK banking licence. Capital Bank branding was phased out.

The provisions in the act were implemented on 17 September 2007. In 2008, HBOS Group agreed to be taken over by Lloyds TSB Group during the Great Recession.

==Sponsorships==
The Bank of Scotland sponsored the Scottish Premier League from its inception in 1998, until the end of the 2006–2007 Scottish Premier League season, following its decision to not renew the deal in favour of investing in grassroots sport instead. Additionally, the bank sponsored Scottish Athletics for a number of years. Since November 2010, the Bank of Scotland Foundation has invested over £32 million to around 2,500 charities in Scotland, reaching roughly 1.2 million people by providing financial support to local services and personal support services.

== Banknotes ==

===Banknote history===

Although the Bank of Scotland today is not a central bank, it retains the right (along with two other Scottish commercial banks) to issue pound sterling banknotes to this day. These notes are equal in value to notes issued by the Bank of England, the central bank of the United Kingdom.

The Bank of Scotland was the first European bank to issue paper currency redeemable for cash on demand (which was an extremely useful facility given the poor state of the Scottish coinage at the end of the 17th century) on a sustainable basis after the earlier failed attempt of the Swedish Stockholms Banco in 1661–64. Following the Acts of Union in 1707, the bank supervised the reminting of the old Scottish coinage into Sterling. Up until the middle of the 19th century, privately owned banks in Great Britain and Ireland were permitted to issue their own banknotes, and money issued by provincial Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish banking companies circulated freely as a means of payment. The Bank of Scotland still produces its own banknotes, and is the longest continuous issuer of banknotes in the world. In 2022, the Bank of Scotland revealed the design of its £100 polymer note. The design was the first to commemorate the contribution of an influential person from Scotland, the suffragette and medical pioneer, Dr Flora Murray.

In 1826, there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of the United Kingdom Parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds face value. Sir Walter Scott wrote a series of letters to the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Journal&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Malachi Malagrowther&quot;, which provoked such a response that the government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing £1 notes.

===1995 &quot;Tercentenary&quot; series===

Bank of Scotland&#x27;s previous note issue was in 1995, known as the &quot;Tercentenary Series&quot; as they were issued in the year of the three hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the bank. Each denomination features Sir Walter Scott on the front, and on the back are representations of industries that Scotland excels in:

* £5 note featuring a vignette of oil and energy
* £10 note featuring a vignette of distilling and brewing
* £20 note featuring a vignette of education and research
* £50 note featuring a vignette of arts and culture
* £100 note featuring a vignette of leisure and tourism.

These notes are no longer in circulation.

===2007 &quot;Bridges&quot; series===
Bank of Scotland began issuing a new series of banknotes in the Autumn of 2007, which feature the common theme of Scottish bridges. It will take at least three years for the current issue of Bank of Scotland notes to be phased out of circulation. In keeping with the bank&#x27;s tradition, the front of the notes depict an image of Sir Walter Scott; the image on the 2007 series is based on the portrait of Scott painted by Henry Raeburn.

Some new security features have also been added to the new design. These include a metallic security thread embedded in every banknote, which contains the numerical value of the note and the note&#x27;s bridge image. A new hologram and foil patch has been introduced on the front of the £20, £50 and £100 notes, which features the Bank of Scotland logo and the numerical value of the note.

* £5 note features the Brig o&#x27; Doon
* £10 note features the Glenfinnan Viaduct
* £20 note features the Forth Bridge
* £50 note features the Falkirk Wheel
* £100 note features the Kessock Bridge

On 1 March 2018 the Bank of Scotland decided to withdraw all of its paper £5 and £10 notes, and fully replace them with its polymer equivalents (see below).

===2016 Polymer series===
Bank of Scotland began issuing new banknotes on polymer in 2016, beginning with the £5 note. The main theme of the bridges of Scotland are kept for this series, but have been redesigned to incorporate additional design features. The portrait of Sir Walter Scott by Henry Raeburn is the same as the 2007 issues, but have been shifted from the centre to the right side of the notes. The bank&#x27;s headquarters, &quot;The Mound&quot; is featured at the centre of the note. The size of the notes for this series is also reduced.

* £5 note features Brig o&#x27; Doon
* £10 note features Glenfinnan Viaduct
* £20 note features the Forth Bridge and a commemorative £20 note features the Queensferry Crossing
* £50 note features Falkirk Wheel and The Kelpies
* £100 note features Flora Murray

<text>Anne-Geneviève de Bourbon (; 28 August 16195 April 1679) was a French princess who is remembered for her beauty and amours, her influence during the civil wars of the Fronde, and her final conversion to Jansenism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Anne Geneviève was the only daughter of Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and his wife Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, and the sister of &quot;Louis, Grand Condé&quot;. She was born in the prison of the Château of Vincennes into which her father and mother had been thrown for opposition to Concino Concini, the favourite of Marie de&#x27; Medici, who was then regent during the minority of Louis XIII.

She was educated with great strictness in the convent of the Carmelites in the &quot;Rue Saint-Jacques&quot; in Paris. Her early years were clouded by the execution of Henri of Montmorency, her mother&#x27;s only brother, for intriguing against Richelieu in 1632, and that of her mother&#x27;s cousin the Count François de Montmorency-Bouteville for duelling in 1635; but her parents made their peace with Richelieu, and being introduced into society in 1635 she soon became one of the stars of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, at that time the center of all that was learned, witty, and gay in France.
===&quot;The Goddess of Peace and Concord&quot;===

In 1642, she was married to Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville, governor of Normandy, a widower twice her age (his first wife Louise de Bourbon had died in 1637). The marriage was not happy. After Richelieu&#x27;s death, her father became chief of the council of regency during the minority of Louis XIV, her brother Louis won the great victory of Rocroi in 1643, and the duchess became of political importance. In 1646, she accompanied her husband to Münster, where he was sent by Mazarin as chief envoy, and where she charmed the German diplomats who were negotiating the treaty of Westphalia and was addressed as the &quot;goddess of peace and concord&quot;.

===&quot;La Fronde&quot;===
On her return, she fell in love with the Duke of La Rochefoucauld, the author of the &quot;Maxims&quot;, who made use of her love to obtain influence over her brother, and thus win honors for himself. She was the guiding spirit of the first Fronde, when she brought over Armand de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, her second brother, and her husband to the malcontents, but she failed to attract Condé himself, whose loyalty to the court overthrew the first Fronde. It was during the first Fronde that she lived at the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; and took the city of Paris as godmother for the child born to her there. The peace did not satisfy her, although La Rochefoucauld won the titles he desired. The second Fronde was largely her work, and in it she played the most prominent part in attracting to the rebels first Condé and later Turenne. In the last year of the war, she was accompanied into Aquitaine by the Duke of Nemours, an intimacy which gave La Rochefoucauld an excuse for abandoning her, and to immediately return to his former mistress the duchesse de Chevreuse.

===Jansenism: a Refuge from Disgrace===
Thus abandoned, and in disgrace at court, the Duchess betook herself to religion. She accompanied her husband to his government at Rouen, and devoted herself to good works. She took for her spiritual director the Abbé Antoine Singlin (1607–1664), famous in the history of Port-Royal. She chiefly lived in Normandy until 1663, when her husband died, and she came to Paris.

There she became more and more Jansenist in opinion, and her piety and the remembrance of her influence during the disastrous days of the Fronde, and above all the love her brother, the great Condé, bore her, made her conspicuous. The king pardoned her and in every way showed respect for her. She became the great protectress of the Jansenists; it was in her house that Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole and Noël Lalane, author of &quot;De la Grâce victorieuse&quot;, were protected; and to her influence must be in great part attributed the release of Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy, from the Bastille, the introduction of Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne into the ministry and of Arnauld to the king.

Her famous letters to the pope are part of the history of Port-Royal, and as long as she lived the nuns of Port-Royal des Champs were left in safety. Her elder son resigned his title and estates, and became a Jesuit under the name of the Abbé d&#x27;Orléans, while the younger, after leading a debauched life, was killed leading the attack in the passage of the Rhine on 12 June 1672.

As her health failed, she hardly ever left the convent of the Carmelites in which she had been educated. On her death in 1679, she was buried with great splendor by her brother Condé, and her heart, as she had directed, was sent to the nuns of the Port-Royal des Champs.

==Authorities on the Duchess==
The chief authority for Madame de Longueville&#x27;s life is a little book in two volumes by Villefore the Jansenist, published in 1738. Victor Cousin has devoted four volumes to her, which, though immensely diffuse, give a vivid picture of her time. See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Portraits des femmes&quot; (1840). Her connection with Port-Royal should be studied in Arnauld&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;, and in the different histories of that institution.

==Children==
*Charlotte Louise, Mademoiselle de Dunois (1645–1664). 
*Jean Louis Charles d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville (1646–1694). 
*Marie Gabrielle (1646–1650).
*Charles Paris d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville (1649–1672).

<doc id="285613" wikidata="Q542634" url="?curid=285613" title="Alex Garland">
<text>Alexander Medawar Garland (born 26 May 1970) is an English author, screenwriter, and director. He rose to prominence with his novel &quot;The Beach&quot; (1996). He received praise for writing the Danny Boyle films &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002) and &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2007), as well as &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dredd&quot; (2012). In video games, he co-wrote &quot;&quot; (2010) and was a story supervisor on &quot;&quot; (2013).

Garland made his directorial debut when he wrote and directed the sci-fi thriller &quot;Ex Machina&quot; (2014). He earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, and won him three British Independent Film Awards, including Best Screenplay, Best Director, and Best British Independent Film for the film. His second movie, &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2018), an adaptation of the 2014 novel of the same name, was a critical success. He wrote, directed and executive produced the FX miniseries &quot;Devs&quot; (2020) followed by the horror thriller &quot;Men&quot; (2022), dystopian action thriller &quot;Civil War&quot; (2024), and the war film &quot;Warfare&quot; (2025). The three films were produced by A24.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Medawar Garland was born in London on 26 May 1970, the son of psychologist Caroline (née Medawar) and political cartoonist Nicholas Garland. Alexander has a younger brother and two older paternal half-siblings. He is the maternal grandson of writer Jean Medawar and Nobel Prize-winning biologist Peter Medawar, the latter of whom was born in Brazil to an English mother and Lebanese father. 

Alexander Garland was educated at University College School in Hampstead, England and later graduated from the University of Manchester in Manchester with an art history degree.

==Career==
===Novels===
Garland&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Beach&quot;, was published in 1996. Based on his travels across Europe and Thailand, it tells the story of a young English backpacker who discovers an unspoiled seashore occupied by a community of like-minded backpackers. The novel is noted for its references to drug culture, sequences of hallucinations, and unique depictions of excess and utopia. &quot;The Beach&quot; was initially met with positive reviews, and with a spreading word of mouth response, the novel grew in popularity; it led some critics to regard Garland a key voice of Generation X. He would later speak of his discomfort with the fame &quot;The Beach&quot; brought him. &quot;The Beach&quot; has been translated into 25 different languages and sold close to 700,000 copies by the start of 1999. It was developed into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2003, the novel was Ranked 103 in BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll.

Garland&#x27;s &quot;The Tesseract&quot; (1998) is a non-linear narrative with several interwoven characters, set in Manila, Philippines. The novel is characterized by a post-modernist narrative style and structure. It explores several themes such as love and violence through each character&#x27;s circumstance and context of surroundings as well as seemingly inconsequential actions and the repercussions of those actions on other characters. &quot;The Tesseract&quot; was not a critical or commercial success, but it too was adapted into a film.

Throughout his work, Garland has expressed his love of travel (particularly backpacking) and his love of Manila, much of which influenced his work.

===Film===
In 2002, Garland wrote the screenplay for Danny Boyle&#x27;s film &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, starring Cillian Murphy. He has said that the script was influenced by 1970s zombie films and English science fiction like &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. Video games such as the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series also served as an influence for &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, with Garland crediting the first game for revitalizing the zombie genre. Inspiration for the &quot;Rage&quot; virus came from real-world infections such as Ebola and filoviruses. He won a Best Screenplay honor at the 2004 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards for his script of the film.

In 2005, Garland wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of &quot;Halo&quot;. D. B. Weiss and Josh Olson rewrote this during 2006 for a 2008 release, although the film was later canceled. In 2007, he wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Sunshine&quot;, which was his second screenplay to be directed by Danny Boyle and to star Cillian Murphy. Garland served as an executive producer on &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, the sequel of &quot;28 Days Later&quot;. He wrote the screenplay for the 2010 film &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro. He also wrote the script for &quot;Dredd&quot;, an adaptation of the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comic book series from &quot;2000 AD&quot;. In 2018, Karl Urban, who played the eponymous role in the film, stated that it was Garland who deserved credit for also directing &quot;Dredd&quot;.

Garland made his directorial debut with &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, a 2014 feature film based on his own story and screenplay, starring Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. The film won a Jury Prize at the 2015 Gerardmer Film Festival, and earned Garland a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Garland&#x27;s second film, &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2018), was based on Jeff VanderMeer&#x27;s 2014 science fiction novel of the same name. Garland has described it as &quot;an adaptation [that] was a memory of the book,&quot; rather than book-referenced screenwriting, to capture the &quot;dream like nature&quot; and tone of his reading experience. Production began in 2016, and the film was released in February 2018.

In January 2021, Garland was hired to direct his third film, &quot;Men&quot;, starring Jessie Buckley and Rory Kinnear. The film follows a young woman who goes on a solo vacation to the English countryside after the death of her ex-husband. Released in May 2022, it received generally positive reviews, though its narrative approach received some criticism. Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum placed &quot;Men&quot; on his Best Films of 2022 list.

In April 2022, it was announced that Garland worked with A24 again for his fourth feature, &quot;Civil War&quot;, an action epic starring Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, and previous collaborators Stephen McKinley Henderson and Cailee Spaeny. The film was released on 12 April 2024. Garland will reunite with Boyle to write &quot;28 Years Later&quot;, the long-gestating sequel to &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, which is intended to launch a new trilogy of zombie films. Murphy will serve as an executive producer. The film is set to be released by Sony.

In February 2024, it was revealed that Charles Melton was in talks to star in Garland&#x27;s upcoming untitled war film with A24. This project marks the second collaboration between Garland and Ray Mendoza, who served as the military supervisor for &quot;Civil War&quot;. The pair wrote and will co-direct the film. The following month, Joseph Quinn, D&#x27;Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Kit Connor, Cosmo Jarvis, Will Poulter and Finn Bennett joined the ensemble cast, and the film was revealed to be titled &quot;Warfare&quot;. The same month, Garland stated that he would not direct any films in the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; after the release of &quot;Civil War&quot; and that his co-directorial work on &quot;Warfare&quot; was &quot;more of a supporting character&quot; to Mendoza&#x27;s.

===Television===
Garland wrote, served as executive producer, and directed the eight-episode miniseries &quot;Devs&quot; about the &quot;mysterious ongoings at a tech company&quot;, for FX. The series was greenlit in August 2018, and premiered 5 March 2020 on FX on Hulu. It stars &quot;Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Annihilation&quot; actress Sonoya Mizuno, alongside Nick Offerman, Jin Ha, Zach Grenier, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny, and Alison Pill. Spaeny, who did not audition for the role as Garland had wanted her specifically for it said that &quot;Devs&quot; was short for &quot;Development&quot;, and the series would explore the idea of the multiverse.

In May 2022, a television series based on &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; was optioned at FX, to be executive produced by Garland, who previously wrote the screenplay for the 2010 film adaptation of the same name. It would have premiered on Hulu in the United States, Star in other territories and Star+ in Latin America with Viola Prettejohn, Tracey Ullman and Kelly Macdonald starring. However in February 2023, it was announced that FX had cancelled the series before production began.

===Video games===
Garland and Tameem Antoniades co-wrote the video game &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. They won a 2011 award from the Writer&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain. Garland also served as a story supervisor on the game &quot;&quot; in 2013.

==Personal life==
Garland is married to English-Mexican actress Paloma Baeza, with whom he has a son and a daughter. He has described himself as being an atheist.

<text>Halifax (previously known as Halifax Building Society and colloquially known as The Halifax) is a British banking brand operating as a trading division of Bank of Scotland, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group.

It is named after the town of Halifax, West Yorkshire, where it was founded as a building society in 1853. By 1913 it had developed into the UK&#x27;s largest building society and continued to grow and prosper and maintained this position within the UK until 1997 when it demutualised.

In 1996, it became Halifax plc, a public limited company which was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 2001, Halifax plc merged with The Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland, forming HBOS. In 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 legally transferred the assets and liabilities of the Halifax chain to Bank of Scotland which became a standard plc, with Halifax becoming a division of Bank of Scotland. A takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB was approved by the Court of Session on 12 January 2009, and on 19 January 2009, Bank of Scotland, including Halifax, formally became part of Lloyds Banking Group.

== History ==
===The Jonas Tylor era===
The Halifax was formed out of the Loyal Georgian Society, a friendly society which carried out lending. Its decision to withdraw from lending led directly to the formation of the building society. The Halifax Permanent Building and Investment Society was proposed by the town&#x27;s leaders at a meeting in December 1852. Its rules were ratified in February 1853 and it was registered under the Benefit Building Societies Act 1836, with the &quot;Investment&quot; omitted from its title. Jonas Tylor, a 24-year-old lawyer&#x27;s clerk, was appointed Secretary and he was supported as president by John Fisher, manager of the Halifax Joint Stock Banking Company. Jonas Tylor was to serve as Secretary of the Halifax for almost fifty years and he was responsible for the society&#x27;s strategy of branch expansion from its beginning. Three branches were opened in its first year and by 1862 there was a total of 12 branches, all within Halifax. The first move out of Halifax came in 1862 with the formation of a branch in Huddersfield, which had its own chairman and directors.

One of the features of the Halifax was its willingness to finance the philanthropic housing development by prominent local businessmen. Edward Akroyd, a local mill owner, financed the building of working-class houses &quot;built cheaply, perhaps without taste&quot; through his Goahead Building Club. His subsequent plan to build a &quot;superior class of dwellings&quot; involved the formation of a Building Association and it was this development of the Akroydon model housing scheme in the 1860s that was financed by the Halifax. There followed a more substantial scheme with John Crossley, a carpet manufacturer, creating The West Hill Park Model Dwellings.

The 1903 history dutifully recorded the branch expansion in the late decades of the nineteenth century. By 1871 another ten local offices had been opened, supported by the construction of a new head office in 1873. Another 22 were opened in the next decade including the important cities of Bradford and Leeds; the Halifax had developed a significant regional presence. By 1902 there were 11 principal branches, all in Yorkshire cities, with a further 49 smaller branches.

===The Enoch Hill era===
After the death of Jonas Tylor, the appointment of his successor brought in [Sir] Enoch Hill, destined to be one of the great names in building society history. Hill was a mill worker&#x27;s son becoming a &quot;half timer&quot; in a Leek silk mill aged 8, with little of the required afternoon education forthcoming. He was full time at the age of 13, later moving from mill work to farming, printer&#x27;s apprentice and then becoming a local jobbing printer. His work with the church was recognised by the elders and he benefitted from their personal tuition. Amongst other activities he helped the blind secretary of Leek United Permanent Benefit Building Society by reading to him. Hill became increasingly involved with the administration of the Leek and that became his main work from 1896. It was from the position of Secretary to the Leek that he was recruited by the Halifax in 1903, at the age of 37. 

One of Hill&#x27;s early decisions was to concentrate on owner occupiers, particularly the cheaper properties. In 1904/5 the Halifax claimed to have opened more new accounts than any incorporated building society in the UK; in 1908 it had the largest advances and by 1913 it was the largest building society by size of assets. Despite its size, by the end of WWI the Halifax was still largely based in Yorkshire and Lancashire and the next stage was to take the Society national. The first branch in the south was opened at Shaftesbury in 1919; the all-important London office followed in 1924. Between 1918 and 1928 around 100 new branches and agencies were opened, doubling the Halifax&#x27;s coverage; that decade finished with new offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

By 1928 Halifax was in the unique position of having the two largest building societies in the country and they decided to merge. The Halifax Equitable Building Society had been formed in 1871 and it too grew rapidly. By 1911 it claimed to be the 11th largest; third by 1921 and second by 1924. At the time of the merger the Halifax Permanent had assets of £33m and the Equitable £14m. One of the features of the Equitable was that it had formed its own bank in 1900—the Halifax Equitable Bank. Although independent from the building society, only society members could buy shares. The Equitable Bank was sold to the Bank of Liverpool and Martins on the grounds that banking was best left to specialists. The Halifax Permanent Building Society paralleled the Equitable by forming its own bank in 1910—the Halifax and District Permanent Banking Company—but that was sold in 1917. Following the merger, branches were quickly opened in a number of leading cities: Aberdeen, Birmingham and Cardiff in 1929; and Belfast, Derby and Newcastle in 1930. On the back of the expansion in branches and agencies, and helped by the boom in private housing, assets increased from £47m after the 1928 merger to £123m in 1938. That was the year in which Sir Enoch Hill retired, at the age of 72, having been in charge of the Halifax for 35 years. He had been Chairman of the National Association of Building Societies from 1921 to 1933; the first secretary of the International Congress of Building Societies in 1914 and was knighted in 1928.

===New head office===
A new head office was built at Trinity Road, Halifax, in 1973. The distinctive diamond-shaped building was used on marketing material during the 1980s and 1990s. Underneath the building is a specially constructed deedstore which is used to store property deeds for a one-off charge of £10. It is computerised and could originally be filled with Halon gas in the event of fire. Its importance has diminished in recent years because property data is now kept on a central database kept by HM Land Registry.

===Demutualisation===
The deregulation of the financial services industry in the 1980s saw the passing of the Building Societies Act 1986 which allowed societies greater financial freedoms, and diversification into other markets. Accordingly, the Halifax acquired an estate agent to complement its mortgage business. It also expanded by offering current accounts and credit cards, traditionally services offered by commercial banks. In 1993, it established a Spanish subsidiary, Banco Halifax Hispania, mainly serving British expatriate mortgage customers.

The 1986 act also allowed building societies to demutualise and become public limited companies instead of mutually owned organisations, owned by the customers who borrowed and saved with the society. Although the Abbey National demutualised in 1989, the process was not repeated until the late 1990s, when most of the large societies announced demutualisation plans. In 1995, the Halifax announced it was to merge with the Leeds Permanent Building Society and convert to a plc. The Halifax floated on the London Stock Exchange on 2 June 1997. Over 7.5 million customers of the Society became shareholders of the new bank, the largest extension of shareholders in UK history.

As Halifax plc, the new bank was the fifth largest in the UK in terms of market capitalisation. Further expansion took place with the 1996 acquisition of Clerical Medical Fund Managers, a UK life insurance company. In 1999, the Halifax acquired the Birmingham Midshires Building Society and ComparetheLoan. In 2000, Halifax established Intelligent Finance, a telephone-and-internet-based bank.

===Formation of HBOS===
In 2001, a wave of consolidation in the UK banking market led Halifax to agree a £10.8 billion merger with the Bank of Scotland. The new group was named Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) with headquarters in Edinburgh, and retained both Halifax and the Bank of Scotland as brand names. Halifax branches in the rest of the UK use the Bank of Scotland brand for business banking. In 2006 the Bank of Scotland (Ireland), HBOS&#x27;s main retail bank in Ireland, announced that it would be rebranding its retail business as Halifax, citing the Irish public&#x27;s exposure to Halifax advertising on ITV as among the reasons. The Bank of Scotland name was to be retained for business banking.

In 2006, the HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 was passed. The aim of the Act was to simplify the corporate structure of HBOS. The Act was fully implemented on 17 September 2007 and the assets and liabilities of Halifax plc transferred to Bank of Scotland plc. The Halifax brand name was to be retained as a trading name, but it no longer exists as a legal entity.

===Lloyds Banking Group===

HBOS was acquired by the Lloyds Banking Group in January 2009 amid falling share price and speculation as to its future. Bank of Scotland plc (including its brands such as Halifax) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the group.

In February 2009, Halifax made significant changes to its current accounts. From then, all new standard current accounts had zero credit and debit interest, along with no paid and unpaid item charges (which were previously up to £35). Halifax has replaced their basic &#x27;Easycash&#x27; account with the &#x27;Basic Account&#x27;. They have no unpaid charges and replaced all Visa Electron cards with Visa Debit cards. They also align themselves with all other Halifax current accounts with an increased ATM daily withdrawal limit of £500. Instead, all overdraft-eligible Halifax &#x27;Standard current account&#x27; customers pay £1 per day for being overdrawn by up to £1999.99 within an arranged overdraft, and £2 per day for up to £2999.99 and £3 per day for over £3000.00. For unarranged overdrafts the fee is £5 per day. Credit interest has been replaced by a £5 net payment every month if customers abide by the terms of the &#x27;Reward current account&#x27;. These changes were implemented to all current account customers (except student accounts) from December 2009. These changes caused a great deal of media attention at the time of the change, with Martin Lewis and consumer magazine &quot;Which?&quot; urging Halifax customers to keep their accounts in credit wherever possible, or consider moving their accounts to an alternative bank, in response to the new charges.

On 16 October 2009, Halifax Estate Agency was sold to LSL Properties for a fee of £1. The branches were renamed as one of LSL&#x27;s existing brands, Reeds Rains.

On 14 November 2009, HBOS was hit by a power failure which affected all branches, cash machines and online banking. The bank said that the power failure occurred at an IT centre in Copley, West Yorkshire which caused several problems for Halifax&#x27;s banking system. Halifax&#x27;s online banking system did not recover from the power failure for several hours.

==Advertising==
On Boxing Day 2000, Halifax started a successful marketing campaign, which was continued after the creations of HBOS.

Halifax have also created adverts that have featured pop culture from franchises such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, the 1939 musical fantasy, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

In February 2021, Halifax released a TV advertisement featuring the Oasis song &quot;Stand By Me&quot;.

<text>In Riemannian geometry, the sectional curvature is one of the ways to describe the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. The sectional curvature &quot;K&quot;(σ&quot;p&quot;) depends on a two-dimensional linear subspace σ&quot;p&quot; of the tangent space at a point &quot;p&quot; of the manifold. It can be defined geometrically as the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane σ&quot;p&quot; as a tangent plane at &quot;p&quot;, obtained from geodesics which start at &quot;p&quot; in the directions of σ&quot;p&quot; (in other words, the image of σ&quot;p&quot; under the exponential map at &quot;p&quot;). The sectional curvature is a real-valued function on the 2-Grassmannian bundle over the manifold.

The sectional curvature determines the Riemann curvature tensor completely.

==Definition==
Given a Riemannian manifold and two linearly independent tangent vectors at the same point, &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, we can define

:formula_1

Here &quot;R&quot; is the Riemann curvature tensor, defined here by the convention formula_2 Some sources use the opposite convention formula_3 in which case &quot;K(u,v)&quot; must be defined with formula_4 in the numerator instead of formula_5

Note that the linear independence of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; forces the denominator in the above expression to be nonzero, so that &quot;K(u,v)&quot; is well-defined. In particular, if &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are orthonormal, then the definition takes on the simple form
:formula_6
It is straightforward to check that if formula_7 are linearly independent and span the same two-dimensional linear subspace of the tangent space formula_8 as formula_9, then formula_10 So one may consider the sectional curvature as a real-valued function whose input is a two-dimensional linear subspace of a tangent space.

===Alternative definitions===
Alternatively, the sectional curvature can be characterized by the circumference of small circles. Let formula_11 be a two-dimensional plane in formula_12. Let formula_13 for sufficiently small formula_14 denote the image under the exponential map at formula_15 of the unit circle in formula_11, and let formula_17 denote the length of formula_13. Then it can be proven that

: formula_19 

as formula_20, for some number formula_21. This number formula_21 at formula_15 is the sectional curvature of formula_11 at formula_15.

==Manifolds with constant sectional curvature==
One says that a Riemannian manifold has &quot;constant curvature formula_26&quot; if formula_27 for all two-dimensional linear subspaces formula_28 and for all formula_29

The Schur lemma states that if &quot;(M,g)&quot; is a connected Riemannian manifold with dimension at least three, and if there is a function formula_30 such that formula_31 for all two-dimensional linear subspaces formula_28 and for all formula_33 then &quot;f&quot; must be constant and hence &quot;(M,g)&quot; has constant curvature.

A Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature is called a space form. If formula_26 denotes the constant value of the sectional curvature, then the curvature tensor can be written as
: formula_35
for any formula_36
Since any Riemannian metric is parallel with respect to its Levi-Civita connection, this shows that the Riemann tensor of any constant-curvature space is also parallel. The Ricci tensor is then given by formula_37 and the scalar curvature is formula_38 In particular, any constant-curvature space is Einstein and has constant scalar curvature.

=== The model examples ===

Given a positive number formula_39 define
* formula_40 to be the standard Riemannian structure
* formula_41 to be the sphere formula_42 with formula_43 given by the pullback of the standard Riemannian structure on formula_44 by the inclusion map formula_45
* formula_46 to be the ball formula_47 with formula_48
In the usual terminology, these Riemannian manifolds are referred to as Euclidean space, the n-sphere, and hyperbolic space. Here, the point is that each is a complete connected smooth Riemannian manifold with constant curvature. To be precise, the Riemannian metric formula_49 has constant curvature 0, the Riemannian metric formula_43 has constant curvature formula_51 and the Riemannian metric formula_52 has constant curvature formula_53

Furthermore, these are the &#x27;universal&#x27; examples in the sense that if formula_54 is a smooth, connected, and simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold with constant curvature, then it is isometric to one of the above examples; the particular example is dictated by the value of the constant curvature of formula_55 according to the constant curvatures of the above examples.

If formula_54 is a smooth and connected complete Riemannian manifold with constant curvature, but is &quot;not&quot; assumed to be simply-connected, then consider the universal covering space formula_57 with the pullback Riemannian metric formula_58 Since formula_59 is, by topological principles, a covering map, the Riemannian manifold formula_60 is locally isometric to formula_61, and so it is a smooth, connected, and simply-connected complete Riemannian manifold with the same constant curvature as formula_62 It must then be isometric one of the above model examples. Note that the deck transformations of the universal cover are isometries relative to the metric formula_58

The study of Riemannian manifolds with constant negative curvature is called hyperbolic geometry.

==Scaling==
Let formula_54 be a smooth manifold, and let formula_65 be a positive number. Consider the Riemannian manifold formula_66 The curvature tensor, as a multilinear map formula_67 is unchanged by this modification. Let formula_68 be linearly independent vectors in formula_8. Then
: formula_70
So multiplication of the metric by formula_65 multiplies all of the sectional curvatures by formula_72

==Toponogov&#x27;s theorem==
Toponogov&#x27;s theorem affords a characterization of sectional curvature in terms of how &quot;fat&quot; geodesic triangles appear when compared to their Euclidean counterparts. The basic intuition is that, if a space is positively curved, then the edge of a triangle opposite some given vertex will tend to bend away from that vertex, whereas if a space is negatively curved, then the opposite edge of the triangle will tend to bend towards the vertex.

More precisely, let &quot;M&quot; be a complete Riemannian manifold, and let &quot;xyz&quot; be a geodesic triangle in &quot;M&quot; (a triangle each of whose sides is a length-minimizing geodesic). Finally, let &quot;m&quot; be the midpoint of the geodesic &quot;xy&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; has non-negative curvature, then for all sufficiently small triangles
:formula_73
where &quot;d&quot; is the distance function on &quot;M&quot;. The case of equality holds precisely when the curvature of &quot;M&quot; vanishes, and the right-hand side represents the distance from a vertex to the opposite side of a geodesic triangle in Euclidean space having the same side-lengths as the triangle &quot;xyz&quot;. This makes precise the sense in which triangles are &quot;fatter&quot; in positively curved spaces. In non-positively curved spaces, the inequality goes the other way:
:formula_74

If tighter bounds on the sectional curvature are known, then this property generalizes to give a comparison theorem between geodesic triangles in &quot;M&quot; and those in a suitable simply connected space form; see Toponogov&#x27;s theorem. Simple consequences of the version stated here are:

* A complete Riemannian manifold has non-negative sectional curvature if and only if the function formula_75 is 1-concave for all points &quot;p&quot;.
* A complete simply connected Riemannian manifold has non-positive sectional curvature if and only if the function formula_75 is 1-convex.

==Manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature==
In 1928, Élie Cartan proved the Cartan–Hadamard theorem: if &quot;M&quot; is a complete manifold with non-positive sectional curvature, then its universal cover is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space. In particular, it is aspherical: the homotopy groups formula_77 for &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2 are trivial. Therefore, the topological structure of a complete non-positively curved manifold is determined by its fundamental group. Preissman&#x27;s theorem restricts the fundamental group of negatively curved compact manifolds. The Cartan–Hadamard conjecture states that the classical isoperimetric inequality should hold in all simply connected spaces of non-positive curvature, which are called Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.

==Manifolds with positive sectional curvature==
Little is known about the structure of positively curved manifolds. The soul theorem (; ) implies that a complete non-compact non-negatively curved manifold is diffeomorphic to a normal bundle over a compact non-negatively curved manifold. As for compact positively curved manifolds, there are two classical results:

* It follows from the Myers theorem that the fundamental group of such a manifold is finite.
* It follows from the Synge theorem that the fundamental group of such a manifold in even dimensions is 0, if orientable and formula_78 otherwise. In odd dimensions a positively curved manifold is always orientable.

Moreover, there are relatively few examples of compact positively curved manifolds, leaving a lot of conjectures (e.g., the Hopf conjecture on whether there is a metric of positive sectional curvature on formula_79). The most typical way of constructing new examples is the following corollary from the O&#x27;Neill curvature formulas: if formula_54 is a Riemannian manifold admitting a free isometric action of a Lie group G, and M has positive sectional curvature on all 2-planes orthogonal to the orbits of G, then the manifold formula_81 with the quotient metric has positive sectional curvature. This fact allows one to construct the classical positively curved spaces, being spheres and projective spaces, as well as these examples :

* The Berger spaces formula_82 and formula_83.
* The Wallach spaces (or the homogeneous flag manifolds): formula_84, formula_85 and formula_86.
* The Aloff–Wallach spaces formula_87.
* The Eschenburg spaces formula_88
* The Bazaikin spaces formula_89, where formula_90.

==Manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature==
Cheeger and Gromoll proved their soul theorem which states that any non-negatively curved complete non-compact manifold formula_91 has a totally convex compact submanifold formula_92 such that formula_91 is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of formula_92. Such an formula_92 is called the soul of formula_91. In particular, this theorem implies that formula_91 is homotopic to its soul formula_92 which has the dimension less than formula_91.

<text>In the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry, the scalar curvature (or the Ricci scalar) is a measure of the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. To each point on a Riemannian manifold, it assigns a single real number determined by the geometry of the metric near that point. It is defined by a complicated explicit formula in terms of partial derivatives of the metric components, although it is also characterized by the volume of infinitesimally small geodesic balls. In the context of the differential geometry of surfaces, the scalar curvature is twice the Gaussian curvature, and completely characterizes the curvature of a surface. In higher dimensions, however, the scalar curvature only represents one particular part of the Riemann curvature tensor.

The definition of scalar curvature via partial derivatives is also valid in the more general setting of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. This is significant in general relativity, where scalar curvature of a Lorentzian metric is one of the key terms in the Einstein field equations. Furthermore, this scalar curvature is the Lagrangian density for the Einstein–Hilbert action, the Euler–Lagrange equations of which are the Einstein field equations in vacuum.

The geometry of Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature has been widely studied. On noncompact spaces, this is the context of the positive mass theorem proved by Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau in the 1970s, and reproved soon after by Edward Witten with different techniques. Schoen and Yau, and independently Mikhael Gromov and Blaine Lawson, developed a number of fundamental results on the topology of closed manifolds supporting metrics of positive scalar curvature. In combination with their results, Grigori Perelman&#x27;s construction of Ricci flow with surgery in 2003 provided a complete characterization of these topologies in the three-dimensional case.

==Definition==
Given a Riemannian metric , the scalar curvature Scal is defined as the trace of the Ricci curvature tensor with respect to the metric:

: formula_1

The scalar curvature cannot be computed directly from the Ricci curvature since the latter is a (0,2)-tensor field; the metric must be used to raise an index to obtain a (1,1)-tensor field in order to take the trace. In terms of local coordinates one can write, using the Einstein notation convention, that:
:formula_2
where are the components of the Ricci tensor in the coordinate basis, and where are the inverse metric components, i.e. the components of the inverse of the matrix of metric components . Based upon the Ricci curvature being a sum of sectional curvatures, it is possible to also express the scalar curvature as
:formula_3
where denotes the sectional curvature and is any orthonormal frame at . By similar reasoning, the scalar curvature is twice the trace of the curvature operator. Alternatively, given the coordinate-based definition of Ricci curvature in terms of the Christoffel symbols, it is possible to express scalar curvature as
:formula_4
where formula_5 are the Christoffel symbols of the metric, and formula_6 is the partial derivative of formula_5 in the σ-coordinate direction.

The above definitions are equally valid for a pseudo-Riemannian metric. The special case of Lorentzian metrics is significant in the mathematical theory of general relativity, where the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature are the fundamental terms in the Einstein field equation.

However, unlike the Riemann curvature tensor or the Ricci tensor, the scalar curvature cannot be defined for an arbitrary affine connection, for the reason that the trace of a (0,2)-tensor field is ill-defined. However, there are other generalizations of scalar curvature, including in Finsler geometry.

===Traditional notation===
In the context of tensor index notation, it is common to use the letter to represent three different things:
# the Riemann curvature tensor: or 
# the Ricci tensor: 
# the scalar curvature: 

These three are then distinguished from each other by their number of indices: the Riemann tensor has four indices, the Ricci tensor has two indices, and the Ricci scalar has zero indices. Other notations used for scalar curvature include , , , , or , and .

Those not using an index notation usually reserve &quot;R&quot; for the full Riemann curvature tensor. Alternatively, in a coordinate-free notation one may use &quot;Riem&quot; for the Riemann tensor, &quot;Ric&quot; for the Ricci tensor and &quot;R&quot; for the scalar curvature.

Some authors instead define Ricci curvature and scalar curvature with a normalization factor, so that
:formula_8
The purpose of such a choice is that the Ricci and scalar curvatures become &quot;average values&quot; (rather than sums) of sectional curvatures.

==Basic properties==
It is a fundamental fact that the scalar curvature is invariant under isometries. To be precise, if is a diffeomorphism from a space to a space , the latter being equipped with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric , then the scalar curvature of the pullback metric on equals the composition of the scalar curvature of with the map . This amounts to the assertion that the scalar curvature is geometrically well-defined, independent of any choice of coordinate chart or local frame. More generally, as may be phrased in the language of homotheties, the effect of scaling the metric by a constant factor is to scale the scalar curvature by the inverse factor .

Furthermore, the scalar curvature is (up to an arbitrary choice of normalization factor) the only coordinate-independent function of the metric which, as evaluated at the center of a normal coordinate chart, is a polynomial in derivatives of the metric and has the above scaling property. This is one formulation of the Vermeil theorem.

===Bianchi identity===
As a direct consequence of the Bianchi identities, any (pseudo-)Riemannian metric has the property that
:formula_9
This identity is called the &quot;contracted Bianchi identity&quot;. It has, as an almost immediate consequence, the Schur lemma stating that if the Ricci tensor is pointwise a multiple of the metric, then the metric must be Einstein (unless the dimension is two). Moreover, this says that (except in two dimensions) a metric is Einstein if and only if the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature are related by
:formula_10
where denotes the dimension. The contracted Bianchi identity is also fundamental in the mathematics of general relativity, since it identifies the Einstein tensor as a fundamental quantity.

===Ricci decomposition===
Given a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric on a space of dimension , the &quot;scalar curvature part&quot; of the Riemann curvature tensor is the (0,4)-tensor field
:formula_11
(This follows the convention that .) This tensor is significant as part of the Ricci decomposition; it is orthogonal to the difference between the Riemann tensor and itself. The other two parts of the Ricci decomposition correspond to the components of the Ricci curvature which do &quot;not&quot; contribute to scalar curvature, and to the Weyl tensor, which is the part of the Riemann tensor which does not contribute to the Ricci curvature. Put differently, the above tensor field is the only part of the Riemann curvature tensor which contributes to the scalar curvature; the other parts are orthogonal to it and make no such contribution. There is also a Ricci decomposition for the curvature of a Kähler metric.

===Basic formulas===
The scalar curvature of a conformally changed metric can be computed:
:formula_12
using the convention for the Laplace–Beltrami operator. Alternatively,
:formula_13
Under an infinitesimal change of the underlying metric, one has
:formula_14
This shows in particular that the principal symbol of the differential operator which sends a metric to its scalar curvature is given by
:formula_15
Furthermore the adjoint of the linearized scalar curvature operator is
:formula_16
and it is an overdetermined elliptic operator in the case of a Riemannian metric. It is a straightforward consequence of the first variation formulas that, to first order, a Ricci-flat Riemannian metric on a closed manifold cannot be deformed so as to have either positive or negative scalar curvature. Also to first order, an Einstein metric on a closed manifold cannot be deformed under a volume normalization so as to increase or decrease scalar curvature.

==Relation between volume and Riemannian scalar curvature==
When the scalar curvature is positive at a point, the volume of a small geodesic ball about the point has smaller volume than a ball of the same radius in Euclidean space. On the other hand, when the scalar curvature is negative at a point, the volume of a small ball is larger than it would be in Euclidean space.

This can be made more quantitative, in order to characterize the precise value of the scalar curvature &quot;S&quot; at a point &quot;p&quot; of a Riemannian &quot;n&quot;-manifold formula_17. Namely, the ratio of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of a ball of radius ε in the manifold to that of a corresponding ball in Euclidean space is given, for small ε, by
: formula_18

Thus, the second derivative of this ratio, evaluated at radius &quot;ε&quot; = 0, is exactly minus the scalar curvature divided by 3(&quot;n&quot; + 2).

Boundaries of these balls are (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional spheres of radius formula_19; their hypersurface measures (&quot;areas&quot;) satisfy the following equation:

: formula_20

These expansions generalize certain characterizations of Gaussian curvature from dimension two to higher dimensions.

==Special cases==
===Surfaces===
In two dimensions, scalar curvature is exactly twice the Gaussian curvature. For an embedded surface in Euclidean space R3, this means that

:formula_21

where formula_22 are the principal radii of the surface. For example, the scalar curvature of the 2-sphere of radius &quot;r&quot; is equal to 2/&quot;r&quot;2.

The 2-dimensional Riemann curvature tensor has only one independent component, and it can be expressed
in terms of the scalar curvature and metric area form. Namely, in any coordinate system, one has

: formula_23

===Space forms===
A space form is by definition a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature. Space forms are locally isometric to one of the following types:

The scalar curvature is also constant when given a Kähler metric of constant holomorphic sectional curvature.

===Products===
The scalar curvature of a product &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot; of Riemannian manifolds is the sum of the scalar curvatures of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. For example, for any smooth closed manifold &quot;M&quot;, &quot;M&quot; × &quot;S&quot;2 has a metric of positive scalar curvature, simply by taking the 2-sphere to be small compared to &quot;M&quot; (so that its curvature is large). This example might suggest that scalar curvature has little relation to the global geometry of a manifold. In fact, it does have some global significance, as discussed below.

In both mathematics and general relativity, warped product metrics are an important source of examples. For example, the general Robertson–Walker spacetime, important to cosmology, is the Lorentzian metric
:formula_24
on , where is a constant-curvature Riemannian metric on a three-dimensional manifold . The scalar curvature of the Robertson–Walker metric is given by
:formula_25
where is the constant curvature of .

===Scalar-flat spaces===
It is automatic that any Ricci-flat manifold has zero scalar curvature; the best-known spaces in this class are the Calabi–Yau manifolds. In the pseudo-Riemannian context, this also includes the Schwarzschild spacetime and Kerr spacetime.

There are metrics with zero scalar curvature but nonvanishing Ricci curvature. For example, there is a complete Riemannian metric on the tautological line bundle over real projective space, constructed as a warped product metric, which has zero scalar curvature but nonzero Ricci curvature. This may also be viewed as a rotationally symmetric Riemannian metric of zero scalar curvature on the cylinder .

==Yamabe problem==

The &quot;Yamabe problem&quot; was resolved in 1984 by the combination of results found by Hidehiko Yamabe, Neil Trudinger, Thierry Aubin, and Richard Schoen. They proved that every smooth Riemannian metric on a closed manifold can be multiplied by some smooth positive function to obtain a metric with constant scalar curvature. In other words, every Riemannian metric on a closed manifold is conformal to one with constant scalar curvature.

==Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature==
For a closed Riemannian 2-manifold &quot;M&quot;, the scalar curvature has a clear relation to the topology of &quot;M&quot;, expressed by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem: the total scalar curvature of &quot;M&quot; is equal to 4 times the Euler characteristic of &quot;M&quot;. For example, the only closed surfaces with metrics of positive scalar curvature are those with positive Euler characteristic: the sphere &quot;S&quot;2 and RP2. Also, those two surfaces have no metrics with scalar curvature ≤ 0.

===Nonexistence results===
In the 1960s, André Lichnerowicz found that on a spin manifold, the difference between the square of the Dirac operator and the tensor Laplacian (as defined on spinor fields) is given exactly by one-quarter of the scalar curvature. This is a fundamental example of a Weitzenböck formula. As a consequence, if a Riemannian metric on a closed manifold has positive scalar curvature, then there can exist no harmonic spinors. It is then a consequence of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem that, for any closed spin manifold with dimension divisible by four and of positive scalar curvature, the Â genus must vanish. This is a purely topological obstruction to the existence of Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature.

Lichnerowicz&#x27;s argument using the Dirac operator can be &quot;twisted&quot; by an auxiliary vector bundle, with the effect of only introducing one extra term into the Lichnerowicz formula. Then, following the same analysis as above except using the families version of the index theorem and a refined version of the Â genus known as the &quot;α-genus&quot;, Nigel Hitchin proved that in certain dimensions there are exotic spheres which do not have any Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature. Gromov and Lawson later extensively employed these variants of Lichnerowicz&#x27;s work. One of their resulting theorems introduces the homotopy-theoretic notion of &quot;enlargeability&quot; and says that an enlargeable spin manifold cannot have a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. As a corollary, a closed manifold with a Riemannian metric of nonpositive curvature, such as a torus, has no metric with positive scalar curvature. Gromov and Lawson&#x27;s various results on nonexistence of Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature support a conjecture on the vanishing of a wide variety of topological invariants of any closed spin manifold with positive scalar curvature. This (in a precise formulation) in turn would be a special case of the strong Novikov conjecture for the fundamental group, which deals with the K-theory of C*-algebras. This in turn is a special case of the Baum–Connes conjecture for the fundamental group.

In the special case of four-dimensional manifolds, the Seiberg–Witten equations have been usefully applied to the study of scalar curvature. Similarly to Lichnerowicz&#x27;s analysis, the key is an application of the maximum principle to prove that solutions to the Seiberg–Witten equations must be trivial when scalar curvature is positive. Also in analogy to Lichnerowicz&#x27;s work, index theorems can guarantee the existence of nontrivial solutions of the equations. Such analysis provides new criteria for nonexistence of metrics of positive scalar curvature. Claude LeBrun pursued such ideas in a number of papers.

===Existence results===
By contrast to the above nonexistence results, Lawson and Yau constructed Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature from a wide class of nonabelian effective group actions.

Later, Schoen–Yau and Gromov–Lawson (using different techniques) proved the fundamental result that existence of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature is preserved by topological surgery in codimension at least three, and in particular is preserved by the connected sum. This establishes the existence of such metrics on a wide variety of manifolds. For example, it immediately shows that the connected sum of an arbitrary number of copies of spherical space forms and generalized cylinders has a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. Grigori Perelman&#x27;s construction of Ricci flow with surgery has, as an immediate corollary, the converse in the three-dimensional case: a closed orientable 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature must be such a connected sum.

Based upon the surgery allowed by the Gromov–Lawson and Schoen–Yau construction, Gromov and Lawson observed that the h-cobordism theorem and analysis of the cobordism ring can be directly applied. They proved that, in dimension greater than four, any non-spin simply connected closed manifold has a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. Stephan Stolz completed the existence theory for simply-connected closed manifolds in dimension greater than four, showing that as long as the α-genus is zero, then there is a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature.

According to these results, for closed manifolds, the existence of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature is completely settled in the three-dimensional case and in the case of simply-connected manifolds of dimension greater than four.

==Kazdan and Warner&#x27;s trichotomy theorem==
The sign of the scalar curvature has a weaker relation to topology in higher dimensions. Given a smooth closed manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension at least 3, Kazdan and Warner solved the prescribed scalar curvature problem, describing which smooth functions on &quot;M&quot; arise as the scalar curvature of some Riemannian metric on &quot;M&quot;. Namely, &quot;M&quot; must be of exactly one of the following three types:
# Every function on &quot;M&quot; is the scalar curvature of some metric on &quot;M&quot;.
# A function on &quot;M&quot; is the scalar curvature of some metric on &quot;M&quot; if and only if it is either identically zero or negative somewhere.
# A function on &quot;M&quot; is the scalar curvature of some metric on &quot;M&quot; if and only if it is negative somewhere.

Thus every manifold of dimension at least 3 has a metric with negative scalar curvature, in fact of constant negative scalar curvature. Kazdan–Warner&#x27;s result focuses attention on the question of which manifolds have a metric with positive scalar curvature, that being equivalent to property (1). The borderline case (2) can be described as the class of manifolds with a strongly scalar-flat metric, meaning a metric with scalar curvature zero such that &quot;M&quot; has no metric with positive scalar curvature.

Akito Futaki showed that strongly scalar-flat metrics (as defined above) are extremely special. For a simply connected Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension at least 5 which is strongly scalar-flat, &quot;M&quot; must be a product of Riemannian manifolds with holonomy group SU(&quot;n&quot;) (Calabi–Yau manifolds), Sp(&quot;n&quot;) (hyperkähler manifolds), or Spin(7). In particular, these metrics are Ricci-flat, not just scalar-flat. Conversely, there are examples of manifolds with these holonomy groups, such as the K3 surface, which are spin and have nonzero α-invariant, hence are strongly scalar-flat.

<text>In differential geometry, the Gaussian curvature or Gauss curvature of a smooth surface in three-dimensional space at a point is the product of the principal curvatures, and , at the given point:
formula_1
For example, a sphere of radius has Gaussian curvature everywhere, and a flat plane and a cylinder have Gaussian curvature zero everywhere. The Gaussian curvature can also be negative, as in the case of a hyperboloid or the inside of a torus.

Gaussian curvature is an &quot;intrinsic&quot; measure of curvature, meaning that it could in principle be measured by a 2-dimensional being living entirely within the surface, because it depends only on distances that are measured “within” or along the surface, not on the way it is isometrically embedded in Euclidean space. This is the content of the &quot;Theorema egregium&quot;.

Gaussian curvature is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who published the &quot;Theorema egregium&quot; in 1827.

==Informal definition==
At any point on a surface, we can find a normal vector that is at right angles to the surface; planes containing the normal vector are called &quot;normal planes&quot;. The intersection of a normal plane and the surface will form a curve called a &quot;normal section&quot; and the curvature of this curve is the &quot;normal curvature&quot;. For most points on most “smooth” surfaces, different normal sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures, call these , . The Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures .

The sign of the Gaussian curvature can be used to characterise the surface.
*If both principal curvatures are of the same sign: , then the Gaussian curvature is positive and the surface is said to have an elliptic point. At such points, the surface will be dome like, locally lying on one side of its tangent plane. All sectional curvatures will have the same sign. 
*If the principal curvatures have different signs: , then the Gaussian curvature is negative and the surface is said to have a hyperbolic or saddle point. At such points, the surface will be saddle shaped. Because one principal curvature is negative, one is positive, and the normal curvature varies continuously if you rotate a plane orthogonal to the surface around the normal to the surface in two directions, the normal curvatures will be zero giving the asymptotic curves for that point.
*If one of the principal curvatures is zero: , the Gaussian curvature is zero and the surface is said to have a parabolic point.

Most surfaces will contain regions of positive Gaussian curvature (elliptical points) and regions of negative Gaussian curvature separated by a curve of points with zero Gaussian curvature called a parabolic line.

==Relation to geometries==

When a surface has a constant zero Gaussian curvature, then it is a developable surface and the geometry of the surface is Euclidean geometry.

When a surface has a constant positive Gaussian curvature, then the geometry of the surface is spherical geometry. Spheres and patches of spheres have this geometry, but there exist other examples as well, such as the lemon / American football.

When a surface has a constant negative Gaussian curvature, then it is a pseudospherical surface and the geometry of the surface is hyperbolic geometry.

==Relation to principal curvatures==
The two principal curvatures at a given point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions from that point. We represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, , of two variables, in such a way that the point is a critical point, that is, the gradient of vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2×2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between a cup/cap versus a saddle point.

==Alternative definitions==
It is also given by
formula_2
where is the covariant derivative and is the metric tensor.

At a point on a regular surface in , the Gaussian curvature is also given by
formula_3
where is the shape operator.

A useful formula for the Gaussian curvature is Liouville&#x27;s equation in terms of the Laplacian in isothermal coordinates.

==Total curvature==
The surface integral of the Gaussian curvature over some region of a surface is called the total curvature. The total curvature of a geodesic triangle equals the deviation of the sum of its angles from . The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of positive curvature will exceed , while the sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature will be less than . On a surface of zero curvature, such as the Euclidean plane, the angles will sum to precisely radians.

A more general result is the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

==Important theorems==

===&quot;Theorema egregium&quot;===

Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Theorema egregium&quot; (Latin: &quot;remarkable theorem&quot;) states that Gaussian curvature of a surface can be determined from the measurements of length on the surface itself. In fact, it can be found given the full knowledge of the first fundamental form and expressed via the first fundamental form and its partial derivatives of first and second order. Equivalently, the determinant of the second fundamental form of a surface in can be so expressed. The &quot;remarkable&quot;, and surprising, feature of this theorem is that although the &quot;definition&quot; of the Gaussian curvature of a surface in certainly depends on the way in which the surface is located in space, the end result, the Gaussian curvature itself, is determined by the intrinsic metric of the surface without any further reference to the ambient space: it is an intrinsic invariant. In particular, the Gaussian curvature is invariant under isometric deformations of the surface.

In contemporary differential geometry, a &quot;surface&quot;, viewed abstractly, is a two-dimensional differentiable manifold. To connect this point of view with the classical theory of surfaces, such an abstract surface is embedded into and endowed with the Riemannian metric given by the first fundamental form. Suppose that the image of the embedding is a surface in . A &quot;local isometry&quot; is a diffeomorphism between open regions of whose restriction to is an isometry onto its image. &quot;Theorema egregium&quot; is then stated as follows:

For example, the Gaussian curvature of a cylindrical tube is zero, the same as for the &quot;unrolled&quot; tube (which is flat). On the other hand, since a sphere of radius has constant positive curvature and a flat plane has constant curvature 0, these two surfaces are not isometric, not even locally. Thus any planar representation of even a small part of a sphere must distort the distances. Therefore, no cartographic projection is perfect.

===Gauss–Bonnet theorem===

The Gauss–Bonnet theorem relates the total curvature of a surface to its Euler characteristic and provides an important link between local geometric properties and global topological properties.

== Surfaces of constant curvature ==

*Minding&#x27;s theorem (1839) states that all surfaces with the same constant curvature are locally isometric. A consequence of Minding&#x27;s theorem is that any surface whose curvature is identically zero can be constructed by bending some plane region. Such surfaces are called developable surfaces. Minding also raised the question of whether a closed surface with constant positive curvature is necessarily rigid.
*Liebmann&#x27;s theorem (1900) answered Minding&#x27;s question. The only regular (of class ) closed surfaces in with constant positive Gaussian curvature are spheres. If a sphere is deformed, it does not remain a sphere, proving that a sphere is rigid. A standard proof uses Hilbert&#x27;s lemma that non-umbilical points of extreme principal curvature have non-positive Gaussian curvature.
*Hilbert&#x27;s theorem (1901) states that there exists no complete analytic (class ) regular surface in of constant negative Gaussian curvature. In fact, the conclusion also holds for surfaces of class immersed in , but breaks down for -surfaces. The pseudosphere has constant negative Gaussian curvature except at its boundary circle, where the gaussian curvature is not defined.

There are other surfaces which have constant positive Gaussian curvature. Manfredo do Carmo considers surfaces of revolution formula_6 where formula_7, and formula_8 (an incomplete Elliptic integral of the second kind). These surfaces all have constant Gaussian curvature of 1, but, for formula_9 either have a boundary or a singular point. do Carmo also gives three different examples of surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature, one of which is pseudosphere. 

There are many other possible bounded surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature. Whilst the sphere is rigid and can not be bent using an isometry, if a small region removed, or even a cut along a small segment, then the resulting surface can be bent. Such bending preserves Gaussian curvature so any such bending of a sphere with a region removed will also have constant Gaussian curvature.

==Alternative formulas==
*Gaussian curvature of a surface in can be expressed as the ratio of the determinants of the second and first fundamental forms and : formula_10
*The (after Francesco Brioschi) gives Gaussian curvature solely in terms of the first fundamental form: formula_11
*For an &quot;orthogonal parametrization&quot; (), Gaussian curvature is: formula_12
*For a surface described as graph of a function , Gaussian curvature is: formula_13
* For an implicitly defined surface, , the Gaussian curvature can be expressed in terms of the gradient and Hessian matrix : formula_14
* For a surface with metric conformal to the Euclidean one, so and , the Gauss curvature is given by ( being the usual Laplace operator): formula_15
*Gaussian curvature is the limiting difference between the circumference of a &quot;geodesic circle&quot; and a circle in the plane: formula_16
*Gaussian curvature is the limiting difference between the area of a &quot;geodesic disk&quot; and a disk in the plane: formula_17
*Gaussian curvature may be expressed with the &quot;Christoffel symbols&quot;: formula_18

<doc id="285628" wikidata="Q236446" url="?curid=285628" title="Hélène Dutrieu">
<text>Hélène Dutrieu (10 July 1877 – 26 June 1961), was a Belgian cycling world champion, stunt cyclist, stunt motorcyclist, automobile racer, stunt driver, pioneer pilot, wartime ambulance driver, and director of a military hospital.

==Biography==
Hélène Marguerite Dutrieu was born on 10 July 1877 in Tournai, Belgium, the daughter of a Belgian Army officer. The family later moved to Lille in northern France. She left school at the age of 14 to earn a living.

===Cycling success===

Hélène Dutrieu began her cycle racing career inspired by her older brother Eugène– a professional cyclist. She became a professional track cyclist racing for the Simpson lever chain team. In 1893 she gained the women&#x27;s world record for distance cycled in one hour. In 1896 and 1897 she won the women&#x27;s speed track cycling world championship in Ostend, Belgium, but lost her title in 1898 to Louise Roger. In November 1896 she won the &quot;Course de 12 Jours&quot; (12-day race) in the Royal Aquarium, London, England, and in August 1898 she won the &quot;Grand Prix d’Europe&quot; (Grand Prix of Europe). Leopold II of Belgium awarded Dutrieu the Cross of St André with diamonds in honour of her cycling success. She later became a motorcycle and automobile racer.

=== Stuntwoman ===
She began performing in variety shows as a cycling speciality act and in July 1903 she cycled a loop inside a vertical track at the Eldorado in Marseille, France. She also invented her own stunt, &quot;La Flèche Humaine&quot; (&quot;The Human Arrow&quot;), which was a c. 15 m jump with a bicycle. In September 1903 she appeared at l&#x27;Olympia, Paris. She also performed in London (Crystal Palace), Berlin and other main cities. Later, she moved on to motorcycle stunts (La Moto Ailée, Saut dans la Lune), but after a bad crash in Berlin 1904 she had to spend eight months recovering her health.

=== Acting career ===
Hélène Dutrieu had played a small role at the Déjazet theatre in 1903 (she played “&quot;Hélène&quot;” in “&quot;Môssieu le Maire&quot;“ by Gustave Stoskopf). After regaining her health she went back to the theatre playing comedy in 1906–1909. She performed on stages such as Théâtre des Capucines, Théâtre des Mathurins, Porte Saint-Martin and Théâtre Michel.

===Achievements in aviation===
Dutrieu learned to fly using a Santos-Dumont Demoiselle monoplane in early 1910. On 19 April 1910 she reputedly became the first female pilot to fly with a passenger. On 25 November 1910 Dutrieu became the fourth woman in the world, and the first Belgian woman, licensed as an aeroplane pilot, receiving &quot;Aéro-Club de Belgique&quot; (Aero Club of Belgium) licence #27. Her appearances at air shows earned her the nickname the &quot;Girl Hawk&quot;. There was a minor scandal early in her aviation career when it was revealed to the press that she did not wear a corset while flying.

She was also style conscious, wearing the first known high fashion pilot suit, designed by the Paris couturier Bernard et Cie. In September 1910 Dutrieu flew non-stop from Ostend to Bruges, Belgium. From 26 September to 1 October she flew, frequently carrying passengers, at the aviation week in Burton-upon-Trent, England. She was the first woman pilot to stay airborne for more than an hour and on 21 December 1910 she became the first winner of the &quot;Coupe Femina&quot; (Femina Cup) for a non-stop flight of 167km in 2 hours 35 minutes. In 1911 she regained the &quot;Coupe Femina&quot; temporarily with a flight of 254km in 2 hours 58 minutes but that year&#x27;s cup was eventually won by Marie Marvingt. Dutrieu was a member of the Aéroclub féminin la Stella, a women&#x27;s flying club set up by Marie Surcouf in 1909. In September 1911 Dutrieu travelled to the United States with her Farman III biplane. She competed for the women&#x27;s altitude record and the &quot;Rodman-Wanamaker trophy&quot;, subsequently won by Matilde Moisant, at the Nassau Boulevard airfield meeting in Garden City, New York. In the same year Dutrieu beat 14 male pilots to win the &quot;Coppa del Re&quot; (King&#x27;s Cup) in Florence, Italy. In 1912 she became the first woman to pilot a seaplane. Later the same year she won a prize in competition against four other seaplane pilots, including Réne Caudron, at Ouchy-Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1913 Dutrieu became the first woman aviator awarded membership of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; (French Legion of Honour).

===World War I and afterward===
During World War I Dutrieu became an ambulance driver. Général Février put her in charge of the ambulances at Messimi Hospital. She later became the director of Campagne à Val-de Grâce military hospital. After the war she became a journalist. In 1922 she married Pierre Mortier and took French nationality. She later became vice president of the women&#x27;s section of the &quot;Aéro-Club de France&quot; (Aero Club of France). In 1956 she created the &quot;Coupe Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier&quot; (Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier Cup) with a prize of 200,000 francs for the French or Belgian female pilot who made the longest non-stop flight each year.

<text>Marketing warfare strategies represent a type of strategy, used in commerce and marketing, that tries to draw parallels between business and warfare and then applies the principles of military strategy to business situations, with competing firms considered as analogous to sides in a military conflict, and market share considered as analogous to territory in dispute.
This view of marketing argues that in mature, low-growth markets, where real GDP growth is negative or low, commerce operates as a zero-sum game. One participant&#x27;s gain is possible only at another participant&#x27;s expense. Success depends on battling competitors for market share.

==The use of marketing warfare strategies==

Strategy is the organized deployment of resources to achieve specific objectives, something that business and warfare have in common. In the 1980s business strategists realized that there was a vast knowledge base stretching back thousands of years that they had barely examined. They turned to military strategy for guidance. Military strategy books like &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu, &quot;On War&quot; by von Clausewitz, and &quot;The Little Red Book&quot; by Mao Zedong became business classics.

From Sun Tzu they learned the tactical side of military strategy and specific tactical proscriptions. In regard to what business strategists call &quot;first-mover advantage&quot;, Sun Tzu said: &quot;Generally, he who occupies the field of battle first and awaits an enemy is at ease, he who comes later to the scene and rushes into the fight is weary.&quot; From Von Clausewitz they learned the dynamic and unpredictable nature of military strategy. Clausewitz felt that in a situation of and confusion, strategy should be based on flexible principles. Strategy comes not from formulas or rules of engagement, but from adapting to what he called &quot;friction&quot; (minute-by-minute events). From Mao Zedong they learned the principles of guerrilla warfare.

The first major proponents of marketing warfare theories were Philip Kotler and J.B. Quinn. In an early description of business military strategy, Quinn claims that an effective strategy: &quot;first probes and withdraws to determine opponents&#x27; strengths, forces opponents to stretch their commitments, then concentrates resources, attacks a clear exposure, overwhelms a selected market segment, builds a bridgehead in that market, and then regroups and expands from that base to dominate a wider field.&quot;

The main marketing warfare books were
* &quot;Business War Games&quot; by Barrie James, 1985
* &quot;Marketing Warfare&quot; by Al Ries and Jack Trout, 1986
*Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun by Wess Roberts, 1987

By the turn of the century, marketing warfare strategies had gone out of fashion. It was felt that they were limiting. There were many situations in which non-confrontational approaches were more appropriate. &quot;The Strategy of the Dolphin&quot; was developed in the mid-1990s to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. Today, most business strategists stress that considerable synergies and competitive advantages can be gained from collaboration, partnering, and co-operation. They stress how to divide up the market and how to grow the market. Such are the vicissitudes of business theories. Finally, a recent contribution to understanding and using marketing warfare strategies is the visual business war game proposed by S. Goria.

==Marketing warfare strategies==

* Offensive marketing warfare strategies - They are used to secure competitive advantages; market leaders, runners-up or struggling competitors are usually attacked.
* Defensive marketing warfare strategies - They are used to defend competitive advantages; lessen risk of being attacked, decrease effects of attacks, strengthen position.
* Flanking marketing warfare strategies - They operate in areas of little importance to the competitor.
* Guerrilla marketing warfare strategies - Attack, retreat, hide, then do it again, and again, until the competitor moves on to other markets.
* Position defense - This is a strategy which utilizes its current position against the attacking opposition. In a business context, this is a strategy usually applied when a company has a dominant stake in the market place, usually a monopolized and controlled industry. Marketing with this type of strategy can be identified through barriers of entry. This is where a company has fortified its position by having key strongholds in the Marketing segment or brand identity or product familiarity. They may apply these areas through increasing the equity of the brand or repeat purchases other wise known as customer loyalty strategies (Shayne, Milligan. 2012). E.g. Starbucks as a café giant promoted the free wifi connection to protect their market share against the competition that had first applied the concept (Jamie, Burns. 2013).
* Mobile defense - By moving resources and creating new strategies and tactics, the intended goal is to create a moving target that is difficult to attack by the opposition. This also equips the defense to repel any attacks the opposition has in store. The interpretation in business explained by Shayne Milligan is when businesses introduce new products, replacement products, modifying existing products and repositioning products as well as changing the marketing segments, target markets or changing promotional focus. This type of defensive strategy is most likely incorporated by entrepreneurial companies with strong marketing research and marketing skills along with the ability to continuously develop their product line (Shayne Milligan. 2012).
* Flanking position - Re-deploy your resources to discourage any type of flanking attack. This in business terms is developing new products in a marketing segment that you occupy. By expanding resources the business is able to strengthen their hold on the segment under threat (Shayne Milligan. 2012). E.g. Absolut Vodka had found a marketing segment that was leased served. In doing so they were able to capture this market by increasing prices by promoting premium vodka this tackled their competition Smirnoff in a space they did not allocate resources towards. This is known as Flanking marketing compared to the strategy of flanking position this was a successful attack towards the opposition (Jamie Burns. 2013).
* Counter offense - This initially involves counterattacking the opposition that has attacked you. In business context this is where a counterattack is made on the oppositions weakest point (Shayne Milligan. 2012). Pre-emptive attack on any business must have some type of counter re-action this could be a move by the competition into its sales territory, price cutting, promotional blitz or product improvements. When faced with these competitive signs the options can be frontal deployment of resources by strategically developing new products or improving on products. The other option is finding the oppositions weakest point, which in military terms would be attacking the competitions main territory. E.g. Central DuPage, a suburban hospital located in Chicago, had been under invasion by competitors. Primary and urgent care centres had moved into the local suburban area and with the population rising it became and opportunity not just for the Central hospital DuPage but also for their competitors. In order for the local hospital to protect its share in the market it had to develop new physician offices located in under served areas. This was a counter offence by re-positioning themselves they were able to take in patients through their newly allocated offices where the physicians could refer their patients to the Central DuPage hospital (Naresh, K Malhotra. 1988).
* Frontal attack - This strategy is specifically designed to engage the opposition with a head-on frontal assault. This also means using a substantial amount of resources and financial commitment when taking on a competitor with this strategy. From marketing to the production process, all elements are activated when initiating such an abrasive move. Advertising campaigns and new products are usually intensified to take on the competition where they are strongest; this is to weaken their market share and margins by cutting off their leading products and influencing their targeted audience to re-evaluate their loyalty to the brand or product. It is rare to encounter such strategies, as the process is quite expensive and time-consuming; this is also a high-risk venture if the competition has a strong counteroffensive attack, which can leave the attacking opponent open to counterstrikes. With resources already stretched this strategy is not for the faint-hearted. Shayne Milligan explains that this type of strategy is only used when the market space is homogenous, brand equity is low, customer loyalty is low, products are poorly differentiated, the competitor has relatively low resources or the attacker has stronger resources (Shayne Milligan. 2013). E.g. In 2011 the US shopping giant Target had entered the Canadian market with financial investments exceeding 4.4 billion dollars. Part of this initial investment was allocated towards purchasing 220 previously acquired stores of Zellers, a local Canadian merchandising mogul. With almost 10 million being spent on the refurbishing of each store as well as the hiring of 150–200 employees per store, the financial forecast for the Target Corporation was estimated to be around 6 billion per year by the year of 2017. This was not to be the case, as Target&#x27;s initiating year in the Canadian retail market failed to achieve any realistic financial goals. Even though the success of Target&#x27;s US stores were still in effect, the underestimated planning into the Canadian market was due to unforeseen economic variables as well as Canadian loyalty to stores also owned by US parent companies Wal-Mart and Costco, etc. Such competition had put the Target Corporation in a position at risk of making more losses than profits, which would also effect their US-based stores. Taking on Wal-Mart and other foreign and domestic competition has been unsuccessful, but Target continues to move towards dominating some part of the Canadian retail market (2015). 
* Envelopment strategy or encirclement strategy - This strategy is more broadly used as it focuses on subtle offensive attacks. In such cases the introduction of products that are similar to the competitor&#x27;s products are developed to liberate the market share of the opposition&#x27;s product line. When done properly this type of strategy can avoid a full-scale frontal assault. The objective is to find niches in the marketing space rather than the creating of products that directly compete against the competition. It is more of an indirect assault on the oppositions market share. Shayne Milligan suggests this strategy be used when the market is loosely segmented, some segments are free of larger competitors, the attacker has strong product development resources, the attacker has enough resources to operate in multiple segments simultaneously and the attacker has a decentralized organizational structure (Shayne Milligan. 2013). E.g. Republic Health Corporation, which is a chain of health care centers located in Dallas, developed an advertising campaign called “Step Lively”. This was specifically incorporated to focus on pricing, product form, sales promotion and advertising. The strategy was to create incentives through discounted foot examinations and free home meals after hospitalization as well as purchasing gift cards for a new shoe&#x27;s. They focused on one area at a time against competitors while funneling specific treatments for patients into one hospital in each area at a time (Naresh K, Malhotra. 1988). 
* Leapfrog strategy - Bypassing is a less indirect strategy compared to the alternative options. In business terms this can be achieved through technological advancements or creating new segments that have not been developed as of yet (Naresh K, Malhotra. 1988).
* Guerilla - Guerrilla strategies used usually consists of small incremental attacks by using unconventional methods against a larger opposition. In a business context this can most commonly be used by smaller firms on the bigger competition. These are tactically made forms of communications between the consumers influence of the bigger competitors specifically targeting a market segment that is heavily influenced by the competing opposition. They may be short burst attacks through price cuts, supply deterrence, executive raids or a promotional blitz, even legal actions against the competition or negative publicity. But this type of strategy must have some type of disengage tactic, as a full on confrontational assault could be disastrous for a small firm (Naresh K, Malhotra. 1988). E.g. In 2005 a telecommunications company based in Romania had launched itself in already emerging market of mobile phones. They did this by acquiring an already unsuccessful firm but re-branding the company and using the already established networks. Two rival competitors at that time had complete control of the telecommunications sector in Romania. In order for the smaller firm to compete, they had to resort to two marketing warfare tactics: flanking attacks as well as guerrilla strategies. They were able to penetrate two segments, pre-pay and post-pay. By not taking the competition head on through more heavily operated segments of the industry at that time, they were able to find an area that was less productive for the larger telecommunication providers. The small firm was able to increase 95% of their coverage to 82% of their networks distribution area making mobile phone more affordable and assessable to their customer base initially targeting a young audience. This was unexpected by the two larger telecommunications providers even though they still controlled a larger portion of the telecom industry the small firm was able to become a medium-sized competitor within a short period of time (B, G, Cernat. G, L, Constantin. A, Chiciudean. 2008).

Companies typically use many strategies concurrently, some defensive, some offensive, and always some deterrent. According to the business literature of the period, offensive strategies were more important than defensive one. Defensive strategies were used when needed, but an offensive strategy was requisite. Only by offensive strategies, were market gains made. DAt best, defensive strategies could save you from falling too far behind.

The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics, and communications.

<text>The People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), also known as Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) or Mojahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO) (), is an Iranian dissident organization that was armed until 2003 but has since transitioned into a political group. Its headquarters are currently in Albania. The group&#x27;s ideology was influenced by Islam and revolutionary Marxism; and while they denied Marxist influences, their revolutionary reinterpretation of Shia Islam was shaped by the writings of Ali Shariati. After the Iranian Revolution, the MEK opposed the new theocratic Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, seeking to replace it with its own government. At one point the MEK was Iran&#x27;s &quot;largest and most active armed dissident group&quot;, and it is still sometimes presented by Western political backers as a major Iranian opposition group. The MEK is known to be deeply unpopular today within Iran, largely due to its siding with Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War.

The MEK was founded on 5 September 1965 by leftist Iranian students affiliated with the Freedom Movement of Iran to oppose the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The organization contributed to overthrowing the Shah during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It subsequently pursued the establishment of a democracy in Iran, particularly gaining support from Iran&#x27;s middle class intelligentsia. The MEK boycotted the 1979 constitutional referendum, which led to Khomeini barring MEK leader Massoud Rajavi from the 1980 presidential election. On 20 June 1981, the MEK organized a demonstration against Khomeini and against the ousting of President Abolhassan Banisadr and the protest was violently suppressed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which shot into the crowds, killing fifty and injuring hundreds, before later executing 23 further protesters who had been arrested, including teenage girls. On 28 June, the MEK was implicated in the blowing up of the headquarters of the Islamic Republican Party (IRP) in the Hafte Tir bombing, killing 74 officials and party members. A wave of killings and executions led by Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s government followed, part of the 1981–1982 Iran Massacres.

Facing the subsequent repression of the MEK by the IRP, Rajavi fled to Paris. During the exile, the underground network that remained in Iran continued to plan and carry out attacks and it allegedly conducted the August 1981 bombing that killed Iran&#x27;s president and prime minister. In 1983, the MEK began meeting with Iraqi officials. In 1986, France expelled the MEK at the request of Iran, forcing it to relocate to Camp Ashraf in Iraq. In 1987, it founded the &quot;National Liberation Army of Iran&quot; (NLA), with the sole objective of &quot;toppling the Islamic Republic through military force from outside the country.&quot; During the Iran-Iraq War, the MEK then sided with Iraq, taking part in Operation Forty Stars, and Operation Mersad. Following Operation Mersad, Iranian officials ordered the mass execution of prisoners said to support the MEK. The group gained significant publicity in 2002 by announcing the existence of Iranian nuclear facilities. In 2003, the MEK&#x27;s military wing signed a ceasefire agreement with the U.S. and was disarmed at Camp Ashraf.

Between 1997 and 2013, the MEK was on the lists of terrorist organizations of the US, Canada, EU, UK and Japan for various periods. The MEK is designated as a terrorist organization by Iran and Iraq. Critics have described the group as exhibiting traits of a &quot;personality cult&quot;, while its backers describe the group as proponents of &quot;a free and democratic Iran&quot; that could become the next government there.

== History ==

=== Early years (1965–1970) ===
The Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) was founded in 1965 by a group of Tehran University students who had opposed the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the 1950s. They considered the mainstream Liberation Movement too moderate and ineffective, and aimed to establish a socialist state in Iran based on a modern and revolutionary interpretation of Islam that originated from Islamic texts like Nahj al-Balagha and some of Ali Shariati&#x27;s works. MEK founders included Mohammad Hanifnejad, Saeed Mohsen, and Ali Asghar Badiazadegan, and it attracted primarily young, well-educated Iranians. While MEK publications were banned in Iran, in its first five years, the group primarily engaged in ideological work. 

===Schism (1970–1978)===

During the 1970s, the MEK carried out a series of attacks against the Iranian and Western targets and tried to kidnap the U.S. Ambassador to Iran Douglas MacArthur II in 1970. Some sources attribute the attempted kidnap to other groups. 

By August 1971, the MEK&#x27;s Central Committee included Reza Rezai, Kazem Zolanvar, and Brahram Aram. 1971-1972 arrests and executions by the Shah&#x27;s security services, also infighting within the organization &quot;practically shattered the organization&quot;. During August–September 1971, SAVAK managed to strike arrested and executed many members of MEK including its co-founders. Some surviving members restructured the group by replacing the central cadre with a three-man central committee. Each of the three central committee members led a separate branch of the organization. Two of the original central committee members were replaced in 1972 and 1973, and the replacing members were in charge of leading the organization until the internal purge of 1975.

By 1973, MEK members that declared themselves Marxist–Leninist launched an &quot;internal ideological struggle&quot;, and by 1975 two opposing MEK factions had formed, one being Muslim and the other Marxist. The Marxist faction asserted that &quot;they had reached the conclusion that Marxism, not Islam, was the true revolutionary philosophy&quot;. Members who did not convert to Marxism were expelled or reported to SAVAK. 
This led to two rival Mojahedin, each with its own publication, its own organization, and its own activities. The Marxist faction was initially known as the Mojahedin M.L. (Marxist–Leninist). A few months before the Iranian Revolution, the majority of the Marxist Mojahedin renamed themselves Peykar (Organization of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class) in 1978. From 1973 to 1979, the Muslim MEK including Massoud Rajavi were mainly in prisons.
&quot;Rajavi, upon release from prison during the revolution, had to rebuild the organization&quot;.

Between 1973 and 1975, the Marxist–Leninist MEK increased their armed operations in Iran. In 1973, they engaged in two street battles with Tehran police and bombed ten buildings including Plan Organization, Pan-American Airlines, Shell Oil Company, Hotel International, Radio City Cinema, and an export company owned by a Baháʼí businessman. In February 1974, they attacked a police station in Isfahan and in April, they bombed a reception hall, Oman Bank, gates of the British embassy, and offices of Pan-American Oil company in protest of the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s state visit. A communiqué by the organization declared that their actions had been to show solidarity with the people of Dhofar. On 19 April 1974, they attempted to bomb the SAVAK centre at Tehran University. On 25 May, they set off bombs at three multinational corporations.
Also Lt. Col. Louis Lee Hawkins, a U.S. Army comptroller, was shot dead in Tehran by MEK assailants in 1973. Leading up to the Islamic Revolution, members of the MEK conducted attacks and assassinations against both Iranian and Western targets. In May 1972, an attack on Brig. Gen. Harold Price was attributed to the MEK.
According to George Cave, MEK hit squad members also attacked Harold Price and disabled him for the rest of his life.
These assassinations were carried out either by the Marxist or Islamist branch of the MEK.

In August 1976, a car carrying three American employees of Rockwell International - William Cottrell, Donald Smith, and Robert Krongard - was attacked, resulting in their deaths. While some sources suggest the MEK was responsible, the Marxist opposing branch, which at the time had retained the organization&#x27;s name, claimed responsibility for the killings in their &quot;Military Communique No.24&quot;, concluding that the murders were in retaliation for recent death sentences.

===1979 Iranian Revolution and subsequent power struggles===

The group supported the revolution in its initial phases, and became &quot;a major force in Iranian politics&quot; according to Ervand Abrahamian. Although it soon entered into conflict with Khomeini, and became a leading opposition to the new theocratic regime. By early 1979, the MEK had organized themselves and recreated armed cells, especially in Tehran and helped overthrow the Pahlavi regime.
In January 1979, Massoud Rajavi was released from prison and rebuilt the MEK together with other members that had been imprisoned. Also in January 1979 the MEK released a program advocating for increased rights for ethnic minorities in Iran, the introduction of welfare-state policies, and gender equality; while the Khomeini regime perceived these demands as a threat. 

Its candidate for the head of the newly founded council of experts was Massoud Rajavi in the referendum of August 1979. He was not elected. The MEK further launched an unsuccessful campaign supporting total abolition of Iran&#x27;s standing military, the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, in order to prevent a coup d&#x27;état against the system. They also claimed credit for infiltration against the Nojeh coup plot. 
The MEK was one of the supporters of the occupation of the American embassy in Tehran after the Iranian revolution although MEK has denied it.

The MEK refused to participate in the December 1979 Iranian constitutional referendum organized by the Islamic Republican Party to ratify the Constitution drafted by the Assembly of Experts, arguing that the new constitution had failed in many aspects &quot;most important of all, accept the concept of the &#x27;classless tawhidi society&#x27;&quot;. Despite the opposition, the 3 December 1979 referendum vote approved the new constitution. Once the constitution had been ratified, the MEK proposed Rajavi as their presidential candidate. In his campaign, Rajavi promised to rectify the constitution&#x27;s shortcomings. The conflict surrounding the Constitution intensified when the Assembly of Experts added numerous clauses that transferred sovereignty from the Iranian population to the ulama, shifting the power to senior clerics and away from the president and elected representatives. In the years that followed, the clerics strengthened their grip on the republic, eventually gaining control over all branches of government and fully establishing a theocratic state. As a result of the boycott, Khomeini subsequently refused to allow Massoud Rajavi and MEK members to run in the 1980 Iranian presidential election. Khomeini declared that &quot;those who had failed to endorse the Constitution could not be trusted to abide by that Constitution&quot;. In the March and April 1980 parliamentary elections, the MEK secured the second-highest number of votes. Massoud Rajavi garnered 500,000 votes, while his wife Maryam received over 250,000. However, Khomeini restricted both of them from entering the parliament (Majles). Rajavi then allied with Iran&#x27;s new president, Abolhassan Banisadr, elected in January 1980.

===Cultural revolution, Iranian protests, and subsequent oppression (1980–1981)===
On June 14, 1980, Ayatollah Khomeini initiated an order aimed to &quot;purify&quot; higher education by removing Western, liberal, and leftist elements, leading to the closure of universities, the banning of student unions, and violent occupations of campuses. Following the 1979 revolution, the MEK started to gain popularity among university students. During the Cultural Revolution in Iran, clerics imposed policies to Islamize Iranian society, including the expulsion of critical academics, the suppression of secular political groups, and the persecution of intellectuals and artists. These measures sparked large-scale protests across the country. 

On the final day of the elections, Rajavi met with President Abolhassan Banisadr, complaining that the IRP and its Hezbollah supporters were systematically intimidating voters, disrupting rallies, assaulting campaign workers, and setting ballot boxes on fire. The MEK then arrived at two key conclusions: first, that they had enough popular backing to serve as an opposition to the IRP; and second, that the IRP would not allow them to operate as an opposition. The group began clashing with the ruling Islamic Republican Party while avoiding direct and open criticism of Khomeini. The MEK was in turn suppressed by Khomeini&#x27;s revolutionary organizations.

In response to the widely disputed impeachment of President Banisadr, the MEK organized a large-scale protest against Khomeini on June 20, 1981, intending to topple the regime. Big crowds gathered in various cities, with the Tehran protest alone attracting up to 500,000 people. Leading clerics proclaimed that demonstrators would be considered &quot;enemies of God&quot; and face immediate execution regardless of age. This marked the beginning of the 1981–1982 Iran Massacres led by the Islamic government. In the area around Tehran University, 50 people were killed, 200 wounded, and 1,000 taken into custody, surpassing the intensity of most street battles during the Islamic Revolution. 23 demonstrators were also executed by firing squads, with teenage girls among those executed. From June 24 to 27, the regime executed an additional 50 people. The reported number of executions increased to &quot;600 by September, 1700 by October, and 2500 by December.&quot; Initially, the regime publicly displayed the bodies and took pride in declaring the execution of entire families, &quot;including teenage daughters and 60-year-old grandmothers.&quot; The MEK responded by declaring war against the Government of Islamic Republic of Iran, and initiating a series of bombings and assassinations targeting the clerical leadership. 

In September 1980 during Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Iran, the MEK stepped up to fight for their country despite its strained relationship with Khomeini&#x27;s government. Thousands of MEK members joined the front lines.

==== Hafte Tir bombing ====
On June 28 1981, the Islamic Republican Party headquarters was bombed in the Hafte Tir bombing, which killed 74 party officials and other party members, including Mohammad Beheshti, the party&#x27;s secretary-general and Chief Justice of Iran, 4 cabinet ministers, 10 vice ministers and 27 members of the Parliament of Iran. Iranian officials initially blamed various groups including the Iraqi government, SAVAK, and the United States. Two days after the incident Ruhollah Khomeini accused the MEK. In the years that followed, others were also held accountable, including a man named Mehdi Tafari executed by a Tehran tribunal for his alleged involvement. Kenneth Katzman notes there is much speculation among academics and observers that the bombings could have been orchestrated by top IRP officials as a strategy to eliminate political opponents within the government. According to the United States Department of State, in addition to other sources, the bombing was carried out by the MEK. Ervand Abrahamian argues that whatever the truth may be, the Islamic Republic used this incident to fight the MEK. The MEK declared that the bombing was a &quot;natural and necessary reaction to the regime&#x27;s atrocities&quot;, and it never claimed responsibility for the attack.

==== Open conflict with the Islamic Republican Party ====

In July 1981, the MEK then formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) with the stated goal of uniting the opposition to the Iranian government under one umbrella organization. 
Rajavi assumed the position of chairman of the organization.
On 30 August 1981, they bombed the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, killing the elected President Rajai and Premier Mohammad Javad Bahonar. Iranian authorities announced that Massoud Keshmiri, an MEK member was probably responsible. 
The reaction to the Hafte Tir bombing and the bombing of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office was intense, with many arrests and executions of Mojahedin. 
The MEK responded by targeting key Iranian official figures for assassination, as well as attacking low-ranking civil servants and members of the Revolutionary Guards, along with ordinary citizens who supported the new government.

Between June 1981 and April 1982, around 3500 MEK members were either executed or killed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Another 5000 MEK prisoners were detained in camps, and another 8000 were imprisoned for charges such as possessing copies of Mujahid newspaper. During the same period the MEK was responsible for about 65 percent of nearly 1,000 Khomeini officials killed. From 26 August 1981 to December 1982, the MEK orchestrated 336 attacks against Khomeini officials. In July 1982, 13 IRGC members and Mohammad Sadoughi
were killed by MEK members.

===Exile and underground opposition activity (1982–1988) ===
In 1982, the Islamic Republic cracked down MEK operations within Iran.
On 8 February Mousa Khiabani, Rajavi&#x27;s deputy and the MEK&#x27;s field commander in Iran was killed following a three hour gunfight at a North Tehran safehouse. Alongside him died his wife Azar Rezaei, Ashraf Rabiei, Rajavi&#x27;s first wife and six others. Rajavi&#x27;s son Mostafa survived and was later sent to Paris. The MEK stressed the significance of ideology, which was shaped by its interpretation of what was missing in Iran at the time such as lack of freedom and human rights limitations by the Islamic Republic. The majority of the MEK leadership and members fled to France, where it operated until 1985. In 1983, the MEK started an alliance with Iraq following a meeting between Massoud Rajavi and Tariq Aziz. 

In 1986, after French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac struck a deal with Tehran for the release of French hostages held prisoners by the Hezbollah in Lebanon. Also in June 1986, the Islamic Republic &quot;won another major victory in its campaign to isolate the Mojahedin&quot; by persuading the French government to close down the MEK headquarters in Paris. This improved relations between France and Iran. During this period other European nations declined to offer political asylum to the group. With no alternative available and a desire to maintain the group&#x27;s cohesion, they ultimately decided to relocate to Iraq. James Piazza contends that the MEK&#x27;s expulsion from France and relocation to Iraq is a &quot;crucial episode&quot; in the group&#x27;s exile, as it appears Khomeini aimed to send the MEK to a remote place. However, the group ended up in a location that enabled it to continue its cross-border attacks. MEK representatives contend that their organization had little alternative to moving to Iraq considering its aim of toppling the Iranian clerical government. By 1987, most MEK leaders were based in Iraq, where the group remained until the 2003 US invasion. According to the US State Department, the MEK was mainly supported by Iraq during that period and was fighting on the Iraqi side in the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War.

From 1982 to 1988, despite the mounting casualties on both sides, the lingering underground presence of the MEK in Iran remained operational and went on to perform an average of sixty operations per week, resulting in assassinations of important Khomeini deputies. 
The MEK came to be considered Iran&#x27;s &quot;largest and most active Iranian exile organization&quot;, and its publications were commonly circulated within the Iranian diaspora.

==== Operations Shining sun, Forty Stars, and Mersad ====


The MEK&#x27;s official argument for moving to Iraq was that it would place them geographically close to their enemy, the Islamic Republic government in Iran. In 1987 Masoud Rajavi declared the establishment of the &quot;National Liberation Army of Iran&quot; (NLA). It served as an infantry force that included different militant groups members of the NCRI, and its sole objective was to &quot;overthrow the Islamic Republic using a military force outside the country.&quot; Through a broadcast on Baghdad radio, the MEK extended an invitation to all progressive-nationalist Iranian individuals to join the NLA in overthrowing the government of the Islamic Republic. 

On 27 March 1988, the NLA launched its first military offensive against the Islamic Republic&#x27;s armed forces. The NLA captured 600 square-kilometres of Islamic Republic territory and 508 soldiers from the Iranian 77th infantry division in Khuzestan Province. 
The operation was named &quot;Shining Sun&quot; 
(or &quot;Operation Bright Sun&quot;) in which according to Massoud Rajavi, 2000 soldiers of the Islamic Republic were killed and $100 million worth of equipment was captured and exhibited for journalists.

Operation Forty Stars was launched on June 18, 1988. With 530 aircraft sorties and heavy use of nerve gas, they attacked to the Iranian forces in the area around Mehran, killing or wounding 3,500 and nearly destroying a Revolutionary Guard division. The forces captured the city and took positions in the heights near Mehran, coming close to wiping the whole Iranian Pasdaran division and taking most of its equipment.
While some sources claim that Iraq participated in the operation, the MEK and Baghdad said Iraqi soldiers did not take part.

Near the end of the Iran–Iraq War, a military force of 7,000 members of the MEK, armed and equipped by Saddam&#x27;s Iraq and calling itself the National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA) was founded. 
On 26 July 1988, six days after Ayatollah Khomeini had announced his acceptance of the UN-brokered ceasefire resolution, the NLA advanced under heavy Iraqi air cover, crossing the Iranian border from Iraq.
It seized the Iranian town of Islamabad-e Gharb. As it advanced further into Iran, Iraq ceased its air support and Iranian forces cut off NLA supply lines and counterattacked under cover of fighter planes and helicopter gunships. The MEK claims it lost 1,400 dead or missing and the Islamic Republic sustained 55,000 casualties. It claims to have killed 4,500 NLA during the operation. 
The operation was called &quot;Foroughe Javidan&quot; (Eternal Light) by the MEK and the counterattack Operation Mersad by the Iranian forces. Rajavi later stated that &quot;the failure of Eternal Light was not a military blunder, but was instead rooted in the members&#x27; thoughts for their spouses&quot;.

==== 1988 execution of MEK prisoners ====

Following the MEK&#x27;s Operation Mersad against Iranian forces, thousands of imprisoned members of the MEK, along with members of other leftist opposition groups, were executed. The Iranian government used the MEK&#x27;s failed invasion as a pretext for the mass execution of those &quot;who remained steadfast in their support for the MEK&quot; and other jailed opposition group members.

On 19 July 1988, the authorities isolated major prisons, having its courts of law go on an unscheduled holiday to prevent relatives from inquiring about those imprisoned, and as Ervand Abrahamian notes, &quot;thus began an act of violence unprecedented in Iranian history&quot;. Prisoners were asked if they were willing to denounce the MEK before cameras, help the IRI hunt down MEK members and name secret sympathizers. Those who gave unsatisfactory answers were promptly taken away and hanged. Human rights groups say that the number of those executed remains uncertain, but &quot;thousands of political dissidents were systematically subjected to enforced disappearance in Iranian detention facilities across the country&quot;, with those executed charged with &quot;moharebeh&quot; or &quot;waging war on God&quot;, and of &quot;disclosing state secrets&quot; and threatening national security&quot;. Since the executions, Amnesty International has stated that &quot;there has also been an ongoing campaign by the Islamic Republic to demonize victims, distort facts, and repress family survivors and human rights defenders.&quot;

According to Professor Cheryl Bernard, the mass execution of political prisoners carried out by the Islamic Republic in 1981 caused the MEK to split into four groups: those that were arrested, imprisoned or executed, a group that went underground in Iran, another that left to Kurdistan and a final group that left to other countries abroad. By the end of 1981, the principal refuge for many exiled members of the MEK had become France.

=== Post-war Saddam era (1988–2003) ===
The Iranian government is believed to be concerned about MEK activities in Iran, and MEK supporters are a major target of Iran&#x27;s internal security apparatus abroad and it is said to be responsible for killing MEK members, Kazem Rajavi on 24 April 1990 and Mohammad-Hossein Naghdi, a NCRI representative on 6 March 1993. In 1991 the MEK was accused of helping the Iraqi Republican Guard suppress Shiite and Kurdish nationwide uprisings, a claim the MEK has consistently denied. Ervand Abrahamian suggests that one motivation for the MEK&#x27;s opposition to the clerical regime was its infringement on the rights of national minorities, especially the Kurds.

In April 1992, the MEK attacked 10 Iranian embassies including the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York using different weapons, taking hostages, and injuring Iranian ambassadors and embassy employees. There were dozens of arrests. According to MEK representatives, the attacks were a way to protest the bombing of a MEK military base where several people had been killed and wounded.

In June 1998 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said that he received &quot;anonymous threats of disruption from Iranian exiles&quot; for the 1998 FIFA World Cup match between Iran and the U.S. football teams at Stade de Gerland. The MEK bought some 7,000 out of 42,000 tickets for the match between, in order to promote themselves with the political banners they smuggled. The plan was ultimately foiled with TV cameras avoiding filming them, and intelligence sources having been tipped off about a potential pitch invasion. To prevent an interruption in the match, extra security entered Stade Gerland.

In 1999, after a 2 1⁄2-year investigation, Federal authorities arrested 29 individuals in Operation Eastern Approach, of whom 15 were held on charges of helping MEK members illegally enter the United States. The ringleader pled guilty to providing phony documents to MEK members and to violations of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
In 2002 the NCRI publicly called or the formation of a National Solidarity Front to help overthrow Islamic Republic of Iran.

==== 2003 French arrests ====
In June 2003, French police raided the MEK&#x27;s properties, including its base in Auvers-sur-Oise, under the orders of anti-terrorist magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière, after suspicions that it was trying to shift its base of operations there. 160 suspected MEK members were then arrested, including Maryam Rajavi and her brother Saleh Rajavi. After questioning, most of those detained were released, but 24 members, including Maryam Rajavi, were kept in detention.

In response, 40 supporters began hunger strikes to protest the arrests, and 10 members including Neda Hassani, immolated themselves in various European capitals. French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy declared that the MEK &quot;recently wanted to make France its support base, notably after the intervention in Iraq&quot;, while Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, head of France&#x27;s domestic intelligence service, claimed that the group was &quot;transforming its Val d&#x27;Oise centre [near Paris] [...] into an international terrorist base&quot;. Police found $1.3 million in $100 bills in cash in their offices.

U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on South Asia, then accused the French of doing &quot;the Iranian government&#x27;s dirty work&quot;. Along with other members of Congress, he wrote a letter of protest to President Jacques Chirac, while longtime MEK supporters such as Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas, criticized Maryam Radjavi&#x27;s arrest.
A court later found that there were no grounds for terrorism or terrorism-related finance charges. In 2014, prosecuting judges also dropped all charges of money laundering and fraud.

=== Post-U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003–2016) ===
In May 2003, during the Iraq War, the Coalition forces bombed MEK bases and forced them to surrender. 
This resulted in at least 50 deaths. The US forces disarmed Camp Ashraf residents.
In the operation, the U.S. reportedly captured 6,000 MEK soldiers and over 2,000 pieces of military equipment, including 19 British-made Chieftain tanks. 
Following the occupation the U.S. did not hand over MEK fighters to Iran.
The group&#x27;s core members were for many years effectively confined to Camp Ashraf, before later being relocated to a former U.S. military base, Camp Liberty, in Iraq. 
Then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney argued that the MEK should be used against Iran.
They were then placed under the guard of the U.S. Military. Defectors from the MEK requested assistance from the Coalition forces, who created a &quot;temporary internment and protection facility&quot; for them. In the first year these numbered &quot;several hundred&quot;, mainly Iranian soldiers captured in the Iran-Iraq war and other Iranians lured to the MEK. In all, during the period of US control, nearly 600 members of the MEK defected.

In June 2004, Donald Rumsfeld designated the MeK as protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention. and signed a formal ceasefire agreement.
Since 2009, when the Iraqi government became openly hostile to MEK, the U.S. led efforts to get the group&#x27;s members out of Iraq. After it was no longer designated as a terrorist group, the US was able to convince Albania to accept the remaining 2,700 members who were brought to Tirana between 2014 and 2016.

Separate to events in Iraq, the organization launched a free-to-air satellite television network named &quot;Vision of Freedom&quot; (Sima-ye-Azadi) in England in 2003. It previously operated &quot;Vision of Resistance&quot; analogue television in Iraq in the 1990s, accessible in western provinces of Iran. They also had a radio station, &quot;Radio Iran Zamin&quot;, that was closed down in June 1998.
In 2006, an EU freeze on the group&#x27;s funds was overturned by the European Court of First Instance.
In 2010 and 2011 Ali Saremi, Mohammad Ali Haj Aghaei and Jafar Kazemi were executed by the Iranian government for co-operating with the MEK.

==== Iraqi government&#x27;s crackdown (2009–2013) ====
In 2009 American troops gave the Iraqi government responsibility of the MEK. Iraqi authorities, which were sympathetic to Iran, allowed Iran-linked militias to attack the MEK. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced that the militant group would not be allowed to base its operations from Iraqi soil. On 23 January 2009, while on a visit to Tehran, Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie reiterated the Iraqi Prime Minister&#x27;s earlier announcement that the MEK organization would no longer be able to base itself on Iraqi soil and stated that the members of the organization would have to make a choice, either to go back to Iran or to go to a third country, adding that these measures would be implemented over the next two months.

On 28 July 2009, Iraqi security forces raided MEK headquarters at Camp Ashraf. MEK claimed 11 dead and 400 injured in clashes while the Iraqi government claimed 30 policemen injured. U.S. officials had long opposed a violent takeover of the camp northeast of Baghdad, and the raid is thought to symbolize the declining American influence in Iraq. After the raid, the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, stated the issue was &quot;completely within [the Iraqi government&#x27;s] purview&quot;. In the course of attack, 36 Iranian dissidents were arrested and removed from the camp to a prison in a town named Khalis, where the arrestees went on hunger strike for 72 days. Finally, the dissidents were released when they were in an extremely critical condition and on the verge of death.

In January 2010, Iranian authorities charged five MEK protesters of &quot;rioting and arson&quot; under the crime of &quot;moharebeh&quot;, an offence reserved for those who &quot;take up arms against the state&quot; and carries the death penalty. In July 2010, the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal issued an arrest warrant for 39 MEK members, including Massoud and Maryam Rajavi, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The MEK denied the charges.

In 2012, the MEK moved from Camp Ashraf to Camp Hurriya in Baghdad (a onetime U.S. base formerly known as Camp Liberty). A rocket and mortar attack killed 5 and injured 50 others at Camp Hurriya on 9 February 2013. MEK residents of the facility and their representatives appealed to the UN Secretary-General and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they said has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection. The United States has been working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on the resettlement project.

In 2013, 52 unarmed MEK members were killed during an attack on Camp Ashraf. 7 other members were also reported missing. Iraqi security forces are thought to be responsible for the assault, with guidance and support from the Iranian government.

==== Iran&#x27;s nuclear programme ====

The MEK and the NCRI revealed the existence of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program in a press conference held on 14 August 2002 in Washington, D.C. MEK representative Alireza Jafarzadeh stated that Iran is running two top-secret projects, one in the city of Natanz and another in a facility located in Arak, which was later confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Journalists Seymour Hersh and Connie Bruck have written that the information was given to the MEK by Israel. Among others, it was described by a senior IAEA official and a monarchist advisor to Reza Pahlavi, who said before MEK they were offered to reveal the information, but they refused because it would be seen negatively by the people of Iran. Similar accounts could be found elsewhere by others, including comments made by US officials.

On 18 November 2004, MEK representative Mohammad Mohaddessin used satellite images to state that a new facility existed in northeast Tehran named &quot;Center for the Development of Advanced Defence Technology&quot;. This allegation by MEK and all their subsequent allegations were false.

In 2010 the NCRI claimed to have uncovered a secret nuclear facility in Iran. These claims were dismissed by U.S. officials, who did not believe the facilities to be nuclear. In 2013, the NCRI again claimed to have discovered a secret underground nuclear site.

In 2012, NBC News&#x27; Richard Engel and Robert Windrem published a report quoting U.S. officials, who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity, that the MEK was being &quot;financed, trained, and armed by Israel&#x27;s secret service&quot; to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists. A senior U.S. State Department official said the Department never claimed that the MEK was involved in the assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. Former CIA case officer in the Middle East, Robert Baer said that the perpetrators &quot;could only be Israel&quot;, and that &quot;it is quite likely Israel is acting in tandem with&quot; the MEK.

On 27 November 2020, Iran&#x27;s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was assassinated. Iranian Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, who heads the Supreme National Security Council, blamed Mujahideen-e-Khalq and Israel.

=== Settlement in Albania (2016–present) ===
In 2016, the United States brokered a deal to relocate the MEK to Albania. About 3,000 members moved to Albania, and the U.S. donated $20 million to the U.N. refugee agency to help them resettle. On 9 September 2016, more than 280 remaining MEK members were relocated to Albania. Camp Ashraf 3 is located in Manëz, Durrës County, where they have been protested by the locals.

====Relationship during Trump presidency====
In 2017, the year before John Bolton became President Trump&#x27;s National Security Adviser, Bolton addressed members of the MEK and said that they would celebrate in Tehran before 2019. By 2018, operatives of the MEK were believed to be still conducting covert operations inside Iran to overthrow Iran&#x27;s government. It also maintained some operations in France, and in January 2018, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani phoned French president Emmanuel Macron, asking him to order kicking the MEK out of its base in Auvers-sur-Oise, alleging that the MEK stirred up the 2017–18 Iranian protests.
By 2018, over 4,000 MEK members had entered Albania, according to the INSTAT data.

On 30 June 2018, Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer, lectured an MEK gathering in Paris, calling for regime change in Tehran. John McCain and John Bolton have met the MEK&#x27;s leader Maryam Rajavi or spoken at its rallies.
During the Free Iran 2019 conference in Albania, Rudy Giuliani attended an MEK podium, where the former New York City mayor described the group as a &quot;government-in-exile&quot;, saying it is a ready-to-go alternative to lead the country if the Iranian government falls. Additionally, the Trump administration said it would not rule out the MEK as a viable replacement for the current Iranian regime.

==== Islamic Republic of Iran operations against MEK inside Europe ====

On 30 June 2018 Belgian police arrested married couple of Iranian heritage Amir Saadouni and Nasimeh Naami on charges of &quot;attempted terrorist murder and preparing a terrorist act&quot; against an MEK rally in France. The couple had in their possession half of a kilogram of TATP explosives and a detonator. Police also detained Asadollah Asadi, an Iranian diplomat in Vienna. German prosecutors charged Asadi with &quot;activity as foreign agent and conspiracy to commit murder by contacting the couple and giving them a device containing 500 grams of TATP&quot;. Prosecutors said Asadi was a member of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security service, an organization that focuses on &quot;combating of opposition groups inside and outside of Iran&quot;. Iran responded that the arrests were a &quot;false flag ploy&quot;, with the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman saying the &quot;two suspects in Belgium were in fact members of the People&#x27;s Mujahideen&quot;. In October 2018, the French government officially and publicly blamed Iran&#x27;s Intelligence Service for the failed attack against the MEK. U.S. officials also condemned Iran over the foiled bomb plot that France blames on Tehran. In December 2018, Albania expelled two Iranian diplomats due to alleged involvement in the bomb plot against the MEK (where Mayor Giuliani and other US government officials were also gathered) accusing the two of &quot;violating their diplomatic status&quot;. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that the MEK incited violence during the 2017–2018 Iranian protests.

In October 2019, Albanian police discovered an Iranian paramilitary network that allegedly planned attacks against MEK members in Albania. Albania&#x27;s police chief, Ardi Veliu, said that the Iran Revolutionary Guard&#x27;s foreign wing operated an &quot;active terrorist cell&quot; that targeted members of the MEK. A police statement said that two Iranian security officials led the network from Tehran, and that it was allegedly linked to organised crime groups in Turkey. It also said that the network used a former MEK member to collect information in Albania. Valiu also said that a planned attack on the MEK by Iranian government agents was foiled in March.

In 2020, newspaper &quot;De Standaard&quot; said evidence that Iranian intelligence and security was involved in the failed 2018 bomb plot against an MEK rally was mounting. In a note to the federal prosecutor&#x27;s office, the State Security writes that &quot;the attack was devised in the name and under the impetus of Iran&quot;, with the note also describing one of the case&#x27;s suspects, Asadollah Asadi, as a MOIS agent. Amir Saadouni and Nasimeh Naami, who in 2018 were found with half a kilo of explosives and are also being charged in the case, admitted that they had been in contact with Asadollah Asadi. In October 2020, the Iranian diplomat Asadollah Asadi charged in Belgium with planning to bomb a rally by the MEK &quot;warned authorities of possible retaliation by unidentified groups if he is found guilty&quot;. Asadi would become the first Iranian diplomat to go on trial on charges of terrorism within the European Union. In February 2021, Asadi and his accomplices were found guilty of attempted terrorism and Asadi was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

In September 2022, Albania suffered a second cyber-attack, resulting in it cutting diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic and ordering Iranian embassy staff to leave. According to the FBI and CISA, the cyberattacks were motivated by Albania&#x27;s hosting of the MEK.

== Ideology ==
=== Before the revolution ===

In the 1960&#x27;s the MEK created a series of pamphlets designed to outline their worldviews. Their work &quot;The Portrait of a Muslim&quot; is thought to be the &quot;first book in Persian&quot; to systematically interpret &quot;early Shiism as a protest movement against class exploitation and state oppression.&quot; The group&#x27;s early ideology asserted that science, reason, and modernity were compatible with Islam. They adopted the concept of class struggle from Karl Marx but rejected being labeled as Marxists or socialists as they believed in the spiritual dimension of human beings, a concept incompatible with Marxist philosophy. During this period, the MEK&#x27;s ideology embraced class struggle and historical determinism but rejected the denial of God.

According to Katzman, the MEK&#x27;s early ideology is a matter of dispute. While scholars generally describe the MEK&#x27;s ideology as an attempt to combine &quot;Islam with revolutionary Marxism&quot;, today the organization claims that it has always emphasized Islam, and that Marxism and Islam are incompatible. Despite their Marxist influence, the group never used the terms &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;communist&quot; to describe themselves. Katzman writes that their ideology &quot;espoused the creation of a classless society that would combat world imperialism, international Zionism, colonialism, exploitation, racism, and multinational corporations&quot;. The MEK&#x27;s ideological foundation was developed during the period of the Iran revolution. According to its official history, the MEK first defined itself as a group that wanted to establish a nationalist, democratic, revolutionary Muslim organization in favour of change in Iran.

Historian Ervand Abrahamian observed that the MEK were &quot;consciously influenced by Marxism, both modern and classical&quot;, but they always denied being Marxists because they were aware that the term was colloquial to &#x27;atheistic materialism&#x27; among Iran&#x27;s general public. The Iranian regime for the same reason was &quot;eager to pin on the Mojahedin the labels of Islamic-Marxists and Marxist-Muslims&quot;.

According to Abrahamian, it was the first Iranian organization to develop systematically a modern revolutionary interpretation of Islam that &quot;differed sharply from both the old conservative Islam of the traditional clergy and the new populist version formulated in the 1970s by Ayatollah Khomeini and his disciples&quot;. Abrahamian said that the MEK&#x27;s early ideology constituted a &quot;combination of Muslim themes; Shii notions of martyrdom; classical Marxist theories of class struggle and historical determinism; and neo-Marxist concepts of armed struggle, guerilla warfare and revolutionary heroism&quot;. According to James Piazza, the MEK worked towards the creation by armed popular struggle of a society in which ethnic, gender, or class discrimination would be obliterated.

Nasser Sadegh told military tribunals that although the MEK respected Marxism as a &quot;progressive method of social analysis, they could not accept materialism, which was contrary to their Islamic ideology&quot;. The MEK eventually had a falling out with Marxist groups. According to Sepehr Zabir, &quot;they soon became Enemy No. 1 of both pro-Soviet Marxist groups, the Tudeh and the Majority Fedayeen.&quot;

The MEK&#x27;s ideology of revolutionary Shi&#x27;ism is based on an interpretation of Islam so similar to that of Ali Shariati that &quot;many concluded&quot; they were inspired by him. According to Ervand Abrahamian, it is clear that &quot;in later years&quot; that Shariati and &quot;his prolific works&quot; had &quot;indirectly helped the Mujahedin&quot;.

In the group&#x27;s &quot;first major ideological work&quot;, &quot;Nahzat-i Husseini&quot; or Hussein&#x27;s Movement, authored by one of the group&#x27;s founders, Ahmad Reza&#x27;i, it was argued that &quot;Nezam-i Towhid&quot; (monotheistic order) sought by the prophet Muhammad, was a commonwealth fully united not only in its worship of one God but in a classless society that strives for the common good. &quot;Shiism, particularly Hussein&#x27;s historic act of martyrdom and resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.&quot;

As described by Abrahamian, one Mojahedin ideologist argued:

Reza&#x27;i further argued that the banner of revolt raised by the Shi&#x27;i Imams, especially Ali, Hassan, and Hussein, was aimed against feudal landlords and exploiting merchant capitalists as well as against usurping Caliphs who betrayed the &quot;Nezam-i-Towhid&quot;. For Reza&#x27;i and the Mujahidin it was the duty of all Muslims to continue this struggle to create a &#x27;classless society&#x27; and destroy all forms of capitalism, despotism, and imperialism. The Mojahedin summed up their attitude towards religion in these words: &#x27;After years of extensive study into Islamic history and Shi&#x27;i ideology, our organization has reached the firm conclusion that Islam, especially Shi&#x27;ism, will play a major role in inspiring the masses to join the revolution. It will do so because Shi&#x27;ism, particularly Hussein&#x27;s historic act of resistance, has both a revolutionary message and a special place in our popular culture.

=== After the revolution ===
Massoud Rajavi supported the idea that the Shi&#x27;ism is compatible with pluralistic democracy. In 1981, after signing the &quot;covenant of freedom and independence&quot; with Banisadr, and establishing NCRI Massoud Rajavi made an announcement to the foreign press about the MEK&#x27;s ideology saying that &quot;First we want freedom for all political parties. We reject both political prisoners and political executions. In the true spirit of Islam, we advocate freedom, fraternity, and an end to all repression, censorship, and injustices.&quot; They appealed to all opposition groups to join NCRI. Some secular groups had reservations that a &quot;Islamic Democratic People&#x27;s Republic&quot; was unattainable, while Massoud Rajavi maintained that Shiite religion and pluralistic democracy are compatible. Along with former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr, Rajavi published a Convenant promoting freedom of speech, press, and religion in Iran, as well as protection of Iranian minorities, &quot;especially the Kurdish minority&quot;. 

In 2001, Kenneth Katzman wrote that the MEK had &quot;tried to show itself as worthy of U.S. support on the basis of its commitment to values compatible with those of the United States – democracy, free market economics, protection of the rights of women and minorities, and peaceful relations with Iran&#x27;s neighbors&quot;, but some analysts dispute that they are genuinely committed to what they state. According to Department of State&#x27;s October 1994 report, the MEK used violence in its campaign to overthrow the Iranian regime. A 2009 U.S. Department of State report stated that their ideology was a blend of Marxism, Islamism and feminism.

The MEK says it is seeking regime change in Iran through peaceful means with an aim to replace the clerical rule in Iran with a secular government. It also claims to have disassociated itself from its former revolutionary ideology in favor of liberal democratic values, but they fail to &quot;present any track record to substantiate a capability or intention to be democratic&quot;.
The MEK says it supports a &quot;secular democratic system&quot;, where their leader, Maryam Rajavi, calls for a &quot;pluralist system&quot;, non-nuclear Iran, human rights and freedom of expression, separation of government and religion, and end to Sharia law.

=== Ideological revolution and women&#x27;s rights ===

During the transitional period, the MEK projected an image of a &quot;forward looking, radical and progressive Islamic force&quot;. Throughout the revolution, the MEK played a major role in developing the &quot;revolutionary Muslim woman&quot;, which was portrayed as &quot;the living example of the new ideal of womanhood&quot;. The MEK is &quot;known for its female-led military units&quot;. According to Ervand Abrahamian, the MEK &quot;declared that God had created men and women to be equal in all things: in political and intellectual matters, as well as in legal, economic, and social issues.&quot; According to Tohidi, in 1982, as the government in Tehran led an expansive effort to limit women&#x27;s rights, the MEK adopted a female leadership. In 1987, the National Liberation Army (NLA), &quot;saw female resistors commanding military operations from their former base at Camp Ashraf (in Diyala, Iraq) to Iran&#x27;s westernmost provinces, where they engaged alongside the men in armed combat with Iran&#x27;s regular and paramilitary forces&quot;.

Shortly after the revolution, Rajavi married Ashraf Rabii, an MEK member regarded as &quot;the symbol of revolutionary womanhood&quot;. Rabii was killed by Iranian forces in 1982. On 27 January 1985, Massoud Rajavi appointed Maryam Azodanlu as his co-equal leader. The announcement, stated that this would give women equal say within the organization and thereby &quot;would launch a great ideological revolution within Mojahedin, the Iranian public and the whole Muslim World&quot;.

In 1985, Rajavi launched an &quot;ideological revolution&quot; banning marriage and enforced divorce on all members who were required to separate from their spouses. Five weeks later, the MEK announced that its Politburo and Central Committee had asked Rajavi and Azondalu, who was already married, to marry one another to deepen and pave the way for the &quot;ideological revolution&quot;. At the time Maryam Azodanlu was known only as the younger sister of a veteran member, and the wife of Mehdi Abrishamchi. According to the announcement, Maryam Azodanlu and Mehdi Abrishamchi had recently divorced in order to facilitate this &#x27;great revolution.&#x27; According to Ervand Abrahamian &quot;in the eyes of traditionalists, particularly among the bazaar middle class, the whole incident was indecent. It smacked of wife-swapping, especially when Abrishamchi announced his own marriage to Khiabani&#x27;s younger sister. It involved women with young children and wives of close friends – a taboo in traditional Iranian culture;&quot; something that further isolated the Mojahedin and also upset some members of the organization. Also according to Abrahamian, &quot;the incident was equally outrageous in the eyes of the secularists, especially among the modern intelligentsia. It projected onto the public arena a matter that should have been treated as a private issue between two individuals.&quot; Many criticized Maryam Azodanlu&#x27;s giving up her own maiden name (something most Iranian women did not do and she herself had not done in her previous marriage). They would question whether this was in line with her claims of being a staunch feminist.

Maryam Rajavi became increasingly important over feminism-colored politics. The emancipation of women is now depicted in Maryam Rajavi&#x27;s writings &quot;as both a policy end and a strategy toward revolutionizing Iran. Secularism, democracy, and women&#x27;s rights are thus today&#x27;s leading themes in the group&#x27;s strategic communications. As for Maryam Rajavi&#x27;s leadership, in 2017 it appears to be political and cultural; any remnants of a military force and interest in terrorist strategies have faded away.&quot;

===Cult of personality===
The MEK has been described as a cult of personality by a variety of sources. The MEK has been described as a &quot;cult&quot; by the Iranian government and Iraqi politician Samir Sumaidaie. On May 25, 1981, Khomeini appeared on national television accusing those who criticized the Islamic Consultative Assembly&#x27;s decisions of having a cult of personality. 

It has also been described as a cult by the United States government, and another retired United States general described it as &quot;Cult? How about admirably focused group?&quot;. Romain Nadal said the MEK had a &quot;cult nature&quot;, and Bernard Kouchner said he was ashamed by Nadal&#x27;s criticism. Also numerous academics and former MEK members who defected have described it as a cult. 

Some sources argue that the Iranian government exploits such allegations to demonize the MEK. The Iranian government is reportedly running a disinformation campaign to discredit the MEK, with the head of the Mackenzie Institute commenting that &quot;Iran is trying to get other countries to label it as a terrorist cult&quot;. According to a RAND Corporation report for the US government, during Masoud Rajavi&#x27;s &quot;ideological revolution&quot;, members were required to give &quot;near-religious devotion&quot; to its leaders. Also according to RAND, the MEK had &quot;many of the typical characteristics of a cult, such as authoritarian control, confiscation of assets, sexual control (including mandatory divorce and celibacy), emotional isolation, forced labour, sleep deprivation, physical abuse and limited exit options,&quot; while this is vehemently denied by its supporters and leaders. United Press International (UPI) said that &quot;The truth is that the group&#x27;s ideology has evolved over the years in order to adapt with the region&#x27;s geopolitical changes.&quot; 

In 1990 MEK leadership ordered all couples to divorce, forbid them from re-marrying, and children were sent away. Children were removed from the MEK camp because MEK &quot;resistance fighters&quot; are required to dedicate themselves to their cause. Critics often describe the MEK as the &quot;cult of Rajavi&quot;, arguing that it revolves around the husband-and-wife duo, Maryam and Massoud Rajavi. Members reportedly had to participate in regular &quot;ideological cleansings&quot;. According to RAND, members were lured in through &quot;false promises of employment, land, aid in applying for asylum in Western countries&quot; and then prevented from leaving. Masoud Banisadr, a vocal former member, suggested that the MEK had become a cult in order to survive.

== Structure and organization ==

===Organizations===
Alongside its central organization, the PMOI has a political wing, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), established in 1981 with the stated goal of uniting the opposition to the Iranian government under one umbrella organization. The organization has the appearance of a broad-based coalition, but analysts consider NCRI and MEK to be synonymous and recognize the NCRI as an only &quot;nominally independent&quot; political wing of the PMOI. In 2002 the FBI reported that the NCRI has always been &quot;an integral part&quot; of the MEK and its &quot;political branch&quot;.

The PMOI also historically maintained a dedicated armed wing known as the National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA) that was established in 1987 to serve as an infantry force and coordinate the different militant groups members of the NCRI. It was formally disbanded in 2003 during the Iraq war.

Through its history, the MEK has maintained several front organizations including the Association of Iranian Scholars and Professionals, the Association of Iranian Women, Iran Aid, the California Society for Democracy, the Iranian-American Community of Northern Virginia and the Union Against Fundamentalism.

=== Membership ===

Before the Iran-Iraq war, the MEK was estimated to have about 2,000 members, peaking at 10,000 to 15,000 during the 1980s. In the 2000s, the organization had between 5,000 and 10,000 members, with 2,900 to 3,400 at Camp Ashraf. In February 2020, the MEK claimed to have 2500 members in its Albania camp (); a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter visiting the camp estimated 200 people were present over two days.

=== Fundraising ===

During its life in exile, MEK was initially financed by backers including Saddam Hussein, and later a network of fake charities based in European countries.

In 2004, a report by the US weapons inspector Charles Duelfer claimed that Saddam Hussein provided millions of dollars from the United Nations&#x27; Oil-for-Food program to the MEK.

In Germany, the MEK used a NGO to &quot;support asylum seekers and refugees&quot;. Another alleged organization collected funds for &quot;children whose parents had been killed in Iran&quot; in sealed and stamped boxes placed in city centers. According to the Nejat Society, in 1988, the Nuremberg MEK front organization was uncovered by police. Initially, The Greens supported these organizations while it was unaware of their purpose.

In 1999, United States authorities arrested 29 individuals in Operation Eastern Approach, of whom 15 were held on charges of helping MEK members illegally enter the US. The ringleader pleaded guilty to providing phony documents to MEK members and violation of Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.

The MEK also operated a UK-based charity, Iran Aid, which claimed to raise money for Iranian refugees. In 2001, the Charity Commission for England and Wales closed it down after finding no &quot;verifiable links between the money donated by the British public [approximately £5 million annually] and charitable work in Iran&quot;.

In December 2001, a joint FBI-Cologne police operation discovered what a 2004 report calls &quot;a complex fraud scheme involving children and social benefits&quot;, involving the sister of Maryam Rajavi. The High Court ruled to close several MEK compounds after investigations revealed that the organization fraudulently collected between $5 million and $10 million in social welfare benefits for children of its members sent to Europe.

In 2003, General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) claimed that Netherlands charity that raises money for &quot;children who suffer under the Iranian regime&quot; (SIM ()) was fundraising for the MEK. A spokesperson for the charity said that SIM was unrelated to the MEK and that these allegations were &quot;lies from the Iranian regime&quot;.

As RAND Corporation policy reported, MEK supporters seek donations at public places, often showing &quot;gruesome pictures&quot; of human rights victims in Iran and claiming to raise money for them but funneling it to MEK. A 2004 report by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that the organization is engaged &quot;through a complex international money laundering operation that uses accounts in Turkey, Germany, France, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates&quot;.

On 19 November 2004, two front organizations called the Iranian–American Community of Northern Virginia and the Union Against Fundamentalism organized demonstrations in front of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and transferred funds for the demonstration, some $9,000 to the account of a Texas MEK member. Congress and the bank in question were not aware that the demonstrators were actually providing material support to the MEK. According to Spiegel Online security experts say that U.S., Saudi Arabia and Israel provide the group with financial support, though there is no proof for this supposition and MEK denies this. The Hamburg state court ordered Der Spiegel in 2019 to remove unsupported claims from an article that accused the MEK of &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;psychoterror.&quot;

=== Intelligence capabilities ===
During the years MEK was based in Iraq, it was closely associated with the intelligence service &quot;Mukhabarat&quot; (IIS), and even had a dedicated department in the agency. Directorate 14 of the IIS worked with the MEK in joint operations while Directorate 18 was exclusively responsible for the MEK and issued the orders and tasks for their operations. The MEK offered IIS with intelligence it gathered from Iran, interrogation and translation services.

A 2008 report by the United States Army Intelligence Center, states that the MEK operates a HUMINT network within Iran, which is &quot;clearly a MEK core strength&quot;. It has started a debate among intelligence experts that &quot;whether western powers should leverage this capability to better inform their own intelligence picture of the Iranian regime&#x27;s goals and intentions&quot;. Rick Francona told &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; in 2005 that the MEK teams could work in conjunction with collection of intelligence and identifying agents. U.S. security officials maintain that the organization has a record of exaggerating or fabricating information, according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;. David Kay believes that &quot;they&#x27;re often wrong, but occasionally they give you something&quot;.

American government sources told &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2005 that the Pentagon is hoping to utilize MEK members as informants or give them training as spies for use against Tehran.

The MEK is able to conduct &quot;telephone intelligence&quot; operations effectively, i.e. gathering intelligence through making phone calls to officials and government organizations in Iran. According to Ariane Tabatabai, the MEK&#x27;s &quot;capabilities to conduct terrorist attacks may have decreased in recent years.&quot;

=== Propaganda and social media ===
The MEK&#x27;s first act of counter-propaganda was to release about 2014 Iranian prisoners of war within a period of 9 months. It started on 11 March 1986 when the NLA released 370 prisoners of war. They then released 170 prisoners of war in November 1987 that had been captured by the NLA. A third wave of 1300 prisoners of war were released in August 1988, with some joining the NLA ranks. During the last release, Massoud Rajavi promoted it this as an act of compassion by the NCRI, which was in contrast to the Islamic Republic&#x27;s &quot;cruel manner of treating&quot; prisoners of war. In the 1980s and the 1990s, their propaganda was mainly targeted against the officials in the establishment. According to Anthony H. Cordesman, since the mid-1980s the MEK has confronted Iranian representatives overseas through &quot;propaganda and street demonstrations&quot;. Other analysts have also alleged that there is a propaganda campaign by the MEK in the West, including Christopher C. Harmon and Wilfried Buchta, and others.

According to Kenneth Katzman, the MEK is able to mobilize its exile supporters in demonstration and fundraising campaigns. The organization attempts to publicize regime abuses and curb foreign governments&#x27; relations with Tehran. To do so, it frequently conducts anti-regime marches and demonstrations in those countries.

A 1986 U.S. State Department letter to KSCI-TV described &quot;MEK propaganda&quot; as being in line with the following: &quot;[T]he Iranian government is bad, the PMOI is against the Iranian government, the Iranian government represses the PMOI, therefore, the PMOI and its leader Rajavi are good and worth of support.&quot; According to Masoud Kazemzadeh, the MEK has also used propaganda against defectors of the organization.

Al Jazeera reported on an alleged Twitter-based MEK campaign. According to Exeter University lecturer Marc Owen Jones, accounts tweeting #FreeIran and #Iran_Regime_Change &quot;were created within about a four-month window&quot;, suggesting bot activity.

In an article published by &quot;The Intercept&quot; on 9 June 2019, two former MEK members claimed that &quot;Heshmat Alavi&quot; is not a real person, and that the articles published under that name were actually written by a team of people at the political wing of MEK. Alavi contributed to several media outlets including &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, &quot;The Federalist&quot; and the English edition of Al Arabiya&#x27;s website. According to &quot;The Intercept&quot;, one of Alavi&#x27;s articles published by &quot;Forbes&quot; was used by the White House to justify Donald Trump Administration&#x27;s sanctions against Iran. Since the article&#x27;s publication, Twitter has suspended the &quot;Heshmat Alavi&quot; account, and the writings in the name of &quot;Heshmat Alavi&quot; were removed from &quot;The Diplomat&quot; and &quot;Forbes″&quot; website. A website purported to be a personal blog of &quot;Heshmat Alavi&quot; published a post with counterclaims saying that their Twitter account had been suspended.

== Terrorist designation ==
=== Assignment of designation ===
The countries and organizations below have officially listed MEK as a terrorist organization:

In 1997, the United States put the MEK on the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The Clinton administration reported the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;The inclusion of the People&#x27;s Mojahedin was intended as a goodwill gesture to Tehran and its newly elected president, Mohammad Khatami.&quot;

In 2004, the United States also considered the group as &quot;noncombatants&quot; and &quot;protected persons&quot; under the Geneva Conventions. In 2002, the European Union, pressured by Washington, added MEK to its terrorist list. In 2009, the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice denied the MEK its request to be delisted. In 2008, the United Nations Committee against Torture said the MEK was involved in terrorist activities.

After the US invasion of Iraq, the MEK had a strong support base in the United States to be removed from its list of Foreign Terrorists Organizations, consequently turning it into a legitimate actor.

=== Removal of designation ===
The United Kingdom lifted the MEK&#x27;s designation as a terrorist group in June 2008, followed by the Council of the European Union on 26 January 2009. It was also lifted in the United States following a decision by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 21 September 2012 and lastly in Canada on 20 December 2012.

The Council of the European Union removed the group&#x27;s terrorist designation following the Court of Justice of the European Union&#x27;s 2008 ruling, which criticized France for failing to reveal new supposed evidence that the MEK posed a terrorist threat. The EU courts declared that the listing was unlawful because of &quot;serious procedural failures&quot; and lack of evidence connecting the MEK with terrorist activities. Delisting allowed MEK to pursue tens of millions of dollars in frozen assets and lobby in Europe for more funds. It also removed the terrorist label from MEK members at Camp Ashraf in Iraq.

On 28 September 2012, the U.S. State Department formally removed MEK from its official list of terrorist organizations, beating a 1 October deadline in an MEK lawsuit. Secretary of State Clinton said in a statement that the decision was made because the MEK had renounced violence and had cooperated in closing their Iraqi paramilitary base. It was reported that MEK was removed from the U.S. list of terrorist organizations after intensive lobbying by a bipartisan group of lawmakers. An official denied that lobbying by well-known figures influenced the decision. Some former U.S. officials vehemently reject the new status and believe the MEK has not changed its ways. MEK leaders began a lobbying campaign to be removed from the list by promoting the group as a viable opposition to the clerical regime in Iran. During 2011, lobbying firms DLA Piper, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld and DiGenova &amp; Toensing were paid almost $1,5 million by Iranian American organisations to lobby for delisting the MEK in the US.

The MEK advocated to remove itself from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, having paid high-profile officials upwards of $50,000 give speeches calling for delisting. Ervand Abrahamian, Shaul Bakhash, Juan Cole and Gary Sick among others, published &quot;Joint Experts&#x27; Statement on the Mujahedin-e Khalq&quot; on &quot;Financial Times&quot; voicing their concerns regarding MEK delisting. The National Iranian American Council denounced the decision, stating it &quot;opens the door to Congressional funding of the M.E.K. to conduct terrorist attacks in Iran&quot; and &quot;makes war with Iran far more likely.&quot; Iran state television also condemned the delisting of the group, saying that the U.S. considers MEK to be &quot;good terrorists because the U.S. is using them against Iran.&quot;

The campaign to delist the MEK in the European Union counted with Spanish MEP Alejo Vidal-Quadras as one of its lobbyists. Vox, the far-right party he founded, later received funding by the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The party received almost €1 million between December 2013 and April 2014.

== Foreign relations ==

While dealing with anti-regime clergy in 1974, the MEK became close with secular Left groups in and outside Iran. These included the confederation of Iranian Students, The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen, and the People&#x27;s Front for the Liberation of Oman, among others. The MEK sent five trained members into South Yemen to fight in the Dhofar Rebellion against Omani and Iranian forces.

On 7 January 1986, the MEK leaders sent a twelve-page letter to the &quot;comrades&quot; of Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, asking for temporary asylum and a loan of $300 million to continue their &quot;revolutionary anti-imperialist&quot; actions. It is not clear how the Soviets responded, according to Abbas Milani.

Israel&#x27;s foreign intelligence agency Mossad maintains connections with the MEK, dating back to the 1990s. Until 2001, the MEK received support from the Taliban. The MEK was also among the opposition groups receiving support from Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia.

In April 2012, journalist Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site up until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.

=== Position on the Israel–Palestinian conflict ===

Initially, the MEK used to criticize the Pahlavi dynasty for allying with Israel and Apartheid South Africa, calling them racist states and demanding cancellation of all political and economic agreements with them. The MEK opposed Israeli–Palestinian peace process and was anti-Zionist.

The MEK&#x27;s Central Cadre established contact with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), by sending emissaries to Paris, Dubai, and Qatar to meet PLO officials. On 3 August 1972, they bombed the Jordanian embassy as a means to avenge King Hussein&#x27;s unleashing his troops on the PLO in 1970.

=== Relations with the United States ===

In the late 1970s, the intelligentsia as a class in Iran was distinctly nationalistic and anti-imperialistic. The MEK had impeccable nationalistic credentials, calling for the nationalization of foreign companies and economic independence from the capitalist world, and praising writers such as Al-e Ahmad, Saedi and Shariati for being &quot;anti-imperialist&quot;. Rajavi in his presidential campaign after revolution used to warn against what he called the &quot;imperialist danger.&quot; The matter was so fundamental to MEK that it criticized the Iranian government on that basis, accusing the Islamic Republic of &quot;capitulation to imperialism&quot; and being disloyal to democracy that according to Rajavi was the only means to &quot;safeguard from American imperialism.&quot;

After exile, the MEK sought the support of prominent politicians, academics and human rights lawyers. Rajavi tried to reach as broad a Western public as possible by giving frequent interviews to Western newspapers. In these interviews, Rajavi toned down the issues of imperialism, foreign policy, and social revolution. Instead, he stressed the themes of democracy, political liberties, political pluralism, human rights, respect for &#x27;personal property,&#x27; the plight of political prisoners, and the need to end the senseless war.

Hyeran Jo, associate professor of Texas A&amp;M University wrote in 2015 that the MEK is supported by the United States. In January 1993, President-elect Clinton wrote a private letter to the Massoud Rajavi, in which he set out his support for the organization. The organization has also received support United States officials including Tom Ridge, Howard Dean, Michael Mukasey, Louis Freeh, Hugh Shelton, Rudy Giuliani, John Bolton, Bill Richardson, James L. Jones, and Edward G. Rendell.

As Mukasey mentioned in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in 2011 he had received $15,000 to $20,000 to present a lecture about &quot;MEK-related events&quot;, as well as what he listed as &quot;a foreign agent lobbying pro bono for MEK&#x27;s political arm&quot;. Rendell said he had been paid to speak in support of the MEK and Hamilton said he was paid to &quot;appear on a panel Feb. 19 at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington.&quot; In February 2015, &quot;The Intercept&quot; published that Bob Menendez, John McCain, Judy Chu, Dana Rohrabacher and Robert Torricelli received campaign contributions from MEK supporters.

Some politicians have declared receiving payment for supporting the MEK, but others support the group without payment. In May 2018, Daniel Benjamin who held office as the Coordinator for Counterterrorism between 2009 and 2012, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the MEK offered him money in exchange for his support.

== Human rights record ==
In 2006, Iraqi Prime Minister Al-Maliki told the MEK it had to leave Iraq, but the MEK responded that the &quot;request violated their status under the Geneva Convention&quot;. Al-Maliki and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice maintained that the MEK had committed human rights abuses in the early 1990s when it aided Saddam Hussain&#x27;s campaign against the Shia uprising. According to &quot;Time magazine&quot;, the MEK has denied aiding Saddam in quashing Kurdish and Shia rebellions.

In May 2005, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a report describing prison camps run by the MEK and severe human rights violations committed by the group against its members, ranging from prolonged incommunicado and solitary confinement to beatings, verbal and psychological abuse, coerced confessions, threats of execution, and torture that in two cases led to death. This report was disputed by the UK&#x27;s Lord Corbett. Human Rights Watch released a statement in February 2006, stating the criticisms they received concerning the substance and methodology of the [No Exit] report, was unwarranted.

Former American military officers who had aided in guarding the MEK camp in Iraq gave differing accounts. Those suggested by MEK said its members had been free to leave the camp and that they had not found any prison or torture facilities. Captain Woodside who was not one of those who MEK suggested, said that US officers did not have regular access to camp buildings, or to group members and that it was difficult for members to leave. Jo Hyeran, in her work examining humanitarian violations of rebel groups to international law, states that the MEK has not accepted International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visits to its detention centers. According to criticism of Human Right groups, marriage had been banned in the camp. Upon entry into the group, new members are indoctrinated in ideology and a revisionist history of Iran. All members are required to participate in weekly &quot;ideologic cleansings&quot;. Members who defected from the MEK and some experts say that these Mao-style self-criticism sessions are intended to enforce control over sex and marriage in the organization as a total institution. MEK denied the brainwashing describing it as part of Iranian &#x27;misinformation campaign.&#x27; Also Abbas Milani calls those describing MEK as a cult as lobbyists paid by Iranian regime. In July 2020 a German court ordered the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to remove false information about the MEK.

==Intelligence campaigns against the MEK==

The Shah&#x27;s regime waged a propaganda campaign against the MEK, accusing them &quot;of carrying out subversive acts at the behest of their foreign patrons&quot; and claiming that &quot;the shoot-outs and bombings caused heavy casualties among bystanders and innocent civilians, especially women and children&quot;. It also obtained &quot;public confessions&quot; that accused former colleagues of crimes including sexual promiscuity. The regime claimed that the MEK were &quot;unbelievers masquerading as Muslims&quot;, and used the Quranic term &quot;monafeqin&quot; (hypocrites) to describe them.

The Islamic Republican Party later used many of the same tactics, labelling the MEK &quot;Marxist hypocrites and Western-contaminated &#x27;electics&#x27;, and as &#x27;counter-revolutionary terrorists&#x27; collaborating with the Iraqi Ba&#x27;thists and the imperialists&quot;.
After the 1994 Imam Reza shrine bomb explosion in Mashhad which killed 25 and wounded at least 70 people, the Iranian regime immediately blamed the MEK. A month after the attack, a Sunni group calling itself &quot;al-haraka al-islamiya al-iraniya&quot; claimed responsibility for the attack. Despite this, the Iranian government continued to hold the MEK responsible for both attacks. According to an anonymous U.S. official, Ramzi Yousef built the bomb and MEK agents placed it in the shrine.

Even into the 2000s, the MEK has remained a major target of Iran&#x27;s internal security apparatus. Since 2001, several reports by Dutch, German and US intelligence services have noted the ongoing efforts by the Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Intelligence to &quot;track down and identify those who are in contact with opposition groups abroad&quot;, including the MEK. German and US intelligence have noted that Iranian intelligence was directly financing a misinformation campaign and trying to recruit active or former members of opposition groups, sometimes through &quot;threats to use force against them or their families living in Iran&quot;.

In 2018, U.S. District Court charged two alleged Iran agents of &quot;conducting covert surveillance of Israeli and Jewish facilities in the United States and collecting intelligence on Americans linked to a political organization that wants to see the current Iranian government overthrown&quot;. During the court process, it was revealed that the two alleged agents of Iran had mostly gathered information concerning activities involving the MEK. The two men pleaded guilty in November 2019 to several charges including conspiracy and &quot;acting as an undeclared agent of the Iranian government&quot;. The Justice Department said that one of the men arrived in the US to gather &quot;intelligence information&quot; about the MEK (as well as Israeli and Jewish entities). The other admitted to taking photographs at a 2017 MEK rally in order to profile attendees.

In January 2020 Iranian-American Ahmadreza Mohammadi-Doostdar was sentenced by a U.S. court to 38 months in prison for conducting surveillance on American MEK members. In September 2020 The New York Times published a report where researchers alleged that opponents of the Iranian regime had been targets of a cyber attack by Iranian hackers through a variety of infiltration techniques. MEK was reportedly among the most prominent targets of the attacks.

=== Targeting of MEK members outside Iran ===
From 1989 to 1993, the Islamic Republic of Iran carried out numerous assassinations of MEK members. Between March and June 1990, three MEK members were assassinated in Turkey. On 24 February 1990, Dr Kazem Rajavi (a National Council member) was assassinated in Geneva. In January 1993, an MEK member was murdered in Baghdad.

On 23 September 1991, an attempt was carried out to assassinate Massoud Rajavi in Baghdad. In August 1992, a MEK member was kidnapped and brought to Iran. In September 1992, MEK offices in Baghdad were broken into. In January 1993, a MEK bus was bombed without casualties. Towards the end of 1993, anonymous gunmen attacked Air France offices and the French embassy in Iran after France allowed Maryam Rajavi and 200 MEK members to enter France.

In March 1993, the NCRI&#x27;s spokesman was murdered in Italy. In May 1990, a MEK member was murdered in Cologne. In February 1993, a MEK member was murdered in Manila. In April 1992, a MEK member was murdered in the Netherlands. In August 1992, a MEK member was murdered in Karachi. In March 1993, two assassins on motorcycles murdered NCRI representative Mohammad Hossein Naqdi in Italy. This led to the European Parliament issuing a condemnation of the Islamic Republic of Iran for political murder.

The Iranian regime is also believed to be responsible for killing NCR representative in 1993, and Massoud Rajavi&#x27;s brother in 1990. The MEK claims that in 1996 a shipment of Iranian mortars was intended for use by Iranian agents against Maryam Rajavi. In May 1994, Islamic Republic agents assassinated two MEK members in Iraq. In May 1995, five MEK members were assassinated in Iraq. In 1996, two MEK members were murdered in Turkey (including NCRI member Zahra Rajabi); in the same year two MEK members were killed in Pakistan and another one in Iraq.

==Perception==
===Inside Iran===
After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the MEK gained significant support from the Iranian public, becoming the most popular dissident group. It also received support from national figures including intellectuals, military officers, and athletes. However, after becoming more violent and siding with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War the MEK&#x27;s standing inside Iran diminished. Its supporters within Iran have remained persistent, resisting the regime&#x27;s attempts to eradicate the organization from the country.

Inside Iran, the strength of the MEK is uncertain since many of its supporters have been executed, tortured, or jailed. Karim Sadjadpour believes the MEK is a &quot;fringe group with mysterious benefactors&quot; with a negligible amount of supporters in Iran. Kenneth Katzman wrote in 2001 that the MEK is &quot;Iran&#x27;s most active opposition group&quot;. A 2009 report published by the Brookings Institution notes that the organization appears to be undemocratic and lacking popularity but maintains an operational presence in Iran, acting as a proxy against Tehran. The group has been described as Iran&#x27;s main political opposition group.

The Iranian government consistently refers to the organization with this derogatory name monafiqeen (). The term is derived from the Quran, which describes it as people of &quot;two minds&quot; who &quot;say with their mouths what is not in their hearts&quot; and &quot;in their hearts is a disease&quot;.

While Khomeini and the MEK had allied against the Shah, Khomeini &quot;disliked the MEK&#x27;s philosophy, which combined Marxist theories of social evolution and class struggle with a view of Shiite Islam that suggested Shiite clerics had misinterpreted Islam and had been collaborators with the ruling class&quot;, and by mid-1980, clerics close to Khomeini were openly referring to the MEK as &quot;&quot;monafeghin&quot;, &quot;kafer&quot;, and &quot;elteqatigari&quot;&quot;. The MEK in turn accused Khomeini and the clerics of &quot;monopolizing power&quot;, &quot;hijacking the revolution&quot;, &quot;trampling over democratic rights&quot;, and &quot;plotting to set up a fascistic one-party dictatorship&quot;.

=== By other Iranian opposition parties ===

During the 1970s the group received assistance from the Liberation Movememnt. In the 1980s, the MEK and the Kurdish Democratic Party, the National Democratic Front, the Hoviyat Group, and other groups joined the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Other groups opposing Khomeini&#x27;s government, such as the National Resistance Movement of Iran (NAMIR), led by Shapour Bakhtiar, criticized and rejected cooperation with the MEK. Kenneth Katzman suggests that it&#x27;s hard to determine the level of MEK support among Iran&#x27;s exiles. While certain groups have distanced themselves from the organization, others have lent their support. 

Due to its anti-Shah stance before the revolution, the MEK is not close to monarchist opposition groups and Reza Pahlavi, Iran&#x27;s deposed crown prince. Commenting on the MEK, Pahlavi said in an interview: &quot;I cannot imagine Iranians ever forgiving their behavior at that time [siding with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war]. [...] If the choice is between this regime and the MEK, they will most likely say the mullahs&quot;.

Iran&#x27;s deposed president Abolhassan Banisadr ended his alliance with the group in 1984, denouncing its stance during the Iran–Iraq War.

== In the media ==

The MEK has been featured in several documentaries, including &quot;A Cult That Would Be an Army: Cult of the Chameleon&quot; (2007), &quot;The Strange World of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin&quot; (2012) and &quot;Midday Adventures&quot; (2017).

<text>Suck on This is a live album by the American rock band Primus, released in 1989. At the time of recording, the featured lineup of 
bassist/vocalist Les Claypool, guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Tim Alexander had only been playing together for &quot;about two months&quot;. This release, along with Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s self-titled live album, are seen as popularizing the then-underground alternative metal genre.

==Background==
The album was recorded live at the Berkeley Square in Berkeley, California on February 25 and March 5, 1989, on a TASCAM quarter-inch 8-track Portastudio and mixed on Hi-Fi VHS. The band borrowed $3,000 from Claypool&#x27;s father to cover the recording and pressing of one thousand copies of the album for its initial limited run. They released the record in November 1989 through their own independent label under the name Prawn Song Records before licensing it to Caroline Records in 1990, and later Interscope Records. On April 23, 2002, Prawn Song reissued the album with remastered audio, together with the follow-up studio album &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;.

All of the songs would eventually be released as studio recordings: &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; on &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; in 1991, &quot;Pressman&quot; (as &quot;The Pressman&quot;) on &quot;Pork Soda&quot; in 1993, &quot;Jellikit&quot; on the &quot;Airheads&quot; soundtrack in 1994 as &quot;Bastardizing Jellikit&quot;, and &quot;The Heckler&quot; on &quot;Antipop&quot; in 1999 as a hidden track. All other tracks were included on the band&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; in 1990.

The original liner notes give &quot;hugs and kisses&quot; to a number of bands and local businesses, including Faith No More and Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys, followed by &quot;special hugs and kisses&quot; to a number of individuals, including early Primus members Todd Huth, Jay Lane, Vince Parker and Tim Wright, and &quot;Pops&quot; (Claypool&#x27;s father) &quot;for kickin&#x27; down the corn&quot;. For the 2002 reissue, these sections were omitted in favour of a paragraph written by Claypool detailing the history of the record, leaving only &quot;special thanks&quot; to Claypool&#x27;s father.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Ned Raggett describes the album as &quot;not only demonstrating Primus&#x27; undeniable live flair for art/prog rock/funk of its own devising, but capturing an already rabid fan base getting off on it big-time&quot;, with &quot;its tempo-shifting riffing and Funkadelic-meets-Rush rhythm explosions benefiting from a fairly crisp recording.&quot; He notes that &quot;Claypool&#x27;s voice is sometimes searching for breath or a touch buried in the mix&quot;, but &quot;anyone who likes the Zappa/Beefheart goofy voice approach Claypool is fond of will be perfectly happy with his nutty lip-flapping&quot;.

<text>The Old Hungarian script or Hungarian runes (, &#x27;székely-magyar runiform&#x27;, or ) is an alphabetic writing system used for writing the Hungarian language. Modern Hungarian is written using the Latin-based Hungarian alphabet. The term &quot;old&quot; refers to the historical priority of the script compared with the Latin-based one. The Old Hungarian script is a child system of the Old Turkic alphabet.

The Hungarians settled the Carpathian Basin in 895. After the establishment of the Christian Hungarian kingdom, the old writing system was partly forced out of use during the rule of King Stephen, and the Latin alphabet was adopted. However, among some professions (e.g. shepherds who used a &quot;rovás-stick&quot; to officially track the number of animals) and in Transylvania, the script has remained in use by the Székely Magyars, giving its Hungarian name . The writing could also be found in churches, such as that in the commune of Atid.

Its English name in the ISO 15924 standard is Old Hungarian (Hungarian Runic).

== Name ==
In modern Hungarian, the script is known formally as (&#x27;Szekler script&#x27;). The writing system is generally known as , , and (or simply &#x27;notch, score&#x27;).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The precise date or origin of the script is unknown.
Origins of the Turkic scripts are uncertain. According to some opinions, ancient Turkic runes descend from primaeval Turkic graphic logograms.
Linguist András Róna-Tas derives Old Hungarian from the Old Turkic script, itself recorded in inscriptions dating from . 
Speakers of Proto-Hungarian would have come into contact with Turkic peoples during the 7th or 8th century, in the context of the Turkic expansion, as is also evidenced by numerous Turkic loanwords in Proto-Hungarian.

All the letters but one for sounds which were shared by Turkic and Ancient Hungarian can be related to their Old Turkic counterparts. Most of the missing characters were derived by script internal extensions, rather than borrowings, but a small number of characters seem to derive from Greek, such as &#x27;eF&#x27;.

The modern Hungarian term for this script (coined in the 19th century), , derives from the verb (&#x27;to score&#x27;) which is derived from old Uralic, general Hungarian terminology describing the technique of writing ( &#x27;to write&#x27;, &#x27;letter&#x27;, &#x27;knife, also: for carving letters&#x27;) derive from Turkic, which further supports transmission via Turkic alphabets.

=== Medieval Hungary ===
Epigraphic evidence for the use of the Old Hungarian script in medieval Hungary dates to the 10th century, for example, from Homokmégy. The latter inscription was found on a fragment of a quiver made of bone. Although there have been several attempts to interpret it, the meaning of it is still unclear.

In 1000, with the coronation of Stephen I of Hungary, Hungary (previously an alliance of mostly nomadic tribes) became a kingdom. The Latin alphabet was adopted as official script; however, Old Hungarian continued to be used in the vernacular.

The runic script was first mentioned in the 13th century Chronicle of Simon of Kéza, where he stated that the Székelys may use the script of the Blaks. Johannes Thuróczy wrote in the Chronica Hungarorum that the Székelys did not forget the Scythian letters and these are engraved on sticks by carving.

=== Early Modern period ===
The Old Hungarian script became part of folk art in several areas during this period. In Royal Hungary, Old Hungarian script was used less, although there are relics from this territory, too.
There is another copy – similar to the Nikolsburg Alphabet – of the Old Hungarian alphabet, dated 1609. The inscription from Énlaka, dated 1668, is an example of the &quot;folk art use&quot;.

There are a number of inscriptions ranging from the 17th to the early 19th centuries, including examples from Kibéd, Csejd, Makfalva, Szolokma, Marosvásárhely, Csíkrákos, Mezőkeresztes, Nagybánya, Torda, Felsőszemeréd, Kecskemét and Kiskunhalas.

=== Scholarly discussion ===
Hungarian script was first described in late Humanist/Baroque scholarship by János Telegdy in his primer . Published in 1598, Telegdi&#x27;s primer presents his understanding of the script and contains Hungarian texts written with runes, such as the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

In the 19th century, scholars began to research the rules and the other features of the Old Hungarian script. From this time, the name (&#x27;runic writing&#x27;) began to re-enter the popular consciousness in Hungary, and script historians in other countries began to use the terms &quot;Old Hungarian&quot;, , and so on. Because the Old Hungarian script had been replaced by Latin, linguistic researchers in the 20th century had to reconstruct the alphabet from historic sources. Gyula Sebestyén, an ethnographer and folklorist, and Gyula (Julius) Németh, a philologist, linguist, and Turkologist, did the lion&#x27;s share of this work. Sebestyén&#x27;s publications, (&quot;Runes and runic writing&quot;, Budapest, 1909) and (&quot;The authentic relics of Hungarian runic writing&quot;, Budapest, 1915) contain valuable information on the topic.

=== Popular revival ===

Beginning with Adorján Magyar in 1915, the script has been promulgated as a means for writing modern Hungarian. These groups approached the question of representation of the vowels of modern Hungarian in different ways. Adorján Magyar made use of characters to distinguish &quot;a&quot;/&quot;á&quot; and &quot;e&quot;/&quot;é&quot; but did not distinguish the other vowels by length. A school led by Sándor Forrai from 1974 onward did, however, distinguish &quot;i&quot;/&quot;í&quot;, &quot;o&quot;/&quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;/&quot;ő&quot;, &quot;u&quot;/&quot;ú&quot;, and &quot;ü&quot;/&quot;ű&quot;. The revival has become part of a significant ideological nationalist subculture present not only in Hungary (largely centered in Budapest), but also amongst the Hungarian diaspora, particularly in the United States and Canada.

Old Hungarian has seen other usages in the modern period, sometimes in association with or referencing Hungarian neopaganism, similar to the way in which Norse neopagans have taken up the Germanic runes, and Celtic neopagans have taken up the ogham script for various purposes.

=== Controversies ===
Not all scholars agree with the &quot;Old Hungarian&quot; notion, mainly based on the actual literary facts. The linguist and sociolinguist Klára Sándor said in an interview that most of the &quot;romantic&quot; statements about the script appear to be false. According to her analysis, the origin of the writing is probably (and with high probability its origins are in the western Turkic runiform writings) and it&#x27;s not a different writing system and contrary to the sentiment the writing is neither Hungarian nor Székely-Hungarian; it is a Székely writing since there are no authentic findings outside the historic Székely lands (mainly today&#x27;s Transylvania); the only writing found around 1000 AD had a different writing system. While it may have been sporadically used in Hungary its usage was not widespread. The &quot;revived&quot; writing (in the 1990s) was artificially expanded with (various) &quot;new&quot; letters which were unneeded in the past since the writing was cleanly phonetic, or the long vowels which were not present back in the time. The shape of many letters were substantially changed from the original.
She stated that no works since 1915 have reached the expected quality of the state of the linguistic sciences, and many were influenced by various agendas.

The use of the script often has a political undertone as it is often used along with irredentist or nationalist propaganda, and they can be found from time to time in graffiti with a variety of content. Since most of the people cannot read the script it has led to various controversies, for example when the activists of the Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (opposition) exchanged the rovas sign of the city Érd to &quot;szia&quot; &#x27;Hi!&#x27;, which stayed unnoticed for a month.

== Epigraphy ==
The inscription corpus includes:
* A labeled crest etched into stone from Pécs, late 13th century (Label: &quot;aBA SZeNTjeI vaGYUNK aKI eSZTeR ANna erZSéBeT&quot;; We are the saints [nuns] of Aba; who are Esther, Anna and Elizabeth.)
* Rod calendar, around 1300, copied by Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli in 1690. It contains several feasts and names, thus it is one of the most extensive runic records.
* Nicholsburg alphabet 
* Runic record in Istanbul, 1515.
* Székelyderzs: a brick with runic inscription, found in the Unitarian church
* Énlaka runic inscription, discovered by Balázs Orbán in 1864
* Székelydálya: runic inscription, found in the Calvinist church
* The inscription from Felsőszemeréd (Horné Semerovce), Slovakia (15th century)

== Characters ==
The runic alphabet included 42 letters. As in the Old Turkic script, some consonants had two forms, one to be used with back vowels (a, á, o, ó, u, ú) and another for front vowels (e, é, i, í, ö, ő, ü, ű). The names of the consonants are always pronounced with a vowel. In the old alphabet, the consonant-vowel order is reversed, unlike today&#x27;s pronunciation (&quot;ep&quot; rather than &quot;pé&quot;). This is because the oldest inscriptions lacked vowels and were rarely written down, similar to other ancient languages&#x27; consonant-writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, etc.). The alphabet did not contain letters for the phonemes dz and dzs of modern Hungarian, since these are relatively recent developments in the language&#x27;s history. Nor did it have letters corresponding to the Latin q, w, x and y. The modern revitalization movement has created symbols for these; in Unicode encoding, they are represented as ligatures.

For more information about the transliteration&#x27;s pronunciation, see Hungarian alphabet.

The Old Hungarian runes also include some non-alphabetical runes which are not ligatures but separate signs. These are identified in some sources as &quot;&quot; (likely a misspelling of ). Further research is needed to define their origin and traditional usage. Some common examples are:
*TPRUS: 
*ENT: 
*TPRU: 
*NAP: 
*EMP: 
*UNK: 
*US: 
*AMB: 

== Features ==
Old Hungarian letters were usually written from right to left on sticks. Later, in Transylvania, they appeared on several media. Writings on walls also were right to left and not boustrophedon style (alternating direction right to left and then left to right).

The numbers are almost the same as the Roman, Etruscan, and Chuvash numerals. Numbers of livestock were carved on tally sticks and the sticks were then cut in two lengthwise to avoid later disputes.

* Ligatures are common. (&quot;Note&quot;: the Hungarian runic script employed a number of ligatures. In some cases, an entire word was written with a single sign similar to a bind rune.) The Unicode standard supports ligatures explicitly by using the zero width joiner between the two characters.
* There are no lower or upper case letters, but the first letter of a proper name was often written a bit larger. Though the Unicode standard has upper and lowercase letters, which are the same in shape, the difference is only their size.
* The writing system did not always mark vowels (similar to many Asian writing systems). The rules for vowel inclusion were as follows:
** If there are two vowels side by side, both have to be written, unless the second could be readily determined.
** The vowels have to be written if their omission created ambiguity. (Example: – can be interpreted as – (wheel) and – (rounded), thus the writer had to include the vowels to differentiate the intended words.)
** The vowel at the end of the word must be written.
* Sometimes, especially when writing consonant clusters, a consonant was omitted. This is a phonologic process, with the script reflecting the exact surface realization.

== Text example ==
Text from Csíkszentmárton, 1501.
&quot;Runes originally written as ligatures are underlined.&quot;

English translation: &quot;(This) was written in the 1501st year of our Lord. The smiths Matthias, John (and) Stephen did (this). Master Matthias (and) Master Gregory did (uninterpretable)
== Unicode ==

After many proposals Old Hungarian was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2015 with the release of version 8.0.

The Unicode block for Old Hungarian is U+10C80–U+10CFF:

== Pre-Unicode encodings ==
A set of closely related 8-bit code pages exist, devised in the 1990s by Gabor Hosszú. These were mapped to Latin-1 or Latin-2 character set fonts. After installing one of them and applying their formatting to the document – because of the lack of capital letters – runic characters could be entered in the following way: those letters which are unique letters in today&#x27;s Hungarian orthography are virtually lowercase ones, and can be written by simply pressing the specific key; and since the modern digraphs equal to separate rovás letters, they were encoded as &#x27;uppercase&#x27; letters, i.e. in the space originally restricted for capitals. Thus, typing a lowercase &quot;g&quot; will produce the rovás character for the sound marked with Latin script &quot;g&quot;, but entering an uppercase &quot;G&quot; will amount to a rovás sign equivalent to a digraph &quot;gy&quot; in Latin-based Hungarian orthography.

<doc id="285645" wikidata="Q837033" url="?curid=285645" title="Cyberport">
<text>Cyberport is a business park in Southern District, Hong Kong, consisting of four office buildings, a hotel, and a retail entertainment complex. It describes itself as a digital technology community with over 1,800 (800 on-site and 1,000 off-site) digital and technology companies.

The Cyberport project has courted controversy since its inception because of the government bypassing the open-tender process in awarding the project to real estate developer Richard Li Tzar-Kai, and also because of its reliance on &quot;ancillary residential&quot; revenue. In recent years, Cyberport has developed as a digital technology flagship and key incubator for entrepreneurship in Hong Kong.

==Digital technology community==
Six start-ups from Cyberport, namely GOGOX, KLOOK, WeLab, TNG, Animoca Brands and ZA International, have emerged as &quot;unicorns&quot;, spanning categories of fintech, smart living, digital entertainment and esports. Cyberport is managed by Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, which is wholly owned by the Hong Kong SAR Government.

In operation since 2004, Cyberport focuses on fintech, smart living, digital entertainment and esports, AI and big data, blockchain, and cybersecurity. Cyberport is currently home to the largest Fintech community in Hong Kong with around 400 Fintech companies. Bowtie, a member of the Cyberport community, was authorised by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority to become Hong Kong&#x27;s first virtual insurer under the Fast Track system in November 2018. Zhong An and WeLab, who are also members of Cyberport, were two of the initial eight financial institutions and firms to be granted a virtual bank license.

To promote the development of esports in Hong Kong, Cyberport launched the opening of Hong Kong&#x27;s largest professional-grade esports venue on 16 July 2019 located in the Cyberport Arcade. It also launched the Esports Industry Facilitation Scheme and the Esports Internship Scheme. The former offers cash grants to support industry activities, while the latter provides a cash subsidy for internships in the esports industry.

As of February 2022, Cyberport Incubation Programme had incubated and funded over 1,000 technology start-ups companies since its inception in 2005. The Cyberport Macro Fund was announced in 2016 to support local start-ups after seed stage but generally before or around Series A stage of funding. The fund, which received a further injection of HK$200 million by Cyberport and its scope extended to cover Series A and later stage investments, has, as of July 2022, invested in 22 start-ups totalling about HK$168 million, driving a co-investment ratio of 1:8.

On 25 March, the Hong Kong SAR Government announced that Simon Chan Sai-ming would succeed Dr George Lam as chairman of the board of directors of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024.

Cyberport currently comprises four phases, providing a total of 119,000 square metres of office space. As of May 2021, the occupancy rate of Cyberport&#x27;s office and co-working space has consistently maintained occupancy rates at 90% and 95%, respectively. The number of applications for the &quot;Cyberport Incubation Programme&quot; has substantially increased from less than 100 per year before 2011 to over 600 per year in recent years.

==Project background==
In March 1999, the Hong Kong government announced its intention to develop a &quot;Cyberport&quot;, to help local businesses capitalise on the rapid growth of the Internet. The government called it a development where information technology and multimedia would be nurtured so that future demands of these industries could be met. According to the press release by the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, only one-third of the site would be residential, the sale of which would help finance the Cyberport development. The Cyberport is billed as home to an incubator for ICT startups, providing office space, financial aid, training, micro fund and network access to the investment community.

The Hong Kong government signed a partnership deal with the Pacific Century Group (PCG) to develop a site with open sea view at Telegraph Bay in Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong Island, at a total cost of HK$13 billion. It was announced as part of the 1999 budget by then-Financial Secretary Donald Tsang. It was also hoped that this development would help the HKSAR&#x27;s economy rebound after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and bring a &quot;strategic cluster of information technology and services companies situated in a world-class setting&quot;. The &quot;strategic telecommunication node&quot; was due to be formed due to its close proximity to the proposed &quot;Teleport&quot; in Chung Hom Kok. Touted benefits include &quot;a range of shared facilities for tenants, including a multimedia-based network, telecommunication links, media laboratory, cyber library and other information technology and services support facilities. There will also be educational, entertainment and recreational facilities related to information technology and services for local visitors and tourists&quot;.

As part of the deal, PCG would construct a office complex with a shopping mall and a 173-room hotel that would be put out to management. Title to these properties would be transferred to the government at zero cost, while PCG received land for of residential housing in exchange, and would reap 64.5 percent of the profits from their sale.

The construction of the Cyberport portion consisting of four office buildings, The Arcade and Le Meridien Cyberport Hotel, was completed in phases between 2002 and 2004. The residential developments consist of approximately 2,800 units or houses completed in phases between 2004 and 2008.

==Controversy==

=== Awarding the project without formal open tender ===
The government&#x27;s decision in granting the project to Pacific Century Group (PCG) controlled by Richard Li, son of Hong Kong&#x27;s wealthiest man Li Ka-shing, to develop the site generated much controversy. Awarding the project to PCG without a formal open tender attracted criticism for lack of transparency; other interested developers complained of being sidelined. Three private and wholly owned companies, namely, Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings Limited, Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited and Hong Kong Cyberport (Ancillary Development) Limited (collectively referred to as the &quot;Cyberport companies&quot;) were set up under the Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) to oversee implementation of the project. The project was criticised as unnecessary government intervention in the real estate sector.

=== Residential project disguised as tech hub ===
According to critics, Cyberport was a residential project in disguise, as it arguably failed in its mission to become a high-technology hub for the city. &quot;Eurasia Review&quot; suggested that the government land was injected into the project below value. The overall rationale of the project has been questioned by its critics, as details have emerged about the planning and budgeting for the project that indicate that 75% of the area developed is residential, and that office space for the technology companies was only about 17% of the total. Also the &quot;shared facilities&quot; made up only part of a small block which includes houses and apartments.

=== Low occupancy of rental office towers ===
The project had the reputation of a &quot;ghost town&quot;, as the government-owned portion suffered low occupancy. Fifteen companies signed letters of intent with the developer, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft and Yahoo, but only three moved in at the initial opening, due to a technology slump. The government rejected accusations of favouritism, arguing that PCG&#x27;s presence as an anchor tenant would be a marketing plus to prestigious international technology companies. In addition, tendering was bypassed ostensibly to shorten the sensitive time frame to bring forward the economic benefits of the project. PCG later hived off the residential property interests into a shell company separate from the telecoms operation so that the shell company would receive the residential housing sales revenues; it was also accorded right of first refusal to redevelop sites of 60 existing telephone exchanges of PCCW, the telecoms operator. In October 2004, David Webb cited lack of transparency in the government&#x27;s business dealings and demanded audited financial accounts and directors&#x27; reports for three companies related to the project to be released under the non-statutory Code on Access to Information.

=== Data hack ===
In September 2023, media reported that Cyberport had suffered a hack, where the attackers took around 400GB of personal data. Cyberport initially declined to reveal that personal information was exposed, saying it did not want to cause &quot;unnecessary concern.&quot; A cybersecurity expert said &quot;This attack could have been avoided because the loopholes and incorrect settings that enabled the attack are from two to three years ago, if not earlier. This should not have happened.&quot; A former employee of Cyberport said &quot;There has been no apology from the management, no one has had to step down. They are only issuing statements and holing up.&quot;

Cyberport CEO Peter Yan King-shun said that the hack was limited to &quot;some information stored in some parts of some servers&quot; and said there was no evidence of human error; a former employee said &quot;[Yan] didn&#x27;t acknowledge Cyberport&#x27;s lack of cybersecurity measures to protect staff and start-ups&#x27; information. He didn&#x27;t apologise. Only the chairman sort of apologised.&quot;

SCMP released an editorial, saying &quot;The delay in disclosing last month&#x27;s incident underlines the lack of urgency and sensitivity on the part of management. This was also reflected in a suggestion that data was stolen from a shared drive with presumably less protection.&quot;

=== Expansion ===
In 2019, after the government announced the Cyberport Expansion project, Cyberport repeatedly promised to consult with local residents and the Southern District Council regarding the design of its waterfront park. However, in September 2023, local media reported that Cyberport had declined to attend the Meeting of the Economy, Development, and Planning Committee of the Southern District Council both in 2021 and 2023. 

In June 2021, District Councilor Paul Zimmerman manually photographed each page of Cyberport&#x27;s expansion plans, as they had refused to provide a digital copy. Later in 2023, Zimmerman revealed 8 broken promises and lies made by Cyberport, and said &quot;It is regrettable that Cyberport and ITIB have continuously failed to honour their commitments to consult the community on the park&#x27;s redesign. With a project of HK$5.5 billion impacting such a beloved park, it is disconcerting that Cyberport, with its technological prowess, has been unable to create a dedicated website providing comprehensive information, visuals, timelines, and contacts. The exclusion of the Pokfulam community from the park&#x27;s design process, along with the restriction of their participation, is simply unjust.&quot;

==Housing==
Bel-Air is a luxury residential development in Cyberport. The development is split into six phases; phase 1 and 2 are referred to as Residence Bel-Air and Phase 3 is referred to as Bel-Air on the Peak. Phase 1 and 2 each have a clubhouse and seven blocks that are about 48 floors tall. Floor 40 and above are flats that have the area of two flats combined into one, creating over . All of which feature sky gardens with ocean views. Enumeration of &quot;Block 4&quot; and all fourth floors of each block has been avoided for superstitious reasons. However, the management company neglected to omit 4 when naming the construction phases.

Each floor of &quot;Bel-Air on the Peak&quot; has two or three apartments, two larger units, &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; and a smaller two-bedroom unit &#x27;B&#x27;. The clubhouse of &quot;Bel-Air on the Peak&quot; is significantly newer with more artistic features. They maintain an indoor pool, gym, restaurant, snooker room and children&#x27;s game room.

Bel-Air has 2 clubhouses: the Bay Wing and Peak Wing. They feature a spa, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, game&#x27;s room, gym, children&#x27;s playroom, restaurant and personal cinema. Each floor of the &quot;Residence Bel-Air&quot; has two flats with three bedrooms, a kitchen and a balcony. Additionally, there are single-family homes near &quot;Residence Bel-Air&quot;.

In 1984, Pollard sold numerous state secrets, including the National Security Agency&#x27;s ten-volume manual on how the U.S. gathers its signal intelligence, and disclosed the names of thousands of people who had cooperated with U.S. intelligence agencies. He was apprehended in 1985, and in subsequent proceedings agreed to a plea deal, pleaded guilty to spying for and providing top-secret classified information to Israel. Pollard admitted shopping his services—successfully, in some cases—to other countries. In 1987, he was sentenced to life in prison for violations of the Espionage Act.

The Israeli government acknowledged a portion of its role in Pollard&#x27;s espionage in 1987, and issued a formal apology to the U.S., but did not admit to paying him until 1998. Over the course of his imprisonment, Israeli officials, US-Israeli activist groups and some US politicians continually lobbied for a reduction or commutation of his sentence. In defense of his actions, Pollard said the American intelligence establishment collectively endangered Israel&#x27;s security by withholding crucial information. Opposing any form of clemency were many active and retired U.S. officials, including Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, former CIA director George Tenet; several former U.S. Secretaries of Defense; a bi-partisan group of U.S. congressional leaders; and members of the U.S. intelligence community. They maintained that the damage to U.S. national security due to Pollard&#x27;s espionage was much more severe, wide-ranging, and enduring than acknowledged publicly. Though Pollard argued that he only supplied Israel with information critical to its security, opponents stated that he had no way of knowing what the Israelis had received through legitimate exchanges, and that much of the data he compromised had nothing to do with Israeli security. Pollard revealed aspects of the U.S. intelligence gathering process, its &quot;sources and methods&quot;. In 1995, while imprisoned, he was granted Israeli citizenship.

Pollard was released on November 20, 2015, in accordance with federal guidelines at the time of his sentencing. On November 20, 2020, his parole expired and all restrictions were eliminated. On December 30, 2020, Pollard and his second wife relocated to Israel and settled in Jerusalem.

Since relocating to Israel, Pollard has endorsed Itamar Ben-Gvir and advocated a population transfer to relocate Gaza&#x27;s Arabs to Ireland.

==Early life==
Jonathan Jay Pollard was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1954, to a Jewish family, the youngest of three siblings born to Morris and Mildred &quot;Molly&quot; Klein (Kahn) Pollard. In 1961, his family relocated to South Bend, Indiana, where his father Morris, an award-winning microbiologist, taught at the University of Notre Dame.

At an early age, Pollard became aware of the horrific toll the Holocaust had taken on his mother&#x27;s family, the Kleins (Kahns) from Vilna in Lithuania, and shortly before his bar mitzvah, he asked his parents to visit the Nazi death camps. Pollard&#x27;s family made a special effort to instill a sense of Jewish identity in their children, which included devotion to the cause of Israel.

Pollard grew up with what he termed a &quot;racial obligation&quot; to Israel, and made his first visit to Israel in 1970, as part of a science program visiting the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. While there, he was hospitalized after a fight with another student. One Weizmann scientist remembered Pollard as leaving behind &quot;a reputation of being a troublemaker&quot;.

After completing high school, Pollard attended Stanford University, where he completed a degree in political science in 1976. While there, he is remembered by several of his acquaintances as having boasted that he was a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, claiming to have worked for Mossad, to have attained the rank of colonel in the Israel Defense Forces (even sending himself a telegram addressed to &quot;Colonel Pollard&quot;), and to have killed an Arab while on guard duty at a kibbutz. He also claimed that his father, Morris Pollard was a CIA operative, and to have fled Czechoslovakia as a child during the Prague Spring in 1968 when his father&#x27;s CIA role there was discovered. None of these claims were true. Later, Pollard enrolled in several graduate schools, but never completed a post-graduate degree.

Pollard&#x27;s future wife, Anne Henderson (born 1960), relocated to Washington, D.C., during the autumn of 1978 to live with her (recently divorced) father, Bernard Henderson. During the summer of 1981, she moved into a house on Capitol Hill with two other women and, through a friend of one of her roommates, she first met Pollard. He later said he had fallen in love during their first meeting—they were &quot;an inseparable couple&quot; by November 1981, and in June 1982, when her Capitol Hill lease expired, she moved into Pollard&#x27;s apartment in Arlington, Virginia. In December 1982, the couple moved into downtown Washington, D.C., to a two-bedroom apartment at 1733 20th Street NW, near Dupont Circle. They married on August 9, 1985, more than a year after Pollard began spying for Israel, in a civil ceremony in Venice, Italy. At the time of their arrest, in November 1985, they were paying US$750 () per month in rent.

==Early career==
Pollard began applying for intelligence service jobs in 1979 after quitting graduate school, first at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and then at the U.S. Navy. Pollard was refused for the CIA job after taking a polygraph test in which he admitted to prolific illegal drug usage between 1974 and 1978.

He fared better with the Navy, and on September 19, 1979, he was hired by the Navy Field Operational Intelligence Office (NFOIO), an office of the Naval Intelligence Command (NIC). As an intelligence specialist, he was to work on Soviet issues at the Navy Ocean Surveillance Information Center (NOSIC), a department of NFOIO. A background check was required to receive the necessary security clearances, but no polygraph test. In addition to a Top Secret clearance, a more stringent &#x27;Sensitive Compartmented Information&#x27; (SCI) clearance was required. The Navy asked for but was denied information from the CIA regarding Pollard, including the results of their pre-employment polygraph test revealing Pollard&#x27;s excessive drug use.

Pollard was given temporary non-SCI security clearances pending completion of his background check, which was normal for new hires at the time. He was assigned to temporary duty at another NIC Department, the Naval Intelligence Support Center (NISC) Surface Ships Division, where he could work on tasks that did not require SCI clearance. NOSIC&#x27;s current operations facility and the NISC were co-located in Suitland, Maryland.

Two months after Pollard was hired, he approached the technical director of NOSIC, Richard Haver, and offered to start a back-channel operation with the South African intelligence service. He also lied about his father being involved with CIA operations in South Africa. Haver became wary of Pollard and requested that he be terminated. However, Haver&#x27;s boss believed that Pollard&#x27;s supposed connection with South African intelligence could be useful, and he reassigned him to a Navy human intelligence (HUMINT) operation, Task Force 168 (TF-168). This office was within Naval Intelligence Command (NIC), the headquarters for Navy intelligence operations (located in a separate building, but still within the Suitland Federal Center complex.) It was later discovered that Pollard had lied repeatedly during the vetting process for this position: he denied illegal drug use, claimed his father had been a CIA operative, misrepresented his language abilities and his educational achievements, and claimed to have applied for a commission as officer in the Naval Reserve. A month later Pollard received his SCI clearances and was transferred from NISC to TF-168.

While transferring to his new job at TF-168, Pollard again initiated a meeting with someone far up the chain of command, this time with Admiral Sumner Shapiro, Commander, Naval Intelligence Command (CNIC), about an idea he had for TF-168 and South Africa. (The TF-168 group had passed on his ideas.) After the meeting, Shapiro immediately ordered that Pollard&#x27;s security clearances be revoked and that he be reassigned to a non-sensitive position. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Shapiro dismissed Pollard as a &quot;kook&quot;, saying later, &quot;I wish the hell I&#x27;d fired him&quot;.

Because of the job transfer, Shapiro&#x27;s order to remove Pollard&#x27;s security clearances was neglected. However, Shapiro&#x27;s office followed up with a request to TF-168 that Pollard be investigated by the CIA. The CIA found Pollard to be a risk and recommended that he not be used in any intelligence collection operation. A subsequent polygraph test was inconclusive, although it did prompt Pollard to admit to making false statements to his superiors, prior drug use, and having unauthorized contacts with representatives of foreign governments. The special agent administering the test felt that Pollard, who at times &quot;began shouting and shaking and making gagging sounds as if he were going to vomit&quot;, was feigning illness to invalidate the test. He recommended against Pollard&#x27;s being granted access to highly classified information. Pollard was also required to be evaluated by a psychiatrist.

Pollard&#x27;s clearance was reduced to Secret. He subsequently filed a grievance and threatened lawsuits to recover his SCI clearance. While awaiting his grievance to be addressed, he worked on less sensitive material and began receiving excellent performance reviews. In 1982, after the psychiatrist concluded Pollard had no mental illness, Pollard&#x27;s clearance was upgraded to SCI. In October 1984, after some re-organization of the Navy&#x27;s intelligence departments, Pollard applied for and was accepted into a job as an analyst for the Naval Intelligence Command.

==Espionage==
Soon after Pollard began working at NIC/TF-168, he met Aviem Sella, a combat veteran of the Israeli Air Force. At the time, Sella was on leave from his position as a colonel to gain a master&#x27;s degree in computer science as a graduate student at New York University. Pollard told Sella that he worked for U.S. naval intelligence, told him about specific incidents where U.S. intelligence was withholding information from Israel, and offered to work as a spy. Though Sella had wondered whether Pollard was part of an FBI operation to recruit an Israeli, he eventually believed him. Sella telephoned his air-force intelligence commander in Tel Aviv for further instructions, and the call was switched to the Air Force chief of staff. Sella was ordered to develop a contact with Pollard, but to be careful. He was warned that either the Americans were offering a &quot;dangle&quot; in order to root out foreign intelligence operations, or if this was a genuine spy, Sella would have to pay careful attention to his work.

Within a few days, in June 1984, Pollard started passing classified information to Sella. He was paid $10,000 cash and given a very expensive diamond and sapphire ring, which Pollard later offered to his girlfriend, Anne Henderson, when proposing to her. Pollard was paid well by the Israelis: he received a salary that eventually reached $2,500 () a month, and tens of thousands of dollars in cash disbursements for hotels, meals, and jewelry. In his pre-sentencing statement to Judge Robinson, Pollard said the money was a benefit that was forced on him. &quot;I did accept money for my services&quot;, he acknowledged, but only &quot;as a reflection of how well I was doing my job&quot;. He said that he had later told his controller, Rafi Eitan, a long-time spy who at the time headed Lekem, a scientific-intelligence unit in Israel, that, &quot;I not only intended to repay all the money I&#x27;d received, but, also, was going to establish a chair at the Israeli General Staff&#x27;s Intelligence Training Center outside Tel Aviv&quot;.

Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigator Ronald Olive has alleged that Pollard passed classified information to South Africa, and attempted, through a third party, to sell classified information to Pakistan on multiple occasions. Pollard also stole classified documents related to China on behalf of his wife, who used the information to advance her personal business interests. She kept these secret materials in the house, where investigating authorities discovered them when Pollard&#x27;s espionage activity was revealed.

During Pollard&#x27;s trial, the U.S. government&#x27;s memorandum in aid of sentencing challenged the &quot;defendant&#x27;s claim that he was motivated by altruism rather than greed&quot;. The government said that Pollard had &quot;disclosed classified information in anticipation of financial gain&quot; in other instances:

The government&#x27;s investigation has revealed that defendant provided to certain of his acquaintances U.S. classified documents which defendant obtained through U.S. Navy sources. The classified documents which defendant disclosed to two such acquaintances, both of whom are professional investment advisers, contained classified economic and political analyses which defendant believed would help his acquaintances render investment advice to their clients ... Defendant acknowledged that, although he was not paid for his unauthorized disclosures of classified information to the above-mentioned acquaintances, he hoped to be rewarded ultimately through business opportunities that these individuals could arrange for defendant when he eventually left his position with the U.S. Navy. In fact, defendant was involved in an ongoing business venture with two of these acquaintances at the time he provided the classified information to them ...
During the course of the Pollard trial, Australian authorities reported the disclosure of classified American documents by Pollard to a Royal Australian Navy officer who had been engaged in a personnel-exchange naval-liaison program between the U.S. and Australia. The Australian officer, alarmed by Pollard&#x27;s repeated disclosure to him of data caveated No Foreign Access Allowed, reported the indiscretions to his chain of command. It recalled the officer from his position in the U.S., fearing that the disclosures might be part of a &quot;CIA ruse&quot;. Confronted with this accusation after entering his plea, Pollard admitted only to passing a single classified document to the Australian; later, he changed his story, and claimed that his superiors ordered him to share information with the Australians.

, the full extent of the information Pollard passed to Israel has still not been officially revealed. Press reports cited a secret 46-page memorandum, which Pollard and his attorneys were allowed to view. They were provided to the judge by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who described Pollard&#x27;s spying as including, among other things, obtaining and copying the latest version of &quot;Radio-Signal Notations&quot; (RASIN), a 10-volume manual comprehensively detailing America&#x27;s global electronic surveillance network.

After Pollard&#x27;s release, the former deputy chief of the Mossad Ram Ben Barak publicly regretted Pollard, saying that the recruitment and operation &quot;were unknown by the intelligence leadership and unauthorized&quot; with the resultant damage to the US-Israeli relationship far outweighing the value of the intelligence Pollard provided. &quot;Our entire relationship with the U.S. deteriorated because of this. People lost jobs over it&quot;, according to Barak. &quot;It made for years and years of suspicion, with Americans suspecting he wasn&#x27;t the only one, and feeling that they hadn&#x27;t gotten the necessary explanations. They didn&#x27;t believe it wasn&#x27;t authorized. It caused huge, huge damage. They saw it as a betrayal of them.&quot;

==Capture==
Pollard&#x27;s espionage was nearly revealed in 1984 when a department chief noted a report on Soviet military equipment and questioned why it was germane to the office. Pollard, to whom the report was traced, was asked about it, and he replied that he had been working on terrorist networks, which was accepted as valid. In 1985, a co-worker anonymously reported Pollard&#x27;s removal of classified material from the NIC. The coworker noted that Pollard did not seem to be taking the material to any known appropriate destination, such as other intelligence agencies in the area. Although Pollard was authorized to transport documents and the coworker said the documents were wrapped properly, it appeared unusual that Pollard would be transporting documents on a Friday afternoon when there was little happening and people seemed to be focused on an upcoming long weekend. Ultimately, that report was not acted upon as it was felt it occurred within business hours and Pollard had business being in other offices.
In another instance Pollard&#x27;s direct superior, having to complete extra work at the office on a Saturday, had walked by Pollard&#x27;s desk and noticed unsecured classified material. Taking the initiative to secure it, the supervisor glanced over it and saw it was unrelated to antiterrorism matters in the Caribbean, with which the section was concerned. Looking at more unrelated documents, the supervisor believed foreign intelligence might be involved, but was unable to determine which nation might be interested.

Pollard was stopped and questioned by FBI agents about a week later while removing classified material from his work premises. He explained that he was taking it to another analyst at a different agency for a consultation. His story was checked and found to be false. Pollard requested a telephone call to his wife to tell her where he was. As the interview was voluntary, the investigators had no choice but to grant the request. During the call to Anne, Pollard used the code word &quot;cactus&quot;, signaling that he was in trouble, and that she should remove all classified material from their home. She attempted to do this, enlisting the help of a neighbor.

Pollard later agreed to a search of his home, which found the few documents which Anne had missed. At this time, the FBI decided to cede the case to Pollard&#x27;s supervisors, since they had uncovered only mishandling of documents, with no proof that Pollard was passing classified information. The case broke wide open a few days later, when Pollard was asked by his superiors to take a polygraph test. Instead, he admitted to passing documents illegally, without mentioning Israel. The FBI again became involved. A brief time later, Pollard&#x27;s neighbor, a naval officer, became concerned about safeguarding the suitcase full of highly classified material that Anne had given him, and began telephoning around the military intelligence community asking for advice. He cooperated fully with the investigation and was never charged with any crime.

After his partial confession, Pollard was surveilled, but not taken into custody. On November 21, 1985, he and his wife tried to gain asylum at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., but they were ordered to leave by Israeli guards. FBI agents arrested Pollard as soon as he left embassy property. His handler, Rafi Eitan, stated in a 2014 interview that Pollard had been warned that he was uncovered and that he had given him a prearranged signal to leave the United States, but instead Pollard &quot;wandered around for three days with them following him. He had many opportunities to do what I told him and he didn&#x27;t do it.&quot; Eitan claimed that he had given the order to evict Pollard from the embassy.

After Pollard&#x27;s arrest, Anne evaded an FBI agent who was following her, met Sella at a restaurant, and told him of her husband&#x27;s arrest. As a result, three Israeli diplomatic personnel involved in the operation were also informed: science attachés Yosef Yagur and Ilan Ravid, and embassy secretary Irit Erb. LAKAM had not foreseen this turn of events nor crafted escape plans, and they were told to flee immediately. The apartment where the documents stolen by Pollard were kept and copied was cleared out, and all four immediately fled Washington. Sella and his wife took a train to New York and caught a flight to London, Yagur fled to Canada, Erb to Mexico, and Ravid to Miami, from where they caught connecting flights to Israel. All were out of the United States in 24 hours. Anne was arrested the next day, November 22, 1985.

===Investigation===
Prior to Pollard&#x27;s plea bargain, the U.S. government began preparing a multi-count criminal indictment against him, which included drug offences and tax fraud along with espionage. The government alleged that Pollard used classified documents to unsuccessfully broker an arms deal with the governments of South Africa, Argentina, and Taiwan. FBI investigators also determined that Pollard met with three Pakistanis and an Iranian foreigner in an attempt to broker arms in 1985. Pollard eventually cooperated with investigators in exchange for a plea agreement for leniency for himself and his wife. Israel said initially that Pollard worked for an unauthorized rogue operation, which they maintained for more than ten years. They finally agreed to cooperate with the investigation in exchange for immunity for the Israelis involved.

When asked to return the stolen material, the Israelis reportedly supplied only a few dozen less sensitive documents. At the time, the Americans knew that Pollard had passed tens of thousands of documents.

The Israelis created a schedule designed to wear the American investigators down, including many hours per day of commuting in blacked-out buses on rough roads, and frequent switching of buses, leaving them without adequate time to sleep, and preventing them from sleeping on the commute. The identity of Pollard&#x27;s original handler, Sella, was withheld. All questions had to be translated into Hebrew and answered in Hebrew, and then translated back into English, even though all the parties spoke perfect English. The Commander Jerry Agee remembers that, even as he departed the airport, airport security informed him that &quot;you will never be coming back here again&quot;. After his return to the US, Agee found various items had been stolen from his luggage. The abuse came not only from the guards and officials, but also the Israeli media.

Sella was eventually indicted on three counts of espionage by a United States court. Israel refused to allow Sella to be interviewed unless he was granted immunity. The United States refused because of Israel&#x27;s previous failure to cooperate as promised. Israel refused to extradite Sella, instead giving him command of Tel Nof Airbase. The U.S. Congress responded by threatening to cut aid to Israel, at which point Sella voluntarily stepped down to defuse tensions.

During the morning of January 20, 2021, the last half-day of Donald Trump&#x27;s first presidential term, the White House announced that Trump had granted a full pardon to Sella. The announcement stated that the State of Israel had requested the pardon and had issued a full and unequivocal apology. The announcement also stated that Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer, United States ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Miriam Adelson had endorsed Sella&#x27;s request for clemency.

==Trial==
Pollard&#x27;s plea discussions with the government sought both to avoid a life sentence for him and to allow Anne Pollard to plead to lesser charges, which the government was otherwise unwilling to let her do. The government, however, did eventually offer Anne Pollard a plea agreement provided that Jonathan Pollard assist the government in its damage assessment. As part of this process, he agreed to polygraph examinations, and interviews with FBI agents and Department of Justice attorneys over a period of several months. During late May 1986, the government offered him a plea agreement, which he accepted. By the terms of that agreement, Pollard was required to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to deliver national defense information to a foreign government, which had a maximum prison term of life, and to cooperate fully with the government&#x27;s ongoing investigation. He promised not to disseminate any information concerning his crimes or his case, or to speak publicly about any classified information, without first receiving permission from the director of naval intelligence. He further agreed that failure of Anne Pollard to obey the terms of her agreement entitled the government to void his agreement, and vice versa. In return for Pollard&#x27;s plea, the government promised not to charge him with additional crimes.

Three weeks before Pollard&#x27;s sentencing, Wolf Blitzer, at the time a &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; correspondent, performed a jail-cell interview with Pollard. The interview formed the basis of Blitzer&#x27;s newspaper article, which was also printed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on February 15, 1987, under the headline &quot;Pollard: Not A Bumbler, but Israel&#x27;s Master Spy&quot;. Pollard told Blitzer about some of the information he provided the Israelis: reconnaissance satellite photography of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) headquarters in Tunisia, which was used for Operation Wooden Leg; specific capabilities of Libya&#x27;s air defenses; and &quot;the pick of U.S. intelligence about Arab and Islamic conventional and unconventional military activity, from Morocco to Pakistan and every country in between. This included both &#x27;friendly&#x27; and &#x27;unfriendly&#x27; Arab countries.&quot; Prosecutor Joseph diGenova presented the Blitzer prison interview as evidence in his sentencing memorandum that Pollard had engaged in &quot;unauthorized disclosure of classified information&quot;.

Prior to sentencing, Pollard and his wife Anne gave further defiant media interviews in which they defended their spying and attempted to rally Jewish Americans to their cause, diGenova said. In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview from prison, Anne said, &quot;I feel my husband and I did what we were expected to do, and what our moral obligation was as Jews, what our moral obligation was as human beings, and I have no regrets about that&quot;. 

On June 4, 1986, Pollard pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to deliver national defense information to a foreign government. Prior to sentencing, speaking on his own behalf, Pollard stated that while his motives &quot;may have been well meaning, they cannot, under any stretch of the imagination, excuse or justify the violation of the law, particularly one that involves the trust of government ... I broke trust, ruined and brought disgrace to my family.&quot; He admitted and apologized for taking money from the Israeli government in exchange for classified information. Anne Pollard, in her own statement, stated that she did &quot;what at the time I believed to be correct&quot; in helping her husband and attempting to conceal stolen documents, adding, &quot;And I can&#x27;t say that I would never help him again. However, I would look for different routes or different ways&quot;.

The prosecution answered these statements by saying that the Pollards had continued to violate numerous nondisclosure agreements even as the trial was occurring. The prosecutor, Joseph E. diGenova noted one in particular, which had been signed in June 1986, alluding to Pollard&#x27;s interview with Wolf Blitzer. The prosecutor concluded:
[I]n combination with the breadth of this man&#x27;s knowledge, the depth of his memory, and the complete lack of honor that he has demonstrated in these proceedings, I suggest to you, your honor, he is a very dangerous man.
&quot;The government did something highly suspicious by forgetting to send anyone to monitor these interviews&quot;, Esther Pollard said. &quot;Later, at sentencing, the prosecutor successfully inflamed the judge against Jonathan by falsely claiming that not only had the interviews been secretly arranged behind their backs, but that Jonathan had also disclosed highly classified material to Blitzer that compromised the intelligence community&#x27;s sources and methods.&quot;

===Sentencing and incarceration===
The Pollards&#x27; sentencing occurred on March 4, 1987. While the prosecutor, in compliance with the plea agreement, recommended that Pollard receive &quot;only a substantial number of years in prison&quot;, Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. was not obliged to follow the recommendation. Noting that Pollard had violated multiple conditions of the plea agreement, he imposed a life sentence on the basis of a classified damage-assessment memorandum submitted by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger.

Pollard was then moved from FCC Petersburg in Virginia, where he had been held since 1986, to a federal prison hospital in Springfield, Missouri, to undergo a battery of mental health tests. In June 1988, he was transferred to USP Marion and in 1993 to FCI Butner Medium at the Butner Federal Correction Complex in North Carolina. In May 1991, Pollard asked Avi Weiss to be his personal rabbi. Israeli Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu was also an advocate of Pollard, and campaigned for his release from prison.

Anne Pollard was sentenced to five years, but was paroled after three and a half years due to health problems. Pollard filed for divorce after Anne&#x27;s release. While he reportedly said that he expected to be jailed for the remainder of his life, and did not want Anne to be bound to him, Anne later told a reporter that the divorce papers were served with no warning or explanation of any kind.

After finalization of his divorce from Anne, Pollard allegedly married Esther &quot;Elaine&quot; Zeitz, a Canadian teacher and activist based in Toronto who had organized a campaign for his release. In 1996, she initiated a public hunger strike, but ended it 19 days later after meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who pledged to increase his efforts to secure Pollard&#x27;s release. Media sources and Pollard family members have questioned whether Pollard and Zeitz ever legally wed. Prison officials told &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; that there is no record of a marriage ceremony having been requested or performed. After completing her parole, Anne Pollard emigrated to Israel, where she lived in Tel Aviv on a government stipend supplemented by occasional private donations.

===Appeals===
In 1989, Pollard&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion for withdrawal of his guilty plea and trial by jury due to the government&#x27;s failure to abide by terms of the plea agreement. The motion was denied. An appeals court affirmed the denial. Several years later, with a different attorney, Pollard filed a petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled two-to-one to deny Pollard&#x27;s petition, due primarily to the failure of Pollard&#x27;s original attorneys to file his appeal in a timely manner. Judge Stephen F. Williams dissented, &quot;because the government&#x27;s breach of the plea agreement was a fundamental miscarriage of justice requiring relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255&quot;.

In July 2005, Pollard again filed a motion for a new trial, this time on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also sought access to classified documents pertinent to his new lawyers&#x27; efforts in preparing a clemency petition. The Court of Appeals rejected both arguments. During February 2006, his attorneys filed a petition for &quot;certiorari&quot; with the United States Supreme Court regarding access to the classified documents. They argued that the separation of powers doctrine is a flexible doctrine that does not dictate the complete separation of the three branches of Government from one another. The brief claimed that the Court of Appeals violated this principle in asserting &quot;sua sponte&quot; that the judiciary has no jurisdiction over the classified documents due to the fact that access was for the ultimate purpose of clemency, an executive function. The Supreme Court denied the cert petition in March 2006, ruling that the president&#x27;s clemency power would be wholly unaffected by successor counsel&#x27;s access to the classified documents, and that the classified documents were sealed by a protective order, a judicial procedure.

==Israeli efforts to secure Pollard&#x27;s release==
In 1988, Israel proposed a three-way exchange, wherein Pollard and his wife would be released and deported to Israel, Israel would release Soviet spy Marcus Klingberg, and the USSR would exercise its influence with Syria and Iran to release American hostages held there by Syrian- and Iranian-sponsored terrorist groups.

In 1990, Israel reportedly considered offering to release Yosef Amit, an Israeli military intelligence officer serving a 12-year sentence for spying for the United States and another NATO power, in exchange for Pollard. Sources conflict on the outcome: according to one, Amit made it known that he had no wish to be exchanged. By another account, Israeli officials vetoed the idea, fearing that it would only cause more anger in the United States. (Amit served his sentence and was released in 1993.)

During the 1990s former University of Notre Dame president Theodore Hesburgh, a family friend of Pollard&#x27;s, attempted to broker a deal whereby Pollard would be released, &quot;be banished to Israel&quot;, and would renounce his U.S. citizenship. Mike Royko of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote columns in February 1994 endorsing the idea. White House officials expressed little enthusiasm for Hesburgh&#x27;s plan, and he ceased further efforts.

During 1995, Israel again attempted to arrange a three-way exchange, this time involving American spies imprisoned in Russia: Israel would release Klingberg, the Russians would release U.S. agents who had remained in prison since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the United States would then free Pollard.

Israel&#x27;s official stance until 1998 was that Pollard worked for an unauthorized rogue organization. During May of that year, Premier Netanyahu admitted that Pollard had in fact been an Israeli agent, answering directly to high-ranking officials of Lekem, the Israeli Bureau for Scientific Relations. The Israeli government paid at least two of the attorneys—Richard A. Hibey and Hamilton Philip Fox III—working for his release.

During campaigning leading up to the 1999 Israeli general election, Netanyahu and his challenger Ehud Barak disputed in the media over which had been more supportive of Pollard. In 2002, Netanyahu visited Pollard in prison. In 2007 he pledged that, if re-elected Premier, he would obtain Pollard&#x27;s release.

In September 2009, Israeli State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss released a report stating that repeated petitions for Pollard&#x27;s release during a 20-year period had been rebuffed by the American government. The Pollard family criticized the report, terming it a &quot;whitewash&quot; of the Israeli government&#x27;s activities, although they agreed with its assertion that Pollard had been denied due legal process.

In June 2011, 70 members of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, endorsed the Pollard family&#x27;s request that President Obama allow Pollard to visit his ailing father, Morris. When Morris died soon afterward, Netanyahu announced Israel&#x27;s official endorsement for Pollard&#x27;s request to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. Both requests were denied.

In November 2014, Rafi Eitan, who directed Lekem from 1981 until its dissolution in 1986, admitted that he knew in advance of Pollard&#x27;s impending arrest in 1985 and alerted then-Premier Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Eitan says it was his decision to refuse Pollard&#x27;s request for asylum in the Israeli Embassy. When asked if Israeli officials were aware of Pollard&#x27;s espionage activities, he replied, &quot;Of course&quot;.

===Citizenship===
Pollard applied for Israeli citizenship in 1995; the Ministry of Interior initially refused on grounds that Israel did not grant citizenship to persons who had not yet immigrated, but reversed its decision and granted the petition on November 22, 1995.

Some sources claim that Pollard then renounced his United States citizenship, was now solely an Israeli citizen, and would be deported to Israel if he were released from prison. Others continue to identify him as a U.S. citizen. According to the United States Department of State, there are no peacetime regulations in effect under to empower the attorney general to process renunciations of citizenship from persons physically present in the United States, and by , it is not possible for a person to lose U.S. citizenship while physically present in the United States except by renunciation filed with the Attorney General, or conviction of treason.

On December 30, 2020, Jonathan Pollard and his wife officially immigrated to Israel and became full Israeli citizens.

==Official reactions and public pro-Pollard campaigns==

In addition to the release requests by the Israeli government, there was a long-running public campaign to free Pollard. The organizers include the Pollard family, his ex-wife, Anne, and Jewish groups in the U.S. and Israel. The campaign&#x27;s main points claimed that Pollard spied for an ally instead of an enemy, that his sentence was out of proportion to those given to others who committed similar crimes, and that the U.S. failed to live up to its plea bargain. Some Israeli activists compared President Bush to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders who have taken Israeli soldiers prisoner.

Some who feel the sentence was excessive claim that although Pollard pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain for himself and his wife, he was shown no leniency, and was given the maximum sentence with the exception of death; Pollard&#x27;s opponents answer that Pollard violated the terms of that plea agreement even before the sentence was given.

In 1993, political science professor and Orthodox Jewish activist David Luchins organized an unsuccessful appeal to President Bill Clinton to commute Pollard&#x27;s sentence. The appeal included a letter of remorse from Pollard in which he admitted violating both U.S. laws and Jewish religious tenets. Pollard later reportedly regretted his admission, suspecting that it worsened his chances for clemency. Pollard loyalists blamed Luchins, who received death threats and required federal protection for a period of time.

The issue of his imprisonment has sometimes arisen amidst Israeli domestic politics. Benjamin Netanyahu has been particularly vocal in lobbying for Pollard&#x27;s release, visiting Pollard in prison in 2002. He raised the issue with President Clinton during the Wye River peace talks in October 1998. In his autobiography, Clinton wrote that he favored releasing Pollard, but the objections of U.S. intelligence officials were too strong:
For all the sympathy Pollard generated in Israel, he was a hard case to push in America; he had sold our country&#x27;s secrets for money, not conviction, and for years had not shown any remorse. When I talked to Sandy Berger and George Tenet, they were adamantly opposed to letting Pollard go, as was Madeleine Albright.
Alan Dershowitz has been among Pollard&#x27;s well-known advocates, both in the courtroom as a lawyer and in various print media. Characterizing the sentence as &quot;excessive&quot;, Dershowitz writes in an article reprinted in his bestselling book &quot;Chutzpah&quot;, &quot;As an American, and as a Jew, I hereby express my outrage at Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s sentence of life imprisonment for the crime to which he pleaded guilty&quot;. Dershowitz writes:
[E]veryone seems frightened to speak up on behalf of a convicted spy. This has been especially true of the Jewish leadership in America. The Pollards are Jewish. ... The Pollards are also Zionists, who—out of a sense of misguided &quot;racial imperative&quot; (to quote Jonathan Pollard)—seem to place their commitment to Israeli survival over the laws of their own country. ... American Jewish leaders, always sensitive to the canard of dual loyalty, are keeping a low profile in the Pollard matter. Many American Jews at the grass roots are outraged at what they perceive to be an overreaction to the Pollards&#x27; crimes and the unusually long sentence imposed on Jonathan Pollard.
In 2012, Malcolm Hoenlein advocated for Pollards&#x27; release, saying &quot;27 years—he&#x27;s paid the price for his crimes. He has expressed remorse. Enough is enough. It&#x27;s time that he be let go—there is no justification that we can see for keeping him any longer, there&#x27;s no cause of justice, no security interest that could possibly be served&quot;.

In 2013, Rabbi Pesach Lerner, executive vice president of the National Council of Young Israel, cited hypocrisy of Pollard&#x27;s imprisonment in America after revelations of spying against U.S. allies by the United States intelligence agencies.

The Jerusalem City Council has also acted in advocacy of Pollard, changing the name of a square near the official premier&#x27;s residence from Paris Square to Freedom for Jonathan Pollard Square.

Pollard claimed that he provided only information that was vital to Israeli security, and that it was being withheld by the Pentagon, in violation of a 1983 memorandum of understanding between the two countries. The memorandum of understanding was an agreement between the United States and Israel regarding the sharing of vital security intelligence. According to Pollard, this included data on Soviet arms shipments to Syria, Iraqi and Syrian chemical weapons, the Pakistani atomic bomb project, and Libyan air defense systems. According to the declassified CIA 1987 damage assessment of the Pollard case, with the heading &quot;What the Israelis Did Not Ask For&quot;, the assessment notes that the Israelis &quot;never expressed interest in U.S. military activities, plans, capabilities, or equipment&quot;. Pollard&#x27;s defense claimed that Israel had the legal right to the information that Pollard passed to Israel based upon the 1983 Memorandum of understanding and the United States was violating that Memorandum.

Lee Hamilton, a former U.S. congressman from Indiana who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the time of Pollard&#x27;s sentencing, wrote an emotional letter to President Obama in 2011 endorsing commutation of Pollard&#x27;s sentence. &quot;I have been acquainted for many years with members of his family, especially his parents, and I know how much pain and anguish they have suffered because of their son&#x27;s incarceration&quot;, he wrote. Hamilton added that Pollard&#x27;s father, whose health was failing rapidly, deserved to see his son freed.

In 2010, representatives Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.), Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), and Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) wrote a letter that &quot;notes the positive impact that a grant of clemency would have in Israel, as a strong indication of the goodwill of our nation towards Israel and the Israeli people&quot;. In November 2010, Weiner stated: &quot;No one in the history of the United States who did something similar to Jonathan Pollard served a life sentence, nor should he&quot;.

Dennis B. Ross said in 2004: &quot;Pollard received a harsher sentence than others who committed comparable crimes&quot;. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger stated that &quot;[t]he Pollard matter was comparatively minor. It was made far bigger than its actual importance.&quot; Stephen Fain Williams, a Senior Circuit Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated: &quot;Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s life sentence represents a fundamental miscarriage of justice&quot;. In December 2010, former U.S. assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb said: &quot;In retrospect, we know that an injustice was done to Pollard ... the man is very sick and should be released before it is too late.&quot; 
Some of the accusations against Pollard can be traced to CIA mole Aldrich Ames, who allegedly blamed Pollard to clear himself of suspicion. Rafi Eitan, Pollard&#x27;s Israeli handler, stated that Pollard never exposed American agents in the USSR or elsewhere. Eitan said he believed Ames tried to blame Pollard to clear himself of suspicion.

On November 18, 2010, 39 members of Congress submitted a plea of clemency to the White House on behalf of Pollard, asking the president for his immediate release: &quot;We see clemency for Mr. Pollard as an act of compassion justified by the way others have been treated by our justice system.&quot; They stated how there has been a great disparity by the amount of time that Pollard has served and by others who were found guilty of similar activities.

Former White House Counsel, Bernard Nussbaum, wrote a letter on January 28, 2011, to President Obama stating that he extensively reviewed the Jonathan Pollard file while he served in the White House. In his letter, he stated, &quot;that a failure at this time to commute his sentence would not serve the course of justice; indeed, I respectfully believe, it would be a miscarriage of justice&quot;.

Former secretary of state George Shultz also wrote a letter to President Obama on January 11, 2011, urging that Pollard sentence to be commuted. He stated, &quot;I am impressed that the people who are best informed about the classified material he passed to Israel, former CIA Director James Woolsey and former Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Dennis DeConcini, favor his release&quot;.

In 2011, Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, declared that the time had come to commute the sentence of Pollard. On March 3, 2011, Kissinger wrote a letter to President Obama stating, &quot;Having talked with George Shultz and read the statements of former CIA Director Woolsey, former Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman DeConcini, former Defense Secretary Weinberger, former Attorney General Mukasey and others whose judgement and first-hand knowledge of the case I respect, I find their unanimous support for clemency compelling. I believe justice would be served by commuting the remainder of Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s sentence of life imprisonment&quot;.

Lawrence Korb, former Assistant Secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan, called on the Obama administration to grant clemency to Pollard:
Some now argue that Pollard should be released because it would improve U.S.-Israeli relations and enhance the prospects of success of the Obama administration&#x27;s Middle East peace process. Although that may be true, it is not the reason I and many others have recently written to the president requesting that he grant Pollard clemency. The reason is that Pollard has already served far too long for the crime for which he was convicted, and by now, whatever facts he might know would have little effect on national security.
In the words of Lawrence Korb, &quot;We believe that his continued incarceration constitutes a travesty of justice and a stain on the American system of justice.&quot;

Former vice president Dan Quayle wrote a letter to President Obama on January 31, 2011, urging him to commute Pollard&#x27;s sentence.

On February 16, 2011, Arlen Specter wrote a letter to President Obama, stating that, as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he believed Pollard should be pardoned. Specter was the second chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (the first was Dennis DeConcini) to publicly advocate Pollard&#x27;s release.

On March 22, 2011, more than one hundred New York State legislators signed a petition to President Obama stating, &quot;that we see clemency for Mr. Pollard as an act of compassion justified by the way others have been treated by our justice system&quot;.

Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council, wrote a letter to President Obama on December 26, 2012, formally requesting that he commute Pollard&#x27;s sentence. She stated that he has expressed great remorse. She wrote, &quot;I know I share similar views with many past and current American elected officials&quot; and &quot;therefore, I respectfully urge you to use your constitutional power to treat Mr. Pollard the way others have been treated by our nation&#x27;s justice system&quot;.

In August 2011 Barney Frank sought permission from Congress to discuss the incarceration of Jonathan Pollard and called on Barack Obama to &quot;answer the many calls for Pollard&#x27;s immediate release&quot;. Frank said Pollard has paid a price much higher than anyone else that spied for a friend of the United States and more than many who spied for its enemies.

Congressman Allen West from Florida, wrote a letter to President Obama on June 2, 2011, stating, &quot;After serving 26 years behind bars, Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s health is deteriorating, as is his wife&#x27;s. If we can consent to the release by the British of the Lockerbie bomber back to Libya due to health concern, how can we justify keeping Mr. Pollard behind bars when his crimes were clearly not as serious as a terrorist who murdered hundreds of Americans?&quot;

On October 26, 2011, a bi-partisan group of 18 retired U.S. senators wrote to President Obama urging him to commute Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s prison sentence to time served. The letter included senators who initially opposed his release. In the letter, it stated, &quot;Mr. Pollard will complete his 26th year of incarceration on November 21, 2011 and begin his 27th year of an unprecedented life sentence (seven of which were spent in solitary confinement). He was indicted on one count of passing classified information to an ally without intent to harm the United States—an offense that normally results in a 2–4 year sentence. He pled guilty under a plea agreement with which he fully complied, but which was ignored by the sentencing judge. Mr. Pollard is the only person in the history of the U.S. to receive a life sentence for passing classified information to an ally.&quot; They conclude, &quot;It is patently clear that Mr. Pollard&#x27;s sentence is severely disproportionate and (as several federal judges have noted) a gross miscarriage of justice.&quot;

In a letter to the editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, published on July 5, 2012, James Woolsey wrote that he now endorses release of the convicted spy for Israel, citing the passage of time: &quot;When I recommended against clemency, Pollard had been in prison less than a decade. Today he has been incarcerated for over a quarter of a century under his life sentence.&quot; He pointed out that of the more than 50 recently convicted Soviet and Chinese spies, only two received life sentences, and two-thirds were sentenced to less time than Pollard has served so far. He further stated that &quot;Pollard has cooperated fully with the U.S. government, pledged not to profit from his crime (e.g., from book sales), and has many times expressed remorse for what he did.&quot; Woolsey expressed his belief that Pollard is still imprisoned only because he is Jewish. He said, &quot;anti-Semitism played a role in the continued detention of Pollard.&quot; &quot;For those hung up for some reason on the fact that he&#x27;s an American Jew, pretend he&#x27;s a Greek- or Korean- or Filipino-American and free him&quot;, Woolsey, who is not Jewish, said in his letter to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Angelo Codevilla, who has studied the Pollard case since serving as a senior staff member for the Senate intelligence committee from 1978 to 1985, argued that the swarm of accusations against Pollard over the years is implausible. On November 15, 2013, Professor Codevilla wrote a letter to President Obama, stating, &quot;Others have pointed out that Pollard is the only person ever sentenced to life imprisonment for passing information to an ally, without intent to harm America, a crime which normally carries a sentence of 2–4 years; and that this disproportionate sentence in violation of a plea agreement was based &quot;not on the indictment&quot;, but on a memorandum that was never shared with the defense. This is not how American justice is supposed to work.&quot; In an interview to the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, Codevilla stated, &quot;The story of the Pollard case is a blot on American justice.&quot; The life sentence &quot;makes you ashamed to be an American&quot;.

Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich endorsed releasing Pollard.

According to American intelligence expert John Loftus, former U.S. government prosecutor and army intelligence officer, Pollard could not have revealed the identities of American spies, as Pollard lacked the security clearance to access this information. In the opinion of Loftus, &quot;Pollard&#x27;s continued incarceration is due to horrible stupidity&quot;.

===Official requests for clemency===
Yitzhak Rabin was the first Israeli premier to intervene on Pollard&#x27;s behalf; in 1995, he petitioned President Bill Clinton for a pardon. Other requests ensued. At a critical juncture in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations at the Wye River Conference in 1998, Premier Benjamin Netanyahu attempted to make the outcome contingent on Pollard&#x27;s release. &quot;If we signed an agreement with Arafat, I expected a pardon for Pollard&quot;, he wrote. Clinton later confirmed in his memoir that he tentatively agreed to the condition, &quot;but I would have to check with our people&quot;. When that information was made public, the American intelligence community responded immediately, with unequivocal anger. Seven former Secretaries of Defense—Donald Rumsfeld, Melvin R. Laird, Frank C. Carlucci, Richard B. Cheney, Caspar W. Weinberger, James R. Schlesinger and Elliot L. Richardson—along with several senior congressional leaders, publicly voiced their vigorous opposition to any form of clemency. Central Intelligence Agency director George J. Tenet initially denied reports that he had threatened to resign if Pollard were to be released, but eventually confirmed that he had. Other Clinton advisors, including Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger, were &quot;adamantly opposed&quot; to clemency as well. Clinton, who had not expected such forceful opposition, told Netanyahu that Pollard&#x27;s release could not be a condition of the agreement, and ordered a formal review of Pollard&#x27;s case. Dennis Ross confirmed Clinton&#x27;s version of events in his book &quot;The Missing Peace&quot;.

Another Israeli request was made in New York on September 14, 2005, and refused by President George W. Bush. A request that Pollard be designated a Prisoner of Zion was rejected by the High Court of Justice of Israel on January 16, 2006. Another appeal for intervention on Pollard&#x27;s behalf was rejected by the High Court on March 20, 2006.

On January 10, 2008, the subject of Pollard&#x27;s pardon was again brought up for discussion, this time by Premier Ehud Olmert, during President George W. Bush&#x27;s first visit to Israel as president. Subsequently, this request was refused by President Bush. The next day, at a dinner attended by several ministers of the Israeli government (in addition to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice), the subject of Pollard&#x27;s release was again discussed. This time, however, Premier Olmert commented that it was not the appropriate occasion to discuss Pollard&#x27;s fate.

As President Bush was about to leave office in 2009, Pollard himself requested clemency for the first time. In an interview in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, former CIA director James Woolsey endorsed Pollard&#x27;s release on two conditions: that he show contrition and refuse any profits from books or other projects associated with the case. Bush did not pardon him.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on September 21, 2010, that the Israeli government (again under Netanyahu) proposed informally that Pollard be released as a reward to Israel for extending by three months a halt to new settlements in occupied territories.

On January 24, 2011, Netanyahu submitted the first formal public request for clemency in the form of a letter to President Obama. In 2012, President Shimon Peres presented to Obama a letter signed by 80 Israeli legislators, requesting Pollard&#x27;s release on behalf of the citizens of Israel. In November 2013, Jewish Agency chairman Natan Sharansky said, &quot;It is unprecedented in the history of the U.S. that someone who spied for a friendly country served even half the time [that Pollard has] in prison.&quot;

During late March 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly offered to release Pollard as an incentive to Israel to resume negotiations with the Palestinians toward the formation of a Palestinian state. The White House, however, announced that no decision had been made on any agreement involving Pollard.

In October 2014, Elyakim Rubinstein, an Israeli Supreme Court Justice, former attorney general, and the acting Israeli ambassador to the US at the time of Pollard&#x27;s arrest, advocated for Pollard&#x27;s pardon. He said &quot;Mistakes were made, mainly by the Israelis, but by the Americans as well, and 29 years [is] enough.&quot;

In a November 2014 letter to President Obama, a group of American officials, including former CIA director James Woolsey, former Assistant U.S. Defense Secretary Lawrence Korb, and former U.S. National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, criticized the &quot;unjust denial of parole&quot; for Pollard whose &quot;grossly disproportionate sentence continues&quot;. They termed the charge used to keep him imprisoned &quot;patently false&quot;.

====Opposition====
Critics allege that Pollard&#x27;s espionage, which compromised elements of four major intelligence systems, damaged American national security much more than was ever publicly acknowledged. They have charged that he was motivated not by patriotism or concern for Israel&#x27;s security, but by greed; that Israel paid him well, and he spent the money on cocaine, alcohol, and expensive meals. Many intelligence officials are convinced that at least some of the information Pollard sold to Israel was acquired eventually by the USSR, although officials interviewed by investigative journalist Seymour Hersh acknowledged that they had no good evidence. In 1999, Hersh summarized the case against Pollard in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Four former directors of Naval Intelligence—William Studeman, Sumner Shapiro, John L. Butts, and Thomas Brooks—issued a public response to the call for clemency, and what they termed &quot;the myths that have arisen from this clever public relations campaign ... aimed at transforming Pollard from greedy, arrogant betrayer of the American national trust into Pollard, committed Israeli patriot&quot;:



Shapiro stated that he was troubled by the endorsements by Jewish organizations for Pollard: &quot;We work so hard to establish ourselves and to get where we are, and to have somebody screw it up ... and then to have Jewish organizations line up behind this guy and try to make him out a hero of the Jewish people, it bothers the hell out of me.&quot;

Ron Olive, retired Naval Criminal Investigative Service, directed the Pollard investigation. In his 2006 book, &quot;Capturing Jonathan Pollard: How One of the Most Notorious Spies in American History Was Brought to Justice&quot;, Olive wrote that Pollard did not serve Israel solely, but admitted passing secrets to South Africa, and to his financial advisers, and to shopping his access to Pakistan and other countries. Olive wrote that Pollard also stole classified documents related to China that his wife used to advance her personal business interests and attempted to broker arms deals with South Africa, Argentina, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Iran. Pollard&#x27;s advocates deny these claims citing the 166-page CIA Damage Assessment Report which they say indicates he only passed information to Israel pertaining to Israeli security. Pollard wrote in his defense memorandum that his wife never profited from his espionage. The reports were declassified in 2012.

&quot;New Republic&quot; editor Martin Peretz also argued against freeing Pollard: &quot;Jonathan Pollard is not a Jewish martyr. He is a convicted espionage agent who spied on his country for both Israel and Pakistan (!)—a spy, moreover, who got paid for his work. His professional career, then, reeks of infamy and is suffused with depravity.&quot; Peretz called Pollard&#x27;s supporters &quot;professional victims, mostly brutal themselves, who originate in the ultra-nationalist and religious right. They are insatiable. And they want America to be Israel&#x27;s patsy.&quot;

Former FBI and U.S. Navy lawyer M.E. &quot;Spike&quot; Bowman, a top legal adviser to navy intelligence at the time of Pollard&#x27;s arrest who had intimate knowledge of the Pollard case, issued a detailed critique in 2011 of the case for clemency. &quot;Because the case never went to trial, it is difficult for outside observers to understand the potential impact and complexity of the Pollard betrayal&quot;, he wrote. &quot;There is no doubt that Pollard was devoted to Israel. However, the extent of the theft and the damage was far broader and more complex than evidenced by the single charge and sentence.&quot; In his estimation, Pollard &quot;was neither a U.S. nor an Israeli patriot. He was a self-serving, gluttonous character seeking financial reward and personal gratification.&quot;

In September 2011, according to one report, Vice President Joe Biden—who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time of Pollard&#x27;s arrest—told a group of rabbis, &quot;President Obama was considering clemency, but I told him, &#x27;Over my dead body are we going to let him out before his time. If it were up to me, he would stay in jail for life&#x27;.&quot; Biden later denied having used those precise words, but acknowledged that the report characterized his position accurately.

==Parole==
Laws in effect at the time of Pollard&#x27;s sentencing mandated that federal inmates serving life sentences be paroled after 30 years of incarceration if no significant prison regulations had been violated, and if there was a &quot;reasonable probability&quot; that the inmate would not re-offend. On July 28, 2015, the United States Parole Commission announced that Pollard would be released on November 20, 2015. The U.S. Justice Department informed Pollard&#x27;s legal team that it would not contest the Parole Commission&#x27;s unanimous July 7 decision.

The terms of release set by the Parole Commission stipulated that Pollard must remain on parole for a minimum of five years. His parole restrictions required him to remain in New York City unless granted special permission to travel outside. His parole officer was also authorized to impose a curfew and set exclusion zones within the city. He was ordered to wear electronic monitoring devices to track his movements. In addition, press interviews and Internet access without prior permission were prohibited. Pollard&#x27;s attorneys appealed the conditions to the Parole Commission&#x27;s appeals board, which eliminated only one restriction, that of requiring prior permission to use the Internet. However, it was ruled that his Internet use would be subjected to monitoring. Pollard&#x27;s attorneys and Ayelet Shaked, Israel&#x27;s Justice Minister, urged President Obama to exercise his powers of clemency to waive Pollard&#x27;s parole requirements and allow him to relocate to Israel immediately; but a spokesman for the White House&#x27;s National Security Council announced that the president would not intervene.

After his release on November 20, 2015, as scheduled, Pollard relocated to an apartment secured for him by his attorneys in New York City. A 7:00 pm to 7:00 am curfew was imposed on him. A job offer, as a research analyst at a Manhattan investment company, was retracted due to the inspections to which his employer&#x27;s computers would be subjected. His attorneys immediately filed a motion challenging the terms of his parole, arguing that the Internet restrictions rendered him unemployable as an analyst, and the GPS-equipped ankle bracelet was unnecessary, as he was not a flight risk. The filing included affidavits from McFarlane and former Senate Intelligence Committee member Dennis DeConcini declaring that any secrets learned by Pollard thirty years ago were no longer secret, and had no value today. On August 12, 2016, a federal judge denied the motion on the basis of a statement from James Clapper, the director of U.S. National Intelligence, asserting that contrary to the MacFarlane and DeConcini affidavits, much of the information stolen by Pollard during the 1980s remained secret. The judge also cited Pollard&#x27;s Israeli citizenship, obtained during his incarceration, as evidence that he was indeed a flight risk.

A bill introduced in the Knesset in November 2015 would, if passed, authorize the Israeli government to fund Pollard&#x27;s housing and medical expenses, and pay him a monthly stipend, for the remainder of his life. Reports that the Israelis had already been paying Pollard and his ex-wife during his incarceration were denied. After numerous delays, the bill was withdrawn from consideration in March 2016 at the request of Premier Netanyahu and Israeli security officials, citing &quot;diplomatic and security reasons&quot;.

During March 2017, Pollard&#x27;s attorneys petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse the August 2016 lower-court decision denying his request for more lenient parole restrictions. They argued that the prohibition against leaving his residence between 7 pm and 7 am forced him to violate Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and that surveillance of his computers prevented him from working at a job consistent with his education and intelligence. They further asserted that Pollard could not possibly remember information he saw before his arrest, and in any case, the parole conditions arbitrarily limited his computer usage, but not his ability to transfer information by other means. Netanyahu also reportedly renewed his request for a parole waiver during a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. In May 2017, the court rejected the appeal, ruling that the parole conditions minimized the risk of harm he continued to pose to U.S. intelligence.

On November 20, 2020, Pollard&#x27;s parole restrictions expired. The US Justice Department refused to extend the restrictions.

==Emigration to Israel==
Although Pollard expressed a desire to relocate to Israel, he did not immediately do so after his parole expired due to his wife&#x27;s health issues, and remained in the US for over a month while she underwent chemotherapy for breast cancer. Pollard and his wife, Esther, finally arrived in Israel on December 30, 2020, on a private jet owned by US billionaire Sheldon Adelson. They were greeted on arrival by Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu, who handed Pollard his Israeli documentation. Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said that Pollard would be granted a government stipend equivalent to the pensions granted to former Mossad and Shin Bet agents. In accordance with COVID-19 restrictions, they went into quarantine for two weeks after their arrival. Pollard and his wife settled in Jerusalem. Esther Pollard died on January 31, 2022. She had been hospitalized for two weeks after contracting COVID-19.

Pollard was honored by Mayor of Jerusalem Moshe Lion at a Jerusalem Day gala in 2021. Pollard gave the main address to the gala, in which he accused the U.S. government of anti-Semitism, termed the U.S State Department and the United Nations enemies of Israel, and referred to the Biden administration as &quot;Amalek&quot;. In Jewish tradition, the 613 commandments mandates that Amalekites must be killed.

Pollard refused an offer to campaign for the Knesset on the Otzma Yehudit party&#x27;s electoral slate in the 2022 Israeli legislative election, saying that he had &quot;suffered enough&quot;.

During mid-September 2022, Pollard announced his engagement to Rivka Abrahams-Donin, a widowed mother of seven children. They married on October 20.

On November 23, 2023, Pollard posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Israel should have arrested the families of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas during the Israel–Hamas war to prevent them from interfering in Israel&#x27;s war plans. In February 2024, he advocated moving the entire Arab population out of Gaza, preferably to Ireland.

==In popular culture==

Pollard&#x27;s story inspired the movie &quot;Les Patriotes&quot; (&quot;The Patriots&quot;) by French director Éric Rochant in which American actor Richard Masur portrayed a character resembling Pollard.
Pollard&#x27;s story inspired the stage play &quot;The Law of Return&quot; by playwright Martin Blank, which was produced Off-Broadway at the 4th Street Theater NYC. Blank is also developing a screenplay for the film adaptation of the play.

Beit Yonatan, an Israeli-owned apartment building in Silwan, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem, is named after Pollard.

Street artist Solomon Souza added Pollard&#x27;s portrait to his collection of spray paint art at the Mahane Yehuda Market after Pollard&#x27;s release.

In 1995, a play named &quot;Pollard&quot; (alternatively titled &quot;Pollard&#x27;s Trial&quot;) debuted at the Cameri Theatre in Tel Aviv. It was performed at the Knesset in 2011. The part of Pollard was played by Israeli actor Rami Baruch.

In 2012, SHI 360 released the song &quot;Yonathan&quot;.

In the 1994 novel &quot;The Fist of God&quot; by Frederick Forsyth, the recent case of Pollard&#x27;s espionage is a source of mild tension between the Mossad and the CIA.

<doc id="285658" wikidata="Q5176544" url="?curid=285658" title="Council of the North">
<text>The Council of the North was an administrative body first set up in 1484 by King Richard III of England, to improve access to conciliar justice in Northern England. This built upon steps by King Edward IV of England in delegating authority in the north to Richard, duke of Gloucester (i.e. before Richard himself became king), and in establishing the Council of Wales and the Marches.

It was based in Yorkshire throughout its history: first at Sheriff Hutton Castle and at Sandal Castle, and then at King&#x27;s Manor, York. Henry VIII re-established the council after the English Reformation, when the north became identified with Roman Catholicism. It was abolished in 1641, just before the English Civil War.

==History==
===First creation===
The first &#x27;council in the north&#x27; was established in 1484 by King Richard III of England. The council was administered from Sheriff Hutton. Richard placed the council in the hands of John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, who was charged with control primarily of Yorkshire. A sudden decline in numbers of cases from the far northern counties appearing in the court of king&#x27;s bench at this time may indicate that in the middle and late 1480s litigants from Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland diverted certain legal affairs to this new council.

After Richard&#x27;s death the council was re-established by Henry VII in 1489, nominally led by the king&#x27;s young son Arthur Tudor. After Arthur&#x27;s early death it existed as a sporadically constituted body to deal with pressing issues. The council was led by Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York from shortly after his appointment as Archbishop in 1501 until his death in 1507. During this time he clashed with Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, one of the most powerful noblemen in the north of England. Northumberland had wanted several of the positions on the council to go to his supporters but was unable to secure these positions, he had also frequently clashed with two of the Archbishop&#x27;s household officers Sir John Hotham and Sir Robert Constable. The Archbishop&#x27;s and the Earl&#x27;s retinues notably clashed on the road out of Fulford near York in 1504 and the Archbishop&#x27;s career declined after this point, although he maintained leadership of the council. Following the death of Savage most of the administration of the north was handled by the king&#x27;s mother Margaret Beaufort via a council based in the Midlands.

===Re-creation===
The council was re-established by Henry VIII in 1537, after a period when the north was governed by a less formally constituted council led by Henry Fitzroy. It was established to administer royal justice in the northern parts of England – Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Northumberland.

Resistance to the Reformation was the spur to the recreation of the council. Resentment arose in the north following the English Reformation, the Church of England&#x27;s split from Rome and the dissolution of the Monasteries. In the north, most people&#x27;s faith remained staunchly Roman Catholic and many were unhappy with changes. A rebellion rose up in York creating a 30,000 strong Catholic army, carrying crosses and banners depicting the Holy Wounds. This movement became known as the Pilgrimage of Grace.

It was promised that the rebels would be pardoned and a parliament would be held in York to discuss their demands. The rebels, convinced that monasteries would be reopened, returned to their homes. However, after the failed Rebellion by Sir Francis Bigod, Henry had an excuse to arrest rebel leaders and to execute 200 people involved. Suppression followed the Pilgrimage of Grace. The council was reorganised again in 1538 under Robert Holgate as President. It organised four sessions annually, in York, Durham, Newcastle and Hull.

After York Abbey&#x27;s dissolution, founded by the Lord of Richmond as St Mary&#x27;s, its abbot&#x27;s house was retained by the king and allocated it to the council in 1539. The building is now called King&#x27;s Manor.

===Abolition===
In 1620, Thomas Wentworth gave a famous speech to the council in which he emphasised &quot;authority of the king&quot; as the basis for social order: &quot;the keystone which closeth up the arch of government&quot;. By 1640, the council was no longer perceived as a centralising royal power agent in the north, but rather as a potential locus of resistance. Edward Hyde advocated the council&#x27;s abolition. The Long Parliament abolished the council in 1641 for reasons relating to the Reformation: the council was a chief supporter of Catholic Recusants.

<text>Richard Allen (February 14, 1760March 26, 1831) was a minister, educator, writer, and one of the United States&#x27; most active and influential black leaders. In 1794, he founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent Black denomination in the United States. He opened his first AME church in 1794 in Philadelphia.

Elected the first bishop of the AME Church in 1816, Allen focused on organizing a denomination in which free black people could worship without racial oppression and enslaved people could find a measure of dignity. He worked to upgrade the social status of the black community, organizing Sabbath schools to teach literacy and promoting national organizations to develop political strategies. Allen said, &quot;We will never separate ourselves voluntarily from the slave population in this country; they are our brethren, and we feel there is more virtue in suffering privations with them than a fancied advantage for a season.&quot; The AME Church proliferated among the freed blacks in the Southern United States.

==Early life and freedom==
He was born into slavery on February 14, 1760, on the Delaware property of Benjamin Chew. When he was a child, Allen and his family were sold to Stokley Sturgis, who had a plantation. Because of financial problems, he sold Richard&#x27;s mother and two of his five siblings. Allen had an older brother and sister left with him, and the three began to attend meetings of the local Methodist Society, which was welcoming to enslaved and free Black people. They were encouraged by their enslaver, Sturgis, although he was unconverted. Richard taught himself to read and write. He joined the Methodists at 17. He began evangelizing, attracting criticism and anger from local enslavers.

Allen and his brother then redoubled their efforts for Sturgis to deflect criticism of religion&#x27;s influence on enslaved people.

The Reverend Freeborn Garrettson, who, in 1775, had freed the people he had enslaved, began to preach in Delaware. He was among many Methodist and Baptist ministers who encouraged enslavers to emancipate the people they enslaved after the American Revolutionary War. When Garrettson visited the Sturgis plantation to preach, Allen&#x27;s master was persuaded that slavery was wrong, and offered enslaved people an opportunity to buy their freedom. Allen performed extra work to earn money and bought his freedom in 1780. He then changed his name from &quot;Negro Richard&quot; to &quot;Richard Allen.&quot;

==Marriage and family==
Allen&#x27;s first wife was named Flora. They were married on October 19, 1790. She worked very closely with him during the early years of establishing the church, from 1787 to 1799. They attended church school and worked together, purchasing land donated to the church or rented out to families. Flora died on March 11, 1801, after a long illness. Scholars do not know if they had any children. After moving to Philadelphia, Allen married Sarah Bass, a formerly enslaved person from Virginia. She had moved to Philadelphia as a child, and the couple met around 1800. Richard and Sarah Allen had six children. Sarah Allen was highly active in what became the AME Church and is called the &quot;Founding Mother.&quot;..

==Ministry==

Allen was qualified as a preacher and admitted in December 1784 at the famous &quot;Christmas Conference&quot;, the founding and considered to be the first General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in North America. Held at the old original Lovely Lane Chapel meeting house on the narrow lane off modern South Calvert and German (now Redwood) Streets in old Baltimore Town, (now Downtown Baltimore), largest town/city and port in Maryland. He was one of the two Black attendees of the Conference along with legendary Harry (&quot;Black Harry&quot;) Hosier, (c. 1750–1806), but neither could vote during deliberations in Lovely Lane. Allen was then allowed to lead services at 5 a.m., mainly attended by Black people. But as preacher Allen had family responsibilities, eschewing future Bishop Francis Asbury (1745–1816), Irishman Robert Strawbridge (c. 1732–c. 1781?), and &quot;Black Harry&quot; Hosier&#x27;s practices of horseback circuit riding routes to rural country churches and &quot;Bible stations&quot;, visiting far off parsons and &quot;living in the saddle&quot;, so he moved northeast to Philadelphia, a center of free Black people and the biggest city in the new United States and second only to London in the English-speaking world.

Two years later, in 1786, Allen became a preacher at St. George&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia but was restricted to the early-morning services. As he attracted more Black congregants, the church vestry ordered them to be held in a separate area for worship. Allen regularly preached on the commons (central park) near the church, slowly gaining a congregation of nearly 50 and supporting himself with a variety of odd jobs.

Allen and Absalom Jones, also a Methodist preacher, resented the white congregants&#x27; leaders&#x27; segregation of blacks for worship and prayer. They left St. George&#x27;s to create an independent, self-reliant worship place for African Americans in the large cosmopolitan capital city. Unfortunately, that brought on some opposition from the white church as well as the more established Black people of the community who wanted to merely &quot;fit in&quot; or not stir up any hard feelings.

In protest in 1787 (the same famous summer with the Constitutional Convention holding locked-in sessions in the old Pennsylvania State House, now frequently called &quot;Independence Hall&quot;, with delegates from the &quot;13 Original States&quot;), Allen and Jones led the Black members out of the St. George&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church. They formed the Free African Society (F.A.S.), a non-denominational mutual aid society that assisted fugitive enslaved people from the Southern United States and new migrants coming into the city of Philadelphia. Allen and Absalom Jones, William Gray, and William Wilcher found an available lot on Sixth Street near Lombard Street. Allen negotiated a price and purchased this lot in 1787 to build a church, but it was several years before they had a building. Now occupied by Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, it is the oldest parcel of real estate in the United States that has been owned continuously by African Americans.

Over time, most of the F.A.S. members chose to return to the spiritual home of their youth and forefathers and affiliate with the neighborhood parishes of the former Church of England as it slowly recovered from the wartime bitterness of the Revolution after the British ministry government ending the War in the Treaty of Paris ratified in 1783 by the Confederation Congress in Annapolis. The Anglicans, which had reorganized themselves in a newly independent America now after the Peace in 1785 with nine dioceses on the East Coast / Atlantic Ocean shores meeting and uniting in their first General Convention as renamed &quot;The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America&quot; (later known simply today as &quot;The Episcopal Church, U.S.A.&quot;), with the old familiar Elizabethan era old English texts in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, with some minor revisions in the first American edition of 1789, replacing prayers for His Royal Majesty, the King, and ministers to those for the new president, members of the Congress, Governors and lawful state Commonwealth officials. Many Black people and &quot;Methodists&quot; in Philadelphia had been Anglicans since the 1740s. It was only during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and with the part-time occupation of Philadelphia as the &quot;Patriots&quot; / rebels&#x27; capital by the British Army that drove out most of the old English/British ministers of the old Anglican faith (priests)
During the 1793 yellow fever epidemic, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones helped to organize free blacks as essential workers to care for the sick and deal with the dead. They were appealed to by respected physician Benjamin Rush. Amid fierce debates over the causes of the disease and its potential for contagion, Rush incorrectly believed that yellow fever was not contagious and that it would be less likely to affect people of color. Allen himself worked with the sick and dying, caught yellow fever, and nearly died. In the fall of 1793, the epidemic eased as temperatures dropped and the mosquitoes that carried the disease died. In 1794, Allen and Jones published and copyrighted the pamphlet &quot;A narrative of the proceedings of the black people, during the late awful calamity in Philadelphia, in the year 1793: and a refutation of some censures, thrown upon them in some late publications.&quot; They confronted accounts of the epidemic that accused the black community of being greedy opportunists, and that perpetuated the myth that African Americans had not been affected by the disease.

Allen and others founded the African Church with Absalom Jones leading services and preaching the Word. It was accepted as a parish congregation and opened its doors on July 17, 1794, known as the &quot;African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas&quot;. The following year, 1795, the now Rev. Mr. Absalom Jones was ordained as a Deacon (one of the earliest in American Episcopal/Anglican Church history), and nine years later, in 1804, he became the first Black person ordained in the United States as a Priest / Presbyter (Pastor) of The Episcopal Church, U.S.A.

Allen and others wanted to continue in the more straightforward and more evangelical Methodist practices inspired by George Whitefield, John Wesley, and his brother Charles Wesley. Practices and traditions that had initially been brought from England by Francis Asbury, Robert Strawbridge and interpreted in America by Daniel Coke, Daniel Alexander Phelps. Allen called their congregation the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.), and over time, it became known as &quot;Mother Bethel&quot; Church. Converting a blacksmith shop on Sixth Street, the leaders opened the doors of Bethel A.M.E. Church on July 29, 1794. At first, it was affiliated with the larger Methodist Episcopal Church, as organized in Baltimore in 1784. The Philadelphia congregation had to rely on visiting white ministers to consecrate the bread and wine / sacred elements in the Sunday worship service of Holy Communion / &quot;Eucharist. Otherwise, as a Deacon, he could lead services reading the Scriptures, preaching sermons, and leading the assembled prayers and intercessions; in recognition of his leadership and preaching, Allen was ordained as the first Black Methodist minister/elder by Bishop Francis Asbury of the M.E. Church in 1799. He and the &quot;Mother Bethel&quot; congregation still had to continue to negotiate with white oversight and deal with white elders of the predominantly white Methodist Episcopal Church denomination. A decade after its founding, the Bethel A.M.E. Church of Philadelphia had 457 members, and by 1813, it had risen amazingly to 1,272.

In April 1816, 22 years after the organizing of &quot;Mother Bethel&quot; congregation in 1794, Rev. Allen called for a general conference meeting in Philadelphia and proposed the uniting of the five African-American congregations then existing in the eastern areas of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia; Langhorne/Attleborough, Pennsylvania; Salem, New Jersey; Delaware and Baltimore, Maryland. Together, they founded the independent denomination of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E. Church), the first fully independent Black denomination in the United States. On April 10, 1816, the other ministers elected Allen as their first Bishop, and he served in the episcopal office for 15 years until his passing, but 37 years total ministering to &quot;Mother Bethel&quot; of Philadelphia. The African Methodist Episcopal Church is Black America&#x27;s oldest and largest formal institution.

From 1797 until his 1831 death, Bishop Allen and his wife Sarah operated a station in the &quot;City of Brotherly Love&quot; on the Underground Railroad on the East Coast line for fugitive enslaved people fleeing from further south in the slave and border states of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

==Preaching==

The social themes of Bishop Allen&#x27;s preaching were abolition, colonization, education, and temperance. The preaching style was rarely expository or written to be read, but the subject was delivered in an evangelical and extemporized manner that demanded action rather than meditation. The tone was persuasive, not didactic.

==Activism outside the church==
Richard Allen was active in the Philadelphia abolitionist movement. In December 1799, Richard Allen, Absalom Jones, and sixty-nine other Black Philadelphians sent a petition to Congress urging the end of the international slave trade and a gradual emancipation plan. The petition also addressed the rights of free black men. The signers asserted the citizenship of Black Americans and demanded protection against kidnapping under the Fugitive Slave Act. As many states denied Black Americans the right to testify in court, those accused of being runaway slaves often had no legal redress. (Richard Allen himself had been accused of being a runaway slave in 1786, but fortunately had white Philadelphian allies who were willing to testify on his behalf.) Congress rejected their petition. Enslavers objected to emancipation, and some non-slave owners such as Harrison Gray Otis (politician) saw the petition itself as fraudulent, arguing that Black Americans were &quot;incapable of writing their names, or of reading the petition...&quot;

Also in 1799, Richard Allen and Absalom Jones co-published a pamphlet, considered the first Black publication in America, defending the prices Black caregivers had charged for nursing during the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.

In September 1830, Black representatives from seven states convened in Philadelphia at the Bethel AME church for the first Negro Convention. The civic meeting was the first organized by African-American leaders on such a large scale. Allen presided over the meeting, which addressed both regional and national topics. The convention occurred after the 1826 and 1829 riots in Cincinnati when whites had attacked Black people and destroyed their businesses. After the 1829 rioting, 1,200 Black people had left the city to go to Canada. As a result, the Negro Convention addressed organizing aid to such settlements in Canada, among other issues. The 1830 meeting was the beginning of an organizational effort known as the Negro Convention Movement, part of 19th-century institution building in the Black community. Conventions were held regularly nationally.

Allen was a Prince Hall Freemason and served as the first Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, Prince Hall.

==Death ==
Allen died at home on Spruce Street on March 26, 1831. He was buried at the church that he founded. His grave remains on the lower level.

<text>Richard Vincent Allen (January 1, 1936 – November 16, 2024) was United States National Security Advisor under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1982. In 1977, prior to Reagan&#x27;s presidential election in November 1980, he served as Reagan&#x27;s chief foreign policy advisor. Afterwards, he became a fellow at the Hoover Institution. He was a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee.

==Early life and education==
Allen was born in Collingswood, New Jersey, on January 1, 1936, the son of Magdalen (Buchman) and Charles Carroll Allen. A graduate of Saint Francis Preparatory School in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, Allen received his B.A. and M.A degrees from the University of Notre Dame. His M.A. from Notre Dame is in political science.

==Career==
From 1962 to 1966, Allen worked at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He then joined the Hoover Institution as a senior staff member of from 1966 to 1968, when he left to become foreign policy coordinator to Richard Nixon. He served twice in the Nixon White House. He was then Ronald Reagan&#x27;s chief foreign policy advisor from 1977 to 1980, before being appointed Reagan&#x27;s first National Security Advisor.

In July 2000, Allen wrote an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, detailing his role in the recruitment of George H. W. Bush to be Reagan&#x27;s vice president.

===National Security Advisor (1981–1982)===
In November 1981, while serving as Reagan&#x27;s National Security Advisor, Allen was accused of receiving a bribe from a Japanese journalist for setting up an interview in January 1981 with First Lady Nancy Reagan. In his diary, Ronald Reagan wrote that the Japanese magazine gave cash gifts to people that it interviewed, and that Allen had stepped in to intercept the check to avoid embarrassment for Nancy Reagan, then gave the check to his secretary, who put it in an office safe. When Allen changed offices, the check was found left in the safe. The FBI cleared everyone involved, and then the Justice Department began its own investigation, and the story was leaked to the press. 

Reagan believed that political sabotage was behind the leaking of the story. A classified U.S. government source later revealed that Allen and his Potomac Associates partners were caught soliciting bribes, paid as &quot;consulting fees&quot; from Japanese corporations. Japanese security operations reported the crime to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and requested the U.S. government quietly handle the removal. Although the claims were never proven, Allen was pressured to take a leave of absence. On January 4, 1982, he resigned and his position was filled by his deputy, James W. Nance.

In 1981, Allen said that an unidentified third country, possibly Canada, had passed on an offer of 50 Vietnam War POWs in return for $4 billion. In lengthy, closed-door testimony under oath to committee investigators on June 23, 1992, he generally confirmed Hanoi&#x27;s 1981 offer. Allen was asked by a committee staffer, &quot;Soon after taking office, did the Reagan administration become involved in an offer made by the Vietnamese government for the return of live prisoners of war, if you can recall?&quot;

Allen responded, &quot;This $4 billion figure sticks in my mind, and I remember writing something—I don&#x27;t know whether it was during a meeting with the president or to him—saying that it would be worth the president&#x27;s going along and let&#x27;s have the negotiation…&quot;

Then Allen was asked, &quot;Do you recall whether the $4 billion was for live American prisoners? To which he replied, &quot;Yes, I do if it was $4 billion, it was indeed for live prisoners.&quot; When asked how many POWs he believed were still being held, he replied, &quot;Dozens, hundreds.&quot;
He later recanted and no other official has supported the statement in public.

===Post-Reagan administration career===
Allen became a senior fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution, and a member of The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Asian Studies Center Advisory Council, the Council on Foreign Relations, the United States Defense Policy Board, the American Alternative Foundation, and the United States National Security Advisory Group. He also served on the advisory council of the Nixon Center.

Allen was president of the Richard V. Allen Company, a Washington D.C.-based consulting services firm. He provided consulting services to international companies and organizations. He served on APCO Worldwide&#x27;s Iraq reconstruction task force and is considered one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C. for South Korea&#x27;s interests.

Allen was also a fellow of St Margaret&#x27;s College, Otago, a residential college in New Zealand.

==Personal life and death==
In 1957, Allen married Patricia Ann Mason, and they had seven children. In later years, Allen divided his time between Denver, Colorado, and Long Beach Island, New Jersey. He died at a Denver hospital on November 16, 2024, at the age of 88.

<doc id="285662" wikidata="Q7883865" url="?curid=285662" title="Underwater basket weaving">
<text>Underwater basket weaving is an idiom referring pejoratively to supposedly useless or absurd college or university courses and often generally to refer to a perceived decline in educational standards.

The term also serves as an intentionally humorous generic answer to questions about an academic degree. It is also used to humorously refer to any non-academic elective course, specifically one that does not count towards any graduation requirements.

==Possible origin of the phrase==

In weaving willow baskets, a trough of water is needed in which to soak the dried willow rods. They are then left to stand until pliable and ready to be used in weaving. The weaving is, however, usually not done under water (see counterexample below). An issue of &quot;The American Philatelist&quot; from 1956 refers to an Alaskan village where &quot;Underwater basket weaving is the principal industry of the employables among the 94 Eskimos here. By way of explanation – the native reeds used in this form of basketry are soaked in water and the weavers create their handiwork with their hands and raw materials completely submerged in water throughout the process of manufacture&quot;.

==Early use==

The phrase in its pejorative sense has been used since at least the mid-1950s. According to a 1953 article in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; on &quot;Hepster Lingo&quot;, &quot;Any snap course in school is &#x27;underwater basket weaving. In a letter to the editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1956, a correspondent bemoaned an alleged decline in academic standards among college football programs and mentioned &quot;majoring in underwater basket weaving, or the preparation and serving of smorgasbord, or, particularly at Berkeley, the combined course of anatomy and panty-raiding&quot;. The following year, an article in the &quot;National Review&quot; mentioned that &quot;the bored students in the educationists&#x27; courses call those dreary subjects &#x27;underwater basket-weaving courses, and another year on a newspaper column noted that &quot;One seaside university is bowing to the stern educational demands of the times by eliminating its popular course in underwater basket weaving&quot;. An article in the &quot;Daily Collegian&quot; at Penn State University in 1961 refers to a parody in which &quot;a typical Miami coed majoring in underwater basket weaving was interviewed&quot;. An article from 1976 refers to football players so dumb that they had to take underwater basket weaving, and another 1976 article refers to underwater basket-weaving as &quot;an old old family joke&quot;.

==Current use==
In recent years, many subjects in the humanities have adopted scientific methodologies under the category of social sciences. Some of the courses offered in these subjects have drawn criticism; for instance, an op-ed expressed concern over the lack of rigor and scientific relevancy in coursework at the University of Minnesota. Such criticism has been accused of stereotyping the social sciences as underwater basket weaving subjects.

Dave Ramsey, American personal finance writer and radio host, has used the self-invented term &quot;German Polka History&quot; to describe university degree programs that are unlikely to result in a career and which he thus advises people against pursuing. He uses the term along with a degree in &quot;Left-Handed Puppetry&quot; as an umbrella description to avoid singling any specific degree for ridicule.

==Notable uses==


The phrase was used during the Vietnam War era to describe the sort of major that many young men who would otherwise not have entered college undertook to escape the draft. US Senator Gordon L. Allott referred in 1968 to &quot;the situation that we were in after World War II where we had universities setting up courses in underwater basket weaving, and all this sort of thing&quot;. Senator Robert Byrd used the phrase in 1969 when questioning the use of funds to offer professional training to Cuban refugees. The University of Portsmouth had a joke syllabus for underwater basket weaving on the Technology faculty pages, and another joke syllabus proposal was posted by a University of Central Arkansas student magazine.

US punk band NOFX referred to an underwater basket weaving course in their song &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot;.

The phrase appears in the MIT application process as a humorous example suggesting students should simply state their current interests.

==As a taught course==
Since 1980, Reed College in Portland, Oregon has occasionally offered an underwater basket weaving class during Paideia, its festival of learning that offers informal, non-credit courses.

The Student Resource Center at the University of Arizona offered a submerged snorkeling basket-weaving course in spring 1998. In early 2009, a Rutgers University scuba diving instructor offered a one-off course. Underwater Basket Weaving is a trademark of the US Scuba Center Inc., which offers a specialty class designed to improve or more fully enjoy diving skills from which participants can &quot;take home a memorable souvenir.&quot;

As an April Fools joke, Coursera offered an online course on underwater basket weaving as of April 1, 2013. The class was supposed to &quot;consist of short lecture and demonstration videos, between 8 and 10 minutes in length, short quizzes, and practical weaving exercises.&quot;

<text>The title of Earl of Athlone has been created three times.

== History ==

It was created first in the Peerage of Ireland in 1692 by King William III for General Baron van Reede, Lord of Ginkel, a Dutch nobleman, to honour him for his successful battles in Ireland including the Siege of Athlone. The title also had the subsidiary title of Baron Aughrim. These titles became extinct in 1844 upon the death of the 9th Earl. The Earls also bore the Dutch nobility title Baron van Reede (hereditary in male line; still extant in the Netherlands).

The second creation was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, as a subsidiary title of the Dukedom of Clarence and Avondale, and was conferred in 1890 upon Prince Albert Victor of Wales, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. When he died in 1892, the title became extinct.

The third creation was in 1917, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, for the former Prince Alexander of Teck, younger brother of Queen Mary and greatuncle of Queen Elizabeth II, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Trematon. The earldom was given after members of the British royal family renounced their German royal titles. Alexander had two sons who predeceased him, and the titles became extinct after his death.

<doc id="285673" wikidata="Q5191156" url="?curid=285673" title="Crystal Cavern">
<text>Crystal Cavern(s), also known throughout the years as Alabama Caverns and McClu(n)ney Cave, is a small cavern containing crystal formations located in Clay, Alabama, USA.

==History==
The cavern was discovered in 1840 by a Thomas McCluney.
It was mined for saltpeter during the Civil War (1861 to 1865). 

The cavern was a tourist attraction for Clay. It opened and closed in 1927 as Alabama Caverns, but had reopened and been renamed to &quot;Crystal Caverns&quot; by 1941, when the WPA Guide to Alabama recorded that it was electrically lit, that its admission price was 25 cents (), and that it had &quot;beautiful formations&quot; including what appeared to be &quot;metallic draperies&quot;. In 1946, however, biologist Edward McCrady described it as &quot;the poorest commercialized cave [he&#x27;d] ever seen&quot;. In the early 1960s, the facilities were upgraded. The Congressional Record of 1966 recorded it as having camping facilities that included showers and restrooms, and described it as a &quot;fairyland&quot;. It closed as a tourist attraction in the late 1960s, and is now privately owned.

During the Cold War, the cavern was designated as a fallout shelter for up to 1045 people.

==Geology==
The cavern is part of the Chickamauga Limestone, lies approximately above the Copper Ridge Dolomite, and formed along a strike joint when the Appalachian Mountains folded at the end of the Paleozoic. It was reported in 1933 as extending as a narrow passage for 800 feet, with several right angle turns, and having a maximum height of either &quot;about 80 feet&quot; or &quot;67 feet.&quot; Cave formations included &quot;onyx crusts and rosettes&quot;, stalactites and stalagmites, and &quot;a petrified waterfall&quot;. Two named formations were the &quot;Capitol Dome&quot;, part of a wall resembling the United States Capitol dome, and the &quot;Family Loft&quot;, a high recess containing two large columns along with smaller stalagmites. Siliceous dolomite extruded from the walls and at one point formed a bridge. This was formed by a solution channel (a void in the limestone which allows passage of water) above and below the dolomite bed.

The cavern contained a spring in a pit which, in 1933, was about 20 feet above the water table, and fed by a &quot;slight drip during wet seasons.&quot; In 1946, McCrady reported the pool to be less than a foot deep, and clear.

==Fauna==
The cavern has been the sole reported location of the pseudoscorpion &quot;Aphrastochthonius pecki&quot;, described in 1968, and one of two local locations reported for Peck&#x27;s cave snail (&quot;Glyphyalinia pecki&quot;), which was described in 1966. The McCluney cave cricket (&quot;Euhadenoecus insolitus&quot;), a regional species, was described in 1978 from a pair of specimens collected at the cavern by Peck in 1965. A white salamander was seen in the cave&#x27;s pool by Walter B. Jones, however McCrady found the pool devoid of life, and believed the salamander to have accessed the cave via one of its many cracks.

<doc id="285680" wikidata="Q975544" url="?curid=285680" title="Curtiss OX-5">
<text>The Curtiss OX-5 was an early V-8 American liquid-cooled aircraft engine built by Curtiss. It was the first American-designed aircraft engine to enter mass production, although it was considered obsolete when it did so in 1917. It nevertheless found widespread use on a number of aircraft, perhaps the most famous being the JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot;. Some 12,600 units were built through early 1919. The wide availability of the engine in the surplus market made it common until the 1930s, although it was considered unreliable for most of its service life.

==Design and development==
The OX-5 was the last in a series of Glenn Curtiss designed V engines, which started as a series of air-cooled V-twins for motorcycles in 1902. A modified version of one of these early designs was sold as an aircraft engine in 1906, and from then on the company&#x27;s primary market was aircraft. The basic design had slowly expanded by adding additional cylinders until they reached the V-8 in 1906. They also started enlarging the cylinders as well, but this led to cooling problems that required the introduction of liquid cooling in 1908. These early engines used a flathead valve arrangement, which eventually gave way to a cross-flow cylinder with overhead valves in 1909, leading to improved volumetric efficiency. By this point engine design was a team effort; the team included Charles M. Manly, whose earlier Manly–Balzer engine had held the power-to-weight ratio record for 16 years. Curtiss continued the development of their V8 engines with demand for higher power outputs being largely driven by the US Navy’s requirement for seaplanes. By 1912 Curtiss V8’s were developing 75 hp and were known as the Curtiss Model O. The Curtiss O was further developed into the 90 hp Curtiss OX. OX series production began in 1913. The OX-5 was built between 1915 and 1919 and was by far the most popular OX variant.

Like most engines of the era, the OX-5&#x27;s high-temperature areas were built mostly of cast iron, using individual cylinders bolted to a single aluminum crankcase, wrapped in a cooling jacket made of a nickel-copper alloy. Later versions used a brazed-on steel jacket instead. Cylinder heads were also attached to the crankcase, using X-shaped tie-downs on the top of the head attached to the block via four long bolts. Fuel was carbureted near the rear of the engine, then piped to the cylinders via two T-shaped pipes, the cylinders being arranged so the intake ports of any two in a bank were near each other. The cylinders had one intake and one exhaust valve, the exhaust valve operated by a pushrod from a camshaft running between the banks and inlet valve operated by a pull rod/tube working from the same camshaft. This arrangement caused the outer exhaust valves to have a rather long rocker arm. The push/pullrods were arranged one inside the other, the exhaust valve rod being on the inside and the intake valve rod a tube around it. The aluminum camshaft bearings were a split type bolted together and held in place by lock screws. The pistons were cast aluminum.

The OX-5 was not considered particularly advanced, nor powerful, for its era. By this point rotary engines such as the Oberursel or Gnome-Rhône were producing about , and newer inlines were becoming available with or more. Nevertheless, the OX-5 had fairly good fuel economy as a result of its slow RPM, which made it useful for civilian aircraft. The OX-5 was used on the Swallow Airplane Swallow, Pitcairn PA-4 Fleetwing II, Travel Air 2000, Waco 9 and 10, the American Eagle, the Buhl-Verville CW-3 Airster, and some models of the Jenny. The primary reason for its popularity was its low cost after the war, with almost-new examples selling as low as $20. It was often used in boats as well as in aircraft.

===Reliability===
The engine was considered unreliable, but unreliable is a relative term: aviation engine technology had not fully matured at the end of World War I. Certainly the JN4 with the OX-5 was underpowered, but the OX-5 proved a much better engine than the Hall Scott A7A that was the Achilles heel of the Standard J-1, the substitute primary trainer. In particular the valve gear was fragile, and it had no provisions for lubrication other than grease and oil applied by hand, leading to an overhaul interval as short as fifty hours. Additionally the engine featured a single spark plug in each cylinder, and a single ignition system, in an era when ignition equipment was less reliable, with dual ignition already being fitted to more advanced aviation powerplants like the French V-form Hispano-Suiza 8 and the inline-six cylinder series of Mercedes D.I through D.III German engines. Built by several contractors in large numbers, the OX-5 suffered from uneven quality control. However, while the overwhelming majority of training accidents in the U.S. were in JN-4s, this was because JN-4s were flown by the vast majority of trainee pilots, and the accident rate in the US for primary training was four times less than the advanced training rate in France (virtually all US airmen getting advanced training in France), approximately 2800 flying hours in the US primarily in OX-5 powered JN-4s per fatality to 761 hours per fatality in France in other types. Very few fatal accidents were caused by engine failure, although the lack of power may have been the cause of the many stall and spins that took about forty five percent of training lives. Anyone seeing a JN-4 today struggling into the air with an OX-5 can see very quickly that the JN-4 had to be flown in a narrow envelope. Also, the replacement of the A7A in Standard J-1s was contemplated, but the cost of $2,000 per aircraft compared with the need (by the time the J-1s were grounded in June 1918 JN-4s were in sufficient supply) led to the rejection of this idea. The successful civilian post-war use of the OX-5 (even in civilian purchased and converted J-1s) was due to its relative reliability in the more aerodynamically advanced designs of the 1920s, its simplicity of operation, and its low cost. By comparison the Hall Scott A7A created such a bad impression during the war that very few, if any, were used by civilian operators.

The OX-5 itself would be replaced by the well-proven Wright Aeronautical-built version of the 150 hp Hispano-Suiza HS-8a V8 engine in the nearly 930 examples of the later production Curtiss JN-4H Jenny biplanes.

<text>Enochian magic is a system of Renaissance magic developed by John Dee and Edward Kelley and adopted by more modern practitioners. 
The origins of this esoteric tradition are rooted in documented collaborations between Dee and Kelley, encompassing the revelation of the Enochian language and script, which Dee wrote were delivered to them directly by various angels during their mystical interactions. Central to the practice is the invocation and command of various spiritual beings. 

Dee&#x27;s journals detail the two men&#x27;s interactions with these entities, accompanied by the intricate Enochian script and tables of correspondences. They believed that these revelations granted them access to insights concealed within &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Book of Enoch&quot;.

Enochian magic, as practiced by Dee and Kelley, involved a range of rituals and ceremonies designed to evoke angelic and other spiritual entities. These practices, meticulously recorded in Dee&#x27;s journals, aimed to harness the energies and wisdom of these entities for transformative and practical purposes. This Renaissance occult tradition involved the interaction between human practitioners and the ethereal realm, characterized by the use of the Enochian language and symbols.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn would later integrate elements of Enochian magic into its system. This adaptation reignited interest in Enochian practices, further embedding them within broader Western esoteric traditions. Debates have arisen regarding the accuracy and interpretation of these adaptations, one example of the evolution of Enochian magic across diverse historical and contemporary contexts.

==Background==

In the early 1580s, John Dee&#x27;s pursuit of understanding the secrets of nature left him dissatisfied with his progress. Seeking a more profound wisdom encompassing both natural and artificial truths, Dee&#x27;s journey evolved into a spiritual exploration. Dee wrote:

In response, Dee turned his attention toward the supernatural as a means to acquire the knowledge he sought. He used scrying, employing individuals known as scryers or crystal-gazers to act as intermediaries between himself and angelic beings. Dee&#x27;s initial attempts with various scryers proved underwhelming, until he encountered Edward Kelley in 1582. Operating under the pseudonym Edward Talbot due to a forgery conviction, Kelley&#x27;s remarkable abilities caught Dee&#x27;s attention and impressed him greatly.

Dee enlisted Kelley&#x27;s services, focusing his energies on supernatural pursuits. These spiritual interactions were steeped in Christian piety and followed periods of purification, prayer, and fasting. Dee held a steadfast belief in the potential benefits these efforts could bring to humanity. Kelley&#x27;s role in channeling angelic communications resulted in a voluminous output, with the angels dictating several books, often in a previously unknown language termed &quot;Angelical&quot;, now more commonly called Enochian. Kelley&#x27;s contributions laid the groundwork for Enochian magic, a system that intertwined mysticism and practical ritual within the landscape of Renaissance occultism.

=== Angelical ===

Called Angelical by Dee, the Enochian language is an occult constructed language — said by its originators to have been received from angels — recorded in the private journals of John Dee and his colleague Edward Kelley in late 16th-century England. The term &quot;Enochian&quot; comes from Dee&#x27;s assertion that the Biblical patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

The language found in Dee&#x27;s and Kelley&#x27;s journals encompasses a limited textual corpus. Linguist Donald Laycock, an Australian Skeptic, studied the Enochian journals, and argues against any extraordinary features. The phonology and grammar resemble English, though the translations are not sufficient to work out any regular morphology. Some Enochian words resemble words and proper names in the Bible, but most have no apparent etymology.

There have been several compilations of Enochian words made to form Enochian dictionaries. A scholarly study is Donald Laycock&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Enochian Dictionary&quot;. Also useful is Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Gmicalzoma: An Enochian Dictionary&quot;. Israel Regardie&#x27;s Enochian dictionary is reprinted in Crowley, Duquette, and Hyatt, &quot;Enochian World of Aleister Crowley&quot;.

Since Dee is known to have been a spy for Elizabeth I&#x27;s court, there are interpretations of his Angelic manuscripts as cryptographic documents - most likely polyalphabetic ciphers - designed to disguise political messages.

==Manuscript sources==
At the heart of Enochian magic&#x27;s origin are manuscripts attributed to John Dee and Edward Kelley, notably the &quot;Five Books of Mystery&quot; and &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot;. These texts serve as pivotal foundations, encoding the intricate language, symbolism, and rituals intrinsic to Enochian magic.

These manuscripts have been enriched by a succession of scholars and practitioners. Individuals like Thomas Rudd (1583?–1656), Elias Ashmole (1617–1692), Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (1854–1918), William Wynn Westcott (1848–1925), Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), and Israel Regardie (1907–1985) have contributed as guardians and commentators. As magicians, their roles extend beyond preservation, including writing commentaries, making adaptations, and revealing insights that have expanded the views on Enochian magic. 

===&quot;Five Books of Mystery&quot;===
The Five Books of Mystery (&quot;Mysteriorum Libri Quinque&quot;) are documented within the manuscript Sloane MS 3188, a repository of the &#x27;actions&#x27; or mystical practices detailed in &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot;. This manuscript served as a diary spanning from 22 December 1581 to 23 May 1583. It encompasses the first five Books of Mystery, along with an Appendix, notably concluding where Casaubon&#x27;s &quot;A True and Faithful Relation&quot; commences. There are two transcripts of this manuscript available today: from Joseph Peterson and C. L. Whitby. The &quot;Five Books of Mystery&quot; serve as a comprehensive guide to Enochian magic, encompassing language, symbolism, rituals, and practical techniques. The five books are:

# Primus: &quot;The Magick of Enoch&quot; serves as an introduction to the celestial language known as Angelical, forming the bedrock of Enochian magic. Within its pages, foundational Enochian alphabets are revealed, allowing communication with angelic entities through the use of Angelic Keys. This book establishes the linguistic basis for Enochian magical operations, setting the stage for further exploration into the mystical realm as presented in the &quot;Five Books of Mystery&quot;.
# Secundus: &quot;The Mystical Heptarchy&quot;: This book delves deeper into the Angelical language, unveiling the intricate Great Table—an essential matrix of letters and symbols pivotal to Enochian magical workings. Within its pages, the concept of the Thirty Æthyrs is introduced, presenting metaphysical planes that serve as conduits for practitioners to interact with angelic beings. This book expands the realm of Enochian magic, providing a framework for engaging with celestial hierarchies and exploring the mystical dimensions of existence.
# Tertius: &quot;The Forty-Eight Angelic Keys&quot; shifts the focus to the construction and symbolism of temples. This book offers insights into their integral role within Enochian magic. It outlines the design and significance of temples, emphasizing sacred geometry and symbolism as vehicles for spiritual transformation. By exploring the intricate interplay between architecture and mysticism, this book provides practitioners with a practical understanding of how temples can serve as spaces for connecting with higher realms and channeling divine energies.
# Quartus: &quot;Earthly Knowledge, Aid &amp; Victory&quot;: This book explores the symbolism of Elemental Tablets and Watchtowers, shedding light on the interplay between metaphysical constructs and natural forces. It deciphers the intricate connections between classical elements and earthly energies, enhancing practitioners&#x27; comprehension of the intricate web woven by Enochian magic. Through the exploration of these symbols, individuals gain a deeper insight into the harmonious interaction between mystical and natural realms, enriching their journey into the profound intricacies of Enochian magic.
# Quintus: &quot;The Angels of the Four Quarters&quot; focuses on practical applications of Enochian magic. It offers rituals and ceremonies grounded in the Angelical language and its symbolism. This book serves as a guide bridging the gap between mystical theory and practical implementation in esoteric pursuits.

===&quot;Liber Logaeth&quot;===

Liber Loagaeth (lit. &quot;Book of the Speech of God&quot;, also known as &quot;Liber Mysteriorum, Sextus et Sanctus&quot; &quot;[The Sixth and Sacred Book of the Mysteries]&quot;, referred to by Dee as The Book of Enoch) (1583) is preserved in the British Library mostly within what are known as the Sloane manuscripts, chiefly Sloane MS 3189 (but parts of Sloane MS 3188 and the Cotton MS Appendix I also contain the beginning and end of the book, with some copying of material in Sloane MS 3188 appearing in Sloane MS 3189).

Written up by Edward Kelley, it is composed of 73 folios (18 from Sloane MS 3188, 54 from Sloane MS 3189, and 1 (text only) from Cotton MS Appendix I). The book contains 96 complex magical grids of letters (94 of which are 49×49 grids of letters, one of which is a table composed of 49 rows of text, and one of which is a table of 40 rows of text and 9 rows of 49 letters). The final folio from Cotton MS Appendix I was 21 words consisting of 112 letters, which according to the text, was apparently able to be somehow reduced to 105 letters and arranged into five 3x7 tables, three on the front and two on the back (cf. Cotton MS Appendix I). 

It is from &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot; that Dee and Kelley derived the 48 Calls or Keys (see below), and in which are concealed the keys to the &quot;Mystical Heptarchy&quot;, a related magical work by Dee. Dee himself left little information on his Sixth Holy Book apart from saying that it contained &#x27;The Mysterie of our Creation, The Age of many years, and the conclusion of the World&#x27; and that the first page in the book signified Chaos. (Note that the title, &quot;The Book of Enoch&quot;, attributed to the text of &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot;, is not to be confused with the apocryphal Book of Enoch, which was considered lost in Dee&#x27;s time.

===Other manuscripts===
Another manuscript is Sloane MS 3191, which comprises: &quot;48 Angelic Keys&quot;; &quot;The Book of Earthly Science, Aid and Victory&quot;; &quot;On the Mystic Heptarchy&quot;; and &quot;Invocations of the Good Angels&quot;.

Two further manuscripts from Dee and Kelley&#x27;s workings pertain to Enochian magic:
#Cotton MS Appendix XLVI Part I is the diary for 28 May 1583 – 15 August 1584 inclusive: &quot;The Sixth (and Sacred) Parallel Book of the Mysteries&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;The Sixth and Sacred Book of the Mysteries&quot;, which is part of &quot;Liber Logaeth&quot; – see above) and &quot;The Seventh Book of the Mysteries&quot; (Kraków), beginning where &quot;A True and Faithful Relation begins&quot;. It includes the arrival of Prince Adalbert Laski, the journey to Kraków and the dictation of the 48 Calls or Keys (including descriptions of the 91 Parts of the Earth), as well as the Vision of the Four Watchtowers and also the Great Table.
#Cotton MS Appendix XLVI Part II is the diary for 15 August 1584 – 23 May 1587 (and 20 March – 7 September 1607) inclusive: &quot;The Book of Praha&quot;, &quot;The Royal Stephanic Mysteries&quot;, &quot;The Puccian Action&quot;, &quot;The Book of Resurrection&quot;, &quot;The Third Action of Trebon&quot; and the remaining &quot;Spirit Actions at Mortlake&quot; in 1607, ending where &quot;A True and Faithful Relation&quot; ends. (It may be seen that Casaubon&#x27;s &quot;A True and Faithful Relation&quot; is equivalent to the Cotton MS Appendix &quot;in toto&quot;, i.e. Dee and Kelley&#x27;s diaries from 28 May 1585-23 Sept 1607).

Meric Casaubon&#x27;s 1659 edition of part of these diaries (Cotton Appendix MS XLVI), entitled &quot;A True &amp; Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers between John Dee and Some Spirits&quot;, contains notorious transcription errors which in some cases were transmitted through many subsequent republications of the Dee/Kelly material; Casaubon&#x27;s edition was intended to discredit Dee and Kelly by accusing them of dealing with the Christian Devil. An expanded facsimile edition of Casaubon was published by Magickal Childe in 1992.

Dee and Kelley&#x27;s surviving manuscripts later came into the possession of Elias Ashmole, who preserved them and made copies of some, along with annotations.

==The system==
The Enochian magical system is a structured framework consisting of various essential components which are outlined in Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Liber Chanokh&quot;. Key elements include the Elemental Tablets (including the &quot;Tablet of Union&quot;), the Angelical Keys, the Great Table (made up of the 4 Elemental Tablets and incorporating the Tablet of Union), and specific temple furnishings. These components provide the foundation for practitioners engaged in spiritual exploration within the Enochian tradition. The Angelical Keys of the 30 Aethyrs function as evocations to access mystical realms, while the Great Table symbolically represents the universe. The system also involves the setup of a designated temple space with requisite magical tools.
===The Great Table===
Enochian magic encompasses a system of symbolism and spiritual exploration, primarily centered around the Elemental Tablets and related elements. The core of this magical system is the Great Table, which consists of four Elemental Tablets, symbolizing the classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water. These tablets are inhabited by various spiritual beings and entities.

Within the Great Table, there is a structured hierarchy of spiritual entities. These include the Three Holy Names, representing potent sources of divine authority, and a Great Elemental King who governs each of the Elemental Tablets. Supporting these are the Six Seniors (also known as Elders), comprising a total of 24 figures reminiscent of the Twenty-Four Elders mentioned in the biblical Book of Revelation. Additionally, there are two Divine Names associated with the Calvary Cross; Kerubim, often depicted as angelic beings linked to the fixed zodiac signs; and Sixteen Lesser Angels, each with distinct roles and attributes.

Further intricacies emerge within the Elemental Tablets, which are divided into four sub-quadrants or sub-angles. These contain the names of archangels and angels responsible for overseeing specific quarters of the world, effectively populating the universe, both seen and unseen, with intelligent spiritual beings.

At the heart of each Elemental Tablet lies the Great Central Cross, consisting of two central vertical columns known as &quot;Linea Patris&quot; and &quot;Linea Filii&quot;, and a central horizontal line called &quot;Linea Spiritus Sancti&quot;. The exact significance of the Great Central Cross can vary among interpretations of Enochian magic.

Completing the symbolic representation of the five classical elements is the Tablet of Union, often referred to as the Black Cross. This grid of twenty squares is derived from within the Great Central Cross and serves to embody the element of Spirit.

===The Thirty Æthyrs===
The Thirty Aethyrs are an integral part of the Enochian magical system, representing a sequence of spiritual planes or realms that practitioners explore as they ascend from 30 (TEX, the lowest) to 1 (LIL, the highest). In the practice of Enochian magic, magicians document their visions, experiences, and impressions within each successive Aethyr, marking their progression through this mystical hierarchy.

One notable feature of the Aethyrs is the presence of &quot;Governors&quot;. Each of the 30 Aethyrs is inhabited by three Governors, with the exception of TEX, which has four, totaling 91 Governors across the entire system. These Governors are considered angelic or spiritual entities associated with the Aethyrs and are believed to hold significant knowledge and power within their respective realms.

The Governors are distinguished by their unique sigils, which are mystical symbols representing their presence and authority. A crucial part of Enochian magical practice involves tracing these sigils onto the Great Tablet, a key tool in the Enochian system. By inscribing the sigils on the Tablet, magicians establish a connection with the Governors and the energies associated with each Aethyr.

===The Angelical Keys===
The Angelical Keys, also known as the Calls or Enochian Keys, are a central component of Enochian magic. These keys are a series of rhetorical exhortations which function as evocations when read in the Enochian language. They are used to effect the &quot;opening of &#x27;gates&#x27; into various mystical realms.&quot; These realms may include elemental realms, sub-elemental realms, or the Thirty Aethyrs, depending on which key is used.

There are a total of nineteen Angelical Keys in Enochian magic. The first eighteen keys are typically associated with opening gates to the realms of elements and sub-elements. In Enochian magic, these realms are often mapped onto the Great Tablet, a complex symbolic diagram used in Enochian ritual work.

The nineteenth key is specifically used to open gateways to the Thirty Aethyrs. The Aethyrs are envisioned as concentric rings that expand outward from the innermost Aethyr to the outermost. They are often viewed as a map of the entire universe, with each Aethyr providing access to unique spiritual insights and experiences. Exploring these Aethyrs is seen as a journey through different levels of spiritual consciousness and understanding.

===The Temple===

Temple &quot;furniture&quot; required for the performance of Enochian magic includes:
#The Holy Table: a table with a top engraved with a Hexagram, a surrounding border of Enochian letters, and in the middle a Twelvefold table (cell) engraved with individual Enochian letters. According to Duquette and Hyatt, the Holy Table &quot;does not directly concern Elemental or Aethyrical workings. Angels found on the Holy Table are not called forth in these operations.&quot;
#The Seven Planetary Talismans: The names on these talismans (which are engraved on tin and placed on the surface of the Holy Table) are those of the Goetia. According to Duquette and Hyatt, &quot;this indicates (or at least implies) Dee&#x27;s familiarity with the Lemegeton and his attempt, at least early in his workings, to incorporate it in the Enochian system.&quot; As with the Holy Table, Spirits found on these talismans are not called forth in these operations.
#The Sigillum dei Aemeth, Holy Sevenfold Table, or &#x27;Seal of God&#x27;s Truth&#x27;: The symbol derives from the grimoire called &quot;Liber Juratus&quot; or &quot;The Sworn Book of Honorius&quot;, of which Dee owned a copy. Five versions of this complex diagram are made from bee&#x27;s wax, and engraved with the various lineal figures, letters and numbers. The four smaller ones are placed under the feet of the Holy Table. The fifth and larger one (about nine inches in diameter) is covered with a red cloth, placed on the Holy Table, and is used to support the &quot;Shew-Stone&quot; or &quot;Speculum&quot; (crystal or other device used for scrying). Scrying is an essential element of the magical system. Dee and Kelly&#x27;s technique was to gaze into a concave obsidian mirror. Crowley habitually held a large topaz mounted upon a wooden cross to his forehead. Other methods include gazing into crystals, ink, fire or even a blank TV screen.

==Adaptation by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn==
Little else became of Dee&#x27;s work until late in the nineteenth century, when it was incorporated by a brotherhood of adepts in England.

The rediscovery of Dee and Kelley&#x27;s material by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the 1880s led to Mathers developing the material into a comprehensive system of ceremonial magic. Magicians invoked the Enochian deities whose names were written on the tablets. They also traveled in their bodies of light into these subtle regions and recorded their psychic experiences. The two major branches of the system were then grafted on to the Adeptus Minor curriculum of the Golden Dawn. According to Aleister Crowley, the magician starts with the 30th aethyr and works up to the first, exploring only so far as his level of initiation will permit.

According to Chris Zalewski&#x27;s 1994 book, the Golden Dawn also invented the game of Enochian chess, in which aspects of the Enochian Tablets were used for divination. They used four chessboards without symbols on them, just sets of colored squares, and each board is associated with one of the four elements of magic.

Florence Farr founded the Sphere Group which also experimented with Enochian magic.

=== Criticism of the Golden Dawn adaptation===
Paul Foster Case (1884–1954), an occultist who began his magical career with the Alpha et Omega, was critical of the Enochian system. According to Case, the system of Dee and Kelley was partial from the start, an incomplete system derived from an earlier and complete Qabalistic system, and lacked sufficient protection methods. Case believed he had witnessed the physical breakdown of a number of practitioners of Enochian magic, due to the lack of protective methods. When Case founded his own magical order, the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), he removed the Enochian system and substituted elemental tablets based on Qabalistic formulae communicated to him by Master R.

==In popular culture==
Since horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, in his short work &quot;The History of the Necronomicon&quot; (written 1927, published after Lovecraft&#x27;s death, in 1938), made John Dee the translator of one of the versions of his mythical book of forbidden lore, &quot;The Necronomicon&quot; (an example of Lovecraft&#x27;s use of the technique of &quot;pseudo-authenticity&quot;), much has been written connecting Dee and Enochian magic with &quot;The Necronomicon&quot;. The fanciful connection between Dee and &quot;The Necronomicon&quot; was suggested by Lovecraft&#x27;s friend Frank Belknap Long.

<text>Ahmed Jibril (; c. 1937 – 7 July 2021) was a Palestinian militant and political leader who was the founder and leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC).

During the Syrian Civil War, Jibril was a notable supporter of the Assad government and PFLP-GC members helped government forces to fight the Syrian opposition. However, after clashes with rebels in Yarmouk Camp in Damascus, the PFLP-GC suffered defections and was forced to withdraw from the camp, and Jibril fled the city.

==Early life==
Born to a Palestinian father and Syrian mother, Jibril&#x27;s year of birth is given by different sources as 1935, 1937 and 1938 and his place of birth as Yazur, Jaffa, Ramla and Ramallah in Mandatory Palestine as well as Iraq and Syria. When the First Arab-Israeli War began in 1948, his family moved to Homs, Syria, where he was raised. He graduated from the Homs Military Academy and served in the Syrian Army from 1956 until 1958, rising to the rank of captain before being expelled as a suspected Communist. In 1959, he founded the Palestinian Liberation Front. Beginning in 1965, he worked closely with the leadership of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), including Yasser Arafat. In 1967, he joined with George Habash to form the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a Palestinian Marxist–Leninist and revolutionary socialist organization that combined Arab nationalism with the leftist ideology, and which was in conflict with Arafat.

==Break from the PFLP==
In 1968, Jibril broke away from the PFLP because of disputes over the more revolutionary Marxism advocated by Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh. He formed a new organization, the pro-Syrian &quot;The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command&quot; (PFLP-General Command).

Jibril never wavered from his belief that Palestine could only be liberated through military attrition. He joined George Habash and other splinter groups which opposed negotiations with the Israeli government. He launched a variety of inventive attacks, including the &quot;Night of the Gliders&quot; on 25 November 1987.

==Leader of PFLP-GC==
Samuel Katz&#x27;s &quot;Israel vs. Jibril&quot; distinguishes the PFLP-GC and Jibril&#x27;s strategy from the rest of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) by its emphasis on military training and equipment, and not on declarations and publicity stunts. This caused the group to fail to make a significant mark on the public debate. Since 1994&#x27;s Oslo Accords, support for the PFLP-GC dwindled among Palestinians.

On 7 May 2001, the Israeli Navy seized a Palestinian boat filled with heavy weapons in the port of Haifa. Jibril is believed to have been behind the shipment of weapons, which were bound for the Gaza Strip.

During the Syrian Civil War, the PFLP-GC helped the Syrian Army to fight the Syrian rebels in and around Yarmouk Camp – a district of Damascus that is home to the biggest community of Palestinian refugees in Syria. Several members of the PFLP-GC&#x27;s central committee opposed this alliance with the government and resigned in protest. By 17 December 2012, the rebels, which included Palestinians, had won control of Yarmouk. Jibril fled Damascus, reportedly for the Mediterranean city of Tartous. Palestinian left-wing groups—including the PFLP—berated Jibril and the PFLP-GC. One PFLP official said that Jibril &quot;does not even belong to the Palestinian Left. He is closer to the extremist right-wing groups than to revolutionary leftist ones&quot;. On 18 December, the Palestinian National Council (PNC) denounced Jibril, saying it would expel him over his role in the conflict.

In a 17 February 2017, Jibril did an interview with Al Mayadeen and expressed his hope that the Iranian military with others would fully back the future Palestinian war against Israel.

Talal Naji succeeded Jibril as the secretary-general of the PFLP-GC.

==Personal life==
Jibril&#x27;s son, Jihad Ahmed Jibril, who headed the PFLP-GC&#x27;s military wing and was in line to replace Jibril as leader of the group, was killed by a car bomb in Beirut on 20 May 2002.

==Death==
Jibril died of heart failure on 7 July 2021, in Damascus, Syria. After a funeral service in the Al-Othman Mosque in Damascus with his coffin draped in the Palestinian flag, he was buried in the Martyrs Cemetery of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp.

<text>Mohammed Jihad Ahmed Jibril (1961 – 20 May 2002) was the son of Ahmed Jibril, founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC). He was assassinated in Beirut on 20 May 2002.

==Early life and education==
Jihad Ahmed Jibril was born in Damascus, Syria, in 1961. He is the eldest son of Ahmed Jibril. He attended the Libyan military academy from 1981 to 1983 and graduated with the rank of a lieutenant colonel. He was studying law at Lebanese University when he was assassinated.

==Political activity and attacks==
Jibril became the leader of the military wing of the PFLP-GC and was the heir apparent of the organization before he was killed. He was also a member of the Popular Front&#x27;s executive committee. Jibril was reported to have participated in an airborne attack on Israel in 1987, killing six Israeli soldiers.

Jibril was seriously injured in an explosion during an exercise in the Bekaa valley in 1997. He also experienced an assassination attempt in 2000 when his car came under fire near a PFLP-GC base south of Beirut.

==Personal life==
Jibril was married with two children; Ahmed (born 1992) and Ali (born 1996).

==Death==
Jibril was killed in a car bombing in Beirut on 20 May 2002. A 2 kg TNT booby trap had been put under the driver&#x27;s seat of his car. The blast occurred in a crowded commercial center in Beirut&#x27;s Mar Elias district. The bomb exploded nearly at 11:45 am when Jibril turned the ignition key. The assassination was blamed by his father and others on Israel, but it denied the allegations. In mid-June 2006, Lebanon authorities arrested a group of alleged spies who reportedly confessed to working for Israel and carrying out the attack. Other Israelis, one American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and one Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) agent were implicated in the assassination but never charged. Some Lebanese opponents of Hezbollah suspected the alleged spy ring was a Hezbollah fabrication.

== Legacy ==
The Jihad Jibril Brigades, the paramilitary branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, bears his name in homage to his person.

<text>The principle of indifference (also called principle of insufficient reason) is a rule for assigning epistemic probabilities. The principle of indifference states that in the absence of any relevant evidence, agents should distribute their credence (or &quot;degrees of belief&quot;) equally among all the possible outcomes under consideration.

In Bayesian probability, this is the simplest non-informative prior.

==Examples==
The textbook examples for the application of the principle of indifference are coins, dice, and cards.

In a macroscopic system, at least, it must be assumed that the physical laws that govern the system are not known well enough to predict the outcome. As observed some centuries ago by John Arbuthnot (in the preface of &quot;Of the Laws of Chance&quot;, 1692),

:It is impossible for a Die, with such determin&#x27;d force and direction, not to fall on such determin&#x27;d side, only I don&#x27;t know the force and direction which makes it fall on such determin&#x27;d side, and therefore I call it Chance, which is nothing but the want of art...

Given enough time and resources, there is no fundamental reason to suppose that suitably precise measurements could not be made, which would enable the prediction of the outcome of coins, dice, and cards with high accuracy: Persi Diaconis&#x27;s work with coin-flipping machines is a practical example of this.

===Coins===
A symmetric coin has two sides, arbitrarily labeled &quot;heads&quot; (many coins have the head of a person portrayed on one side) and &quot;tails&quot;. Assuming that the coin must land on one side or the other, the outcomes of a coin toss are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and interchangeable. According to the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/2.

It is implicit in this analysis that the forces acting on the coin are not known with any precision. If the momentum imparted to the coin as it is launched were known with sufficient accuracy, the flight of the coin could be predicted according to the laws of mechanics. Thus the uncertainty in the outcome of a coin toss is derived (for the most part) from the uncertainty with respect to initial conditions. This point is discussed at greater length in the article on coin flipping.

===Dice===
A symmetric die has &quot;n&quot; faces, arbitrarily labeled from 1 to &quot;n&quot;. An ordinary cubical die has &quot;n&quot; = 6 faces, although a symmetric die with different numbers of faces can be constructed; see Dice. We assume that the die will land with one face or another upward, and there are no other possible outcomes. Applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/&quot;n&quot;. As with coins, it is assumed that the initial conditions of throwing the dice are not known with enough precision to predict the outcome according to the laws of mechanics. Dice are typically thrown so as to bounce on a table or other surface(s). This interaction makes prediction of the outcome much more difficult.

The assumption of symmetry is crucial here. Suppose that we are asked to bet for or against the outcome &quot;6&quot;. We might reason that there are two relevant outcomes here &quot;6&quot; or &quot;not 6&quot;, and that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. A common fallacy is assigning the probability 1/2 to each of the two outcomes, when &quot;not 6&quot; is five times more likely than &quot;6.&quot;

===Cards===

A standard deck contains 52 cards, each given a unique label in an arbitrary fashion, i.e. arbitrarily ordered. We draw a card from the deck; applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/52.

This example, more than the others, shows the difficulty of actually applying the principle of indifference in real situations. What we really mean by the phrase &quot;arbitrarily ordered&quot; is simply that we don&#x27;t have any information that would lead us to favor a particular card. In actual practice, this is rarely the case: a new deck of cards is certainly not in arbitrary order, and neither is a deck immediately after a hand of cards. In practice, we therefore shuffle the cards; this does not destroy the information we have, but instead (hopefully) renders our information practically unusable, although it is still usable in principle. In fact, some expert blackjack players can track aces through the deck; for them, the condition for applying the principle of indifference is not satisfied.

==Application to continuous variables==
Applying the principle of indifference incorrectly can easily lead to nonsensical results, especially in the case of multivariate, continuous variables. A typical case of misuse is the following example:
*Suppose there is a cube hidden in a box. A label on the box says the cube has a side length between 3 and 5 cm.
*We don&#x27;t know the actual side length, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 4 cm.
*The information on the label allows us to calculate that the surface area of the cube is between 54 and 150 cm2. We don&#x27;t know the actual surface area, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 102 cm2.
*The information on the label allows us to calculate that the volume of the cube is between 27 and 125 cm3. We don&#x27;t know the actual volume, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 76 cm3.
*However, we have now reached the impossible conclusion that the cube has a side length of 4 cm, a surface area of 102 cm2, and a volume of 76 cm3!

In this example, mutually contradictory estimates of the length, surface area, and volume of the cube arise because we have assumed three mutually contradictory distributions for these parameters: a uniform distribution for any one of the variables implies a non-uniform distribution for the other two. In general, the principle of indifference does not indicate which variable (e.g. in this case, length, surface area, or volume) is to have a uniform epistemic probability distribution.

Another classic example of this kind of misuse is the Bertrand paradox. Edwin T. Jaynes introduced the principle of transformation groups, which can yield an epistemic probability distribution for this problem. This generalises the principle of indifference, by saying that one is indifferent between &quot;equivalent problems&quot; rather than indifferent between propositions. This still reduces to the ordinary principle of indifference when one considers a permutation of the labels as generating equivalent problems (i.e. using the permutation transformation group). To apply this to the above box example, we have three random variables related by geometric equations. If we have no reason to favour one trio of values over another, then our prior probabilities must be related by the rule for changing variables in continuous distributions. Let &quot;L&quot; be the length, and &quot;V&quot; be the volume. Then we must have
:formula_1,

where formula_2 are the probability density functions (pdf) of the stated variables. This equation has a general solution: formula_3, where &quot;K&quot; is a normalization constant, determined by the range of &quot;L&quot;, in this case equal to:
:formula_4

To put this &quot;to the test&quot;, we ask for the probability that the length is less than 4. This has probability of:
:formula_5.

For the volume, this should be equal to the probability that the volume is less than 43 = 64. The pdf of the volume is
:formula_6.

And then probability of volume less than 64 is
:formula_7.

Thus we have achieved invariance with respect to volume and length. One can also show the same invariance with respect to surface area being less than 6(42) = 96. However, note that this probability assignment is not necessarily a &quot;correct&quot; one. For the exact distribution of lengths, volume, or surface area will depend on how the &quot;experiment&quot; is conducted.

The fundamental hypothesis of statistical physics, that any two microstates of a system with the same total energy are equally probable at equilibrium, is in a sense an example of the principle of indifference. However, when the microstates are described by continuous variables (such as positions and momenta), an additional physical basis is needed in order to explain under &quot;which&quot; parameterization the probability density will be uniform. Liouville&#x27;s theorem justifies the use of canonically conjugate variables, such as positions and their conjugate momenta.

The wine/water paradox shows a dilemma with linked variables, and which one to choose.

==History==
This principle stems from Epicurus&#x27; principle of &quot;multiple explanations&quot; (pleonachos tropos), according to which &quot;if more than one theory is consistent with the data, keep them all”. The epicurean Lucretius developed this point with an analogy of the multiple causes of death of a corpse. The original writers on probability, primarily Jacob Bernoulli and Pierre Simon Laplace, considered the principle of indifference to be intuitively obvious and did not even bother to give it a name. Laplace wrote:
:The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.

These earlier writers, Laplace in particular, naively generalized the principle of indifference to the case of continuous parameters, giving the so-called &quot;uniform prior probability distribution&quot;, a function that is constant over all real numbers. He used this function to express a complete lack of knowledge as to the value of a parameter. According to Stigler (page 135), Laplace&#x27;s assumption of uniform prior probabilities was not a meta-physical assumption. It was an implicit assumption made for the ease of analysis.

The principle of insufficient reason was its first name, given to it by Johannes von Kries, possibly as a play on Leibniz&#x27;s principle of sufficient reason. These later writers (George Boole, John Venn, and others) objected to the use of the uniform prior for two reasons. The first reason is that the constant function is not normalizable, and thus is not a proper probability distribution. The second reason is its inapplicability to continuous variables, as described above.

The &quot;principle of insufficient reason&quot; was renamed the &quot;principle of indifference&quot; by , who was careful to note that it applies only when there is no knowledge indicating unequal probabilities.

Attempts to put the notion on firmer philosophical ground have generally begun with the concept of equipossibility and progressed from it to equiprobability.

The principle of indifference can be given a deeper logical justification by noting that equivalent states of knowledge should be assigned equivalent epistemic probabilities. This argument was propounded by Edwin Thompson Jaynes: it leads to two generalizations, namely the principle of transformation groups as in the Jeffreys prior, and the principle of maximum entropy.

More generally, one speaks of uninformative priors.
