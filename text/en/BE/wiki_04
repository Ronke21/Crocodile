<text>Abbotsbury is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. The village is located around west southwest of Dorchester and inland from the English Channel coast. In the 2021 census the civil parish had a population of 451.

Abbotsbury has been described as a tourism honeypot, known for its picturesque historic buildings and thatched cottages, its variety of tourist attractions, and as a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and Dorset National Landscape. Abbotsbury is known for its swannery, subtropical gardens and surviving abbey buildings, including St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, a 14th-century pilgrimage chapel that stands on a hill between the village and the coast. The coastline within the parish includes a section of Chesil Beach, and the South West Coast Path and Macmillan Way long-distance footpaths pass through the village.

The Ilchester Estate owns much of the village, including the swannery and subtropical gardens. The estate owns of land in Dorset.

==Geography==
Abbotsbury village is in the Dorset unitary authority administrative area, situated about inland from the English Channel coast at Chesil Beach, an barrier beach which south of the village encloses The Fleet, a brackish coastal lagoon. The Dorset Downs, an area of rolling chalk hills, rise steeply to the north the village.

Measured directly, the village is about northwest of Weymouth and southeast of Bridport. Abbotsbury is connected to those towns by the B3157, which is the main road running through the village. Abbotsbury is located from Upwey railway station and from Bournemouth International Airport. The coastline within Abbotsbury civil parish is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. All of Abbotsbury parish is within the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
 northwest of the village, at the top of Wears Hill, are the earthworks of Abbotsbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. The earthworks cover a roughly triangular area of about , of which about are inside the ramparts.

In the 10th century a charter of King Edmund records a granting of land at &quot;Abbedesburi&quot;, a name which indicates the land may have once belonged to an abbot. In the 11th century King Cnut granted land at nearby Portesham to the Scandinavian thegn Orc (also Urki, Urk), who took up residence in the area with his wife Tola. The couple founded Abbotsbury Abbey and enriched it with a substantial amount of land.

In 1086, in the Domesday Book Abbotsbury was recorded as &quot;Abedesberie&quot; or &quot;Abodesberie&quot;; it had 62 households, 16 ploughlands, of meadow and 2 mills. It was in the hundred of Uggescombe and the lords and tenants-in-chief were Abbotsbury Abbey and Hawise, wife of Hugh son of Grip.

Abbotsbury Abbey existed for 500 years, but was destroyed in the dissolution, although the abbey barn survived. Stone from the abbey was used in the construction of many buildings in the village, including the house of Abbotsbury&#x27;s new owner, Sir Giles Strangways.
In 1644, during the English Civil War, Roundheads (Parliamentarians) and Cavaliers (Royalists) clashed at Abbotsbury. Parliamentarians besieged the Royalists in the church of St. Nicholas; two bullet holes from the fight remain in the Jacobean pulpit. The Strangways house which had replaced the Abbey after the dissolution was also the scene of a skirmish, as the Royalist Colonel Strangways resisted the Parliamentarians, who besieged the house and burned it. The house gunpowder store exploded in the fire and the house was destroyed, together with the old abbey records which had been stored there.

In the late 17th, and early 18th centuries Abbotsbury experienced several fires, resulting in the destruction of virtually all its medieval buildings. Most of the historic secular buildings in the village today were built from stone in the 17th and 18th centuries.

County historian John Hutchins (1698–1773) recorded that fishing was the main industry in the village, and 18th-century militia ballot lists reveal that husbandry was also particularly important. Ropemaking, basketry and the manufacture of cotton stockings were other notable trades within the village, with records indicating hemp and withies being grown in the area.

In the early 19th century, Abbotsbury&#x27;s population grew steadily, from about 800 in 1801 to nearly 1,100 sixty years later.

During the Second World War, the coastal front was fortified and defended as a part of British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. Later, The Fleet Lagoon was used as a machine gun training range, and bouncing bombs were tested there, for Operation Chastise (the &quot;Dambuster&quot; sortie).

The modern village still has a long street of stone houses, many of which are thatched, with some dating from the 16th century. The street broadens at one point into an old market square. Parts of the street have a raised pavement. The village is surrounded by hills on all sides, except to the east; in 1905 Sir Frederick Treves described Abbotsbury as being &quot;very pleasantly situated among the downs&quot;. Dorset-born broadcaster and writer Ralph Wightman described the village as &quot;possibly the most interesting in Dorset&quot;.

Abbotsbury was the location for a small Royal Observer Corps Bunker, it was located near to Abbotsbury Hill. It was opened in 1959 and closed in 1968, it remains mostly intact. 
==Governance==
In the United Kingdom national parliament, Abbotsbury is in the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

In local government, Abbotsbury is in the Dorset unitary authority area at the highest tier, and Chesil Bank civil parish (which also includes Portesham, Fleet and Langton Herring) at the lowest tier. Abbotsbury elects four of the 15 councillors on Chesil Bank Parish Council. For elections to Dorset Council, it is part of Chesil Bank electoral ward.

Historically, Abbotsbury was in Weymouth Rural District from 1894 to 1933, Dorchester Rural District from 1933 to 1974, and the West Dorset district from 1974 to 2019.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census, the civil parish—which includes the hamlet of Rodden to the east—had 256 dwellings, 219 households and a population of 481. 23.3% of residents were age 65 or over, compared to 16.4% for England as a whole.

===Notable people===
Scientist James Lovelock, best known for proposing the Gaia hypothesis, lived in Abbotsbury in his later years.

Judge Sir David Neuberger took as his Life Peerage title Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury in 2007.

==Transport==
The B3157, known locally as &quot;the coast road&quot;, between Abbotsbury and Burton Bradstock is noted for its fine coastal views and often promoted as a scenic route for tourists. To the west of the village, the road climbs Abbotsbury Hill, a climb with up to 20% gradient that is noted as a popular challenge for cyclists.

Abbotsbury is served by the First Hampshire &amp; Dorset &quot;Jurassic Coaster&quot; branded bus services X52 (summer only) and X53 which provide connections to Axminster, Lyme Regis, Bridport, Weymouth, Lulworth Cove and Wool.

Between 1885 and 1952, Abbotsbury was served by the Abbotsbury Railway, a branch from the main line to Weymouth. It was primarily designed for freight, in anticipation of the development of oil shale deposits and stone at Portesham, as well as iron ore at Abbotsbury which would be shipped to South Wales for processing. The Abbotsbury terminus of the line was sited to the east of the village because the railway could not buy the land needed to build the station closer to the centre of the village.

==Notable buildings==
Nearly a hundred structures within the parish are listed by English Heritage for their historic or architectural interest. These include six structures listed as Grade I and six listed as Grade II*.
To the south of the village, on a bare hill about high, stands St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, a small 14th-century pilgrimage chapel used by the monks of the abbey as a place for private prayer. It is built entirely of stone, including the roof and even the panelled ceiling. The walls are thick and buttressed. The chapel overlooks the English Channel, and may have served as a beacon for sailors, warning of the nearby Isle of Portland. The chapel is listed as Grade I.

The Parish Church of St Nicholas dates from the 14th century but has had various revisions over the centuries. The tower contains three bells dating from 1773 and made by Thomas Castleman Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The chancel was classicised in the 18th century and still has its plastered barrel roof and fine altarpiece. There are also some 15th-century painted glass, a stone effigy of one of the abbots and a Jacobean canopied pulpit. The church is listed as Grade I.

Abbotsbury Abbey tithe barn was built around 1400. It measures and is the world&#x27;s largest thatched tithe barn. It has 23 bays, 11 of which have been unroofed since the 17th century. The 12 roofed bays are covered with thatch, though previously stone slabs were used. Part of the north wall has been destroyed. The barn is listed as Grade I.

==Ilchester Estate==
An estate of some in Dorset covering Chesil Beach and Abbotsbury is held by the Ilchester Estate, owned by Mrs Charlotte Townshend, the daughter of Viscount Galway, a descendant of the first Countess of Ilchester and owner of the Melbury Estate.

===Swannery===
Situated south of the village on the shore of the Fleet lagoon, Abbotsbury Swannery is over 600 years old, having previously been owned by the abbot and managed, using decoys, to provide meat for the abbey. When the abbey was destroyed the swannery passed to the earls of Ilchester, and today the decoys are used for monitoring and recording purposes. The swannery has a large colony of mute swans, as well as other waterfowl, and is open to the public. The site is an important nesting and breeding ground for the swans and, from May through the summer, cygnets can be seen at close quarters.

===Subtropical gardens===
Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens were founded in 1765 by the Countess of Ilchester, as a kitchen garden for the nearby castle. Since then, the gardens have developed into a 20-acre (81,000 m2) site filled with exotic plants, many of which were newly discovered species when they were first introduced. There are formal and informal gardens, with woodland walks and walled gardens. In 1990 violent storms damaged many of the rare specimens, which have since been replaced by younger plants.
==Amenities==
Abbotsbury has a village hall, called the Strangways Village Hall; it is run by the Strangways Hall Committee and is a registered charity and available for hire. The village has two public houses, The Ilchester Arms and The Swan Inn, and several tearooms, small shops and businesses. The village also has a cricket ground.

== Abbotsbury Garland Day ==
Held on 13 May each year, Abbotsbury Garland Day has been celebrated since about the early 19th century. The custom was first described in John Hutchins&#x27; &quot;History of Dorset&quot; in 1867. Originally, the children of the local fishermen made garlands which were blessed in a church service and some were then rowed out to sea to be tossed into the water. The children would then spend the rest of the day playing on the beach.

After World War I, the custom evolved and children of non-fishermen started to take part, probably due to the decline of the local fishing industry. The village school gave the children a day&#x27;s holiday and they would construct two garlands, one of wild flowers and the other of garden flowers. These were held aloft on poles and paraded from house to house in the village with the intention of collecting money which the children would keep. Later in the day, older children who had been at school in Weymouth would arrive home and make a more elaborate garland which would also be taken around the houses. Two garlands would be placed on the war memorial.

Abbotsbury village school closed in 1981 and the children no longer get a holiday, so the celebrations now usually take place in the evening or on the nearest Saturday.

<text>The yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea), is one of two species of night heron in genus &quot;Nyctanassa&quot;. Unlike the black-crowned night heron, which has a worldwide distribution, the yellow-crowned is restricted to the Americas. It is known as the &quot;bihoreau violacé&quot; in French and the &quot;pedrete corona clara&quot; or &quot;yaboa común&quot; in some Spanish-speaking countries.

== Taxonomy ==
The yellow-crowned night heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with herons, cranes and egrets in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea violacea&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;crested bittern&quot; that had been described in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in the first volume of his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America, but this has been restricted to the Carolinas following Catesby. The yellow-crowned night heron is now placed together with the extinct Bermuda night heron in the genus &quot;Nyctanassa&quot; that was introduced in 1887 by the Norwegian born zoologist Leonhard Stejneger. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;nux&quot; meaning &quot;night&quot; with &quot;anassa&quot; meaning &quot;queen&quot; or &quot;lady&quot;; the specific epithet is from Latin &quot;violaceus&quot; meaning &quot;violet-coloured&quot;. The related heron, the Bermuda night heron, was endemic to Bermuda, but probably became extinct following human colonization.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;N. v. violacea&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – central, east USA to east Mexico and east Costa Rica
* &quot;N. v. bancrofti&quot; Huey, 1927 – west Mexico to west Nicaragua, Socorro Island and West Indies
* &quot;N. v. caliginis&quot; Wetmore, 1946 – Panama and west Colombia to Peru
* &quot;N. v. cayennensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Panama and northeast Colombia to northeast Brazil
* &quot;N. v. pauper&quot; (Sclater, PL &amp; Salvin, 1870) – Galápagos Islands
Being a heron, the yellow-crowned night heron is related to egrets and bitterns (the family Ardeidae), and, more distantly, to pelicans and ibises (the order Pelecaniformes). The night herons are usually considered to have separated from the day herons (such as the great blue heron or the green heron).

Various classifications recognize five subspecies, but little is known as to how much they are integrated together and how much their geographic range varies. Their body size decreases from north to south, and the shape of their bills varies geographically, depending on the size of the crustaceans they eat in different regions.

==Description==
=== General shape ===
The yellow-crowned night heron is a rather stocky wading bird, ranging from and from , the females being a little smaller than the males. The yellow-crowned night heron has a wingspan ranging from . The neck, slim when extended, exposes its large head (compared to its body), with a large and heavy bill.

=== Colors ===

The body and back are a smooth grey-blue, with a black scaled pattern on the wings. The long legs are yellow and turn coral, pink or red during courtship. The most characteristic part of the yellow-crowned night heron is the head: black and glossy, with white cheeks and a pale yellow crown going from the bill, between the eyes and to the back of the head, giving the bird its common name. Such colours make the face appear striped in a horizontal black-white-black-white pattern. Long, thin, white feathers grow to the back of the crown during mating season. The bill, also black, is thick and deeply set under the eyes which are dark orange or red.

=== Flight ===
Like all herons, the yellow-crowned night heron flies with long, slow purposeful wing beats. It can be found gliding over water with its legs easily visible, extended straight below the tail, unlike the black-crowned night heron, whose legs can barely be seen in flight.

=== Juveniles and immatures ===
It takes about three years for yellow-crowned night herons to acquire the full physical appearance of adults. Before that, the young birds show signs of immaturity, such as a brownish body, an overall greyish head, drab colors and spots and streaks on their plumage.

Although the adults are easy to tell apart, juvenile yellow-crowned night heron can look very similar to juvenile black-crowned night heron. Yellow-crowned juveniles tend to stand straighter and have heavier bills and longer legs, and their spots and streaks are finer than those of the black-crowned.

== Habitat ==

The yellow-crowned night heron looks for shallow water to live in: marshes, wooded swamps, and lakeshores for inland populations, and thickets, mangroves and cliff-bound coasts for coastal populations. It can also be found in areas that do not always have enough water, but that get flooded on a regular basis. Its habitat is closely linked to that of the crustaceans that make for most of its diet, and it tolerates fresh water, brackish water and saltwater.

Another important habitat factor is nesting sites. The yellow-crowned night heron needs bushes or trees to build nests, although it will use rock ledges where vegetation is unavailable (for example, on cliffs).

Unlike the black-crowned night heron, the yellow-crowned does not mind living near humans and can be found in wooded neighborhoods, nesting on rooftops and driveways. Such cohabitation may not go smoothly and can create conflicts with humans.

== Distribution and migration ==
The yellow-crowned night heron is found exclusively in the Americas, and its distribution depends closely on food (mainly crustaceans) availability.

=== Winter and year-round range ===
It winters where the climate allows for year-round crab activity: tropical and subtropical regions, southern Florida, the Gulf Coast (Louisiana to Alabama), and the eastern Texas coast. It is also found in Mexico, Central America, the Galápagos Islands, the Caribbean and northern South America (south to Peru and Brazil in coastal regions) where generally resident.

=== Breeding range ===
From 1925 to 1960, the yellow-crowned night heron spread northward for reasons still not clear. Today [when?], in addition to its winter and year-round range, it can be found in the south-east inland of the United States during breeding season, and additional isolated breeding colonies have been recorded even farther inland, all the way to the northern border of the United States.

=== Migration ===
Different subspecies and populations have different migratory behaviour. Subspecies and populations that are insular or live in warmer areas are confirmed to be sedentary. The tropical subspecies and populations migrate, but to an extent that is still unclear for lack of data. The migratory behaviour of the yellow-crowned night heron has changed with its expansion north: one subspecies (&quot;Nyctanassa violacea violacea&quot;) migrates to the northern limits of its range, moving north and west after breeding. Birds observed outside of the normal range are usually first-years or strays.

Migration occurs in mid-March in lower latitude, and from mid-March to April in higher latitude.

==Behavior==

=== Vocalizations ===
The most common call of the yellow-crowned night heron is a loud, sharp and quick &quot;squawk&quot; that the bird gives shortly after taking off or uses as an alarm call or an aggression call. The young beg for food with a soft &quot;chu-chu-chu&quot; call that becomes louder as the chicks grow older and more demanding. A different range of vocalizations plays an important part in courtship and pair formation. Males and females use a &quot;yup-yup&quot; call during the greeting ceremony, and a &quot;huh!&quot; call when they form a pair among other nesting birds. The male concludes his courtship display with a &quot;whoop&quot; which may or may not lead to the pair actually forming.

===Feeding===

The yellow-crowned night heron eats mainly crustaceans (crabs and crayfish) as well as insects, some fish (eels and pipefish) or worms (leeches and other aquatic worms). Crabs preyed upon include fiddler crabs, marsh crabs, blue crabs (&quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;, &quot;Callinectes similis&quot; and &quot;Cardisoma guanhumi&quot;) and green crabs. It can also feed on amphibians, molluscs (mussels and snails), lizards, snakes, small rodents and small birds. The geographic location of the heron is closely related to the prey it may find, and the size and shape of its bill allows it to hunt for prey of specific size.

The yellow-crowned night heron may forage any time of the day and night, although it prefers the night to feed the young. It becomes very aggressive if another individual approaches when foraging, but will tolerate a safe distance of about ten meters. It selects prey visually, either stalking it or standing and waiting for it to come within reach. When hunting crayfish, the heron stands at the entrance of the burrow, always facing the sun so its shadow is not cast over the entrance of the burrow, which would alert the crawfish. It can also choose an alternate pattern of walking slowly towards prey with its body bent and its head retracted, then standing and waiting before walking slowly again, sneaking up effectively on unsuspecting crabs. Sometimes it can be seen running in shallow water after prey, but it will not follow one in deep water.

Once close enough, it lunges with its bill. Small prey are swallowed whole while larger prey (for example, a large crab), it will try to dismember in order to eat the body first and the legs last, or to jab it straight through the body. It will also carry crabs, molluscs or fish away from the water to prevent them from escaping.

Any indigestible material, such as crab shells, is ejected in a pellet, and it is quite common to find shells and pellets scattered around foraging and nesting areas.

===Breeding===

==== Courtship and nest-building ====
Like many other aspects of its life, the yellow-crowned night heron&#x27;s breeding season depends closely on the emergence of crabs in the spring; the crab cycle itself depends on temperatures. As such, the breeding season of the yellow-crowned night heron varies geographically, typically between March and May. In some tropical locations, it can breed all year.

It is still unclear exactly how, and for how long, the yellow-crowned night heron forms a mating pair. Some herons arrive at breeding grounds already in pairs, meaning they either found a mate during their migration to the breeding grounds, or they have been with this mate for some time. Others form their pair or renew it upon reaching the breeding grounds.

The breeding grounds are chosen near water and host loose, rather small colonies of reproducing herons, unlike those of most wading birds that welcome large colonies. Colonies often start small with only a pair nesting, then grow over the years and can last over 20 years.

About 9–10 days after arriving at the breeding grounds, the pair builds a nest. The male usually chooses an emplacement and starts to build the nest for the female. Eventually, both birds decide where to build their nest, sometimes starting several nests before settling down. At first, the male brings material (twigs, branches and such) for the female to build the nest, then both perform both roles. Sometimes they will steal material from a nearby nest being built. They can be seen repairing their nest well into the breeding season. Trees and bushes are the preferred location for nests, the herons will usually build in high branches away from the trunk. A pair can use the same nest for years, enlarging it every season; the first nest is usually just large enough to hold the eggs. Nest-building is not the result of successful courtship, but rather an active part of the courtship.

==== Hatching and development of the young ====

The yellow-crowned night heron typically has one brood per year. It will try to replace a brood completely lost if it is not too late into the breeding season, but not a partially lost brood. The female lays two to six eggs, depending on the conditions, especially the temperature. The eggs are oval and smooth, with a pale green-blue color. Both parents start guarding the nest as soon as the first egg is laid, and they both incubate the clutch in turn.

24–29 days later, the young hatch, vulnerable and entirely dependent on their parents. They look nothing like the adults with their white-grey short, soft feathers, their wide blue eye-ring and their yellow bill.

During the first two weeks, both adults the young. After this period, they will only shelter the chicks from sun, rain or strong wind. Both parents feed the young, taking turns gathering food and guarding the nest. They regurgitate food in the center of the nest rather than feeding each chick individually. The young do not recognize their own parents and will adopt their begging-for-food behavior whenever any adult is around them; the adults, on the other hand, recognize their own chicks and are aggressive towards other offspring, driving them away and refusing to feed them.

When the nest grows too tight for the chicks, they start venturing to its edges; they leave the nest 36–42 days after hatching. They cannot fly yet, so they walk around the nests and return daily to the colony to be fed, and they keep doing so for another three weeks. They start taking short flights by the sixth week, and are capable of sustained flight between their seventh and eleventh week. Once again, crab availability intervenes at this point: the more crabs are available to the young, the less often they come back to the roost and the less they rely on adults to be fed.

The immature birds will roost with the adults until the end of the breeding season, after which they disperse to unknown destinations. They will not be seen on the breeding grounds until they have acquired their adult plumage (two or three years later), and little is known about their ecology during this time. This mystery is actually a research priority about the yellow-crowned night heron.

== Human interaction ==
Like many other species of birds, the yellow-crowned night heron is an intermediate host and amplifier of the eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus (sleeping sickness). This common virus in the Southeast of the United States is lethal to horses and can be to humans as well. It is transmitted by mosquitoes: an infected mosquito will transmit the virus to a yellow-crowned night heron, which will be unaffected by it but will host it (the heron is known as a &quot;reservoir host&quot; for the virus) until another mosquito picks it up from the heron and transmits it to a horse or a human. Because of the long distances over which yellow-crowned night herons travel during migration, they can carry the virus over larger geographical areas, becoming amplifiers of EEE. However, EEE remains a rare disease of which the symptoms can be treated, and only a few cases are identified most years.

== Threats and conservation ==

=== Threats ===
The yellow-crowned night heron has no real competition for food. The adults have virtually no predators, but the nests are vulnerable to other animals. Both the eggs and the young are an appealing meal to American crows and some mammals such as raccoons. Crows are also known to harass adult yellow-crowned night heron out of their nest, or displace the eggs in order to use the nest themselves. The importance of the impact of such predation varies geographically, Virginia being the state where it matters the most.

Human activities also constitute threats to the yellow-crowned night heron. In areas where the herons cohabit with people, they are often disturbed or shooed away from their nests if they get too close to human habitations. Loss of habitat is another major threat to the yellow-crowned night heron, with the wetlands they favor regressing continually. Additionally, in some part of the Americas such as Louisiana and the Bahamas, the meat of the yellow-crowned night heron is considered a delicacy, leading to illegal hunting of the fledgling.

=== Conservation status and measures ===
The yellow-crowned night heron is generally not considered a threatened species, as the population size is very large, its range is wide and it has a stable trend. Its status with the IUCN is of Least Concern, meaning no conservation action is required across the species’ range. However, this status changes in some specific geographic locations, such as Indiana, where the yellow-crowned night heron is considered endangered, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Kentucky where it is classified as Threatened, and Virginia, where it is classified as Special Concern. As such, some conservation measures are taken locally, but the conservation of the yellow-crowned night heron is usually simply included in broader projects, especially those that aim for wetland conservation.

The yellow-crowned night heron was introduced in the Bermudas in the end of the 1970s as a means of biological control against land crabs, which were considered a pest as were digging holes in the golf courses and the population went out of control after the closely related Bermuda night heron went extinct in the 1600s. As yellow-crowned night herons are opportunistic feeders, not specialist feeders like the Bermuda night heron which have since decimated native land crab populations and have been observed predating endemic and critically endangered Bermuda rock lizards.

==In culture==
In 2019, the yellow-crowned night heron was named the official bird of the City of Houston, Texas.

<text>The black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) [or black-capped night heron], commonly shortened to just night heron in Eurasia, is a medium-sized heron found throughout a large part of the world, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North and South America. In Australasia it is replaced by the closely related Nankeen night heron (&quot;N. caledonicus&quot;), with which it has hybridised in the area of contact.

==Taxonomy and name==
The black-crowned night heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with herons, cranes and egrets in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea nycticorax&quot;, based on specimens from southern Europe. It is now placed in the genus &quot;Nycticorax&quot; that was described in 1817 by the English naturalist Thomas Forster for this species. The epithet &quot;nycticorax&quot; is from Ancient Greek and combines &quot;nux&quot;, &quot;nuktos&quot; meaning &quot;night&quot; and &quot;korax&quot; meaning &quot;raven&quot;. The word was used by authors such as Aristotle and Hesychius of Miletus for a &quot;bird of ill omen&quot;, perhaps an owl. The word was used by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555 and then by subsequent authors for a black-crowned night heron.

Four subspecies are accepted:
* &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Eurasia south to Africa and Madagascar and east to east Asia, Philippines and Indonesian Archipelago
* &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; (Gmelin, 1789) – southern Canada to northern Argentina and northern Chile; Hawaii
* &quot;N. n. obscurus&quot; (Bonaparte, 1855) – central and southern Chile and southwest Argentina
* &quot;N. n. falklandicus&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1914) – Falkland Islands

In the Falkland Islands, the bird is called &quot;quark&quot;, which is an onomatopoeia similar to its name in many other languages, like &quot;qua-bird&quot; in English, in Dutch and West Frisian, in Czech, in Ukrainian, in Russian, in Vietnamese, in Indonesian, (&quot;wactli&quot;) in Nahuatl (cf. the scientific name of the New World subspecies), and in Quechua.

== Description ==
Adults have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey, red eyes, and short yellow legs. They have pale grey wings and white under parts. One to eight (mostly two to four) long slender white plumes, erected in greeting and courtship displays, extend from the back of the head. The sexes are similar in appearance although the males are slightly larger. Black-crowned night herons do not fit the typical body form of the heron family. They are relatively stocky with shorter bills, legs, and necks than their more familiar cousins, the egrets and &quot;day&quot; herons. Their resting posture is normally somewhat hunched but when hunting they extend their necks and look more like other wading birds. For a short period during courtship at the start of the nesting season, the legs of adults turn bright salmon-pink, and the bare skin around the eyes blue.

The subspecies differ little; nominate &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot; and &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; are particularly similar in plumage (some authors have considered &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; a synonym of the nominate), but the latter is on average slightly larger. &quot;N. n obscurus&quot; is the most distinctive subspecies, clearly darker than &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; from further north in South America, but &quot;N. n. falklandicus&quot; is intermediate, with both paler and darker individuals occurring.

Immature birds have dull grey-brown plumage on their heads, wings, and backs, with numerous pale &quot;teardrop&quot; spots. Their underparts are paler and streaked with brown. Second and third year birds attain plumages increasingly similar to adults, but lacking the white head plumes. The young birds have orange eyes and duller yellowish-green legs. They are very noisy birds in their nesting colonies, with calls that are commonly transcribed as or .

Measurements:
* Length. &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot;: ; &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot;: 
* Weight. &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot;: male , female ; &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot;: 
* Wingspan. &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot;: ; &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot;: 

== Distribution ==
The breeding habitat is fresh and salt-water wetlands throughout much of the world. The nominate subspecies &quot;N. n. nycticorax&quot; breeds in Europe, Asia and Africa, subspecies &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; in North and South America from Canada as far south as northern Argentina and Chile, &quot;N. n. obscurus&quot; in southernmost South America, and &quot;N. n. falklandicus&quot; in the Falkland Islands. Black-crowned night herons nest in colonies on platforms of sticks in a group of trees, or on the ground in protected locations such as islands or reedbeds. Three to eight eggs are laid.

This heron is migratory in the northern parts of its range, but is otherwise resident (even in the cold Patagonia). European birds winter in Africa (with a few staying in southern Spain), central and east Asian birds winter in southern Asia, and North American birds winters in Mexico, the southern United States, Central America, and the West Indies.

A colony of the herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for more than a century. The birds also prominently live year-round in the shores around the San Francisco Bay, with the largest rookery in Oakland. Their ever presence at Oakland&#x27;s Lake Merritt and throughout the city&#x27;s downtown area, as well as their resilience to the urban environment and displacement efforts, have led to them being named Oakland&#x27;s official city bird.

=== Status in Great Britain ===
There are two archaeological specimens of the black-crowned night heron in Great Britain. The oldest is from the Roman London Wall and the more recent from the Royal Navy&#x27;s late medieval victualling yards in Greenwich. It appears in the London poulterers&#x27; price lists as the Brewe, a bird which was thought to have been the Eurasian whimbrel or glossy ibis, which has now been shown to refer to the black-crowned night heron, derived from the medieval French &quot;Bihoreau&quot;. Black-crowned night heron may have bred in the far wetter and wider landscape of pre-modern Britain. They were certainly imported for the table so the bone specimens themselves do not prove they were part of the British avifauna. In modern times the black-crowned night heron is a vagrant (excluding the feral breeding colonies that were established at Edinburgh Zoo from 1950 into the start of the 21st century and at Great Witchingham in Norfolk, where there were 8 pairs in 2003 but breeding was not repeated subsequently). A pair of adults were seen with two recently fledged juveniles in Somerset in 2017, which is the first proven breeding record of wild black-crowned night herons in Great Britain.

== Behaviour ==

These birds stand still at the water&#x27;s edge and wait to ambush prey, mainly at night, early morning or evening. They primarily eat small fish, leeches, earthworms, mussels, squid, crustaceans (such as crayfish), frogs, other amphibians, aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, lizards, snakes, small mammals (such as rodents), small birds, eggs, carrion, plant material, and garbage and refuse at landfills. They are among the seven heron species observed to engage in bait fishing; luring or distracting fish by tossing edible or inedible buoyant objects into water within their striking range – a rare example of tool use among birds. During the day they rest in dense trees or bushes. &quot;N. n. hoactli&quot; is more gregarious outside the breeding season than the nominate race.

== Parasites ==
A thorough study performed by J. Sitko and P. Heneberg in the Czech Republic in 1962–2013 suggested that the central European black-crowned night herons host 8 helminth species. The dominant species consisted of &quot;Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus&quot; (62% prevalence), &quot;Contracaecum microcephalum&quot; (55% prevalence) and &quot;Opistorchis longissimus&quot; (10% prevalence). The mean number of helminth species recorded per host individual reached 1.41. In Ukraine, other helminth species are often found in black-crowned night herons too, including &quot;Echinochasmus beleocephalus&quot;, &quot;Echinochasmus ruficapensis&quot;, &quot;Clinostomum complanatum&quot; and &quot;Posthodiplostomum cuticola&quot;.

<text>The General Educational Development (GED) tests are a group of four academic subject tests in the United States and its territories certifying academic knowledge equivalent to a high school diploma. This certification is an alternative to the U.S. high school diploma, as is HiSET. Passing the GED test gives those who do not complete high school, or who do not meet requirements for high school diploma, the opportunity to earn a Certificate of High School Equivalency or similarly titled credential. 
GED Testing Service is a joint venture of the American Council on Education, which started the GED program in 1942.

The American Council on Education, in Washington, D.C. (U.S.), which owns the GED trademark, coined the initialism to identify &quot;tests of general equivalency development&quot; that measure proficiency in science, mathematics, social studies, reading, and writing. The GED Testing Service website does not refer to the test as anything but &quot;GED&quot;. It is called the GED in the majority of the United States, and internationally. In 2014, some states in the United States switched from GED to the HiSET and TASC (discontinued December 31, 2021). Iowa and Maine do not accept the GED.

The GED Testing Service is a joint venture of the American Council on Education. Pearson is the sole developer for the GED test. The test is taken in person. States and jurisdictions award a high school equivalency credential (also called a high school equivalency development or general equivalency diploma) to persons who meet the passing score requirements.

In addition to English, the GED tests are available in Spanish in several states (e.g. California, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Nevada, Texas). Tests and test preparation are also offered to people who are incarcerated or who live on military bases. People who live outside the United States and U.S. territories may be eligible to take the GED tests through Pearson VUE testing centers. Utah&#x27;s Adult High School Completion program is an alternative for people who prefer to earn a diploma.

==History==

In November 1942, the United States Armed Forces Institute asked the American Council on Education (ACE) to develop a battery of tests to measure high school-level academic skills. These tests gave military personnel and veterans who had enrolled in the military before completing high school a way to demonstrate their proficiency. Passing these tests gave returning soldiers and sailors the academic credentials they needed to get civilian jobs and gain access to post-secondary education or training.

ACE revised the GED tests for a third time in 1988. The most noticeable change to the series was the addition of a writing sample, or essay. The new tests placed more emphasis on socially relevant topics and problem-solving skills. Surveys of test-takers found that more students (65%) reported taking the test with the intention of continuing their education beyond high school, rather than to get better employment (30%).

A fourth revision was made in 2002 to make the test comply with more recent standards for high-school education.

A fifth revision was released on January 2, 2014, designed to be administered on Pearson VUE, a proprietary computer-based testing platform. The new test applies to the United States and internationally, but not to Canada, which used the 2002 version. As of May 2024, Canada discontinued the GED. It retained four content areas—language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies—but with different content to &quot;measure a foundational core of knowledge and skills that are essential for career and college readiness.&quot;

==Test administration==
There are more than 6,000 official GED Testing Centers in the United States and its territories, and several hundred in other countries. Testing centers are most often in adult-education centers, community colleges, and public schools. Students in metropolitan areas may be able to choose from several testing locations.

Official GED Testing Centers are controlled environments. All testing sessions take place either in person or online according to specific rules, and security measures are enforced. Breaks may be permitted between tests, depending on how many tests are being administered in a session. There may be restrictions on what test-takers may bring into the testing room.

There are approximately three to six GED test forms in circulation at any time. This helps catch test-takers who may be cheating. As with any standardized test, the various test forms are calibrated to the same level of difficulty

The GED has also been administered online since January 2020, but some states (Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Wyoming) do not recognize the GED earned this way.

===Eligibility===
Regulations governing who is eligible to take the GED vary by state. According to GED Testing Service policy, students at least 16 years old and not enrolled in high school are eligible for the program. However, many states require the candidate to be 17 years old and a resident of the state. Some states that allow students under 17 years of age to take the test require a letter of parental consent and a letter of consent from the student&#x27;s school district. In South Africa and Namibia, students who are at least 17 years old are eligible.

===Cost===
The cost of the GED test for test-takers varies depending on the state. , costs in Maryland were $45, free in New York, but the typical fees are $120 for all four tests, or $30 for each of the four subject tests. There is an additional fee to take the test online, typically $6 per test. The cost of each test outside of the U.S. is $80 each.

In Canada the testing is free in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the Northwest Territories. For the remaining provinces and territories the price varies between $6 per test in Newfoundland and Labrador to $40 per test in Alberta.

===Students with disabilities===
People with disabilities who want to take the GED test may be entitled to receive reasonable testing accommodations. If a qualified professional has documented the disability, the candidate should get the appropriate form from the Testing Center:
* Physical disability and chronic-health disability (such as blindness, low vision, hearing impairment, and mobility impairment): &quot;Request for Testing Accommodations—Physical/Chronic Health Disability&quot; form
* Learning or cognitive disability (such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, receptive aphasia, and written-language disorder): &quot;Request for Testing Accommodations—Learning and Other Cognitive Disabilities&quot; form
* Emotional or mental-health disorder (such as bipolar disorder, Tourette&#x27;s syndrome, and schizophrenia): &quot;Request for Testing Accommodations—Emotional/Mental health&quot; form
* Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (inattentive type, hyperactive–impulse type, or combined type): &quot;Request for Testing Accommodations—Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&quot; form

The candidate returns the completed form to the GED testing center. Each request is considered individually. If accommodations are approved, the local GED testing examiner conducts the testing with the approved accommodations, which are provided at no extra charge. Accommodations may include, but are not limited to:
* Audio cassette tests
* Braille or large-print tests
* Vision-enhancing technologies
* Use of video equipment
* Use of a talking calculator or abacus
* Use of a sign language interpreter
* Use of a scribe (a person who writes down the test-taker&#x27;s answers)
* Extended testing time

==Passing the GED testing battery==
Possible scores on each test (4) within the GED battery range from a minimum of 100 to a maximum of 200. A score of 200 on an individual test puts the student in the top 1% of graduating high school seniors. ACE issues recommendations for what constitutes a minimum passing score for any given sub-test (currently 145) and for the test as a whole (currently 580—i.e., an average of 145 per test across all four sub-tests). Although most GED-issuing jurisdictions (for the most part, Boards of Education of U.S. states) adopt these minimum standards as their own, a jurisdiction may choose to establish higher standards for issuance of the certificate. Many jurisdictions award honors-level equivalency diplomas to students who meet certain criteria higher than those for a standard diploma in a given jurisdiction. Some districts hold graduation ceremonies for GED tests passers and/or award scholarships to the highest scorers. The GED test pass rate for all takers is almost 60%.

Colleges that admit based upon high school grades may require a minimum score on the GED test in order to admit students based upon the test. For example, Arizona State University requires an average sub-test score of in addition to the certificate.

If a student passes one or more, but not all four, tests within the battery, he or she only needs to retake the test(s) not passed. Most places limit the number of times students may take each individual test within a year. A student may encounter a waiting period before being allowed to retake a failed test. Tests must be completed by the expiration date, which is generally every two years on the last day of the year.

The GED test is available in many countries around the world. Since 2015, the GED test has become popular in African countries including South Africa and Namibia.

Many government institutions and universities regard the GED test credential as the same as a high school diploma with respect to program eligibility and as a prerequisite for admissions. The U.S. military, however, has higher requirements in admissions for GED test takers to compensate for their lack of a traditional high school diploma. 

The test is administered to a representative sample of graduating high-school seniors each year, about 30% of whom fail the test.

==Effects on employability==
The GED certification itself (i.e., without further post-secondary education or training) does not help people get jobs as much as a high school diploma does. People who have earned the GED credential tend to earn more than dropouts and less than high school graduates. Economist James Heckman found in a 1993 study that this is primarily due to differences in the characteristics and backgrounds of GED test graduates. When controlling for other influences, he finds no evidence that, for the average taker, the GED test credential improves an individual&#x27;s economic opportunities above those for other dropouts.

However, there is a stigma for GED certification holders that affects their employability or pursuit of higher education.

== Calls for abolition ==
There are calls for the GED to be abolished. Those who support abolishing the GED say the program reduces high school graduation rates, is outmoded, and a financial burden for low-income participants.

As of May 3, 2024, the General Education Development (GED) high school equivalency program is no longer available in Canada and is now replaced with the new Canadian Adult Education Credential (CAEC).

<text>The sand cat (Felis margarita) is a small wild cat that inhabits sandy and stony deserts far from water sources. With its sandy to light grey fur, it is well camouflaged in a desert environment. Its head-and-body length ranges from with a long tail. Its short ears are set low on the sides of the head, aiding detection of prey moving underground. The long hair covering the soles of its paws insulates its pads against the extreme temperatures found in deserts.

The first sand cat known to scientists was discovered in the Algerian Sahara and described in 1858. To date, it has been recorded in several disjunct locations in Western Sahara, Morocco, Algeria, Niger, Chad, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In Central Asia, it was first recorded in the Karakum Desert in 1925. The large gap between these two regions of its global range was partially closed in 1948, when a sand cat skin was found in an oasis of the Rub&#x27; al Khali in Oman. It is discontinuously distributed in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In the early 1970s, sand cats were caught in southwestern Pakistan and exported to zoos worldwide. Due to its wide distribution and large population, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

The sand cat usually rests in underground dens during the day and hunts at night. It moves on average at night in search of small rodents and birds. It also kills and consumes venomous snakes. In spring, the female gives birth to two to three kittens, which become sexually mature around the age of one year. The sand cat&#x27;s ecological requirements are still poorly understood, as only a few in-depth studies targeting wild sand cat populations have been conducted.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Felis margarita&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Victor Loche in 1858 who first described a sand cat specimen found in the area of &quot;Négonça&quot; in the northern Algerian Sahara. This holotype specimen appears to have been lost. The species was named after the French General Jean Auguste Margueritte.

In the 20th century, the following zoological specimens of sand cats were described:
*&quot;Eremaelurus thinobius&quot; was proposed as a species by Sergey Ognev in 1926. The specimen had been collected in the eastern Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan. In 1938, Reginald Innes Pocock also considered it a species, but subordinated it to the genus &quot;Felis&quot; using the scientific name &quot;Felis thinobius&quot;. Later he considered it a sand cat subspecies, which to date is widely recognised.
*&quot;F. m. meinertzhageni&quot; proposed by Pocock in 1938 was a sand cat skin from the Algerian Sahara.
*&quot;F. m. aïrensis&quot; proposed by Pocock in 1938 was a female specimen collected in the Aïr Mountains in 1937.
* &quot;F. m. scheffeli&quot; proposed by German zoologist Helmut Hemmer in 1974 was described on the basis of seven sand cats that had been captured alive in Pakistan&#x27;s Nushki desert.
* &quot;F. m. harrisoni&quot; proposed by Hemmer, Grubb and Groves in 1976 was described on the basis of a skin and skull of an adult male sand cat captured in 1967 in Umm al Samim, Oman.

In 1974, &quot;F. m. margarita&quot;, &quot;F. m. thinobia&quot; and &quot;F. m. scheffeli&quot; were temporarily recognized as valid taxa. At the time, it was considered possible that sand cats eventually recorded in Afghanistan and Iran might constitute distinct subspecies.
In 2005, &quot;F. m. margarita&quot;, &quot;F. m. thinobia&quot;, &quot;F. m. scheffeli&quot; and &quot;F. m. harrisoni&quot; were recognised as valid taxa by W. Chris Wozencraft, who considered &quot;F. m. meinertzhageni&quot; and &quot;F. m. aïrensis&quot; synonyms of the nominate subspecies &quot;F. m. margarita&quot;.
The Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group reviewed the existing information and in 2017 recognized only two subspecies based on morphological differences, namely:

* &quot;Felis margarita margarita&quot;, also called the Saharan sand cat, occurs in North Africa. It is smaller in size with brighter, more yellow fur, with more pronounced markings and 2–6 rings on the tail.
* &quot;Felis margarita thinobia&quot;, also called the Turkestan sand cat, Arabian sand cat, and Pakistan sand cat, it occurs in West and Central Asia. It is larger in size with less pronounced markings, a darker, more greyish coat, and only 2–3 rings on the tail.

Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of 47 individuals from across the sand cat&#x27;s range showed that their haplotypes differed only by one to three base pair mutations. This low degree of genetic differentiation between the African and Asian sand cats indicates that the Sinai Peninsula may have been a barrier to gene flow.

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .
The sand cat is part of an evolutionary lineage that is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the &quot;Felis&quot; species around , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA. Analysis of their mitochondrial DNA indicates a genetic divergence of the &quot;Felis&quot; species at around . Both models agree that the jungle cat (&quot;F. chaus&quot;) was the first &quot;Felis&quot; species that diverged, followed by the black-footed cat (&quot;F. nigripes&quot;) and then the sand cat.
It migrated into Africa, possibly during Pleistocene glaciation events. Migration was likely facilitated by extended periods of low sea levels between continents.

A fossil jaw and other skeletal remains of a sand cat were excavated in a Late Pleistocene cave in El Harhoura located near Temara in Morocco.


== Characteristics ==

The sand cat&#x27;s fur is of a pale, sandy, isabelline colour, but much lighter on the lower part of the head, around the nose, throat, and on the belly. A faint reddish line runs from the outer corner of each eye across the cheeks. There are dark brown to blackish bars on the limbs, and the tail has a black tip with two or three dark rings alternating with buff bands. Markings vary between individuals: some have neither spots nor stripes, some are faintly spotted, some have both spots and stripes.
Its head is sandy brown. The large, greenish-yellow eyes are ringed with white, and the nose is blackish. Its whiskers are white and up to long.
Its ears are tawny at the base and tipped with black. Its outer ear is similar to that of a domestic cat, but its ear canal is about twice the size. The magnitude of acoustic input-admittance is about five times higher than of a domestic cat. Additionally, hearing sensitivity of the sand cat is about 8 decibels greater than that of the domestic cat.

In Central Asia, the sand cat&#x27;s winter coat is very long and thick, with hairs reaching up to in length. Its claws on the forelimbs are short and very sharp, and claws on the hind feet are small and blunt. The undersides of its paws are protected from extreme temperatures by a thick covering of fur. The long hairs growing between its toes create a cushion of fur over the foot pads, helping to insulate them while moving over hot sand. This feature makes the cat&#x27;s tracks obscure and difficult to identify and follow.

The sand cat is characterized by a flat, wide head, short legs, and a relatively long tail of . It stands at the shoulder and weighs . The head-and-body length ranges from . The long ears are set low, giving a broad, flat appearance to the head.

Its skull is arched in lateral outline with wide zygomatic arches. The pinnae of the ears are triangular, and the ear canal is very wide, giving the cat an enhanced sense of hearing. The auditory bullae and the passages from the external ears to the ear drums are greatly enlarged compared to other small wild cats; the inner parts of the ears are protected from foreign objects by long, closely spaced white hairs.
It has a bite force at the canine tip of 155.4 Newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 136.7.

==Distribution and habitat==

The sand cat inhabits both sandy and stony deserts. It is widely but not contiguously distributed in the deserts of North Africa and Southwest and Central Asia.
It prefers flat or undulating terrain with sparse vegetation of grasses or small bushes; it avoids bare and shifting sand dunes, where little prey is available.

In the Western Sahara, sand cats were sighted and photographed in the Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab region several times between 2005 and 2016.
Sand cat kittens that had been hiding beneath a tuft of &quot;Panicum turgidum&quot; grass were sighted and photographed in the area in April 2017.
In Algeria, one individual was recorded near a salt cedar mound in the Ahaggar Mountains in 2008.
No confirmed records are known in Mauritania, Tunisia and Libya. In Mali&#x27;s Lake Faguibine area, one individual was shortly sighted by night in 2011.
In the Ténéré Desert, sand cats were observed in the 1980s and between 2008 and 2015.
Sightings in Egypt&#x27;s rocky Western and Eastern Deserts date to the mid 1980s. In the Sinai peninsula, sand cats were sighted in the mid 1990s.

On the Arabian Peninsula, a sand cat skin was discovered by Wilfred Thesiger in 1948 in an oasis of the Rub&#x27; al Khali desert.
In Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, sand cats were captured and encountered trapped in wire mesh fence surrounding the adjacent Saja Umm Ar-Rimth Natural Reserve in the country&#x27;s Najd region. In the Tabuk Region, two sand cats were killed by hunters in 2013 and 2016; and one individual was captured by a local farmer in 2014 and kept in a cage.
Sand cats were also observed in 2014–2015 in three localities in the Turaif area in northern Saudi Arabia.
In &#x27;Uruq Bani Ma&#x27;arid on the western edge of the Rub&#x27; al Khali, sand cats use gravel valley and sand dune habitats in the cool season from October to April; in the hot season from May to September, they mainly use sand dune habitat.
In Al Ain Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, a sand cat was sighted in a gravel plain between dunes in 2003.
Several sand cats were recorded in a protected area in Al Dhafra, Abu Dhabi between April and December 2015, after an absence of sightings for ten years.
In Oman&#x27;s Dhofar Governorate, it was recorded at several locations between 2021 and 2022.

In southern Israel, four sand cats were radio-collared and tracked over a few months in the late 1980s in the Arabah Valley, which lies mostly in Jordan. The monitored sand cats frequently roamed in military camps of the Israeli army and crossed the international border. Since 2002, the sand cat is considered locally extinct in Israel, as it has not been recorded since the turn of the century. 
In Jordan, a sand cat was sighted for the first time in 1997 during a survey in a desert area in the eastern part of the country. In Syria, sand cats were sighted and photographed by a camera-trap in a protected area near Palmyra in 2000 and 2001.
In western Iraq, sand cats inhabit desert areas in the Najaf, Muthanna and Al Anbar Governorates.
In Iran, it occurs in arid flat plains and sandy desert of Abbas&#x27;abad Wildlife Reserve, Kavir National Park and Petergan Rural District. Between March 2014 and July 2016, sand cats were also observed at elevations of in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, foremost in black saxaul dominated habitat. In central Iran, sand cats were observed foremost in sand dunes and sabulous areas during surveys in 2014–2016.

In Pakistan, the first sand cat was detected in 1966 near the Lora River in Balochistan. In the late 1960s, sand cats were also encountered in the Chagai Hills, an extremely arid area comprising rolling sand dunes and stony plains at an elevation of about .

In Central Asia, the sand cat was known to occur up to the late 1960s in the Karakum Desert from the Ustyurt Plateau in the northwest to the Kopet Dag Mountains in the south, and from the Kyzylkum Desert to the Syr Darya River and the northern border to Afghanistan. Adult sand cats with kittens were photographed in the southern Kyzylkum Desert in spring 2013 and 2014.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The sand cat is solitary, except during the mating season and when a female has kittens. It makes loud, high-pitched and short rasping sounds, especially when seeking a mate. Its vocalizations are similar to those of the domestic cat. It communicates by urine spraying and using scent and scratch marks. It buries its feces and covers it with sand.

Its way of moving is distinct: with its belly close to the ground, it moves at a fast run punctuated with occasional leaps. It is capable of sudden bursts of speed and can sprint at speeds of per hour.
Four radio-collared sand cats in Israel moved long distances of in a single night. They were generally active throughout the night, hunting and travelling an average distance of . They retired below ground at dawn and stayed in the burrow during the day. During the survey period, they used several burrows in their home ranges.

Burrows are about deep and dug in slightly slanting ground with usually only a single entrance, though burrows with two or three entrances have also been observed. These burrows were either abandoned by foxes or porcupines, or dug by gerbils or other rodents. In winter, sand cats stay in the sun during the day, but during the hot season, they are crepuscular and nocturnal.

A male sand cat in Israel had a home range of .
In Morocco, a male sand cat travelled in 30 hours. A female sand cat moved in an area of during six days, and two males had home ranges of .
In 2018, several sand cats were observed resting in brown-necked raven nests built in umbrella thorn acacia trees in the Moroccan Sahara.

===Hunting and diet===
In the Ténéré, a desert region in south central Sahara, sand cats were observed preying foremost on small rodents, and the young of cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;), but also hunting greater hoopoe lark (&quot;Alaemon alaudipes&quot;), desert monitor (&quot;Varanus griseus&quot;), sandfish (&quot;Scincus scincus&quot;) and venomous &quot;Cerastes&quot; vipers. If they caught more than they could eat, they buried the remains for later consumption. They satisfied their moisture requirements from their prey but drank water if it was available. The Toubou people have reported incidents of sand cats coming to their camps at night and drinking fresh camel milk.

In Israel, remains of Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards (&quot;Uromastyx aegyptia&quot;) were found near burrows used by sand cats. They were observed preying on jirds (&quot;Meriones&quot;), Cairo spiny mouse (&quot;Acomys cahirinus&quot;), desert lark (&quot;Ammomanes deserti&quot;) and small reptiles.
In central Iran, remains of Blanford&#x27;s jerboa (&quot;Jaculus blanfordi&quot;) and Balochistan gerbil (&quot;Gerbillus nanus&quot;) were the most frequent prey species found around dens of sand cats.

Sand cats were collected in eastern Karakum Desert in the late 1950s. Their feces and stomachs contained remains of tolai hare (&quot;Lepus tolai&quot;), small rodents, birds, small reptiles and invertebrates.
In March 2018, a sand cat was recorded feeding on a MacQueen&#x27;s bustard (&quot;Chlamydotis macqueenii&quot;) in the Kyzylkum Desert.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Oestrus in female sand cats lasts from five to six days, during which they frequently call and scent mark. After a gestation of 59 to 66 days, they give birth to a litter of two to three kittens. The kittens weigh at birth, and have spotted pale yellow or reddish fur. They grow relatively rapidly, reaching three quarters of the adult size within five months, are fully independent by the end of their first year and reach sexual maturity soon after the first year.
In some areas, sand cats give birth to two litters per year.

Of 228 sand cats born in zoos globally by 2007, only 61% of the kittens lived to day 30. They died primarily due to maternal neglect by first-time mothers. Otherwise, they can live up to 13 years in captivity. The life expectancy of wild sand cats has not been documented.

The generation length of the sand cat is about 4 years and 9 months.

== Threats ==
Habitat degradation and loss of sand dunes due to human activities are considered major threats to sand cat populations in Western Asia, where uncontrolled hunting and persecution of predators using poisoned baits are common practices. The sand cat&#x27;s small-mammal prey-base depends on having adequate vegetation, which may experience large fluctuations due to drought or declines due to desertification and loss of natural vegetation.
Fencing of protected areas threatens the sand cat in Saudi Arabia, where several individuals were found stuck in fences.
In Iran, vulnerable arid ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human settlement and activity, especially livestock grazing.
In Uzbekistan, drifting sand areas are increasing, as local people uproot shrubs for use as firewood and as a substrate for silk worm (&quot;Bombyx mori&quot;) cocoons.

In the Sahara, sand cats have been killed in traps laid out by inhabitants of oases targeting foxes and golden jackals (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) or in retaliation for killing poultry.
Several cases of sand cats having been killed by domestic dogs (&quot;C. familiaris&quot;) were reported in Israel and Iran.
In Israel, the sand cat was thought to be threatened by predation from caracals (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;) and wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;).

Sand cats have also been caught for the pet trade in the United Arab Emirates and in Iraq. In Baghdad, two sand cats were presented to a local nursery in 2012 that had been sold as pets; they died a week later. In 2014 and 2015, four sand cats were trapped alive by local truffle collectors and offered for sale in a wildlife market in Baghdad; their fate is unknown.

Sand cats may be at risk of transfer of diseases from domestic and feral cats encroaching on desert areas. In Saudi Arabia, one of 17 wild-caught sand cats was tested positive for feline leukaemia virus.

==Conservation==
&quot;Felis margarita&quot; is listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting is prohibited in Algeria, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Niger, Pakistan, and Tunisia. No legal protection exists in Egypt, Mali, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Previously having been classified as near threatened, it has been downlisted to least concern in 2016, as the estimated size of the global population exceeds the threshold for a threatened category; the extent of decline of the global population is unknown.

The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo started a sand cat reintroduction project in Israel&#x27;s Arabah Desert. Several captive-born individuals from the zoo&#x27;s population were kept in an acclimatization enclosure, but did not survive subsequent release into the wild.

=== In captivity ===

Since the mid 1960s, sand cats were captured in Pakistan for trade and export to Europe until the Pakistani government ceased issuing permits in 1974.
Captive sand cats are highly sensitive to respiratory diseases and infection of the upper respiratory tract. This is the main cause of death in adults. The most common disease is infectious rhinotracheitis. With sand cats being very susceptible to respiratory infections, they have to be kept in very arid enclosures, where humidity and temperature do not fluctuate.

The captive population kept in the European Endangered Species Programme is offspring of 18 founders that originated almost exclusively on the Arabian Peninsula. Until December 2009, the global captive population comprised 200 individuals in 45 institutions, including 23 European zoos with 102 individuals.
The captive population within the Species Survival Plan for sand cat is based on eight founders.

In 2010, two sand cat kittens were born at the Al Ain Zoo after the first procedure of in vitro fertilisation and transfer of frozen-thawed embryos into the oviducts of ovulating females. In July 2012, four sand cat kittens were born at the Ramat Gan Zoo as part of the European Endangered Species Programme.

<text>Granada () is a city in western Nicaragua and the capital of the Granada Department. With an estimated population of 105,862 (2022), it is Nicaragua&#x27;s ninth most populous city. Granada is historically one of Nicaragua&#x27;s most important cities, economically and politically. It has a rich colonial heritage, seen in its architecture and structure.

Granada had a thriving Indigenous population. In 1524, the city was renamed Granada, by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, ostensibly the first European city in mainland America. Unlike other cities that claim the same distinction, the city of Granada was not only the settlement of the conquest, but also a city registered in official records of the Crown of Aragon, and the Kingdom of Castile in Spain. 

Granada is also known as &quot;La Gran Sultana&quot;, in the reflection of its Moorish and Andalusian appearance, unlike its sister city and historical rival León, which displays Castilian trends.

==History==
The settlement of Granada was established by Spanish conquistador Hernández de Córdoba, who named it after the city of the same name in Spain. This was done in honor of the city&#x27;s capture by the forces of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I from the Emirate of Granada, which completed the &quot;reconquista&quot;. During the colonial era, Granada was a sister city to the settlement of Antigua Guatemala, maintained a flourishing level of commerce with ports in the Atlantic Ocean via Lake Cocibolca and the San Juan River, and was subject to attacks from English, French and Dutch pirates who unsuccessfully attempted to take control of the settlement by sailing up the San Juan River.

For many years Granada disputed with León its hegemony as the major city of Nicaragua. The city of Granada was favored by the Conservatives, while Léon was favored by the Liberals. For many years there was conflict that at times became quite violent between the cities&#x27; families and political factions. In the mid-19th century a compromise site was agreed on and the capital was finally established at Managua between both cities. As of 1850, Granada had a population of approximately 10,000.

On 29 May 1834, Cándido Flores, head of the military forces of Granada, revolted against the Government in León led by José Núñez, demanding the reform of the federal Constitution. After being defeated in Managua he could not organize a resistance in Granada, so he left the city to a disorganized mob that committed lootings and robberies, especially in the houses of foreigners.
Granada was also the site where American filibuster William Walker took up residence and attempted to take control of Central America and create independent colonies with economies based on slavery. One of Walker&#x27;s generals, Charles Frederick Henningsen, set the city ablaze before escaping, destroying much of the colonial-era architecture and inscribed the words &quot;Here was Granada&quot; on the ruins before he left.

Granada avoided much of the tumult of the Sandinista Era in the 1970–80s.

==Geography==
Granada is located along the coast of the Lake Nicaragua (a.k.a. Lake Cocibolca), the world&#x27;s twentieth largest lake.

Granada is the capital city of the Department of Granada, which borders Boaco and Managua to the north, Masaya and Carazo to the east and Rivas to the south. Within the same department, the River Tipitapa which connects the Lake of Managua and Nicaragua passes through it in the north. It also has three volcanic lagoons; Manares, Genirzaro, and the famous Apoyo. Apoyo, which is shared with the Department of Masaya, is the largest volcanic lagoon in Nicaragua. 

Granada is a very warm city all year round, with very similar temperatures to Managua. This is due to similarities in geography with its close proximity to a lake and surrounded by high hills. Rainfall in Granada is approximately between 1,100-2,100 mm annually, with an annual average temperature reported to be 25.7 °C.
The vegetation around Granada is a reflection of its climatology. Dry and humid forests skirt the Mombacho volcano. The volcano is also home to a wide array of fauna &quot;(See Wildlife of Nicaragua)&quot;. The lake is also home to many creatures, both marine and freshwater creatures. It is the only freshwater lake in the world where sharks live (Nicaragua shark). Fishing in the lake is quite good, and fishermen, both commercial and recreational, regularly catch guapote and mojarras, as well as sardines. Nicaragua has recently banned fishing of the Nicaragua shark and sawfish because of population decline.

Other important cities and towns within the Granada district include Malacatoya, El Paso, El Guayabo, Diria, Macatepe, El Guanacaste, Nandaime and Diriomo, known nationally as the last city of witches. Mombacho volcano is the highest point (1,345 m) within Granada; the now dormant volcano blew most of its cone into the lake, forming the 365 Islets of Granada, from where the volcano provides an amazing view. It is also possible on a clear day to see Ometepe and Zapatera Islands. The later island is the second largest island in Lake Nicaragua, and also harbors an inactive volcano. The largest is Ometepe Island, also located in Lake Nicaragua. It is a national treasure, known as the home of pre-Columbian statues and idols, which were found on the island during the Spanish conquest, and now exhibited in the Convento San Francisco Museum, as well as in other museums and parks located on Ometepe Island.

Granada has many beaches on Lake Nicaragua which are very popular around Semana Santa (&quot;Holy Week&quot;).

==Economy and tourism==

Granada has long been a center of commerce, including timber, gold and silver. Granada&#x27;s economy continues to grow as it is becoming a hub for tourism. Though Granada remains Nicaragua&#x27;s sixth largest city, it is widely known for preserving some of the finest colonial-era architecture in the country.
A real estate boom had been underway for several years, with many European and Americans purchasing and renovating the area&#x27;s homes for retirement or holiday homes and several foreign realtors establishing offices, but that boom slowed in 2007. The prior escalation of real estate prices in Granada and other parts of Southwestern Nicaragua has led to a shift of investor attention toward Northern Nicaragua and the cities of Matagalpa, Leon, Corinto and the surrounding beaches of Leon and Corinto.

Museums have opened, and new hotels and restaurants are proliferating at a fast rate.

Granada, though now highly dependent on tourism, also has fertile agricultural land within the municipality. Major production of organic coffee and cacao, cattle, plantains and bananas occurs within its boundaries.

==Gastronomy==
Granada&#x27;s restaurants have received international recognition by newspapers like the New York Times.
In the city of Granada, there are many restaurants including Pita Pita, Garden Café &amp; La Hacienda.
In recent years, the city of Granada&#x27;s evolving culinary scene mixes local and international flavors, as well as supporting farm-to-table sustainability of local growers and producers.
Granada&#x27;s economy continues to grow in big part because it is fast becoming a tourist attraction for its colonial architecture, as well as its ecological beauty and now as a food destination.

==Infrastructure==
Most of Granada&#x27;s streets are narrow, as the city evolved centuries before the advent of motorized vehicles. Therefore, today, many streets allow only one-way traffic, offering a challenge to visitors traveling by car.

Following many years of neglect, primarily due to the economic collapse of the nation in the 1980s, most of Granada&#x27;s buildings and infrastructure began to deteriorate. Roads and public utilities fell into disrepair.

In the decades that followed, however, the city government directed funds towards recognition and restoration of many of Granada&#x27;s historic structures. The Spanish government has provided financial cooperation for the refurbishment of the city. One such project is transforming Calle La Calzada into a pedestrian street.

==Culture==

Granada, like most of the Nicaraguan Pacific, is populated primarily by a Spanish-speaking majority of Mestizos. Residing here also are people from the United States, Canada, Spain, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Austria, the Netherlands, and France.

Until recently, Nicaragua was experiencing a booming tourist economy. This, in turn, attracted foreigners to Granada seeking colonial homes for purchase, adding a growing number of Europeans and Americans to the city&#x27;s population. Real estate prices had increased following the foreign interest and subsequent investments. However, with the 2018 civil conflict, the US Department of State issued a travel advisory, citing &quot;civil unrest, crime, limited healthcare availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws.&quot; In 2020, it issued a Level 4, &quot;Do Not Travel&quot; advisory due to COVID 19.

<doc id="272918" wikidata="Q7819604" url="?curid=272918" title="Tommy Kramer">
<text>Thomas Francis Kramer (born March 7, 1955) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) from 1977 to 1990. He played college football for the Rice Owls and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round (27th overall) of the 1977 NFL draft after being named MVP of the 1977 Senior Bowl. He was inducted with the 2012 class into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Kramer played his high school football at Robert E. Lee High School in San Antonio. He guided the Volunteers to a state title in 1971 and then to the state semi-finals in 1972. The state championship game in 1971 was the first high school game played in the new Texas Stadium (Dallas Cowboys) in Irving, Texas. Kramer guided the Lee Volunteers to a 28–27 victory which has been hailed by some as the best high school game ever played in Texas. Kramer&#x27;s high school teammates included Pat Rockett (played major league baseball for the Atlanta Braves), and Richard Osborne (played for the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles).

The Volunteers went 27–1–1 during Kramer&#x27;s two years on the varsity, beating Wichita Falls High School 28–27 for the Class 4A state title in 1971 and losing to Baytown Sterling 21–20 in the 1972 state semifinals. Guided by head coach John Ferrara, the 1971 team finished 14–0–1 – a 7–7 tie with rival Churchill kept the Volunteers from being perfect – and the 1972 squad went 13–1. In an era when most Texas high school football teams churned out yardage with ground-oriented offenses such as the wishbone or the veer, Lee achieved success by throwing the ball.

Kramer passed for 2,588 yards as a senior, then a state record, and completed 149 of 294 passes for 28 touchdowns. In two seasons, he completed 327 of 597 attempts for 5,489 yards and 54 TDs. Surrounded by sure-handed receivers including Osborne, Rockett, and Gary Haack, Kramer was a master at picking apart defenses with his deft passing. Kramer started all but one game as a varsity player, going 26–1–1. He made his debut in the 1971 season opener, replacing starter Bruce Trimmier and rallying Lee to a 7–3 victory over Alamo Heights on a rainy night. It is here that he acquired the nickname &quot;Two-Minute Tommy&quot;, which stuck on for the rest of his football career.

==College career==
After a stellar career at Lee, Kramer became another in the long list of San Antonio products to play college football at Rice University.

Kramer led the Owls in passing for four straight years and his career and season marks were the standard at Rice for over 30 years until they were shattered by Chase Clement, another San Antonio signal caller. Kramer left Rice with school records in single-season passing yards, career passing yards (6,197); season total offense (3,272), career total offense (6,336), season touchdown passes (21), career touchdown passes (37), season total touchdowns (25) and career total touchdowns (48). He was the 1976 George Martin Award winner as Rice&#x27;s MVP in 1976 and was elected to the Rice Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984.

Kramer played in the Senior Bowl and the Blue-Gray Game in 1976 and was named MVP of the Senior Bowl. He also received the Fort Worth Kiwanis Sportsmanship Award in 1976.

In 2012, Kramer was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
Kramer appeared in five games of his rookie season in 1977, with one start and four mop-up roles as the heir apparent to Fran Tarkenton, although when Tarkenton was hurt late in the season, Bob Lee would be the starter for four of the last five games. In the 12th game of the year, Minnesota trailed the San Francisco 49ers 24–7 in the fourth quarter, and Kramer was brought in to replace Lee. He went 9-of-13 for 188 yards and three touchdowns to win 28–27. The following week, he made his first ever start against the Oakland Raiders. He went 16-of-34 for 177 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions in the 35–13 loss. The following year, Kramer would end up in mop-up duty as Tarkenton started each game for his final season. For the 1979 season, Kramer would become fully installed as the starter.

He earned the nickname &quot;Two-Minute Tommy&quot; for his reputation with comebacks, as he would lead the Vikings to nineteen comebacks (and one in the playoffs), with fifteen in the fourth quarter, with 1980 and 1985 having four from Kramer in each year. However, Kramer would be plagued by injuries in his eleven seasons spent with the Vikings, since he started 109 of a possible 152 games for the team over his tenure, and he started each game of a season just twice (1979 and 1982), beset by knee and shoulder injuries to go alongside concussions. Kramer had knee and shoulder injuries, multiple concussions and a 1987 preseason spine injury that he said “basically pretty much ended my career.”

The 1980 season proved a pivotal moment for him and the Vikings. Kramer would go 8–7 as a starter while leading the Vikings back to the postseason for the first time since 1978. He threw 3,397 yards with 23 touchdowns to 24 interceptions while having a 55.7 completion percentage. Kramer saved his best for near-last in the season. Facing the Cleveland Browns in the penultimate game of the regular season, he would take part of an iconic moment for the Vikings, as he threw a game-winning Hail Mary pass with six seconds left. They had trailed 23–9 in the fourth quarter, but Kramer threw three touchdowns in the quarter, including two to Ahmad Rashad late. On the final play of the game, Rashad was clustered in a group of Browns defenders but managed to catch the ball and carry himself into the end zone. The play, known as Miracle at the Met, clinched a division title for the Vikings. Kramer had his best game to that point, throwing 38-of-49 for 456 yards with four touchdowns. He is still the only quarterback for the Vikings to throw for over 450 yards in a game. In the postseason that year, he faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles. Although they led 14–7 at halftime, a series of turnovers led to a 31–16 loss, and Kramer threw 19-of-39 for 209 yards with one touchdown and five interceptions.

In 1982, Kramer led the Vikings to the postseason with a strike-shortened 5–4 record. Facing the Atlanta Falcons in Minnesota, the Falcons led in the fourth quarter 21–16 before Kramer led them to a comeback to pull off a 30–24 win. He threw 20-of-34 passes for 253 yards with two touchdowns and one interception to lead the Vikings to the second round of the playoffs. Facing the Washington Redskins the following week, Kramer could not quite generate magic, as Washington won 21–7 on their way to the Super Bowl. Kramer threw 18-of-39 for 252 yards.

Kramer enjoyed his last flash of brilliance in 1986. He went 7–6 in his thirteen starts while throwing for 3,000 yards with 24 touchdowns to ten interceptions while leading the league in passer rating with 92.6. Kramer had his highlight day on September 28, 1986, as he torched the Green Bay Packers, even though his overall record against the Packers was 6–9, for six touchdown passes (with four in the first quarter) on a 16-of-25 day for 241 yards. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the first and only time. It was the last season which featured Kramer as the primary starter for the Vikings (starting thirteen games). In 1987, Kramer would split time with Wade Wilson (who had been on the team since 1981), with Kramer starting five games and Wilson starting seven, with Kramer noting a preseason injury to his spine as the injury that hastened his end of career. Kramer threw four touchdowns to three interceptions in his 81 passes for six game appearances. Kramer was the starting quarterback when the Vikings sneaked into the playoffs at 8–7, although he was taken out after a few drives for Wilson. Kramer (who was hurt on the first play of the game) was 5-of-9 on 50 yards as the Vikings rolled to a 44–10 win over the New Orleans Saints with Wilson at the helm. From there, the Vikings went to the NFC Championship Game with Wilson starting the next two games. For 1988, he made six starts with appearances in four other games. While going 4–2, he threw for 1,264 yards with five touchdowns to nine interceptions on 173 total pass attempts. For 1989, he closed out his Vikings career with appearances in eight games and four starts while throwing 906 yards and seven touchdowns and interceptions. His final appearance in a Vikings uniform was mop-up duty late in a playoff loss to San Francisco. He went 9-of-19 for 110 yards and an interception in the 41–13 loss. He was released after the season.

Kramer was signed by the New Orleans Saints in 1990. He appeared in only one game for the Saints (against the Vikings) and retired after the 1990 season.

After retirement in 1990, Kramer spent the next thirty years in Texas before returning to Minnesota after his third divorce in 2020.

On September 25, 2024, Kramer announced on Twitter that he was diagnosed with dementia a year prior, deciding to go public after fellow former Vikings quarterback Brett Favre announced his Parkinson&#x27;s diagnosis and to bring awareness to for the NFL to assist with other players battling similar illnesses financially.

<doc id="272931" wikidata="Q245996" url="?curid=272931" title="Three's Company">
<text>Three&#x27;s Company is an American television sitcom that aired for eight seasons on ABC from March 15, 1977, to September 18, 1984. Developed by Don Nicholl, Michael Ross and Bernie West, it is based on the British sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot; created by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer.

The story revolves around three single roommates: Jack Tripper, Janet Wood, and Chrissy Snow, who all platonically live together in a Santa Monica, California, apartment complex owned by Stanley and Helen Roper. The show, a farce, chronicles the escapades and hijinks of the trio&#x27;s constant misunderstandings, social lives, and financial struggles. A top-10 hit from 1977 to 1983, the series has remained popular in syndication and through DVD releases. The show also spawned similar spin-offs to those that &quot;Man About the House&quot; had: &quot;The Ropers&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, based upon &quot;George and Mildred&quot; and &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;, respectively.

==Synopsis==
Florist Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and secretary Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) live in Santa Monica, sharing a multi-bedroom apartment with their roommate Eleanor (Marianne Black). When Eleanor decides to move out, culinary school student Jack Tripper (John Ritter) crashes her going-away party at the apartment and is found by Janet and Chrissy the next morning, passed out in the bathtub. Needing someone to cover Eleanor&#x27;s share of the rent, the women offer to let Jack move in with them and he quickly accepts so that he can have a place to stay other than the local YMCA.

However, overbearing landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell) refuses to allow unmarried men and women to live together in his apartment. He allows Jack to move in only after Janet tells him that Jack is homosexual. Although Stanley&#x27;s wife Helen Roper (Audra Lindley) quickly figures out that Jack is straight, she trusts him with the girls and keeps the secret from Stanley, who tolerates Jack, but mocks him. Frequently siding with the three roommates instead of her husband, Helen&#x27;s bond with them grows through the couple&#x27;s departure, leading into the spin-off &quot;The Ropers&quot;.

Jack continues the charade when new building manager Ralph Furley (Don Knotts) takes over the apartment complex because Mr. Furley insists that his hard-nosed brother and the building&#x27;s new owner Bart Furley (Hamilton Camp) would also never tolerate such living situations. Jack eventually meets a love interest, Vicky Bradford (Mary Cadorette), which leads into &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

After Norman Fell and Audra Lindley left the series in 1979 for their own sitcom, &quot;The Ropers&quot;, Don Knotts joined the cast as the roommates&#x27; new building manager, Ralph Furley. Following Suzanne Somers&#x27; departure in 1980, Jenilee Harrison joined the cast as Chrissy&#x27;s first cousin, Cindy Snow, who was soon replaced by Priscilla Barnes as Terri Alden.

==Episodes==


==Background and production==

===Development===
Famed Broadway writer Peter Stone tried to Americanize the British sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot;. He originally set the series in New York, and he envisioned the male roommate as a successful, yet underpaid, chef in a fancy French restaurant, while the two female roommates were an executive secretary and a high-fashion model. When ABC&#x27;s Fred Silverman read the script, he felt that middle America would not like the concept, and he decided to pass on the script. Silverman asked Larry Gelbart, creator and producer of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, for help with the series. At first, Gelbart wanted nothing to do with the show, feeling that its relatively simple premise made it substandard in comparison to &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Ultimately, as a favor to Silverman, Gelbart developed a pilot episode with the help of his son-in-law, who named the series &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. Gelbart&#x27;s adaptation closely followed the British series. Gelbart named the male roommate David Bell, an aspiring filmmaker looking for a place to live and who just happened to be a great cook. The two female roommates were portrayed by Valerie Curtin who played Jenny, an employee of the DMV, and Susanne Zenor, who played Samantha, an aspiring actress. In Gelbart&#x27;s version, the series took place in an apartment building called the Hacienda Palms in North Hollywood, California. It was produced by Don Taffner and Ted Bergmann.

Silverman liked Gelbart&#x27;s version, and ABC ordered a pilot, which was taped in early 1976. The format of the show just barely made it on to the fall 1976 ABC lineup, but the network later removed it for what network executives felt were more promising series. While ABC was considering how to re-shoot the pilot, CBS expressed an interest in the show. CBS made a firm commitment to producers Taffner and Bergmann to air the show with the Gelbart cast as a mid-season replacement in February 1977. At the last minute, ABC decided that it wanted the show after all, and made a firm commitment to air the show at mid-season with a new cast.

For help in remolding the show, producers hired Don Nicholl, Michael Ross, and Bernie West, the writers who adapted the British series &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; into &quot;All in the Family&quot;. Their revised version of the pilot followed the British series even more closely. The male roommate changed from filmmaker David Bell to Jack Tripp (later changed to Tripper), a cooking student, similar to his British counterpart chef Robin Tripp. Aspiring actress Samantha became secretary Chrissy, portrayed by Denise Galik. Galik was dismissed a couple of days before the pilot taped, and Susan Lanier replaced her. The other female roommate, DMV employee Jenny became Janet Wood, a florist, portrayed by Joyce DeWitt. They also moved the setting of the show from North Hollywood to the beachside in Santa Monica.

Nicholl, Ross, and West went on to conceive the show as an all out farce, building the show&#x27;s plot line heavily on the many misunderstandings encountered by each of the characters. This pilot was actually a remake of the second episode of the British series, titled &quot;And Mother Makes Four&quot;. The new concept was generally well liked, with the exception of Lanier&#x27;s portrayal of Chrissy.

Despite the doubts about Lanier&#x27;s portrayal as Chrissy, Silverman put the show on the network lineup, scheduled to air in March 1977. Meanwhile, he ordered a search for another actress to portray Chrissy. The day before production of the series began, Silverman desperately watched the audition tapes again, fast-forwarding through them quickly. Suddenly, he noticed Suzanne Somers&#x27;s audition, which he hadn&#x27;t seen previously. Silverman recognized Somers from her appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, watched her audition and decided she was ideal for the part. No one on the production staff could give Silverman a straight answer why Somers had originally been rejected. Producers contacted her immediately, and she was on the set the next day.

At the last minute before the pilot taped, the producers considered whether to recast John Ritter. Although test audiences liked Ritter, the producers felt Ritter&#x27;s foolish and clumsy portrayal of Jack made his character seem somewhat effeminate. Earlier in the casting process, actors such as Barry Van Dyke and future television director Michael Lembeck were considered for the role. Silverman was confident in Ritter, and he advocated that he remain on the show.

With Somers, Ritter, and DeWitt set in their roles, the third version of the pilot hastily went into production in January 1977. ABC accepted this version, and five additional episodes were filmed for the show&#x27;s spring debut.

===Filming===
&quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; was recorded at two locations: the first, seventh, and eighth seasons were taped at Metromedia Square and ABC Television Center, while the second through sixth seasons were taped in Studio 31 at CBS Television City. The cast would receive the script on Monday, rehearse from Tuesday to Thursday, and then shoot on Friday. Each episode was shot two consecutive times using different audiences and a three multicamera setup.

The taping was done in sequence, and there were rarely any retakes because the producers were strict. Priscilla Barnes once said, &quot;Our bosses were very, very controlling. If my hair was too blonde, I&#x27;d get called up in the office.&quot;

The scenes in the opening credits with the trio frolicking on a boardwalk and riding bumper-cars were shot at the Santa Monica Pier, prior to the construction of the adjacent larger amusement park.

Producers shot a new opening sequence when Priscilla Barnes joined the show, featuring the new threesome and the other cast members riding a zoo tram and observing various animals around the park. These sequences were filmed at the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park. During this sequence, a baby boy in overalls who approaches Janet while feeding the goats at the zoo was portrayed by Jason Ritter, John Ritter&#x27;s oldest son. The exterior shots of the apartment building were filmed at 2912 4th Street in Santa Monica.

Of all the new sitcoms that premiered on ABC for the 1976–77 television season, only &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and the summer premiere of &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; returned for a second season.

===Cast changes===
&quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; had many cast changes over its run. The first of these changes took place in the spring of 1979 with the relocation of the Ropers to their own television series, which revolved around Helen and Stanley and their neighbors in a townhouse community after Stanley had sold the apartment building; it lasted for one and a half seasons. &quot;Man About the House&quot; had similarly spun off the Ropers for the series &quot;George and Mildred&quot;.

Three changes took place in the fall of 1979, at the beginning of the fourth season. The first was the addition of Lana Shields, an older woman who chased Jack. She kept pursuing him but he was unappreciative of her advances. Since Ann Wedgeworth disliked her diminishing role in the series, producers dropped Lana from the show with no explanation before mid-season. The second addition that fall was the new building manager, Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts), whose brother Bart bought the building from the Ropers. Mr. Furley pursued Lana unsuccessfully, as she unsuccessfully pursued Jack. Unlike Lana, Mr. Furley remained until the end of the series. Third, Richard Kline as Larry Dallas, previously in a recurring role, was upgraded to a full cast member.

Season five (1980–1981) marked the beginning of contract re-negotiations and sparked friction on the set. Somers demanded a substantial increase in salary, from $30,000 to $150,000 per episode plus 10% of the show&#x27;s profits. John Ritter, as the show&#x27;s top-billed actor, was making $150,000 per episode at the time. When Somers&#x27; demands were not met, Somers went on a strike of sorts. Executives believed that a complete loss of Somers could damage the program&#x27;s popularity, so a compromise was reached. Somers, who was still under contract, continued to appear in the series, but only in the one-minute closing tag scene of a handful of episodes. Somers&#x27; scenes were taped on separate days from the show&#x27;s regular taping; she did not appear on set with any of the show&#x27;s other cast members. According to Somers, an off-hiatus contract with CBS as well as tension between her and producer Michael Ross led to her being fired, and her dismissal was on the personal level as she states that Ted Harbert confirms this. According to the story within the show, her character had returned to her hometown of Fresno to care for her ailing mother, and was only seen when she telephoned her former roommates and they recounted that week&#x27;s adventures to her. This arrangement continued for one season. Somers&#x27; contract was not renewed and Chrissy&#x27;s place in the apartment was taken by her clumsy cousin Cindy Snow (Jenilee Harrison).

Another replacement, Terri Alden (played by Priscilla Barnes), a clever, sometimes sassy nurse, joined the cast in the sixth season (1981–82). In the script, Cindy was to move to college to fulfill her dream of becoming a veterinarian and would continue to visit throughout the sixth season.

The show ended with the departure of all cast members except Ritter. Janet gets married and starts a new life, and Terri moves to Hawaii. Ritter moved on to the spin-off &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (syndicated as &quot;Three&#x27;s Company, Too&quot; in the &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; syndication package), itself based upon the &quot;Man About the House&quot; spin-off, &quot;Robin&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

After three decades of not speaking to each other, Suzanne Somers and Joyce DeWitt finally reconciled and reunited for Somers&#x27; web series &quot;Breaking Through&quot;, which aired February 2, 2012.
Previously, Somers reconciled with Ritter just days before his death from aortic dissection on September 11, 2003. They had even discussed her making a cameo appearance on Ritter&#x27;s new show, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;.

=== Music ===
The theme song was composed by Joe Raposo (known for composing for the children&#x27;s television shows &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot;), and sung by Ray Charles (not to be confused with the blind R&amp;B musician of the same name) and Julia Rinker. In the first pilot the melody was sung with a series of &quot;doo doo doo&quot; vocalizations rather than the final lyrics.

== Themes ==
Humor in the show was based on farce, often relying on innuendo and misunderstanding, as well as physical comedy to punctuate the hare-brained schemes the characters would invariably conjure up to get themselves out of situations and dilemmas. Running jokes were frequently based on Jack&#x27;s (supposed) sexual orientation, Mr. Roper&#x27;s lack of sexual desire, and Chrissy&#x27;s blonde moments. Conflict in the show came from the dysfunctional marriage of the Ropers, Janet&#x27;s intolerance for a roommate romance, and later on, Jack&#x27;s friendship with Larry and Larry&#x27;s abuse thereof. Of all the characters, only Jack, Janet, and Larry appeared in all eight seasons of the series. Jack is the only character to appear in every episode; Janet appears in all but one episode (season 3&#x27;s &quot;Stanley&#x27;s Hotline&quot;).

== Release ==

===Home media===
Anchor Bay Entertainment has released all eight seasons of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; on DVD in Region 1. These are the original, unedited and uncut network television broadcast versions and not the edited versions which have been broadcast in syndication since the Fall of 1982. Some episodes include commentary as a bonus feature. Also, the season 2 set includes the first of the two unaired pilots as a bonus feature, while the season 3 set contains the other.

Anchor Bay released a complete series set on August 19, 2014. The set was subsequently re-released on February 13, 2018, this time by Lionsgate Home Entertainment.

On December 22, 2023, Visual Entertainment Inc. released the Official 40th Anniversary Collection of the series that also includes spin-offs &quot;The Ropers&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

===Syndication===
ABC aired back-to-back repeats of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; during daytime from June 15 to September 11, 1981 at 11:00 a.m. EST/10:00 CST. The show has been in syndication since 1982 on local stations such as WNEW-TV (now WNYW) in New York City and the sales on the project realized more than $150million, of which Thames took 12.5% ($19million). It debuted on cable in 1992 on TBS and ran through 1999. Nick at Nite bought the show in 2000 and have a seven-year term with other Viacom networks such as TV Land and TNN. In 2007, Viacom renewed its contract for reruns of the show for another six years.

In March 2001, after being notified by a viewer, Nick at Nite quickly edited an episode (&quot;The Charming Stranger&quot;) where John Ritter&#x27;s scrotum skin was briefly visible through the bottom of a pair of blue boxer shorts. The most famous quip about this issue was uttered by Ritter himself, who told the &quot;New York Observer&quot; when they asked him about the controversy: &quot;I&#x27;ve requested that Nickelodeon air both versions, edited and unedited, because sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don&#x27;t&quot; (quoting an advertising jingle for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars). The incident was also brought-up during a &quot;Celebrity Secrets&quot; comedy bit on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in the late 1990s, in which a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says, &quot;Somebody asked me if I did that on purpose...&quot; After taking a nervous sip of water, he responds, &quot;You bet I did!&quot;

Since 2010, the show has aired on Antenna TV, where its spin-offs also air. Because the spin-offs cannot be stripped due to a lack of episodes, they are aired at the same time with the show. In Canada, DejaView (a Corus Entertainment property) re-airs the show.

In 2020, Pluto TV added the show to their channel lineup. and also made its IFC debut on November 27, 2020.

==Reception==
&quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; premiered in the spring, in the middle of the 1976–77 season. In the 1960s and 1970s, midseason television programs were often cancelled after their original six-episode run in the spring. Network observers did not believe that &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; would go anywhere after its first six episodes. They were proven wrong when it raked in record ratings, breaking barriers at the time as the highest-rated midseason show ever broadcast on network television. ABC gladly renewed the show for a formal television season, giving it a permanent primetime spot during the 1977–78 television season.

Ratings continued to climb throughout the years. The first episode, &quot;A Man About the House&quot;, reached No. 28 for the week. The first episode to hit the No. 1 spot was February 14, 1978, when &quot;Will the Real Jack Tripper...&quot; was aired. The most-watched episode aired on March 13, 1979. It was titled &quot;An Anniversary Surprise&quot;, and it centered around Stanley Roper selling the apartment, and the Ropers moving out. Immediately after the episode was the series premiere of the spinoff, &quot;The Ropers&quot;.

==TV movie==
In May 2003, NBC aired a two-hour television movie entitled &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, a docudrama featuring actors portraying Ritter (Bret Anthony), Dewitt (Melanie Paxson), Somers (Jud Tylor) and other actors on the series. The movie covered the entire run of the series, from the pilots to the final episode, but the contract negotiations and subsequent departure of Somers provided much of the drama. Dewitt co-produced and narrated the movie. Ritter and Somers both had some input, but neither appeared in the project.

==Film adaptation==
In 2016, New Line Cinema began negotiations to obtain the film rights to &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; with Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein penning the screenplay. Robert Cort and Don Taffner, Jr. would produce the film and planned to have it set in the 1970s.

<doc id="272940" wikidata="Q42623" url="?curid=272940" title="Jungle cat">
<text>The jungle cat (Felis chaus), also called reed cat and swamp cat, is a medium-sized cat native from the Eastern Mediterranean region and the Caucasus to parts of Central, South and Southeast Asia. It inhabits foremost wetlands like swamps, littoral and riparian areas with dense vegetation. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning.

The jungle cat has a uniformly sandy, reddish-brown or grey fur without spots; melanistic and albino individuals are also known. It is solitary in nature, except during the mating season and mother–kitten families.

Adults maintain territories by urine spraying and scent marking. Its preferred prey is small mammals and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are one year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the nape of her neck and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.

The species was first described by Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776 based on a specimen caught in a Caucasian wetland. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber gave the jungle cat its present binomial name and is therefore generally considered as binomial authority. Three subspecies are recognised at present.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
===Taxonomic history===

The Baltic-German naturalist Johann Anton Güldenstädt was the first scientist who caught a jungle cat near the Terek River at the southern frontier of the Russian empire, a region that he explored in 1768–1775 on behalf of Catherine II of Russia. He described this specimen in 1776 under the name &quot;Chaus&quot;.

In 1778, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber used &quot;chaus&quot; as the species name and is therefore considered the binomial authority. Paul Matschie in 1912 and Joel Asaph Allen in 1920 challenged the validity of Güldenstädt&#x27;s nomenclature, arguing that the name &quot;Felis auriculis apice nigro barbatis&quot; was not a binomen and therefore improper, and that &quot;chaus&quot; was used as a common name rather than as part of the scientific name.

In the 1820s, Eduard Rüppell collected a female jungle cat near Lake Manzala in the Nile Delta. Thomas Hardwicke&#x27;s collection of illustrations of Indian wildlife comprises the first drawing of an Indian jungle cat, named the &quot;allied cat&quot; (&quot;Felis affinis&quot;) by John Edward Gray in 1830. Two years later, Johann Friedrich von Brandt proposed a new species under the name &quot;Felis rüppelii&quot;, recognising the distinctness of the Egyptian jungle cat. The same year, a stuffed cat was presented at a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal that had been caught in the jungles of Midnapore in West Bengal, India. J. T. Pearson, who donated the specimen, proposed the name &quot;Felis kutas&quot;, noting that it differed in colouration from &quot;Felis chaus&quot;. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire described a jungle cat from the area of Dehra Dun in northern India in 1844 under the name &quot;Felis jacquemontii&quot; in memory of Victor Jacquemont.

In 1836, Brian Houghton Hodgson proclaimed the red-eared cat commonly found in Nepal to be a lynx and therefore named it &quot;Lynchus erythrotus&quot;; Edward Frederick Kelaart described the first jungle cat skin from Sri Lanka in 1852 and stressed upon its close resemblance to Hodgson&#x27;s red cat. William Thomas Blanford pointed out the lynx-like appearance of cat skins and skulls from the plains around Yarkant County and Kashgar when he described &quot;Felis shawiana&quot; in 1876.

Nikolai Severtzov proposed the generic name &quot;Catolynx&quot; in 1858, followed by Leopold Fitzinger&#x27;s suggestion to call it &quot;Chaus catolynx&quot; in 1869. In 1898, William Edward de Winton proposed to subordinate the specimens from the Caucasus, Persia and Turkestan to &quot;Felis chaus typica&quot;, and regrouped the lighter built specimens from the Indian subcontinent to &quot;F. c. affinis&quot;. He renamed the Egyptian jungle cat as &quot;F. c. nilotica&quot; because &quot;Felis rüppelii&quot; was already applied to a different cat. A skin collected near Jericho in 1864 led him to describe a new subspecies, &quot;F. c. furax&quot;, as this skin was smaller than other Egyptian jungle cat skins. A few years later, Alfred Nehring also described a jungle cat skin collected in the Palestine region, which he named &quot;Lynx chrysomelanotis&quot;. Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed the nomenclature of felids in 1917 and classified the jungle cat group as part of the genus &quot;Felis&quot;. Another subspecies, &quot;Felis chaus fulvidina&quot;, was named by Oldfield Thomas in 1928.

During an expedition to Afghanistan in the 1880s, mammal skins were collected and later presented to the Indian Museum. One cat skin without a skull from the area of Maimanah in the country&#x27;s north was initially identified as of &quot;Felis caudata&quot;, but in the absence of skins for comparison the author was not sure whether his identification was correct. In his revision of Asiatic wildcat skins collected in the Zoological Museum of Berlin, the German zoologist Zukowsky reassessed the Maimanah cat skin, and because of its larger size and shorter tail than &quot;caudata&quot; skins proposed a new species with the scientific name &quot;Felis (Felis) maimanah&quot;. Zukowsky assumed that the cat inhabits the region south of the Amu Darya River. The Russian zoologist Ognev acknowledged Zukowsky&#x27;s assessment but also suggested that more material is needed for a definite taxonomic classification of this cat. In his posthumously published monograph about skins and skulls of the genus &quot;Felis&quot; in the collection of the Natural History Museum, the British taxonomist Pocock referred neither to Zukowsky&#x27;s appraisal nor to jungle cat skins from Afghanistan. The British natural historian Ellerman and zoologist Morrison-Scott tentatively subordinated the Maimanah cat skin as a subspecies of &quot;Felis chaus&quot;.

In 1969, the Russian biologist Heptner described a jungle cat from the lower course of the Vakhsh River in Central Asia and proposed the name &quot;Felis (Felis) chaus oxiana&quot;.

In the 1930s, Pocock reviewed the jungle cat skins and skulls from British India and adjacent countries. Based mainly on differences in fur length and colour he subordinated the zoological specimens from Turkestan to Balochistan to &quot;F. c. chaus&quot;, the Himalayan ones to &quot;F. c. affinis&quot;, the ones from Cutch to Bengal under &quot;F. c. kutas&quot;, and the tawnier ones from Burma under &quot;F. c. fulvidina&quot;. He newly described six larger skins from Sind as &quot;F. c. prateri&quot;, and skins with shorter coats from Sri Lanka and southern India as &quot;F. c. kelaarti&quot;.

===Classification===
In 2005, the authors of Mammal Species of the World recognized 10 subspecies as valid taxa. Since 2017, the Cat Specialist Group considers only three subspecies as valid. Geographical variation of the jungle cat is not yet well understood and needs to be examined.
The following table is based on the classification of the species provided in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot;. It also shows the synonyms used in the revision of the Cat Classification Task Force:

===Phylogeny ===
In 2006, the phylogenetic relationship of the jungle cat was described as follows:

The jungle cat is a member of the genus &quot;Felis&quot; within the family Felidae.

Results of an mtDNA analysis of 55 jungle cats from various biogeographic zones in India indicate a high genetic variation and a relatively low differentiation between populations. It appears that the central Indian &quot;F. c. kutas&quot; population separates the Thar Desert &quot;F. c. prateri&quot; populations from the rest and also the south Indian &quot;F. c. kelaarti&quot; populations from the north Indian &quot;F. c. affinis&quot; ones. The central Indian populations are genetically closer to the southern than to the northern populations.

== Characteristics ==

The jungle cat is a medium-sized, long-legged cat, and the largest of the extant &quot;Felis&quot; species. The head-and-body length is typically between . It stands nearly at shoulder and weighs . Its body size decreases from west to east; this was attributed to greater competition from small cats in the east. Its body size shows a similar decrease from the northern latitudes toward the tropics. Sexually dimorphic, females tend to be smaller and lighter than males. The face is long and narrow, with a white muzzle. The large, pointed ears, in length and reddish brown on the back, are set close together; a small tuft of black hairs, nearly long, emerges from the tip of both ears. The eyes have yellow irises and elliptical pupils; white lines can be seen around the eye. Dark lines run from the corner of the eyes down the sides of the nose and a dark patch marks the nose. The skull is fairly broad in the region of the zygomatic arch; hence the head of this cat appears relatively rounder.

The coat, sandy, reddish brown or grey, is uniformly coloured and lacks spots; melanistic and albino individuals have been reported from the Indian subcontinent. White cats observed in the coastline tracts of the southern Western Ghats lacked the red eyes typical of true albinos. A 2014 study suggested that their colouration could be attributed to inbreeding. Kittens are striped and spotted, and adults may retain some of the markings. Dark-tipped hairs cover the body, giving the cat a speckled appearance. The belly is generally lighter than the rest of the body and the throat is pale. The fur is denser on the back compared to the underparts. Two moults can be observed in a year; the coat is rougher and lighter in summer than in winter. The insides of the forelegs show four to five rings; faint markings may be seen on the outside. The black-tipped tail, long, is marked by two to three dark rings on the last third of the length. The pawprints measure about ; the cat can cover in one step. There is a distinct spinal crest. Because of its long legs, short tail and tuft on the ears, the jungle cat resembles a small lynx. It is larger and more slender than the domestic cat.

==Distribution and habitat==
The jungle cat is found in the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Indian subcontinent, central and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China.
A habitat generalist, the jungle cat inhabits places with adequate water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands, littoral and riparian areas, grasslands and shrub. It is common in agricultural lands, such as fields of bean and sugarcane, across its range, and has often been sighted near human settlements. As reeds and tall grasses are typical of its habitat, it is known as &quot;reed cat&quot; or &quot;swamp cat&quot;. It can thrive even in areas of sparse vegetation, but does not adapt well to cold climates and is rare in areas where snowfall is common. Historical records indicate that it occurs up to elevations of in the Himalayas. It shuns rainforests and woodlands.

In Turkey, it has been recorded in wetlands near Manavgat, in the Akyatan Lagoon on the southern coast and near Lake Eğirdir.
In the Palestinian territories, it was recorded in the Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho and Jerusalem Governorates in the West Bank during surveys carried out between 2012 and 2016.

In Iran, it inhabits a variety of habitat types from plains and agriculture lands to mountains ranging from elevations of in at least 23 of 31 provinces of Iran.
In Pakistan, it was photographed in Haripur, Dera Ismail Khan, Sialkot Districts and Langh Lake Wildlife Sanctuary.

In India, it is the most common small wild cat.
In Nepal, it was recorded in alpine habitat at elevations of in Annapurna Conservation Area between 2014 and 2016.

In Malaysia, it was recorded in a highly fragmented forest in the Selangor state in 2010.

A few jungle cat mummies were found among the cats in ancient Egypt.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The jungle cat is typically diurnal and hunts throughout the day. Its activity tends to decrease during the hot noon hours. It rests in burrows, grass thickets and scrubs. It often sunbathes on winter days. Jungle cats have been estimated to walk at night, although this likely varies depending on the availability of prey. The behaviour of the jungle cat has not been extensively studied. It is solitary and associates with conspecifics only in the mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking; some males have been observed rubbing their cheeks on objects to mark them.

Leopards, tigers, bears, crocodiles, dholes, golden jackals, fishing cats, large raptors and snakes are the main predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal in particular can be a major competitor to the jungle cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for the other members of &quot;Felis&quot;. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as &quot;Haemaphysalis&quot; ticks and &quot;Heterophyes&quot; trematode species.

===Diet and hunting===

Primarily a carnivore, the jungle cat prefers small mammals such as gerbils, hares and rodents. It also hunts birds, fishes, frogs, insects and small snakes. Its prey typically weighs less than , but occasionally includes mammals as large as young gazelles. The jungle cat is unusual in that it is partially omnivorous: it eats fruits, especially in winter. In a study carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve, rodents were found to comprise as much as 95% of its diet.

The jungle cat hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. It uses different techniques to secure prey. The cat has been observed searching for muskrats in their holes. Like the caracal, the jungle cat can perform one or two high leaps into the air to grab birds. It is an efficient climber as well. The jungle cat has been clocked at . It is an efficient swimmer, and can swim up to in water and plunge into water to catch fish.

===Reproduction===

Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are one year old. Females enter oestrus lasting for about five days, from January to March. In males, spermatogenesis occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the nape of her neck and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.

Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Before parturition, the mother prepares a den of grass in an abandoned animal burrow, hollow tree or reed bed. Litters comprise one to five kittens, typically two to three kittens. Females can raise two litters in a year. Kittens weigh between at birth, tending to be much smaller in the wild than in captivity. Initially blind and helpless, they open their eyes at 10 to 13 days of age and are fully weaned by around three months. Males usually do not participate in the raising of kittens; however, in captivity, males appear to be very protective of their offspring. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months. The lifespan of the jungle cat in captivity is 15 to 20 years; this is possibly higher than that in the wild.

Generation length of the jungle cat is 5.2 years.

==Threats==

Major threats to the jungle cat include habitat loss such as the destruction of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due to high levels of hunting.
Since the 1960s, populations of the Caucasian jungle cat living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. It is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly affected by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats in retaliation for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this trade was banned in 1979; some illegal trade continues in the country, in Egypt and Afghanistan.

In the 1970s, Southeast Asian jungle cats still used to be the most common wild cats near villages in certain parts of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.

== Conservation ==
The jungle cat is listed under CITES Appendix II. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkey. But it does not receive legal protection outside protected areas in Bhutan, Georgia, Laos, Lebanon, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

<text>Hermes was a proposed spaceplane designed by the French Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES) in 1975, and later by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was superficially similar to the American Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar and the larger Space Shuttle.

In January 1985, CNES proposed to proceed with Hermes development under the auspices of the ESA. Hermes was to have keyed a crewed spaceflight program launched by an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. In November 1987, the project was approved for pre-development from 1988 to 1990, after which authorisation for full development was required. However, the project experienced numerous delays and funding issues.

In 1992, Hermes was cancelled due to high cost and unachievable performance, as well as a partnership with the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (RKA) which reduced the need for an independent spaceplane. As a result, no Hermes shuttles were ever built. During the 2010s, it was proposed to resurrect the Hermes vehicle as a partially reusable air-launched spaceplane launch system, known as SOAR.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing recognition by European nations that more international cooperation would be necessary for large space projects. In 1973, the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) — a precursor to the European Space Agency (ESA) — commenced development of a heavy expendable launch system later named the Ariane. The French space agency Centre National D&#x27;études Spatiales (CNES), desired greater autonomy to avoid overreliance upon NASA, and envisaged a European-built human-capable space vehicle that would operate in conjunction with other ESA assets such as Ariane.

In 1976, CNES commenced studies into a crewed version of Ariane. Two different concepts included a capsule and a glider. In 1983, CNES opted to focus on a space plane that would deliver greater convenience, comfort, and cost-effectiveness. A space plane would simplify recovery by having the necessary cross-range manoeuvrability to reach a given point on the Earth within a single day, while providing for a less challenging re-entry environment for the crew and payload. Reusability would also reduce the cost of successive missions. Critical technologies identified included thermal protection, environmental controls, life support systems, aerodynamics, and power.

During the mid-1980s, in addition to the Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer (an independent European space station) and the Ariane 5 heavy launch vehicle, CNES championed the development and production of the &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; as a European initiative akin to the reusable space vehicle programs of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Buran and the US Space Shuttle.

===Selection===
On 18 October 1985, CNES appointed French aerospace company Aérospatiale as the primary contractor for Hermes, the name that had been given to the spacecraft. French aircraft manufacturer Dassault-Breguet was awarded responsibility for the aerodynamic and aerothermal aspects of the design. Arianespace was responsible for the Ariane 5 launcher and a strong candidate to manage operation of the infrastructure for &quot;Hermes&quot;.

On 25 October 1985, the proposal for Hermes was presented to the partner nations of the ESA. A deadline of March 1987 was set for the &#x27;Europeanisation&#x27; of the programme, under which portions of work for Hermes was assigned. The work share was attributed 15% to West Germany, 13% to Italy, 7% to Belgium, 5% to the Netherlands, 4% each to the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden, and 2% or less to Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Ireland. Potential participation by Norway and Canada was mooted. France held a 50 percent share of the work, although CNES was open to further redistribution of the work dependent upon individual partners increasing their stake in the programme. Early on, there was optimism that securing the funding from ESA members to proceed would not be difficult.

In November 1987, the ESA issued its approval. As envisaged, by 1995 Hermes would enable the ESA to service the planned Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer (MTFF) (the MTFF was restructured and ultimately manufactured as the Columbus module of the International Space Station). Development of Hermes was to proceed in two phases:

===&quot;Phase 1: Study and pre-development.&quot;===
Phase 1 was scheduled to end in 1990. Its plans called for the capability to lift 6 astronauts and of cargo, but after the Challenger disaster, an ejection capacity was added to give astronauts at least a small chance of survival in case of catastrophe. Accordingly, the six seats were curtailed to three regular ejection seats, which were chosen over an ejectable crew capsule that would have offered an escape option at heights above . The cargo capacity was reduced to . &quot;Hermes&quot; would not be able to place objects into orbit because its cargo hold could not be opened, That option was abandoned due to weight concerns.

Although &quot;Hermes&quot; was originally viewed as fully reusable (up to 30 re-entries before major service), the limited capacity of the Ariane 5 launcher forced it to leave the Resource Module in orbit. A new resource module would be attached to the &quot;Hermes&quot; and the entire structure would be launched again.

Phase 1 was not completed until the end of 1991 and by then the political climate had changed considerably. The Iron Curtain had been lifted and the Cold War was ending. As a result, ESA commenced a year-long &quot;reflection&quot; period to determine whether it still made sense for Europe to build its own space shuttle and space station or if new partners could be found to share cost and development. Officially, Phase 1 completed at the end of 1992.

===&quot;Phase 2: Final development, manufacture &amp; initial operations.&quot;===
Phase 2 never began, after ESA and the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (RKA) agreed to cooperate on future launchers and a replacement space station for Mir. Economic concerns prevented RKA from participating in a future launcher program, but at this point ESA&#x27;s crew transport needs were reoriented towards the capsule system (as opposed to the glider system of &quot;Hermes&quot;) called for by the joint Russian/European designs.

When both Russia and ESA joined with NASA to build the International Space Station, the need for a European crew transport system was eliminated because Russian and American needs were already satisfied. Accordingly, ESA abandoned the &quot;Hermes&quot; project.

==Design==
Hermes was intended as a reusable launch system to transport astronauts and moderate-size cargo payloads into low Earth orbit (LEO) and back. Hermes bears a resemblance to other reusable launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle. However, unlike the Space Shuttle, Hermes could not carry heavy cargoes as that role was to be performed by the uncrewed Ariane 5. Hermes was envisioned to transport a maximum of three astronauts along with a pressurized payload. The launch weight would be up to , the practical upper limit of an extended Ariane 5 launcher.

Hermes was to be launched as the upper stage of the Ariane 5. Prior to the 1986 redesign, &quot;Hermes&quot; was a single spaceplane containing (front to back) a crew compartment for six, an airlock, an unpressurized cargo hold similar to Buran&#x27;s and the Shuttle&#x27;s, and a service module. After the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; accident it was substantially redesigned. The crew cabin shrank to carry three astronauts, with the cargo hold pressurized and unable to carry or retrieve satellites. &quot;Hermes&quot; now consisted of two separate sections: the vehicle itself and a cone-shaped Resource Module having a docking mechanism attached to the vehicle&#x27;s rear, which was detached and discarded prior to re-entry. Only the crewed vehicle would re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and be re-used. The Resource Module and the launcher would be expended. When launching the Hermes, the Ariane 5 would have had its upper stage replaced by the space plane and an adaptor to mate the vehicle to the main cryogenic stage. The equipment bay of the launcher would also be removed and the spaceplane would perform all guidance and control functions. The development of the Ariane 5 was strongly influenced by the requirements of &quot;Hermes&quot;, such as the extra aerodynamic loads along with an increased reliability factor of 0.9999, while retaining minimal impact on the launcher&#x27;s commercial competitiveness on non-&quot;Hermes&quot; missions.

In comparison to the Space Shuttle, &quot;Hermes&quot; was substantially smaller. It did not share the ogival planform of the Shuttle, instead opting for a highly-swept delta wing complete with wingtip devices, similar to the proposed Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar spacecraft. Like the Shuttle, the pressurised cabin could seat more than five people, two of whom would serve as pilots, while the unpressurised aft cargo bay would have been fitted with large doors spanning the length of the bay along the fuselage. The vehicle would have been powered by a pair of 2,000N-thrust liquid propellant rocket motors identical to those used on the L4 low-energy upper stage of the Ariane 5.

Aerodynamic control would have been provided via a total of seven flight control surfaces, the wingtip rudders, trailing edge elevon/air brakes, and a body-mounted flap; these surfaces would have been controlled via quadruplex-redundant digital flight controls and actuated via triplex-redundant hydraulics. Mission management would have been performed via three general-purpose computers, a monitoring computer, and three digital databuses. Electrical power was to be provided by a motor that would have used liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen along with ten US-built fuel cells. The environmental control and life support systems supply pressurisation of the cabin, along with air, water, and warmth, to support the crew for a maximum of 40 days, although may have been potentially extendable to enable 90 day missions. &quot;Hermes&quot; could have operated autonomously for up to one month, and would be able to remain docked with an orbiting space station for a maximum of 90 days.

According to CNES, &quot;Hermes&quot; would have been subject to more extreme re-entry conditions than the Space Shuttle due to its smaller size exposing the vehicle to higher aerothermal pressures. The baseline thermal protection, was to withstand temperatures of 1,400-1,600 °C for a minimum of 20 minutes and studied by Dassault and SEP, would have consisted of carbon elements with an anti-oxidant coating applied to portions of the nose and leading edges of the wings, while thermal tiles were to have covered the underside of the wing and fuselage. These tiles would have employed thin, reinforced ceramic-carbon honeycomb composite insulating layers separated by thin sheets of metal alloy to reflect the heat; an alternative concept for the tiles would have employed higher metallic portions in place of ceramics. The upper surfaces of the vehicle would have been subject to less heat than the lower surfaces, and used flexible blanket-like low-density, glassfibre-ceramic layers.

The shape of Hermes had been effectively frozen by November 1985. It was refined by subsonic wind tunnel testing in the Onera, constrained by the requirements of subsonic flight. In order to gather valuable data in the face of Europe&#x27;s lack of experience, Dassault proposed validating the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle by completing a 1.4-tonne, 1-scale aerothermal demonstrator, named &quot;Maia&quot;, to be launched by an Ariane 4 for re-entry studies.

===Mission profiles and infrastructure===
Four typical missions were projected for &quot;Hermes&quot;:
* Hosting onboard experiments while in an equatorial altitude orbit
* Flights to NASA&#x27;s space station &quot;Freedom&quot; at a 28.5° inclination orbit 
* Flights to ESA&#x27;s space station &quot;Columbus&quot; at a 60° orbit.
* Flights to ESA&#x27;s uncrewed remote sensing &quot;Polar Platform&quot; at a 98° orbit

After each mission, Hermes would be refurbished at a dedicated facility in Europe. Around 40 days prior to a launch date, the vehicle would be transported on a specially-modified Airbus A300 airliner to its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, where it would be integrated with its payload and installed atop an Ariane 5 rocket prior to being transferred to the launch pad. Mission control was to be based at Toulouse, France. During a typical mission, communications and tracking would have been performed by a planned European network of data relay satellites with coverage across 75% of a Hermes mission at a 28.5° orbit at an altitude of .

Following a mission, Hermes would land at Istres-Le Tubé Air Base near Istres. Other potential landing sites were mooted, including Guiana Space Centre, Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport on the island of Fort de France and unspecified airstrips in Bermuda. In the event of an aborted launch during the first 84 seconds, &quot;Hermes&quot; would be able to return to Kourou. A later abort would likely necessitate a water landing in the Atlantic Ocean, after which the vehicle would need to be retrieved by a recovery ship. Other emergency landing strips were to be designated, dependent upon the specifics of each mission.

==Mockups and models==
A full scale mockup was built in 1986, and was shown in 1987 at Le Bourget in May, followed by Madrid in September and Toulouse during October - November. The following year (1988) the mockup was shown at Strasbourg in Abril, Hanover in May, and Bordeaux in December.
With the end of the project in 1993, this mockup was transferred to ENSICA (&quot;École nationale supérieures d&#x27;ingénieurs de construction aéronautique&quot;) in 1996.
In 2005 it was brought to Le Bourget to await a possible restoration project.

A 1/7 scale model built by EADS is shown since 2002 at the Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport.

==In media==
* A 1994 The Simpsons episode called &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; features a Hermes inspired shuttle design.
* The 2015 film &quot;&quot;The Martian&quot;&quot; features a ship named &quot;Hermes&quot;, although the design is radically different from the shuttle design in real life, and is designed for interplanetary travel.
* The 2017 film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;&#x27;s novelization mentions &quot;Hermes&quot; as the shuttle used by ESA during its first expedition to the International Space Station (identified as &quot;Alpha&quot;).

<text>James Edward Finks (August 31, 1927 – May 8, 1994) was an American professional football player, coach, and executive.

==Early life and playing career==
Finks was born in St. Louis, Missouri, attended high school in Salem, Illinois, and attended college at the University of Tulsa. After being selected as a 12th-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 1949 NFL draft, he played for several years as a defensive back and quarterback, retiring after the 1955 season. He was also drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in 1948 to play catcher and accepted that position before moving to the Pittsburgh Steelers to play football.

==College coaching and CFL career==
Finks served as an assistant coach under Terry Brennan at the University of Notre Dame in 1956, after which he went on to the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, where he served as a player/coach before becoming the general manager on October 31, 1957. Finks turned the Stampeders into a winning team. He signed many of the players that made Calgary the winningest team in the CFL during the 1960s, though the team did not win a Grey Cup title until 1971. He also signed quarterback Joe Kapp, who would also later play under Finks in the NFL.

==NFL front office career==
In 1964, Finks was named the general manager of the Minnesota Vikings. In 1968, Minnesota won its first NFL Central Division Championship, marking the start of a dynasty that produced 11 division championship teams and four Super Bowl appearances in the following 14 years. In 1969, the Vikings won 12 of 14 games and claimed the NFL championship before losing to the American Football League&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs 23–7 in Super Bowl IV.

The Vikings team that Finks put together was powered by a dynamic defensive front four, popularly known as The &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot;. The first member of the unit, defensive end Jim Marshall, came to the Vikings in a 1961 trade before Finks arrived. In 1964, the new general manager added two potential stars to the line: end Carl Eller as a first-round pick in the NFL Draft, and tackle Gary Larsen in a trade. He completed &quot;The Purple People Eaters&quot; in 1967 by picking Alan Page in the draft.

In 1967, Norm Van Brocklin resigned as head coach and Finks immediately hired Bud Grant, who had been a successful coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL for 10 seasons. That year, Finks also brought in a new quarterback, Joe Kapp, from the CFL. Kapp had played for the Calgary Stampeders when Finks was its general manager. During the 1969 NFL championship season, Kapp passed for a record seven touchdowns against the Baltimore Colts and was a major contributor to his team&#x27;s success.

In 1972, Finks made another daring trade with the New York Giants, this time to bring back Fran Tarkenton, the quarterback he had traded in 1967. In 1973, the Vikings defeated the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC championship but lost to the Miami Dolphins 24–7 in Super Bowl VIII. It turned out to be the last game with the Vikings for Finks, who that season was named the NFL Executive of the Year. Finks, who had been named a club vice-president in 1972 as a reward for his brilliant work, resigned in May 1974, reportedly because the Vikings refused to award him the stock that had been held by Van Brocklin and also because of the decision by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to have all team owners have offices.

===Chicago Bears===
Finks joined the Chicago Bears as executive vice-president and general manager. Owner George Halas had made most of the football decisions himself for most of the time since joining the team in 1920 (when it was the Decatur Staleys), even after buying the team in 1921 and overseeing its move to Chicago. However, he finally saw the need to modernize and gave Finks complete control of football operations. Finks spent the 1974 season studying the Bears player talent as well as opposition players from all around the NFL. The next year, he began employing the same formula he used so well in Minnesota to improve the Bears&#x27; talent pool.

The Bears under Finks improved. By 1977, they reached the playoffs for the first time since 1963. They were a playoff team again in 1979 with a 10–6 record, best-ever for the Finks-led Bears. But Finks&#x27; tenure in Chicago ended suddenly in 1982 when he resigned because Halas did not consult him in the hiring of Mike Ditka as head coach. However, he did stay with the Bears until after the 1983 Draft. By the time he left the Bears he held a minor portion of the franchise, which he relinquished when he resigned.

Finks contributed to one of the most dominant NFL teams of the 1980s. The 1985 Bears went over 15–1 in the regular-season and shut out both the New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams in playoff games leading to the Super Bowl.

After leaving the Bears, Finks joined the Chicago Cubs as president and chief executive officer in September 1983. He remained through the 1984 season when the Cubs captured the 1984 National League&#x27;s Eastern Division crown.

His record as GM with the Bears from 1974 to 1983 (Including 1983 because that was his last draft) was 65 wins – 80 losses

===Later career===
On January 14, 1986, Finks took charge of a New Orleans Saints team that never had experienced a winning season in its 19-year history. His first move was to hire a new coach, Jim Mora. Success came more quickly for Finks in New Orleans than it had in either Minnesota or Chicago. In just his second season, the Saints won 12 games for their first winning season ever. Finks was named NFL Executive of the Year for the second time.

When NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle retired in 1989, Finks was the leading candidate to replace him. He was the only candidate put forward for the job by a six-owner search committee (Wellington Mara, Lamar Hunt, Art Modell, Robert Parins, Dan Rooney, and Ralph Wilson). However, a group of 11 newer owners who wanted more of a voice in the selection process abstained from voting, preventing Finks from receiving the 19 votes necessary to become Commissioner. Six months later, a second meeting was held and it ended with 13 votes for Finks and 13 for attorney Paul Tagliabue. At a third meeting, a compromise was reached by the two groups that would make Tagliabue Commissioner and Finks president in charge of football operations. However, Finks declined this position and Tagliabue was elected by an undisclosed number of votes.

==Death==
Finks died in 1994 in Metairie, Louisiana from lung cancer. Jim Finks was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995. Finks enshrinement was based substantially on achievements with the Minnesota Vikings, Chicago Bears and New Orleans Saints franchises. He had also previously built the Vikings and Bears into Super Bowl teams—and the Saints became winners for the first time in franchise history. His longest tenure was spent with the Minnesota Vikings. His son Jim Finks Jr. authored the 2009 book &quot;COLORS: Pro Football Uniforms of the Past and Present&quot;.

<doc id="272952" wikidata="Q85977419" url="?curid=272952" title="Law Society of England and Wales">
<text>The Law Society of England and Wales (officially The Law Society) is the professional association that represents solicitors for the jurisdiction of England and Wales. It provides services and support to practising and training solicitors, as well as serving as a sounding board for law reform. Members of the Society are often consulted when important issues are being debated in Parliament or by the executive. The Society was formed in 1825.

The Hall of The Law Society is in Chancery Lane, London, but it also has offices in Cardiff to deal with the Wales jurisdiction and the Senedd.

A president is elected annually to serve for one year. The current president is Richard Atkinson.

The Law Society has nothing to do with barristers in England and Wales. The relevant professional body for barristers is the General Council of the Bar.

==History==
The London Law Institution, the predecessor to the Law Society, was founded in 1823 when many London Solicitors came together to raise the reputation of the profession by setting standards and ensuring good practice. &#x27;London&#x27; was dropped from the title in 1825 to reflect the fact that the Law Institution had national aspirations.

The Society was founded on 2 June 1825, when a committee of management was appointed. The Society acquired its first royal charter in 1831 as The Society of Attorneys, Solicitors, Proctors and others not being Barristers, practising in the Courts of Law and Equity of the United Kingdom. A new Charter in 1845 defined the Society as an independent, private body servicing the affairs of the profession like other professional, literary and scientific bodies. By further Royal Charter in 1903 the name of the Society was changed to simply &quot;The Law Society&quot;. The Society first admitted women members in 1922.

In 1949, the Law Society was given the responsibility of legal aid by the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949. The function was passed to the Legal Aid Board by Legal Aid Act 1988.

In July 2013, the Association of Women Solicitors (AWS), a national organisation working with and representing women solicitors in the United Kingdom, merged with the Law Society to form its Women Lawyers Division. Although merged, the AWS will operate separately from the Law Society.

===Discipline===
In 1834, the Society first initiated proceedings against dishonest practitioners. By 1907, the Society possessed a statutory disciplinary committee and was empowered to investigate solicitors&#x27; accounts and to issue annual practising certificates. In 1983, the Society established the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors to deal with complaints about solicitors. Complaints regarding the conduct of solicitors are now dealt with by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). However, complaints regarding poor service are the remit of the Legal Ombudsman.

===Legal education===
The Solicitors Act 1860 enabled the Society to create a three-tier examination system. In 1903, the Society established its own Law Society School of Law, which later merged with tutorial firm Gibson and Weldon to become the independent College of Law. By 1922 The Law Society required a compulsory academic year for all clerks.

==Regulatory body status==
Following the recommendations of the Clementi Review The Law Society split its representative and regulatory functions.

Complaints from the public are handled by the Legal Ombudsman which is a single portal for complaints by the public made against all providers of legal services including the Bar, licensed conveyancers etc., but excluding unqualified will-writers.

The regulatory body for solicitors is the Solicitors Regulation Authority. It is a Board of The Law Society although it regulates and enforces regulation completely independently of the Law Society. The Law Society remains the approved regulator, although following the Legal Services Act 2007 a new body, the Legal Services Board (currently chaired by Dr Helen Phillips) oversees all the approved regulators including the Bar Council, which has also divested its regulatory functions into the Bar Standards Board.

The Law Society of England and Wales is a Designated Professional Body under the Financial Services &amp; Markets Act 2000.

==The Hall of The Law Society==
Located at 113 Chancery Lane The Hall of The Law Society is the principal building of the society. Built in 1832 the building is Grade II* listed. The architect was Lewis Vulliamy. An extension in 1902-04 was designed by Charles Holden. In addition to offices for its staff, the building is used for Law Society conferences and events and parts of the building are available on a private hire basis for events.

==Past presidents==

==Standard Conditions of Sale==
The &quot;Standard Conditions of Sale&quot; are issued by the Law Society to provide a standard set of rules and expectations for the sale and purchase of residential property in England and Wales. As a contractual instrument they are intended &quot;to create legal rights and legal obligations&quot; on the part of both parties to a transaction. The fifth (current) edition was initially published in 2011, and was revised in 2018. The majority of residential property sales are subject to these conditions.

<doc id="272955" wikidata="Q2905677" url="?curid=272955" title="Singing telegram">
<text>A singing telegram is a message that is delivered by an artist in a musical form. Singing telegrams are historically linked to normal telegrams, but tend to be humorous. Sometimes the artist is in costume or formal clothing.

Western Union, the American telegraph company, began offering singing telegram services in 1933. That July 28, a fan sent Hollywood singing star Rudy Vallee a birthday greeting by telegram. George P. Oslin (1899–1996), the Western Union public relations director, decided this would be a good opportunity to make telegrams, which had been associated with deaths and other tragic news, into something more popular. He asked a Western Union operator, Lucille Lipps, to sing the message over the telephone, and this became the first singing telegram. While Oslin created the singing telegram because he thought &quot;that messages should be fun,&quot; he recalled that he &quot;was angrily informed I was making a laughingstock of the company.&quot;

As relatively few telegram recipients had telephones, most telegrams, including singing telegrams, were first delivered in person. The popularization of the telephone in the 1960s reduced telegrams in general. By 1972, Western Union was receiving a small number of requests for singing telegrams and was seeking regulatory approval on a state-by-state basis to eliminate the offering. Western Union suspended its singing telegram service in 1974, but independent singing telegram companies, specializing in often costumed personal delivery of gift messages, have kept up the tradition.

==Variants==
The linguistic morpheme &quot;-gram&quot; is also found at the end of words in combining forms to give the names of variants on the personally delivered message. These novelty telegrams are generally designed to amuse or embarrass the recipient. The message deliverers are mostly hired through a specialist commercial agency. Examples include the kissogram, strippergram, Gorillagram etc.

===Kissogram===
A kissogram, also called kissagram or kiss-a-gram (short for kissing telegram), is a message delivered along with a kiss, usually arranged as a humorous surprise. The message deliverers are typically young women who are dressed in provocative clothing. The term &quot;kissogram&quot; was used in the TV program &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during the early 2010s to describe the profession of The Doctor&#x27;s companion Amy Pond, who appears in a sexy kissogram version of a police officer&#x27;s uniform.

===Stripogram===
A stripogram or strippergram is a form of message delivery in which a stripper will perform a striptease while singing or dancing. This type of entertainment became popular in the 1970s in the US and spread to Europe during the 1980s. By the 1990s corporate strip-o-gram work, in which a stripper performs for clients in their workplace, was making up a significant part of the striptease business for novelty telegram services in the US. Strippergrams in the UK are sometimes hired for events such as stag parties. Typically a Strip-O-Gram is most often a form of gift given for a birthday, anniversary or bachelor party. A common practice is for the stripper-gram to be dressed in an outfit of one kind or another and to act out some charade connected with this, before commencing their actfor example a police officer &#x27;arresting&#x27; somebody, a lawyer pretending to serve papers, a jilted bride and so on (sometimes this charade will be relevant to something the intended &#x27;victim&#x27; has experienced, such as a divorce, or brush with the law). Usually a Strip-o-gram entertainer is accompanied by a chaperone, who plays her music, holds on to the money, tips and secures her safety, unlike an escort, who comes alone and does more of a one on one with the celebrant. Nowadays some agencies or performers do both to secure a bigger pay out.

===Bikinigram===
A bikinigram or bikini-gram is a message delivered by a bikini-clad young woman.

<doc id="272956" wikidata="Q751086" url="?curid=272956" title="Brownsea Island">
<text>Brownsea Island is the largest of the islands in Poole Harbour in the county of Dorset, England. The island is owned by the National Trust with the northern half managed by the Dorset Wildlife Trust. Much of the island is open to the public and includes areas of woodland and heath with a wide variety of wildlife, together with cliff top views across Poole Harbour and the Isle of Purbeck.

The island was the location of an experimental camp in 1907 that preceded the publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; and &quot;The Scout&quot; magazine in 1908. Access is by public ferry or private boat; in 2017 the island received 133,340 visitors. The island&#x27;s name probably comes from Old English = &quot;Brūnoc&#x27;s island&quot;.

==Geography==

Brownsea Island lies in Poole Harbour opposite the town of Poole in Dorset, England. It is the largest of eight islands in the harbour. The island can be reached by one of the public ferries or by private boat. There is a wharf and a small dock near the main castle. The island is long and wide and consists of of woodland (pine and oak), heathland and salt-marsh.

The entire island, except the church and a few other buildings which are leased or managed by third parties, is owned by the National Trust. Most of the buildings are situated near the small landing stage. The northern portion of the island is a Nature Reserve managed by Dorset Wildlife Trust and an important habitat for birds; this part of the island has limited public access. A small portion to the southeast of the island, along with Brownsea Castle, is leased to the John Lewis Partnership for use as a holiday hotel by partners, and is not open to the public.

The island forms part of the Studland civil parish within the Dorset unitary authority. It is within the South Dorset constituency of the House of Commons. Until 31 January 2020, it was also within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Ecology==

Brownsea Island has built up on a bare sand and mud bank deposited in the shallow harbour. Ecological succession has taken place on the island to create topsoil able to support ecosystems.

The nature reserve on the island is leased from the National Trust by Dorset Wildlife Trust. This reserve includes a brackish lagoon and area of woodland. Other ecosystems on the island include salt marsh, reedbed, two freshwater lakes, alder carr, coniferous woodland, deciduous woodland and arboretum. In the past invasive species such as rhododendrons, also non-native, were introduced to the island, but the trusts have cleared many areas. The entire island is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

===Wildlife===

The island is one of the few places in southern England where indigenous red squirrels survive, largely because non-native grey squirrels have never been introduced to the island. The Brownsea red squirrel population is the only population known in the UK to carry the human form of the bacteria stem &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; that causes leprosy in humans. Brownsea also has a small ornamental population of peacocks. The island has a heronry, in which both grey heron and little egret nest.

There is a large population of non-native sika deer on the island. In the past the numbers have been higher than the island can sustain and have overgrazed. To try to limit damage to trees and other vegetation by deer, areas of the island have been fenced off to provide areas of undamaged woodland to allow other species such as red squirrels to thrive.

The lagoon is noted for the large population of common tern and sandwich tern in summer, and a very large flock of avocets in winter, when more than 50 per cent of the British population (over 1500) can be present.

Some imported stonework and statuary on the island serves as a habitat for a Mediterranean land snail, &quot;Papillifera bidens&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The first records of inhabitants on Brownsea Island occurred in the 9th century, when a small chapel and hermitage were built by monks from Cerne Abbey near Dorchester. The chapel was dedicated to St Andrew and the only resident of the island was a hermit, who may have administered to the spiritual welfare of sailors passing through Poole Harbour. In 1015, Canute led a Viking raid to the harbour and used Brownsea as a base to sack Wareham and Cerne Abbey. In the 11th century the owner of the island was Bruno, who was Lord of the Manor of Studland. Following his invasion of England, William the Conqueror gave Studland, which included Brownsea, to his half-brother, Robert de Mortain. In 1154, King Henry II granted the Abbot of Cerne the right of wreck for the island and the abbey continued to control the interests of Brownsea for the following 350 years.

===Tudor period and Civil War===

After the dissolution of the monasteries, control of Brownsea passed to the Crown. Henry VIII recognised the island&#x27;s strategic importance of guarding the narrow entrance to the expanding port of Poole. As part of a deterrent to invasion forces from Europe, the island was fortified in 1547 by means of a blockhouse, which became known as Brownsea Castle. In the following centuries, the island passed into the hands of a succession of various owners.

In 1576, Queen Elizabeth I made a gift of Brownsea to one of her court favourites and rumoured lover, Sir Christopher Hatton. During the English Civil War, Poole sided with Parliament and garrisoned Brownsea Castle. Colonel Thomas Pride, the instigator of Pride&#x27;s Purge– the only military coup d&#x27;état in English history – was stationed on the island in 1654. Sir Robert Clayton, a Lord Mayor of London and wealthy merchant became owner in the mid-1650s and after his death in 1707 the island was sold to William Benson, a Whig Member of Parliament and architect. He converted the castle into a residence and was responsible for introducing many varieties of trees to the island.

===Industrial plans===

In 1765 Sir Humphrey Sturt, a local landowner and MP purchased the island, which in turn passed to his sons. Sturt expanded the castle and records suggest that he spent £50,000 on enhancing the island&#x27;s gardens. Sir Augustus John Foster, a retired British diplomat, bought the island in 1840. Foster experienced bouts of depression and died in Brownsea Castle in 1848 when he slit his throat. In 1852 Brownsea was again up for sale and was sold for £13,000. It was purchased by William Waugh, a former Colonel in the British Army in the belief he could exploit the white clay deposits on the island to manufacture high-quality porcelain.

A three-storey pottery was built in southwest corner of the island together with a tramway to transport the clay from clay pits in the north. He hoped the clay would be of the same quality as the nearby Furzebrook clay, but it turned out to be suitable only for sanitary ware. The company employed more than 200 people, but by 1887 the venture closed owing to a lack of demand and the poor quality of the clay.
Traces of these activities remain today, mainly as building foundations and pottery fragments. Waugh was also responsible for expanding the number of buildings on the island – creating the now ruined village of Maryland (named after Waugh&#x27;s wife), as well as adding a new gatehouse and tower in the Tudor style. Waugh also paid for the construction of a new pier, adorned with castellated watch towers. Another large expenditure was the construction of St Mary&#x27;s church, built in the Gothic style, and also named after his wife. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Harry Smith in 1853 and construction was completed a year later. Inside the church there is a monument to Waugh as well as the tomb of the late owner Charles van Raalte. In the church, Scout and Girl Guide flags line either side of the main altar.

After falling heavily into debt, the Waughs fled to Spain. The island was acquired by creditors and sold in 1873 to George Cavendish-Bentinck, who added Jersey cows to Brownsea and expanded the island&#x27;s agriculture. He filled the island with several Italian Renaissance sculptures, some of which still decorate the church and the quay. The 1881 census recorded a total population of 270 people on the island, the majority of whom provided a labour force for the pottery works. After his death, the island was sold to Kenneth Robert Balfour in 1891. Following the introduction of electric lighting, the castle was gutted by fire in 1896. It was subsequently rebuilt, and in 1901 Balfour put the island up for sale.

===20th century===
The island was purchased by wealthy stockbroker Charles van Raalte who used the island as a residential holiday retreat. During this time the castle was renovated and served as host to famous visitors such as Guglielmo Marconi. Robert Baden-Powell had met the van Raaltes at an angling house party in Ireland. van Raalte suggested his Brownsea Island as the venue for Baden-Powell&#x27;s experimental camp for boys in the summer of 1907. Brownsea was largely self-supporting, with a kitchen garden and a dairy herd. Many of the pottery factory workers had stayed on after it closed, farming and working for the owners.

Charles van Raalte died in Calcutta in February 1908 and his wife eventually left the island in 1925.

In 1927 the Island was purchased at auction by Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000. Her entire family were from the London area and Kent - except that her daughter&#x27;s husband&#x27;s first cousin&#x27;s husband was Arthur Soames whose family lived in Lilliput, within view of Brownsea Island. Arthur&#x27;s sister was Olave Soames, the wife of Robert Baden-Powell.

A recluse by nature, Mrs. Bonham-Christie ordered a mass eviction of the island&#x27;s residents to the mainland. Most of the island was abandoned and gradually reverted to natural heath and woodland. In 1934, a wild fire caused devastation after burning for a week. Much of the island was reduced to ashes, and the buildings to the east were only saved by a change of wind direction. Traumatised by the event, Bonham-Christie banned all public access to the island for the rest of her life.

In May and June 1940 a refugee camp was set up on Church Field, 3000 Dutch and Belgian refugees cames here over 6 weeks. Some of the Dutch refugee boats were then used in the evacuation of the troops from Dunkirk. During the Second World War large flares were placed on the western end of the island to mislead Luftwaffe bombers away from the port of Poole. The decoy saved Poole and Bournemouth from of German bombs, but the deserted village of Maryland was destroyed. In April 1961, Bonham-Christie died at 96 years old and her grandson gave the island to the Treasury to pay her death duties. Concerned the island could be sold to commercial developers, a campaign was started by local conservationist, Helen Brotherton, with the aim of purchasing the island to protect its natural habitats.

The National Trust subsequently agreed to take over responsibility for the island if enough funds were raised and in 1962 it purchased Brownsea for £100,000. Work was carried out to prepare the island for visitors; tracks were cleared through areas overgrown with rhododendrons and firebreaks were created to prevent repetition of the 1934 fire. The Dorset Wildlife Trust leased a nature reserve on the north of the island, Scouts and Guides were allowed to return and the castle was renovated and leased to the John Lewis Partnership for use as a staff hotel. The island was opened to the public in May 1963 by Olave, Lady Baden-Powell at a ceremony attended by members of the 1907 camp. Soon after Brownsea Island was opened to the public, it was attracting more than 10,000 visitors a year. Larger boats means that today the island attracts some 110,000 visitors annually.

Since 1964 the island has been host to the Brownsea Open Air Theatre, annually performing the works of William Shakespeare. The island has a visitor centre and museum, displaying the island&#x27;s history. There is also a newly located shop and cafe, with one holiday cottage on the quay. At the Scout camp at the southwest of the Island there is an outdoor centre and a trading post shop which is focused on the Scout movement.

=== 21st century ===
The Dorset Wildlife Trust operates on the island from The Villa, previously the island vicarage. The island has a single post box that is emptied each day. In October 2008, the island was featured on BBC One&#x27;s annual &quot;Autumnwatch&quot; programme.

There is an annual round-the-island swim of run by the RLSS Poole Lifeguards.

==Scouts and Brownsea Island==
From 1 August until 8 August 1907, Robert Baden-Powell held an experimental camp on the island, to test out his Boy Scout ideas. He gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds (from boys&#x27; schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys&#x27; Brigade units) and held a week-long camp. The boys took part in activities such as camping, observation, woodcraft, chivalry, lifesaving and patriotism. Following the camp, in 1908, Baden-Powell&#x27;s book &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; and &quot;The Scout&quot; magazine were published and the Scout movement grew rapidly.

Boy Scouts camped on the island until the 1930s, when all public access to the island was forbidden by the island&#x27;s owner. After ownership of the island transferred to the National Trust, a permanent Scout camp site was opened in 1963 by Olave Baden-Powell. In August 2007, 100 years after Baden-Powell&#x27;s experimental camp, Brownsea Island was the focus of celebrations of the centenary. Four camps were set up on the island including a replica of the original 1907 camp, and hundreds of Scouts and Girl Guides from 160 countries travelled to the island to take part in the celebrations. Also present on the Island that day were 17 descendants of Baden-Powell.

<text>The All-Union Science Production Association Biopreparat (, , ) was a Soviet agency created in April 1974, which spearheaded the largest and most sophisticated offensive biological warfare program the world has ever seen. It was a vast, ostensibly civilian, network employing 30–40,000 personnel and incorporating five major military-focused research institutes, numerous design and instrument-making facilities, three pilot plants and five dual-use production plants. The network pursued major offensive research and development programs which genetically engineered microbial strains to be resistant to an array of antibiotics. In addition, bacterial agents were created with the ability to produce various peptides, yielding strains with wholly new and unexpected pathogenic properties.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of the &quot;Biopreparat&quot; network are closely connected with the creation in the 1950s by the USSR, under the leadership of Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, of biological warfare mobilisation facilities hidden within newly built civil production plants. The construction of the first major dual-use plant, the Berdsk Chemical Factory, located 26 km south of Novosibirsk, began in 1957 in response to a decree by the USSR Council of Ministers on the development of the Soviet chemical and microbiological industry. A second dual-use facility, the Omutninsk Chemical Factory, located in Vostochnyi, 150 km north-east of Kirov, was created in accordance with a decree issued on the 2 August 1958 by the CPSU and the Council of Ministers. The idea behind the new plants was that in the event of wartime emergency they could switch from the output of civil microbiological products to the production of military biological agents. Both the Berdsk and the Omutninsk facilities were transferred to &quot;Biopreparat&quot; upon its creation in 1974.

Another key institution which &quot;Biopreparat&quot; was to draw heavily upon for the recruitment of scientific personnel with knowledge of biological weapons was the Scientific-Research Technical Bureau (&quot;Nauchno-issledovatel&#x27;skoe tekhnicheskoe byuro&quot; or &quot;NITB&quot;). It was created in August 1958 under the USSR Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Fifteenth Administration, which at this time managed the Soviet Union&#x27;s BW programme. &quot;NITB&quot; had the task of developing technology for use in the creation of dual-use pharmaceutical and microbiological enterprises. It also had the responsibility of maintaining the military components of the Soviet dual-use facilities in a constant state of readiness. Most of the key staff members at &quot;NITB&quot; were transferred to &quot;Biopreparat&quot; in 1974.

===Establishment===
On the 24 April 1974, the USSR&#x27;s Main Administration of the Microbiological Industry (&quot;Glavmikrobioprom&quot;) issued Order 131 DSP which created the All-Union Science Production Association &quot;Biopreparat&quot;. On the 26 June 1974, a number of the Soviet Union&#x27;s existing dual-use BW facilities were transferred to the new agency. These included the Berdsk Chemical Factory and the Omutninsk Chemical Factory. The &quot;Biopreparat&quot; project was reportedly initiated by academician Yuri Anatol&#x27;evich Ovchinnikov, who convinced General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev that development of biological weapons was necessary. The research at &quot;Biopreparat&quot; constituted a violation of the terms of the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, which outlawed biological weapons.

===Exposure in the West===
&quot;Biopreparat&quot;&#x27;s research and development (R&amp;D) programmes were from the very outset subject to extraordinary levels of secrecy and compartmentalization. The first significant intelligence reaching the West regarding the nature and extent of this Soviet covert BW effort resulted from the defection to the UK in October 1989 of a high-level &quot;Biopreparat&quot; scientist, Vladimir Artemovich Pasechnik (1937–2001). The latter was able to provide a detailed account of the vast scope of Moscow&#x27;s clandestine program. As a result of Pasechnik&#x27;s testimony, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President George H. W. Bush were able to apply pressure on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to open up Russia&#x27;s germ warfare facilities to a team of outside inspectors. When the inspectors toured four of the sites in 1991, they were met with denials and evasions. Production tanks, the purpose of which seemed to be to manufacture large quantities of hazardous materials, were clean and sterile when presented to inspectors. Laboratories had been stripped of equipment before being presented to inspectors.

Pasechnik&#x27;s revelations that the program was much greater in scope than previously suspected were confirmed in 1992 with the travel to the United States of Colonel Kanatzhan Baizakovich Alibekov (b. 1950). The latter, who subsequently adopted the name of Ken Alibek, had served as First Deputy Director of &quot;Biopreparat&quot; from 1988 to 1992. Alibekov later wrote the book &quot;Biohazard&quot; (1999) detailing publicly his extensive inside knowledge of the structure, goals, operations and achievements of &quot;Biopreparat&quot;. He was also featured in the October 13, 1998 episode of &quot;Frontline&quot; entitled &quot;Plague War&quot;.

===Changing role of &quot;Biopreparat&quot;, 1985 – present===
&quot;Biopreparat&quot; had three distinct, and, at times overlapping, phases of its existence. From its origins in April 1974 through to the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, and indeed for some undetermined time thereafter, it was engaged in a major offensive BW research programme. It also maintained five dual-use manufacturing plants. In March 1985, with the election by the Politboro of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the CPSU, &quot;Biopreparat&quot; increased in size and political importance and began to emerge also as a major player with regard to the civil biopharmaceutical sector. By 1988, in this second phase, the &quot;Biopreparat&quot; network incorporated no less than 40 facilities, operating in 15 different cities and had control of domestic production of vaccines, antibiotics and other essential medicines. It was precisely at this moment that Alibekov emerged as a key interlocutor between &quot;Biopreparat&quot; and a number of Western pharmaceutical companies. In the third and final phase during the 2000s, &quot;Biopreparat&quot; was divested of control of nearly all R&amp;D institutes and manufacturing facilities. Henceforward, it assumed a highly diminished role, focused on export control and other matters and only maintained a small headquarters staff.

==Operations==
&quot;Biopreparat&quot; was a system of nominally civilian, research and design institutes, pilot plants and dual-use manufacturing facilities located mainly at sites in European Russia, in which a small army of scientists and technicians worked on bacterial and viral pathogens with a view to developing a new generation of biological weapons. It incorporated capacity with the potential to produce weaponized anthrax in the Soviet Union and was a leader in the development of new bioweapons technologies.

===Facilities===
The project incorporated the following R&amp;D, design, pilot plant and production facilities:
* All-Union Scientific-Research Design Institute of Applied Biochemistry (&quot;VNIIbiokhimmashproekt&quot;), Moscow
* All-Union Scientific-Research Institute of Applied Microbiology (&quot;VNII PM&quot;), Obolensk
* All-Union Institute of Highly Pure Biochemical Preparations (&quot;VNII OChB&quot;), Leningrad
* All-Union Scientific-Research Institute of Molecular Biology (&quot;VNII MB&quot;), Kol&#x27;tsovo
* Institute of Immunology, Lyubuchany
* Experimental Design Bureau of Precision Biological Engineering (&quot;OKB TBM&quot;), Kirishi
* Experimental Design Bureau of Automation Equipment (&quot;OKBA&quot;), Yoshkar-Ola
* Stepnogorsk Scientific Experimental-Industrial Base (&quot;SNOPB&quot;), Stepnogorsk, northern Kazakhstan
* Berdsk Scientific Experimental-Industrial Base (&quot;BNOPB&quot;), Berdsk
* Omutninsk Scientific Experimental Industrial Base (&quot;ONOPB&quot;), Omutninsk
* Berdsk Chemical Factory, Berdsk
* Omutninsk Chemical Factory, Omutninsk

===Pathogens===
Research was conducted on a range of bacterial and viral pathogens with a view to their potential weaponization. These included:
* &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; (the causative agent of anthrax)
* &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; (the causative agent of plague)
* &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot; (the causative agent of tularaemia)
* Brucella sp. (the causative agent of Brucellosis)
* Smallpox virus
* Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
* Marburg virus 
* Machupo virus

The only reliable data with regard to production capacity of weaponised agents concerns &quot;SNOPB&quot; (Stepnogorsk). Here, the plant is estimated to have incorporated capacity for the production of around 300 metric tonnes of weaponized &quot;B. anthracis&quot; spores per ten-month production cycle.

<doc id="272964" wikidata="Q204814" url="?curid=272964" title="Black-footed cat">
<text>The black-footed cat (Felis nigripes), also called the small-spotted cat, is the smallest wild cat in Africa, having a head-and-body length of . Despite its name, only the soles of its feet are black or dark brown. With its bold small spots and stripes on the tawny fur, it is well camouflaged, especially on moonlit nights. It bears black streaks running from the corners of the eyes along the cheeks, and its banded tail has a black tip.

The first black-footed cat known to science was discovered in the northern Karoo of South Africa and described in 1824. It is endemic to the arid steppes and grassland savannas of Southern Africa. It was recorded in southern Botswana, but only a few authentic records exist in Namibia, in southern Angola and in southern Zimbabwe. Due to its restricted distribution, it has been listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2002. The population is suspected to be declining due to poaching of prey species for human consumption as bushmeat, persecution, traffic accidents, and predation by herding dogs.

The black-footed cat has been studied using radio telemetry since 1993. This research allowed direct observation of its behaviour in its natural habitat. It usually rests in burrows during the day and hunts at night. It moves between on average in search of small rodents and birds. It feeds on 40 different vertebrates and kills up to 14 small animals per night. It can catch birds in flight, jumping up to high, and also attacks mammals and birds much heavier than itself. A female usually gives birth to two kittens during the Southern Hemisphere summer between October and March. They are weaned at the age of two months and become independent after four months of age at the latest.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The scientific name &quot;Felis nigripes&quot; was used by the British explorer William John Burchell in 1824 when he described the species based on skins of small, spotted cats that he encountered near Litákun (now known as Dithakong), in South Africa.
&quot;Felis&quot; (&quot;Microfelis&quot;) &quot;nigripes thomasi&quot; was proposed as a subspecies by the South African mammalogist Guy C. Shortridge in 1931, who described black-footed cat skins collected in Griqualand West that were darker than those of the nominate subspecies.
When the British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed cat skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London, he corroborated that the black-footed cat is a &quot;Felis&quot; species.

The validity of a subspecies was doubted as no geographical barriers matching the observed differences exist between populations. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and noted that the black-footed cat is most probably a monotypic species.

=== Phylogeny and evolution ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA from all Felidae species revealed that their evolutionary radiation began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates that they radiated at around .

The black-footed cat is part of an evolutionary lineage that is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of all &quot;Felis&quot; species around , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA. Analysis of their mitochondrial DNA indicates a genetic divergence of &quot;Felis&quot; species at around . Both models agree on the jungle cat (&quot;F. chaus&quot;) having been the first &quot;Felis&quot; species that diverged, followed by the black-footed cat.

Fossil remains of the black-footed cat have not been found. It possibly migrated during the Pleistocene into Africa. This migration was possibly facilitated by extended periods of low sea levels between Asia and Africa.

The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the black-footed cat as derived through analysis of nuclear DNA:

==Characteristics==

The black-footed cat has tawny fur that is entirely covered with black spots. Its head is darker than the rest of the body but paler above the eyes. Its whiskers are white, and its ears bear grizzled dark brown hairs. On the neck and back, some spots are elongated into stripes. The spots form transverse stripes on the shoulders. The forelegs and the hind legs bear irregular stripes. Its tail is confusedly spotted. The underparts of the feet are black or dark brown. The throat rings form black semi-circles that vary in colour from dusky brown to pale rufous and are narrowly edged with rufous. Some individuals have a pure white belly with a tawny tinge where it blends into the tawny colour of the flanks. The ears, eyes and mouth are lined with pale off-white. Two black streaks run from the corners of the eyes across the cheeks. Individuals vary in background colour from sandy and pale ochre to dark ochre.
In the northern part of its range, it is lighter than in the southern part, where its spots and bands are more clearly defined. The three rings on the throat are reddish brown to black, with the third ring broken in some individuals.
The black bands are broad on the upper legs and become narrower towards the paws. The long guard hairs are gray at the base and have either white or dark tips. The underfur is dense with short and wavy hair. The fur becomes thicker and longer during winter.
The pupils of the eyes contract to a vertical slit, like in all &quot;Felis&quot; species. They are light green to dark yellow.

The black-footed cat is the smallest cat species in Africa. Females measure in head and body length with a long tail. Males are between with a long tail. Its tapering tail is about half the length of the head and body.
Its skull is short and round with a basal length of and a width of . The ear canal and the openings of the ears are larger than in most &quot;Felis&quot; species. The cheek teeth are long and the upper carnassials long.
It has small pointed ears ranging from in females and in males. The hindfoot of females measures maximum and of males maximum .
Its shoulder height is less than .
Females weigh and males .

The African wildcat (&quot;Felis lybica&quot;) is almost three times as large as the black-footed cat, has longer legs, a longer tail and mostly plain grey fur with less distinct markings. The serval (&quot;Leptailurus serval&quot;) resembles the black-footed cat in coat colour and pattern, but has proportionately larger ears, longer legs and a longer tail.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-footed cat is endemic to Southern Africa; its distribution is much more restricted than other small cats in this region. Its range extends from South Africa northward into southern Botswana, where it was recorded in the late 1960s. It has also been recorded in Namibia, extreme southern Angola and southern Zimbabwe. It is unlikely to occur in Lesotho and Eswatini. It inhabits open, arid savannas and semi-arid shrubland in the Karoo and the southwestern Kalahari with short grasses, low bush cover, and scattered clumps of low bush and higher grasses. The mean annual precipitation in this region ranges from .
In the Drakensberg area, it was recorded at an elevation of .

==Behaviour and ecology==
The black-footed cat is nocturnal and usually solitary, except when females care for dependent kittens. It spends the day resting in hollow termite mounds and dense cover in unoccupied burrows of South African springhare (&quot;Pedetes capensis&quot;), aardvark (&quot;Orycteropus afer&quot;), and Cape porcupine (&quot;Hystrix africaeaustralis&quot;). It digs vigorously to extend or modify these burrows for shelter. After sunset, it emerges to hunt. It seeks refuge at the slightest disturbance and often uses termite mounds for cover or for bearing its young. When cornered, it defends itself fiercely. Due to this habit and its courage, it is called in parts of the South African Karoo, meaning &#x27;anthill tiger&#x27;. A San legend claims that a black-footed cat can kill a giraffe by piercing its jugular. This exaggeration is intended to emphasize its bravery and tenacity.

Unlike most other cats, it is a poor climber, as its stocky body and short tail are thought not to be conducive for climbing trees. However, one black-footed cat was observed and photographed resting in the lower branches of a camelthorn tree (&quot;Vachellia erioloba&quot;).

A female roams in an average home range of in a year, and a resident male in an area of . The range of an adult male overlaps the ranges of one to four females. It uses scent marking throughout its range. Receptive females were observed spraying urine up to 41 times in a stretch of . They sprayed less frequently during pregnancy. Other forms of scent marking include rubbing objects, raking with claws, and depositing faeces in visible locations. Its calls are louder than those of other cats of its size, presumably to allow calls to be heard over relatively large distances. When close to each other, however, it uses quieter purrs or gurgles; when threatened, it hisses and growls. Adults move an average of per night in search of prey.
It is difficult to survey because of its highly secretive nature; moreover, it tends to move fast without using roads or tracks like other cats. In South Africa, a density of was estimated in Benfontein near Kimberley during 1998 to 1999, that fell to during 2005 to 2014. Farther south, in the Nuwejaarsfontein area, the estimated number of individuals during 2009 to 2014 was . These were probably exceptionally high densities, as both areas feature good weather and management conditions, while the number of individuals in less favourable habitats could be closer to .

===Hunting and diet===

The black-footed cat hunts at night irrespective of the weather, at temperatures from . It attacks its prey from the rear, puts its forepaws on its flanks and grounds the prey using its dewclaws. It employs three different ways of hunting: &quot;fast hunt&quot;, &quot;slow hunt&quot;, and &quot;sit and wait&quot; hunt. In a fast hunt, it moves at a speed of and chases prey out of vegetation cover. During a slow hunt, it stalks the prey at a speed of , meandering cautiously through the grass and vigilantly checking its surroundings while turning its head side to side. It moves between on average in search of small rodents and birds, mostly moving in small circles and zig-zagging among bushes and termite mounds. In a &quot;sit and wait&quot; hunt, it waits for the prey motionlessly in front of a rodent den, sometimes with closed eyes. Its ears keep moving, and it opens the eyes as soon as it hears a sound.

Due to its small size, the black-footed cat hunts mainly small prey such as rodents and small birds, but also preys on Cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;), being heavier than itself. Its energy requirement is very high, with about of prey consumed per night, which is about a sixth of its average body weight.
It is able to satisfy its daily water requirements through its prey, but drinks water when available.

Black-footed cats have been observed to attempt catching 10 vertebrates in five hours of hunting, with a mean of six successful attempts.
In 1993, a female and a male black-footed cat were followed for 622 hours and observed hunting. They caught vertebrates every 50 minutes and killed up to 14 small animals in a night. They killed shrews and rodents by a bite in the neck or in the head and consumed them completely. They stalked birds quietly, followed by a quick chase and a jump up to a height of and over a distance of , also catching some in the air. They pulled them down to the ground and consumed small birds like Cape clapper lark (&quot;Mirafra apiata&quot;) and spike-heeled lark (&quot;Chersomanes albofasciata&quot;) without plucking. They plucked large birds like northern black korhaan (&quot;Afrotis afraoides&quot;), ate for several hours, cached the remains in hollows and covered them with sand. Neonate springbok (&quot;Antidorcas marsupialis&quot;) lambs keep hiding quietly in a hollow or under a bush for the first few days of their lives. A male pounced on a lamb resting in the grass, but abandoned the hunt after the lamb got up on its feet. It later scavenged the carcass of a recently deceased lamb weighing nearly . It consumed around meat in each of several bouts of eating, starting from the thighs, making its way from the lower back through the flanks to the neck; later it opened up the chest and fed on the inner organs. Insects like harvester termites, grasshoppers and moths constituted about 2% of the prey mass consumed.
Altogether 54 prey species of the black-footed cat were identified, with the gerbil mouse (&quot;Malacothrix typica&quot;) being among its most important prey. Its average prey weighs with small mammals constituting the most important prey class, followed by larger mammals weighing more than and small birds.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
In captivity, male black-footed cats become sexually mature at the age of nine months, and females at the age of seven months. Their oestrus lasts around 36 hours, and gestation lasts 63 to 68 days. The female gives birth to up to two litters per year during the Southern Hemisphere summer between October and March. The litter size is usually one or two kittens, in rare cases also four kittens.

Wild female black-footed cats observed in the wild were receptive to mating for only five to ten hours, requiring males to locate them quickly. Males fight for access to the female. Copulation occurs nearly every twenty to fifty minutes.

Kittens weigh at birth; they are born blind and relatively helpless, although they are able to crawl after just a few hours. Their eyes open at three to ten days, and their deciduous teeth break through at the age of two to three weeks. Within one month, they take solid food, and are weaned at the age of two months. Their permanent teeth erupt at the age of 148 to 158 days.

Captive females were observed trying to shift their kittens to a new hiding place every six to ten days after a week of their birth, much more frequently than other small cats. They are able to walk within two weeks and start climbing at three weeks. In the wild, kittens are born in South African springhare burrows or hollow termite mounds. From the age of four days onward, the mother leaves her kittens alone for up to 10 hours during nights. At the age of six weeks, they can move fast and frequently leave the den. Kittens and independent subadults are at the risk of falling prey to other carnivores such as black-backed jackal (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;), caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;) and nocturnal raptors. They become independent after three to four months and tend to stay within their mother&#x27;s home range. Captive black-footed cats can live for up to 15 years and three months.

===Diseases===
Both captive and free-ranging black-footed cats exhibit a high prevalence of AA amyloidosis, which causes chronic inflammatory processes and usually culminates in kidney failure and death. Wild black-footed cats are susceptible to transmission of infectious diseases from domestic dogs and cats.

== Threats ==
Known threats include methods of indiscriminate predator control, such as bait poisoning and steel-jaw traps, habitat destruction from overgrazing, declining South African springhare populations, intraguild predation, diseases, and unsuitable farming practices. Several black-footed cats have been killed by herding dogs. The majority of protected areas may be too small to adequately conserve viable sub-populations.

== Conservation ==
The black-footed cat is listed on CITES Appendix I and is protected throughout most of its range including Botswana and South Africa, where hunting is illegal.

=== Field research ===
The Black-footed Cat Working Group carries out a research project at Benfontein Nature Reserve and Nuwejaarsfontein Farm near Kimberley, Northern Cape. In November 2012, this project was extended to Biesiesfontein Farm located in the Victoria West area. Between 1992 and 2018, 65 black-footed cats were radio-collared and followed for extended periods to improve the understanding about their social organisation, sizes and use of their home ranges, hunting behaviour and composition of their diet.
Camera traps are used to monitor the behaviour of radio-collared black-footed cats and their interaction with aardwolves (&quot;Proteles cristatus&quot;).

=== In captivity ===
The Wuppertal Zoo acquired black-footed cats in 1957, and succeeded in breeding them in 1963. In 1993, the European Endangered Species Programme was formed to coordinate which animals are best suited for pairing to maintain genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding. The &quot;International Studbook for the Black-footed Cat&quot; was kept in the Wuppertal Zoo in Germany. , detailed records existed for a total of 726 captive cats since 1964; worldwide, 74 individuals were kept in 23 institutions in Germany, United Arab Emirates, US, UK, and South Africa.

Several zoos reported breeding successes, including Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, Fresno Chaffee Zoo, Brookfield Zoo, and Philadelphia Zoo.

The Audubon Nature Institute&#x27;s Center for Research of Endangered Species is working on advanced genetics involving cats. In February 2011, a female kept there gave birth to two male kittens – the first black-footed cats to be born as a result of fertilization using frozen and thawed sperm and frozen and thawed embryos. In 2003, the sperm was collected from a male and then frozen. It was used to fertilize an egg in 2005, creating embryos that were thawed and transferred to a surrogate female in December 2010. The female carried the embryos to term and gave birth to two kittens. The same center reported that on 6 February 2012, a female black-footed cat kitten, Crystal, was born to a domestic cat surrogate after interspecies embryo transfer.

<text>Andrew Michael Spence (born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American economist and Nobel laureate.

Spence is the William R. Berkley Professor in Economics and Business at the Stern School of Business at New York University, and the Philip H. Knight Professor of Management, Emeritus, and Dean, Emeritus, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Together with George A. Akerlof and Joseph E. Stiglitz, Spence is a co-recipient of the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, &quot;for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information.&quot;

==Career==
Spence is noted for his job-market signaling model, which inspired research into this branch of contract theory. In this model, employees signal their respective skills to employers by acquiring a certain degree of education, which is costly to them. Employers will pay higher wages to more educated employees, because they know that the proportion of employees with high abilities is higher among the educated ones, as it is less costly for them to acquire education than it is for employees with low abilities. For the model to work, it is not even necessary for education to have any intrinsic value if it can convey information about the sender (employee) to the recipient (employer) and if the signal is costly.

Spence received his middle and high school education at the University of Toronto Schools of the University of Toronto. He later came back to Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto to serve as a member of the Rotman Dean’s Advisory Board.

Spence attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in philosophy in 1966, completing a senior thesis titled &quot;Freedom and Determinism&quot;. Spence then studied at Magdalen College, University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and received a B.A./M.A. in mathematics in 1968. Spence then began graduate studies in economics at Harvard University with the support of a Danforth Graduate Fellowship in the fall of 1968. He received a Ph.D. in economics in 1972, completing a dissertation titled &quot;Market signalling&quot; under the supervision of Kenneth Arrow and Thomas C. Schelling. Spence was awarded the David A. Wells Prize for outstanding doctoral dissertation in 1972.

He stepped down as Dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1999 and joined Oak Hill Capital Partners. He is the Chairman of the Commission on Growth and Development, and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Spence joined the faculty of New York University&#x27;s Stern School of Business on September 1, 2010. He joined the faculty of SDA Bocconi School of Management in Italy in July 2011.

He is a senior fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution and the Philip H. Knight Professor Emeritus of Management in the Graduate School of Business. Spence is also a Commissioner for the Global Commission on Internet Governance. Additionally, Spence is also a member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council.

He is the author of three books and 50 articles, and has also been a consistent contributor to &quot;Project Syndicate&quot;, an international newspaper syndicate, since 2008. Among his beliefs are that high-frequency trading should be banned.

Spence had both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer in a graduate-level economics class at Harvard. In a 1999 &quot;Fortune&quot; interview, however, Gates and Ballmer admitted not attending class and passing only after cramming for four days before the final.

<text>Null fill in radio engineering is used in radio antenna systems which are located on mountains or tall towers, to prevent too much of the signal from overshooting the nearest part of intended coverage area. Phasing is used between antenna elements to take power away from the main lobe and electrically direct more of it at a more downward angle in the vertical plane. This requires a phased array. Changing the relative power supplied to each element also changes the radiation pattern in this manner, and often both methods are used in combination.

<text>Texas Tech University (Texas Tech, Tech, or TTU) is a public research university in Lubbock, Texas, United States. Established on February 10, 1923, and called Texas Technological College until 1969, it is the flagship institution of the five-institution Texas Tech University System. As of fall 2024, the university enrolled 40,969 students, making it the sixth-largest university in Texas. Over 25% of its undergraduate student population identifies as Hispanic, so the university has been designated a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI).

The university offers degrees in more than 150 courses of study through 13 colleges and hosts 55 research centers and institutes. Texas Tech University has awarded nearly 325,000 degrees since 1927, including over 75,000 graduate and professional degrees. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Research projects in the areas of pulsed power, strengthening national security, grid computing, resilience and adaptability, energy, advancing One Health, rural and urban development, and atmospheric sciences are among the most prominent at the university. The Institute for Critical Infrastructure Security is a world-class collaborative research institute that works to solve the continuous problem of cyber-security interruptions in critical infrastructure systems. The Institute for One Health Innovation brings together experts from human, animal and environmental health to better understand how each interacts with the others, and thereby develop a more holistic approach to health for all.

The Texas Tech Red Raiders are charter members of the Big 12 Conference and compete in Division I for all varsity sports. The Red Raiders football team has made 41 bowl appearances, which is tied for 20th most of any university. The Lady Raiders basketball team won the 1993 NCAA Division I Tournament.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===

The call to open a college in West Texas began shortly after settlers arrived in the area in the 1880s. In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A&amp;M to be in Abilene. However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee&#x27;s choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff&#x27;s veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend West Texas secede from the state.

In 1923, the legislature decided, rather than a branch campus, a new university would better serve the region&#x27;s needs under legislation co-authored by State Senator William H. Bledsoe of Lubbock and State Representative Roy Alvin Baldwin of Slaton in southern Lubbock County. On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year, a committee began searching for a site. When the committee&#x27;s members visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for hosting the institution. That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including Floydada, Plainview, Big Spring, and Sweetwater. On November 22, 1923, Paul Whitfield Horn was selected as the university&#x27;s first president.

Construction of the college campus began on November 1, 1924. Ten days later, the cornerstone of the Administration Building was laid in front of 20,000 people. Speakers at the event included Governor Pat Neff; Amon G. Carter; Reverend E. E. Robinson, Colonel Ernest O. Thompson; and Representative Richard M. Chitwood, the chairman of the House Education Committee, who became the first Texas Tech business manager. Chitwood served in the position only fifteen months; he died in November 1926. With an enrollment of 914 students—both men and women—Texas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925. It was originally composed of four schools—Agriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts.

Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps training did not start until 1936. By 1939, the school&#x27;s enrollment had grown to 3,890. Although enrollment declined during World War II, Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its armed forces training detachments. Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943.
=== Expansion and growth ===

By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects. The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to &quot;Texas State University&quot;, feeling the phrase &quot;Technological College&quot; did not define the institution&#x27;s scope. While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the Double T, opposed it. Other names—University of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University, and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technology—were considered, but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964.

A failed move by Governor John Connally to have the school placed into the Texas A&amp;M University System, as well as continued disagreement and heated debate over the school&#x27;s new name, kept the name change from being approved. In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature&#x27;s approval on June 6, and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September. All of the institution&#x27;s schools, except Law, became colleges.

Texas Tech was integrated in the summer of 1961 when its first African-American student, Lucille S. Graves, was admitted. After its initial rejection of African-American students&#x27; enrollment and the threat of a lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit &quot;all qualified applicants regardless of color&quot;. The university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student in 1967, when Danny Hardaway was recruited to play for the Red Raiders football team. In 1970, Hortense W. Dixon became the first African American student to earn a doctorate from the university. In 1972 Emory Grant Davis became the first full-time African American faculty member.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the university invested US$150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded.

On May 29, 1969, the 61st Texas Legislature created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine. The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. TTUHSC, which is now part of the Texas Tech University System, includes Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. It has locations in four Texas cities in addition to the main campus in Lubbock.

In 2011, the combined enrollment in the Texas Tech University System was greater than 42,000 students—a 48% increase since 2000. Chancellor Kent Hance reiterated plans for Texas Tech&#x27;s main campus to reach enrollment of 40,000 students by 2020, with additional 5,000 students at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and 10,000 students at Angelo State University.

=== Recent history ===

In 1996, the Board of Regents of Texas Tech University created the Texas Tech University System. Former State Senator John T. Montford, later of San Antonio, was selected as the first chancellor to lead the combined academic enterprise. Regents Chair Edward Whitacre Jr. stated the move was made due to the institution&#x27;s size and complexity. &quot;It&#x27;s time,&quot; he said, &quot;to take the university into the 21st century&quot;. The Texas Tech University system originally included Texas Tech University and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. On November 6, 2007, the voters of Texas approved an amendment to the Texas Constitution realigning Angelo State University with the Texas Tech University System. Kent Hance, a Texas Tech graduate who had served as United States Representative and as one of the three elected members of the Texas Board which regulates the oil-and-gas industry, assumed the duties of chancellor on December 1, 2006.

To meet the demands of its increased enrollment and expanding research, the university has invested more than $548 million in new construction since 2000. It has also received more than $65.9 million in private donations. In April 2009, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill to increase state funding for seven public universities. Texas Tech University was classified by the state as an &quot;Emerging Research University&quot;, and was among the universities that received additional state funding for advancement toward &quot;Tier 1&quot; status. Three funds—the Research University Development Fund, the Texas Research Incentive Program, and the National Research University Benchmark Fund—provided $500 million in grants and matching funds during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. On September 2, 2009, the university announced it had received private gifts totaling $24.3 million. Of these, $21.5 million are eligible for match under the Texas Research Incentive Program.

In late 2011 and throughout 2012–13, construction began on several new buildings on campus. The construction included a new $20 million Petroleum Engineering and Research building, a new building to house the Rawls College of Business, two new residence halls, a $3.5 million chapel, and extensive remodeling of the building that previously housed the Rawls College of Business. In 2021, construction began on the new $100 million, 125,000-square-foot Academic Sciences Building.

The university system&#x27;s endowment reached $1.043 billion in March 2014, surpassing one billion dollars for the first time.

In 2023, Texas voters approved the creation of a new funding mechanism, the Texas University Fund. Its $3.9 billion endowment was created by combining a one-time grant from the state’s budget surplus with the National Research University Fund, interest income from the Economic Stabilization Fund, and charitable contributions. Four Texas universities, including Texas Tech, initially qualified to receive TUF funds based on their research expenditures and doctoral degrees awarded annually. Texas Tech received approximately $44 million for fiscal year 2024.

== Academics ==

By enrollment, Texas Tech is the sixth-largest university in Texas. Altogether, the university has educated students from all 50 US states and over 100 foreign countries. Enrollment has continued to increase in recent years, and the university achieved Chancellor Kent Hance&#x27;s goal to enroll 40,000 students by 2020. From 1927 through fiscal year 2023, the university awarded 249,780 bachelor&#x27;s, 55,265 master&#x27;s, 10,357 doctoral, and 9,449 law degrees.

As a public university, Texas Tech is subject to Texas House Bill 588, which guarantees Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their graduating class admission to any public Texas university. About half of incoming first-year students finish in the top quarter of their graduating classes.

Texas Tech University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The university offers 150 bachelor&#x27;s, 104 master&#x27;s, and 59 doctoral degree programs. Texas Tech has seven regional campuses in Texas—in Amarillo, the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, El Paso, Fredericksburg, Junction, Marble Falls, and Waco.

Texas Tech also has a satellite campus in Europe, in Seville, Spain, and one in Escazú, San José, Costa Rica. Additional study-abroad programs are offered in various countries, such as Denmark, England, France, and Italy.

The Office of International Affairs provides services for faculty and students, offers international educational and cultural experiences for the school and community, and contributes to the university&#x27;s globalization process and its effort to grow as an international educational and research center. The International Cultural Center provides a continual series of conferences, lectures, art exhibitions, and performances.

=== Colleges and schools ===
Texas Tech has expanded from its original four schools to comprise ten colleges and two schools.

The Whitacre College of Engineering offers 10 engineering programs accredited by ABET. On November 12, 2008, following a $25 million gift from AT&amp;T in honor of alumnus Edward Whitacre Jr., the college was formally renamed the Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering.

The largest academic division on campus, the College of Arts &amp; Sciences offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in a wide range of subjects from philosophy to mathematics. In 2004, the College of Mass Communications and the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts were created from programs organized within the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. The College of Mass Communications changed its name to the College of Media &amp; Communication in 2012 and offers degrees in several areas, including advertising, journalism, digital media and professional communication, and public relations. The College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts was renamed in honor of the contributions by the J.T. &amp; Margaret Talkington Foundation in 2016. Programs offered through Talkington College are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, the National Association of Schools of Music, and the National Association of Schools of Theatre.

Once the Division of Home Economics, the College of Health &amp; Human Sciences now offers degrees in community, family and addiction sciences; apparel design and interior design; health professions; hospitality and retail management; human development and family sciences; nutritional sciences; and personal financial planning. The School of Personal Financial Planning was the first CFP Board-registered Ph.D. program in the nation when it was founded in 2000. It is still consistently ranked among the top programs in the nation. Its students won the Financial Planning Association&#x27;s Financial Planning Challenge in 2024, 2023, 2021, 2020, and 2018.

The Huckabee College of Architecture, founded in 1927, offers programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board.

The Rawls College of Business, which is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, is the university&#x27;s business school. The college offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in business disciplines. From its origin in 1942, the business school was known as the Division of Commerce, until it was renamed the College of Business Administration in 1956. In 2000, following a $25 million gift from alumnus Jerry S. Rawls, the college was formally renamed the Jerry S. Rawls College of Business.

In 1967, both the College of Education and the Texas Tech University School of Law were founded. The College of Education instructs future teachers and is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.

The School of Law is an American Bar Association-accredited law school on the main campus in Lubbock. The school offers Juris Doctor degrees, which can be earned in conjunction with Master of Business Administration or Master of Science degrees through the. Rawls College of Business, the Whitacre College of Engineering, or the College of Arts &amp; Sciences

All graduate programs offered at Texas Tech University are overseen by the Graduate School, which was officially established in 1954. The university&#x27;s Honors College allows select students to design a customized curriculum that incorporates a broad range of disciplines, and offers students the opportunity for early admission into Texas Tech University&#x27;s medical and law schools.

In September 2008, Texas Tech established the College of Outreach and Distance Education, known today as Texas Tech Online. Texas Tech&#x27;s seven in-state satellite campuses are under the auspices of the college. Additionally, it oversees the Texas Tech University Independent School District and its signature program, Texas Tech K-12.

The Texas Tech University System also operates a medical school, the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC). It offers schools of biomedical sciences, health professions, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and population and public health. While it is a discrete entity, separate from Texas Tech University, it offers joint degrees (such as MD/MBA) through coordination with the university. Further, the Health Sciences Center campus is adjacent to the university&#x27;s main campus in Lubbock. In addition to its Lubbock campus, TTUHSC has campuses in Abilene, Amarillo, El Paso, Dallas, and Odessa.

=== Research ===
The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and hosts 55 research centers and institutes. According to the National Science Foundation, Texas Tech had $226.7 million in research development funding and expenditures in 2022, ranking Texas Tech 120th in the nation.

The National Wind Institute (formerly the Wind Science and Engineering Research Center or WISE) was established following the May 11, 1970, Lubbock Tornado that caused 26 fatalities and over $1.06 billion (2024 dollars) in damage in Lubbock. The National Wind Institute, which includes of indoor laboratory space, is focused on research, education, and information outreach. The interdisciplinary research program studies methods to exploit the beneficial qualities of wind and to mitigate its detrimental effects. The institute offers education in wind science and engineering to develop professionals who are experts in creating designs that deal effectively with problems caused by high winds. The institute established the nation&#x27;s first Ph.D. program in Wind Science and Engineering in 2003. National Wind Institute researchers contributed significantly to the development of the Enhanced Fujita Scale for rating the strength of tornadoes.
Texas Tech has made many contributions to NASA and the spaceflight industry. The university&#x27;s Charles A. Bassett II Pulse Laboratory honors engineering alumnus and Gemini-era astronaut Charles A. Bassett II. In total, Texas Tech has helped to produce five astronauts including Bassett, Paul Lockhart, and Rick Husband; Husband was commander of STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Texas Tech has partnered with NASA to perfect methods for growing fresh vegetables in space and to determine the most efficient ways to recycle wastewater. In 2018, faculty member Seiichi Nagihara and his team analyzed data from the 1970s lunar missions and found that incremental changes in the moon’s surface temperature during the 1970s were caused by the astronauts themselves. As they disturbed the light-colored soil on the moon, they exposed the darker soil underneath, which absorbed more sunlight. The university’s latest contribution is designed to help future astronauts avoid such mistakes. Nagihara’s Lunar Instrumentation for Subsurface Thermal Exploration with Rapidity, or LISTER, is a tool that can drill into the moon’s surface and measure underground temperatures. In 2019, it was selected for one of the upcoming Artemis missions.

Building upon existing areas of strength, Texas Tech is now focusing its research enterprise in several key areas: energy, One Health, strengthening national security, systems resilience and adaptability, and rural and urban development.

From 2022-2024, efforts related to Texas Tech&#x27;s pulsed power electronics laboratory received $65 million in federal funding. Projects include research on semiconductors, high power microwaves, cyber-physical security, directed energy and high-performance computing.

Texas Tech&#x27;s Davis College of Agricultural Sciences &amp; Natural Resources has received state and federal grants for research projects including the fiber properties of cotton, the antibacterial properties of cotton fabric, and the development of chemical-warfare protective fabrics. The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.

== Campus ==


The Lubbock campus is home to the main academic university, law school, and medical school (Health Sciences Center). It is one of two institutions (the other being UT Austin) in Texas to have a graduate school, law school, and medical school on its main campus. The campus has Spanish Renaissance architecture. Many buildings borrow architectural elements from those found at University de Alcalá in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, and Mission San José in San Antonio. A large section of the campus built between 1924 and 1951 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Texas Technological College Historic District. This area is roughly bounded by 6th Street on the north, University Avenue on the east, 19th Street on the south, and Flint Street on the west.

In 1998, the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System created the Texas Tech University Public Art Collection to enliven the campus environment and extend the university&#x27;s educational mission. It is funded by using one percent of the estimated total cost of each new building on campus. The collection features pieces from artists such as Tom Otterness and Glenna Goodacre. In 2020, &quot;Fodor&#x27;s Travel&quot; ranked the Public Art Collection among the ten best outdoor museums in the United States.

The university also hosts the Museum of Texas Tech University, which was founded in 1929 and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The museum is home to over eight million objects and specimens and houses the Moody Planetarium, art galleries, a sculpture court, and a natural science research laboratory. It also operates the Val Verde County research site and the Lubbock Lake Landmark, an archaeological site and natural history preserve in the city of Lubbock. The site has evidence of 12,000 years of use by ancient cultures on the Llano Estacado (Southern High Plains), and allows visitors to watch active archaeological digs. Visiting scientists and tourists may also participate in the discovery process. Lubbock Lake Landmark is a National Historic Landmark, which lists it on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a designated State Archaeological Landmark. Texas Tech is also the location of the Southwest Collection historical archive and the sponsoring institution of the West Texas Historical Association.
Located on the northern edge of the campus is the National Ranching Heritage Center, a museum of ranching history. The site spans and is home to 38 historic structures that have been restored to their original condition. Structures represented at the center include a linecamp, a dugout, a bunkhouse, a blacksmith shop, a cowchip house, a schoolhouse, corrals, shipping pens, windmills, chuckwagons, and a coal-burning locomotive.

The university maintains a number of libraries, some general-purpose and some dedicated to specific topics such as architecture and law. Among the most notable of these are the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library and The Vietnam Center and Sam Johnson Vietnam Archive, the nation&#x27;s largest and most comprehensive collection of information on the Vietnam War. On August 17, 2007, the Vietnam Center and Archive became the first US institution to sign a formalized exchange agreement with the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam. This opened the door for a two-way exchange between the entities. In 2023, Texas Tech returned to the families of Vietnamese soldiers killed in battle their personal documents, which had been found on the battlefield by American soldiers.
== Student life ==
There are over 600 student clubs and organizations at Texas Tech. Many students participate in Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life. Texas Tech Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life includes 12 Panhellenic societies and 23 InterFraternity Council chapters, as well as 4 groups in the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and 12 in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC). The Student Union Building, located centrally on campus, is the hub of daily student activity. It houses restaurants, coffee shops, a book store, meeting rooms, lecture halls, movie rooms, and study areas, as well as the offices and meeting rooms of several student organizations and the Student Government Association. Directly next to the Student Union Building is the School of Music, home of the Texas Tech Goin&#x27; Band from Raiderland. The 450-member band, which was awarded the Sudler Trophy in 1999, performs at all home football games and other events.

Most students live on campus for at least a portion of their academic careers. Students with fewer than 30 hours of academic credit are required to live in university housing unless they receive an exemption. Specific residence halls and communities exist for graduate students, athletes, and various specific interests and academic disciplines. Every resident on campus is a member of the Texas Tech Residence Hall Association, which provides various on-campus programming and leadership opportunities. RHA is led by an Executive Board and Senate with student representatives from each residence hall. The organization is also a member of the South West Affiliate of College and Universities Residence Halls.
International honor societies Phi Beta Kappa (liberal arts and sciences), Beta Gamma Sigma (business), and Tau Beta Pi (engineering) have chapters at the university. Professional, service, and social fraternities and sororities on campus include Alpha Phi Omega (service), Alpha Kappa Psi (business), Delta Sigma Pi (business), Alpha Omega Epsilon (engineering), Phi Alpha Delta (law), Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (music), Kappa Kappa Psi (band), and Tau Beta Sigma (band). Professional development and research organizations hosted by the university include the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program, the Center for the Integration of Science Education and Research, the Society of Engineering Technologists, Student Bar Association, and the Texas Tech Forensic Union. Spirit organizations representing Texas Tech include the High Riders, Saddle Tramps, and the Sabre Flight Drill Team.

The university maintains KTXT-FM 88.1, a student-operated radio station focusing on alternative music. National Public Radio station KTTZ-FM 89.1, which features classical music and news, is also found on campus. Additionally, the university owns and operates Public Broadcasting Service television station KTTZ-TV. Students run a newspaper, &quot;The Daily Toreador&quot;, until 2005 known as &quot;The University Daily&quot;. Until 2020, the university also produced a yearbook, &quot;La Ventana&quot;.
== Athletics ==

Texas Tech&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Red Raiders with the exception of the women&#x27;s basketball team, which is known as the Lady Raiders. Texas Tech competes in NCAA Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. From 1932 until 1956, the university belonged to the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After being rejected eight times over more than 20 years, the Southwest Conference admitted Texas Tech on May 12, 1956. When the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1995, Texas Tech, along with the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&amp;M University, and Baylor University, merged with schools from the former Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12. Athletic Director Kirby Hocutt is a member of the College Football Playoff committee. Texas Tech varsity teams have won three NCAA national titles: the men&#x27;s indoor track and field championship in 2024, the men&#x27;s outdoor track and field championship in 2019, and the Lady Raiders basketball team won the school&#x27;s first ever title in 1993.
The Texas Tech Lady Raiders, led by player Sheryl Swoopes and head coach Marsha Sharp, won the 1993 NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship. The men&#x27;s basketball team has made 14 appearances in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Tournament. Bob Knight served as men&#x27;s basketball coach from the beginning of the 2001 season until February 4, 2008. On January 1, 2007, he set the record for most coaching victories in men&#x27;s NCAA Division I basketball history when the Red Raiders defeated the New Mexico Lobos, 70–68. Upon Knight&#x27;s retirement, his son Pat Knight became the head coach of the team for several seasons until Billy Gillispie replaced him. In 2013, Tubby Smith replaced Gillispie. After Tubby Smith&#x27;s departure in 2016, Chris Beard, an assistant under Bob Knight, came aboard. Beard quickly achieved national attention, leading the team to its first Elite Eight appearance in just his second season. He led the Red Raiders to the Final Four in his third year, losing in the National Championship game to Virginia. The Red Raiders current head coach is Grant McCasland.

Since 1999, Texas Tech has played home basketball games at United Supermarkets Arena, a 15,020-seat multipurpose facility which cost $ in dollars to build. In addition to serving as home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, the Red Raider volleyball team uses the arena. Texas Tech students broke the Big 12 Conference record for student attendance at the United Supermarkets Arena during a February 25, 2014 loss to Kansas State. The record of 6,086 students fell less than 2,000 short of the national record.

The Red Raiders football team, is a member of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A) and is coached by Joey McGuire. Throughout the 2000s, then head coach Mike Leach lead the team to national prominence. The Red Raiders have made 41 bowl appearances, which is 20th most of any university. From 1932 to 1956, as members of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Red Raiders won eight conference championships and one co-championship, the most held by a Border Conference member. After joining the Southwest Conference, the Red Raiders added conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994.
Jones AT&amp;T Stadium is home to the Red Raiders football team. The stadium, named for Clifford B. and Audrey Jones, opened in 1947 and has a capacity of 60,229. In 2000, the stadium was renamed Jones SBC Stadium after SBC Communications made a $30 million contribution to the university. Following SBC Communications&#x27; acquisition of AT&amp;T Corporation in 2006 and its subsequent adoption of the AT&amp;T name, the stadium was renamed Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. The stadium&#x27;s original seating capacity was 27,000, but it was expanded in 1959, 1972, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2013, and 2024. As of fall 2024, its total capacity is 60,229.

On August 7, 2008, the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System announced a $25 million expansion project. The expansion added a Spanish Renaissance-themed façade to the stadium&#x27;s east side. In addition to the improvements to the facility&#x27;s exterior, the expansion added 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suites. Texas Tech allocated $19 million to the expansion and added another $6 million through fund-raising initiatives. On November 20, 2008, university officials announced the project&#x27;s fundraising goal had been exceeded. The expansion&#x27; groundbreaking ceremonies took place on November 29, 2008, and construction was completed before the 2009 football season.

In January 2013, construction added another 368 seats in the north endzone and two observation decks. The $11 million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north end zone concourse that connects the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157 feet of ribbon board will be added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear feet in the northeast and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal feet in the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season.

The south end zone project, completed in 2024, marked the largest athletic facility investment in the university’s history. It upgraded the stands behind the south end zone and created more than 300,000 square feet for player development and fan amenities.

The Red Raiders baseball team played its first game in 1925. The team has two conference championships, two conference tournament championships, and has made nine NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament appearances. Larry Hays coached the team from 1987 to 2008 and compiled a .639 winning percentage. Following Hays&#x27; retirement on June 2, 2008, Assistant Coach Dan Spencer was promoted to head coach. Dan Spencer was replaced by Tim Tadlock following the 2012 season and made its first appearance in the College World Series in 2013. At least 20 former Red Raiders baseball players have gone on to play in the Major Leagues. Alumnus Josh Jung won the 2023 World Series as a member of the Texas Rangers. The Texas Tech team plays its home games at Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park. The field, renovated in 2012 and on the main campus in Lubbock, has a seating capacity of 5,050.

Texas Tech&#x27;s track and field teams have been led by head coach Wes Kittley since 2000. Under Kittley, the men&#x27;s team won the 2019 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships and the 2024 NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships. It has produced seven Olympic medalists, 16 national champions, over 200 All-Americans and 119 Big 12 Champions, including Michael Mathieu, Sally Kipyego, Kennedy Kithuka, Shereefa Lloyd, Gil Roberts and others.

In addition to varsity sports, the university&#x27;s Sport Clubs Federation offers 30 recreational and competitive sport clubs, including polo, rugby union, lacrosse, fencing, and soccer. 
=== Mascots ===
The Masked Rider is Texas Tech University&#x27;s oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot; In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university&#x27;s Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25% larger than life.

Today, the Masked Rider, with guns up, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like those worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech.

Texas Tech&#x27;s other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider&#x27;s horse, an alternative mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Although the Masked Rider&#x27;s identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red&#x27;s student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.
== Traditions ==
=== Carol of Lights ===

The Carol of Lights is an annual event, sponsored by the Residence Halls Association, to celebrate the holiday season. The event begins with a carillon concert, from the 46 bells in the west tower of the Administration Building followed a torch-light processional by the Saddle Tramps and High Riders spirit organizations. The Texas Tech Trombone Choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; in the Science Quadrangle. This is followed by the lighting ceremony, where 13 buildings within the Texas Technological College Historic District are illuminated with the over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights. The lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students come back from the holiday break.

In 1959, Texas Tech University Board of Directors member Harold Hinn planned and provided the funding to cover the Science Quadrangle and Administration Building with 5,000 lights. However, students were away on Christmas break and did not see the display. The following year, the Residence Hall Association sponsored the event under the name &quot;Christmas Sing&quot;. In 1961, the event was renamed Carol of Lights and the display increased to 16,000 lights. The tradition has since grown to include decorations like the 38-foot lighted Christmas tree, 3,000 luminaries lining the sidewalks of Memorial Circle, and a 21-foot fresh pine wreath hung on the Physics/Geosciences building built by Women&#x27;s Service Organization.

=== Double T ===
The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech&#x27;s first football coach, E. Y. Freeland, was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players. The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise, but incorporates three-dimensional beveling effects coupled with white trim.

To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. By tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.

=== Will Rogers and Soapsuds ===
One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of Will Rogers on his horse Soapsuds. The statue, entitled &quot;Riding Into the Sunset&quot;, has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers&#x27; longtime friend Amon G. Carter. Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue, and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of West Texas. The statue, estimated to cost $25,000 ($327,450 in 2024 dollars) when it was dedicated, stands and weighs . The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: &quot;Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, &#x27;Soapsuds&#x27;, riding into the Western sunset.&quot;

The statue continues to be a part of school tradition. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap it with red crêpe paper, a tradition dating back to 1969 and a loss to Texas A&amp;M after which the statue was found covered in maroon paint in an apparent prank. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crêpe paper.

According to one taught to students during freshman orientation, the statue was originally intended to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds&#x27; posterior end to face due east, a dubious greeting to visitors entering by the main eastern campus entrance where the statue is placed. The horse&#x27;s rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. The legend holds that this problem was solved by Tech&#x27;s Civil Engineering department, who calculated that a 23° turn of Soapsuds&#x27; head to the north would line up Soapsuds&#x27; rear end directly toward College Station, Texas, home of the rival Texas A&amp;M Aggies. Modern surveys and satellite imagery have determined the statue&#x27;s posterior end actually points roughly equidistantly between College Station and Austin, home of another rival team, the Texas Longhorns.

=== Texas Tech ring ===
While the class ring had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century, various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university&#x27;s graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school&#x27;s full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.

One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.

== Notable alumni ==
The Texas Tech Alumni Association, with over 28,000 members, operates 100 chapters in cities throughout the United States and the world.

<text>Devils Tower (also known as Bear Lodge) is a butte, possibly laccolithic, composed of igneous rock in the Bear Lodge Ranger District of the Black Hills, near Hulett and Sundance in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, above the Belle Fourche River. It rises above the Belle Fourche River, standing from summit to base. The summit is above sea level.

Devils Tower National Monument was the first United States national monument, established on September 24, 1906, by President Theodore Roosevelt. The monument&#x27;s boundary encloses an area of .

==Name==
Indigenous names for the monolith include &quot;Bear&#x27;s House&quot; or &quot;Bear&#x27;s Lodge&quot; (or &quot;Bear&#x27;s Tipi&quot;, &quot;Home of the Bear&quot;, &quot;Bear&#x27;s Lair&quot;); Cheyenne, , (&quot;Home of Bears&quot;), &quot;Aloft on a Rock&quot; (Kiowa), &quot;Tree Rock&quot;, &quot;Great Gray Horn&quot;, and &quot;Brown Buffalo Horn&quot; ().

The name &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tower&quot; originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, when his interpreter reportedly misinterpreted a native name to mean &quot;Bad God&#x27;s Tower&quot;. All information signs in that area use the name &quot;Devils Tower&quot;, following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is omitted.

In 2005, a proposal to recognize several indigenous ties through the additional designation of the monolith as &quot;Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark&quot; were opposed by United States Representative Barbara Cubin, arguing that a &quot;name change will harm the tourist trade and bring economic hardship to area communities&quot;. In November 2014, Arvol Looking Horse proposed renaming the geographical feature &quot;Bear Lodge&quot; and submitted the request to the United States Board on Geographic Names. A second proposal was submitted to request that the U.S. acknowledge what it described as the &quot;offensive&quot; mistake in keeping the current name and to rename the monument and sacred site into &quot;Bear Lodge National Historic Landmark&quot;. The formal public comment period ended in fall 2015. Local state senator Ogden Driskill opposed the change. The name was not changed.

==Geology==


The landscape surrounding Devils Tower is composed mostly of sedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks visible in Devils Tower National Monument were laid down in a shallow sea during the Triassic. This dark red sandstone and maroon siltstone, interbedded with shale, can be seen along the Belle Fourche River. Oxidation of iron minerals causes the redness of the rocks. This rock layer is known as the Spearfish Formation. Above the Spearfish Formation is a thin band of white gypsum, called the Gypsum Springs Formation, Jurassic in age. Overlying this formation is the Sundance Formation. During the Paleocene Epoch, 56 to 66 million years ago, the Rocky Mountains and the Black Hills were uplifted. Magma rose through the crust, intruding into the existing sedimentary rock layers.

Geologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in the late 19th century and came to the conclusion that it was formed by an igneous intrusion. In 1907, geologists Nelson Horatio Darton and C.C. O&#x27;Harra (of the South Dakota School of Mines) theorized that Devils Tower must be an eroded remnant of a laccolith.

The igneous material that forms the Tower is a phonolite porphyry intruded about 40.5 million years ago, a light to dark-gray or greenish-gray igneous rock with conspicuous crystals of white feldspar. As the magma cooled, hexagonal columns formed (though sometimes 4-, 5-, and 7-sided columns were possible), up to wide and tall.

As rain and snow continue to erode the sedimentary rocks surrounding the Tower&#x27;s base, more of Devils Tower will be exposed. Nonetheless, the exposed portions of the Tower still experience certain amounts of erosion. Cracks along the columns are subject to water and ice erosion. Portions, or even entire columns, of rock at Devils Tower are continually breaking off and falling. Piles of broken columns, boulders, small rocks, and stones, called scree, lie at the base of the tower, indicating that it was once wider than it is today.

The geologically related Missouri Buttes are located northwest of Devils Tower.

==Native American cultural beliefs==
Devils Tower inspired many geomyths.

According to the traditional beliefs of Native American peoples, the Kiowa and Lakota, a group of girls went out to play and were spotted by several giant bears, who began to chase them. In an effort to escape the bears, the girls climbed atop a rock, fell to their knees, and prayed to the Great Spirit to save them. Hearing their prayers, the Great Spirit made the rock rise from the ground towards the heavens so that the bears could not reach the girls. The bears, in an effort to climb the rock, left deep claw marks in the sides, which had become too steep to climb. Those are the marks which appear today on the sides of Devils Tower. When the girls reached the sky, they were turned into the stars of the Pleiades.

Another version tells that two Sioux boys wandered far from their village when Mato the bear, a huge creature that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato tried to get up from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor center at Devils Tower.

In a Cheyenne version of the story, the giant bear pursues the girls and kills most of them. Two sisters escape back to their home with the bear still tracking them. They tell two boys that the bear can only be killed with an arrow shot through the underside of its foot. The boys have the sisters lead the bear to Devils Tower and trick it into thinking they have climbed the rock. The boys attempt to shoot the bear through the foot while it repeatedly attempts to climb up and slides back down leaving more claw marks each time. The bear was finally scared off when an arrow came very close to its left foot. This last arrow continued to go up and never came down.

Wooden Leg, a Northern Cheyenne, related another legend told to him by an old man as they were traveling together past the Devils Tower around 1866–1868. An Indigenous man decided to sleep at the base of Bear Lodge next to a buffalo head. In the morning he found that both he and the buffalo head had been transported to the top of the rock by the Great Medicine with no way down. He spent another day and night on the rock with no food or water. After he had prayed all day and then gone to sleep, he awoke to find that the Great Medicine had brought him back down to the ground, but left the buffalo head at the top near the edge. Wooden Leg maintained that the buffalo head was clearly visible through the old man&#x27;s spyglass. At the time, the tower had never been climbed and a buffalo head at the top was otherwise inexplicable.

The buffalo head gives this story special significance for the Northern Cheyenne. All the Cheyenne maintained in their camps a sacred teepee to the Great Medicine containing the tribal sacred objects. In the case of the Northern Cheyenne, the sacred object was a buffalo head.

N. Scott Momaday (Kiowa) was given the name Tsoai-talee (Rock Tree Boy) by Pohd-lohk, a Kiowa elder, linking the child to the Devils Tower bear myth. To reinforce this mythic connection, his parents took him there. Momaday incorporated the bear myth as unifying subtext into his 1989 novel &quot;The Ancient Child&quot;.

==U.S. history==
Fur trappers may have visited Devils Tower, but they left no written evidence of having done so. The first documented non-Indigenous visitors were members of Captain William F. Raynolds&#x27;s 1859 expedition to Yellowstone. Sixteen years later, Colonel Richard I. Dodge escorted an Office of Indian Affairs scientific survey party to the massive rock formation and coined the name Devils Tower. Recognizing its unique characteristics, the United States Congress designated the area a U.S. forest reserve in 1892 and in 1906 Devils Tower became the nation&#x27;s first National monument.

==Climbing==


As of 1994, climbing Devils Tower had increased in popularity. About 1.3% of the monument&#x27;s 400,000 annual visitors climbed Devils Tower, mostly using traditional climbing techniques. The first known ascent of Devils Tower by any method occurred on July 4, 1893, and is credited to William Rogers and Willard Ripley, local ranchers in the area. They completed this first ascent after constructing a ladder of wooden pegs driven into cracks in the rock face. A few of these wooden pegs are still intact and are visible on the tower when hiking along the Tower Trail at Devils Tower National Monument. Over the following 30 years, many climbs were made using this method before the ladder fell into disrepair.

The first ascent using modern climbing techniques was made by Fritz Wiessner with William P. House and Lawrence Coveney in 1937. Wiessner led almost the entire climb free, placing only a single piece of fixed gear, a piton, which he later regretted, deeming it unnecessary.

In 1941 George Hopkins parachuted onto Devils Tower, without permission, as a publicity stunt resulting from a bet. He had intended to descend by a rope dropped to him after successfully landing on the butte, but the package containing the rope, a sledge hammer and a car axle to be driven into the rock as an anchor point slid over the edge. As the weather deteriorated, a second attempt was made to drop equipment, but Hopkins deemed it unusable after the rope became snarled and frozen due to the rain and wind. Hopkins was stranded for six days, exposed to cold, rain and winds before a mountain rescue team led by Jack Durrance, who had successfully climbed Devils Tower in 1938, finally reached him and brought him down. His entrapment and rescue was widely covered by the media of the time.

Today, hundreds of climbers scale the sheer rock walls of Devils Tower each summer. The most common route is the Durrance Route, which was the second free route established in 1938. There are many established and documented climbing routes covering every side of the tower, ascending the various vertical cracks and columns of the rock. The difficulty of these routes range from relatively easy to some of the most challenging in the world. All climbers are required to register with a park ranger before and after attempting a climb. No overnight camping at the summit is allowed; climbers return to base on the same day they ascend.

The Tower is sacred to several Plains tribes, including the Lakota, Cheyenne and Kiowa. Because of this, many Native American leaders objected to climbers ascending the monument, considering this to be a desecration. The climbers argued that they had a right to climb the Tower, since it is on federal land. A compromise was eventually reached with a voluntary climbing ban during the month of June when the tribes are conducting ceremonies around the monument. Climbers are asked, but not required, to stay off the Tower in June. According to the PBS documentary &quot;In the Light of Reverence&quot;, approximately 85% of climbers honor the ban and voluntarily choose not to climb the Tower during the month of June. However, several climbers along with the Mountain States Legal Foundation sued the Park Service, claiming an inappropriate government entanglement with religion.

=== Incidents ===
Seven people have lost their lives climbing Devils Tower in the park&#x27;s 118 year history. Rescues of stranded and under-equipped climbers on the formation are common. The most recent fatality was in September 2024, when a climber fell to his death while descending, leaving his climbing partner stranded without a rope on the face of the tower until help arrived.
==Wildlife==

Devils Tower National Monument protects many species of wildlife, such as white-tailed deer, prairie dogs, and bald eagles.

==In popular culture==

* The 1977 movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; used the formation as a plot element and as the location of its climactic scenes. The film&#x27;s popularity resulted in a large increase in visitors and climbers to the monument.

<doc id="272987" wikidata="Q217384" url="?curid=272987" title="Ali Karimi">
<text>Mohammad Ali Karimi ( ; born 8 November 1978) is an Iranian football coach and former professional footballer. During his professional football career, he has played as a playmaker in the Iran Pro League, UAE Pro League, Qatar Stars League and Bundesliga. Karimi has scored 38 goals in 127 matches for the Iran national team. In 2004, he was recognized as the best scorer of the AFC Asian Cup and received the Asian Footballer of the Year award in the same year. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2013–14 season and, on 11 April 2014, played the final game of his 18-year career.

Karimi&#x27;s professional career began with Fath Tehran, where he made his first-team debut in 1996, aged 18. He then played three seasons with Persepolis, winning the Iranian league twice and the Hazfi Cup once with the club. In July 2001, Karimi signed a two-year contract with UAE Pro League club Al-Ahli Dubai. While an Al-Ahli player, Karimi won two cup titles, and was the top goalscorer in the 2003–04 season, an impressive feat for a midfielder. After leaving the club in 2005 aged 26, Karimi made a long-awaited move to Europe to play for Bayern Munich. At the club, he had relative success, winning both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal in 2005–06 season. Later in his career, he rejoined former coach Felix Magath and won a second German Cup with Schalke 04. Karimi ended his playing career in Iran with Persepolis and Tractor Sazi, and with the latter won the Hazfi Cup in the final season of his career.

In international football, Karimi made his Iran debut on 13 October 1998 at the age of 19. He made 127 career appearances in total, appearing at five major tournaments, including 1998 Asian Games, 2000, 2004, and 2007 Asian Cups and 2006 FIFA World Cup. Renowned for his on-the-ball skill, dribbling runs and playmaking ability, he was often referred to as the &quot;Asian Maradona&quot; and &quot;The Magician&quot;. In the video introducing Iran&#x27;s national football team in the 2018 World Cup, by FIFA, he was described as &quot;One of the top 2 players of Iran&#x27;s football history&quot;. He is regarded as one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time. In 2017, AFC named Karimi as &quot;one of the icons of Asian football history&quot;.

Karimi is known as one of the most popular athletes in the history of Iran. In April 2015, he was recognized as Iran&#x27;s most popular football player (from 1991 to 2015) in a poll by &quot;Navad&quot; television program.

==Club career==
Karimi started his professional career with second-division side Fath Football Club in 1997 where training was conducted on the streets with a plastic ball.

===Persepolis===
In 1998, Karimi joined Persepolis football club, which won the domestic double in 1999 and the championship again in 2000. He attended a trial with Perugia Calcio, but the transfer was aborted when Perugia deemed the transfer fee too high. There was also reportedly an offer from Spain&#x27;s Atlético Madrid who were willing to pay Karimi £4.3 million in a four-year contract. Still, Karimi opted for United Arab Emirates side Al-Ahli because he wanted to stay close to home.

===Al-Ahli===
Karimi signed with Al Ahli in the United Arab Emirates in 2001 for a reported salary of $1.3 million for two years. In that season, Al-Ahli managed to win its first trophy, when they became the Winners of the President Cup in 2001–02 season.

He scored a league-high 14 goals for Al Ahli in 2004. In June 2020, he was named the best foreign player in the UAE League as well.

===Bayern Munich===
On 3 May 2005, Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich&#x27;s website announced that as its first new player for the 2005–06 season, it signed Karimi with a one-year contract, as the third Iranian player of this team, after Ali Daei (1998–99) and Vahid Hashemian (2004–05). After the friendly match between Iran and Germany in October 2004, Karimi was noticed by the Bayern Munich club. He received the best score in &quot;kicker&quot; magazine after Jens Lehmann.

Karimi entered the field in the second half of the first week of the Bundesliga against Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the second week&#x27;s 5–2 victory against Bayer Leverkusen, he was recognized as the second best player of the match by scoring a goal and providing an assist. Six weeks into the league, Karimi scored his second goal assist in the Bundesliga, setting the stage for a 1–0 win against Eintracht Frankfurt and was recognized as the man of the match. In week 16 of the Bundesliga, he provided his third assist against Kaiserslautern. At the end of the half-season of the Bundesliga, which was accompanied by Bayern&#x27;s 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, Karimi scored again. He was also recognized as Bayern Munich&#x27;s best player by scoring 2.5 points from &quot;kicker&quot; magazine in the 22nd Bundesliga match, which ended with a 1–1 draw against Hannover.

Karimi made his 25th appearance for Bayern on 4 March 2006 against Hamburg, which resulted in an automatic 12-month extension to his one-year contract that expired on 30 June 2007. But Karimi was injured in the same game and missed all Bayern Munich matches until the end of the 2005-2006 season.

He played 3 times in the UEFA Champions League before getting injured, scoring in his first game against Rapid Vienna. By scoring against Rapid Vienna, Karimi became the only Iranian Bayern Munich player to score in the UEFA Champions League. Before the injury, Karimi played in 20 Bundesliga games, two DFB-Pokal games, one DFL-Ligapokal game and three UEFA Champions League games.

Karimi&#x27;s average scores in the Bundesliga and the UEFA Champions League in the 2005–06 season are the best among the three Iranian players in the &quot;kicker&quot; magazine.

Karimi, who was still suffering from the previous season&#x27;s injury, was injured again before the start of the 2006-2007 season and missed the season&#x27;s opening games. By the end of the 2006–07 season, he played 16 games (13 Bundesliga games - two UEFA Champions League games and one DFL-Ligapokal game).

In the 32nd week of the Bundesliga, Karimi became the foundation for Bayern&#x27;s 1–1 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach by sending a goal assist. In week 34 of the Bundesliga, he played his last game for Bayern in a 5–2 win against Mainz and scored for the last time in Bayern Munich. In this competition after Mehmet Scholl; Karimi was recognized as the second-best player of Bayern together with Hasan Salihamidžić by scoring 2.5 from &quot;kicker&quot; magazine.

In two seasons in Bayern Munich, Karimi played 42 games (33 Bundesliga games, 5 UEFA Champions League games, 2 DFB-Pokal games and 2 DFL-Ligapokal games) and became the record holder for the most number of games among the three Iranian players of this team. Karimi ended his career in Bayern Munich by scoring four goals and sending four assists. In 2017, the Transfermarkt website named Karimi among the best players who joined Bayern Munich from 1998 to 2017 as a free agent (a player who is eligible to sign a contract with any team and whose contract has expired with his previous team) and performed well. In this team have been placed.
After Karimi&#x27;s position in support of the 2022 Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, FC Bayern Munich announced on 5 November 2022 that &quot;due to concerns regarding the health condition of Ali Karimi and other Iranian players of Bayern Munich, we have long since been in touch with the German ambassador to Tehran. The club is aware of the current critical situation in Iran and is ready to provide any assistance in this matter&quot;.

=== Qatar SC ===
On 3 July 2007, Karimi announced that he had signed a two-year deal with Qatar Sports Club. Karimi was believed to have signed a contract worth around £3.2 million, with a clause allowing him to return to Europe anytime.

On 13 July 2008, Karimi signed a two-year contract with Al-Sailiya that is said to be worth around £4.7 million.

===Persepolis===

Persepolis&#x27; then chairman, Dariush Mostafavi, reached an agreement with Karimi after a one-hour-long telephone conversation. Persepolis had to pay Al-Sailiyah to release Karimi from his contract. Mostafavi claimed the release fee was around US$310,000. Karimi joined Persepolis on loan, and signed with Persepolis on a one-year contract on 6 September 2008.

Karimi scored his first goal since his return to Persepolis in the Tehran derby. With Esteghlal leading 1–0, Karimi equalized for Persepolis two minutes from time. On 9 October 2008, Karimi scored a hat trick against Abumoslem but could not prevent Persepolis losing 4–3.

However, Karimi&#x27;s contract was not extended, reportedly because of a strained relationship with Persepolis chief executive Abbas Ansarifard. While Ansarifard claimed that the club offered Karimi a contract, but he did not show up, Karimi claimed that Persepolis kept him waiting for four weeks for nothing.

===Steel Azin===

Karimi joined newly promoted Steel Azin on 29 July 2009 on a one-year deal. He was reported to be paid US$400,000 for the season.

After joining Steel Azin, Karimi scored for four consecutive matches at the start of the season. On 14 August 2009, he scored the second goal in Steel Azin&#x27;s 4–3 win over Saba. He scored a brace against Shahin in Steel Azin&#x27;s 2–1 victory. On 4 December 2009, Karimi converted a penalty in the 52nd minute against Pas FC to score his 11th goal of the season. On 6 March 2010, during his team&#x27;s match against Saipa, Karimi was sent off for pushing Majid Ayoubi after Ayoubi had fouled him.

In January 2010, it was reported that Al-Ahli made an offer of US$500,000 to sign Karimi on a loan deal until the end of the 2009–10 season, which Steel Azin rejected.

Karimi was sacked by the club in August 2010 for failing to observe the fast requirement during Ramadan, but was reinstated a few days later after paying a fine. The player maintained that he had not shown disrespect to Islam.

===Schalke 04===
Karimi signed a five-month deal for Schalke on 31 January 2011 upon passing a medical examination. He made his first appearance for the German club on 5 April 2011, coming on for Raúl in the second half in a Champions League quarter-final match against Inter Milan before coming on as a substitute against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the German Bundesliga in his second and final match for Schalke. He won the German Cup for the second time before the end of his contract.

===Persepolis===
On 15 June 2011, Persepolis chairman Habib Kashani announced that they had reached an agreement with Karimi. He played for Persepolis in the 2011–12 Persian Gulf Cup and the 2011–12 Hazfi Cup. This was the second time that Karimi returned to his native club, Persepolis. Karimi was also appointed as Club captain. He made his debut in a match against Malavan and scored his first goal in the season for Persepolis in a match against Shahrdari Tabriz. He extended his contract with Persepolis for another season on 18 June 2012. He was injured a few times during the season and was unable to perform very well and at the end of the season, he announced his retirement from football.

===Tractor Sazi===
On 13 June 2013, Karimi returned from retirement and joined Tractor Sazi, signing a one-year contract with Tractor Sazi. He made his first appearance for Tractor Sazi in Iran Pro League against his former club Persepolis. Karimi scored his first goal in the Iran Pro League in Tractor&#x27;s 4–2 win over Zob Ahan. He helped Tractor to win the season&#x27;s Hazfi Cup, his first title in Iranian football after his return from European Football.

On 20 July 2014, Karimi announced his retirement by publishing a letter on his YouTube account. At the time, Karimi was aged 35 and played professional football for 18 years.

==International career==

Karimi made his debut for Iran national team in October 1998 in a match against Kuwait. That same year, he won the Gold Medal with Iran at the 1998 Asian Games. Karimi scored one of Iran&#x27;s two goals in the final against Kuwait.

He was also one of Iran&#x27;s main players in its 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. In 2001, after losing to Bahrain and drawing with Thailand, Iran finished second in their qualifying group. It had to play a home-and-away play-off with the Republic of Ireland for a spot at the 2002 World Cup. Karimi started as an attacking midfielder in the first game in Dublin and used his acceleration on the break and his dribbling to attack Ireland&#x27;s defense. However, he was also off target on a number of occasions, and Iran lost the match 2–0. They won the return leg 1–0 but missed the final.

At the 2004 Asian Cup, Karimi scored five goals, making him joint top scorer. Iran finished third in the overall tournament, behind Japan and China. In the quarter-final, Karimi scored a hat trick in Iran&#x27;s 4–3 win over South Korea. Karimi was given the prestigious Asian Player of the Year award in 2004, joining his fellow Iranians, Mahdavikia in 2003, Ali Daei in 1999, and Khodadad Azizi in 1996. He also won the 2004 West Asian Football Federation Championship with &quot;Team Melli&quot;.

His performance in the Iran–Germany friendly game for Bam victims held in Azadi Stadium in Tehran in October 2004 was said to be the reason behind Bayern&#x27;s interest in the player.

Coming off a serious ankle injury, Karimi had a poor World Cup finals at Germany 2006. He was unable to exert much influence on proceedings as the Iranians lost 3–1 to Mexico and 2–0 to Portugal. He was substituted in the 65th minute of the Portugal game and kicked the team&#x27;s sports bags by the dugout. Iran&#x27;s then manager Branko Ivankovic said he may drop Karimi in the upcoming game due to disciplinary reasons. Karimi did not play in the 1–1 draw against Angola, but Ivankovic attributed Karimi&#x27;s omission to his refusal to play because of an injury.

Karimi played in the 2007 Asian Cup. In May 2008, Karimi was banned from playing in the national team after he made criticisms towards the IRIFF in the Ardebil training ground, but was reinstated in the national squad after intervention from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

In October 2008, Karimi retired from Team Melli. Ali Daei, the then-Iran football coach, said Karimi would never be called up again. In April 2009, Karimi announced that he was ready again to serve his country if he was to be picked by Team Melli coach, Afshin Ghotbi.

He played in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification for Iran and on 10 June 2009, Karimi scored in a 1–0 victory over U.A.E. to keep Iran&#x27;s 2010 World Cup qualifying hopes alive. On 17 June 2009, he played in Iran&#x27;s 1–1 draw with South Korea, which eliminated Iran from the 2010 World Cup finals. During the match, a number of Iranian players, including Karimi, wore green wristbands, which were interpreted to be a show of support for Iranian opposition leader Hossein Mousavi, who accused the Iranian government of vote rigging the election on 12 June. Western media reported after the game that the players who wore the green wristbands had been banned lifetime to play in national team, while a newspaper in Iran reported that the players concerned had retired. On 24 June 2009, FIFA wrote to Iran&#x27;s football federation asking for clarification on the situation. The Iranian football federation replied that no disciplinary action had been taken against any player. On 3 March 2010, he returned for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Thailand.

He was invited to the national football team again by Carlos Queiroz in 2011 to play in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification and played for the team until his retirement in 2013. Queiroz later announced that Karimi was one of his best players during his coaching times. He is currently the third most-capped player and the third-highest scorer of Iran.

==Style of play==

Karimi&#x27;s most famous football feature is his dribbling skills. In 2003, World Soccer described him as a player with &quot;hypnotic movements and ball work&quot;. In 2004, &quot;kicker&quot; magazine called Karimi the &quot;Maradona of Asia&quot; in a report: &quot;He shoots well with both feet, changes direction very quickly and is a player who makes the opposing team dizzy.&quot;
During the coaching of Branko Ivankovic, when the Iran national team usually played with a 4-2-3-1 formation, Karimi played mostly in the attacking midfield position. FIFA magazine described Karimi as a professional playmaker in the April 2006 issue.

According to FIFA in 2009, Karimi&#x27;s &quot;stunning dribbles&quot; are one of the characteristics of Karimi&#x27;s game, and because of this, he is known as &quot;Magician&quot;.

In a report in 2017, AFC called Karimi the &quot;Maradona of Asia&quot; and introduced him as &quot;one of the Icons of Asian football history&quot;. In the continuation of this report, &quot;magical dribbling skills&quot; and &quot;a knack for the unpredictable&quot; are mentioned as characteristics of Karimi&#x27;s game.

==Managerial career==
On 25 September 2014, Karimi was named as the assistant coach by Carlos Queiroz in the Iranian national team. However, he stepped down from his role shortly before the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. Later in June 2017, he was appointed Naft Tehran manager but has not signed a contract with the team and left the team before the start of the league. However, Karimi resigned with Naft in September. On 1 January 2018, he became the head coach of Sepidrood while Sepidrood was in the bottom two, but he kept this team in the Persian Gulf Pro League.

== Personal life ==
Ali Karimi married Sahar Davari in 1999, at the age of 21. The couple has a daughter named Hima and two sons named Havash and Hirsa.

Karimi publicly supported the Mahsa Amini protests against the government of Iran in late 2022. He posted on Instagram that not even holy water could &quot;wash away this disgrace&quot; of Amini&#x27;s death. In addition to his criticism of the government, he used his platform of 14+ million followers to advise Iranians on how to bypass Internet censorship in their country. Based in Dubai, he was charged &quot;in absentia&quot; by Iran with &quot;encouraging riots&quot;, and his house in Lavasan was seized by the Iranian state.

On 21 December 2022, after Karimi&#x27;s meeting with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, Steinmeier, emphasized his support for the Iranian protesters.

On 18 January 2023, Karimi publicly tweeted his support for exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi to assume a role as representative of the Iranian people pending a national referendum.

<text>The Chinese mountain cat (Felis bieti), also known as Chinese desert cat and Chinese steppe cat, is a small wild &quot;Felis&quot; species with sand-coloured fur, faint dark stripes on the face and legs and black tipped ears. It is endemic to the Tibetan Plateau of western China, where it lives in grassland above elevations of . It has been listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2002.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The scientific name &quot;Felis bieti&quot; was proposed by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1892 who described the Chinese mountain cat based on a skin collected in Sichuan Province. He named it &quot;Felis Bieti&quot; in honour of the French missionary Félix Biet.

In 2007, it was provisionally classified as a wildcat subspecies under the name &quot;F. silvestris bieti&quot;.
It has been recognised as a valid species since 2017, as it is morphologically distinct from wildcats.

The Chinese mountain cat belongs to an evolutionary &quot;Felis&quot; lineage that is estimated to have had a common ancestor with the Asiatic wildcat (&quot;F. lybica ornata&quot;) around during the Middle Pleistocene. Gene flow from Chinese mountain cats to domestic cats (&quot;F. catus&quot;) in a few areas of the Tibetan Plateau is estimated to have happened between the 1960s and 2000s.

==Characteristics==
The Chinese mountain cat has sand-coloured fur with dark guard hairs. Faint dark horizontal stripes on the face and legs are hardly visible. Its ears have black tips. It has a relatively broad skull, and long hair growing between the pads of their feet. It is whitish on the belly, and its legs and tail bear black rings. The tip of the tail is black. It is long in head and body with a long tail. Adults weigh from .

==Distribution and habitat==
The Chinese mountain cat is endemic to China and lives on the north-eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. It was recorded only in eastern Qinghai and north-western Sichuan.
It inhabits high-elevation steppe grassland, alpine meadow, alpine shrubland and coniferous forest edges at elevations of . It has not been confirmed in true desert or heavily forested mountains.

The first photographs of a wild Chinese mountain cat were taken in 2007. One individual was observed and photographed in May 2015 in the Ruoergai grasslands. Between autumn 2018 and spring 2019, Chinese mountain cats were documented in an alpine meadow in the southeastern Sanjiangyuan region.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
The Chinese mountain cat is active at night and preys on pikas, rodents and birds. It breeds between January and March. Females give birth to two to four kittens in a secluded burrow.

Until 2007, the Chinese mountain cat was known only from six individuals, all living in Chinese zoos, and a handful of skins in museums.

== Threats ==
The Chinese mountain cat is threatened due to the organised poisoning of pikas. The poison used diminishes prey species and also kills cats unintentionally.

== Conservation ==
&quot;Felis bieti&quot; is listed on CITES Appendix II. It is protected in China by laws such as the Animal Protection Law and the Forestry Law. It has been listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2002 and is included in the list of &quot;National First-Class Protected Animals&quot; under the &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic on the Conservation of Wild Animals&quot; since February 2021.

In July 2023, a Chinese mountain cat was fitted with a GPS collar and released into the wild by the Qinghai Wildlife Rescue and Breeding Center. A five-year-old male was caught in a mouse trap when trying to hunt in a chicken pen. He was sent to the Center in June 2023 to be treated for a leg wound and for rehabilitation.

<text>A market cross, or in Scots, a mercat cross, is a structure used to mark a market square in market towns, where historically the right to hold a regular market or fair was granted by the monarch, a bishop or a baron. 

==History==
Market crosses were originally from the distinctive tradition in Early Medieval Insular art of free-standing stone standing or high crosses, often elaborately carved, which goes back to the 7th century. Market crosses can be found in many market towns in Britain. British emigrants often installed such crosses in their new cities, and several can be found in Canada and Australia.

The market cross could be representing the official site for a medieval town or village market, granted by a charter, or it could have once represented a traditional religious marking at a crossroads.

==Design==
These structures range from carved stone spires, obelisks or crosses, common to small market towns such as that in Stalbridge, Dorset, to large, ornate covered structures, such as the Chichester Cross, or Malmesbury Market Cross. They can also be constructed from wood; an example is at Wymondham, Norfolk.

<text>Foolad Khuzestan Football Club (, &quot;Bāshgāh-e Futbāl-e Fulād-e Khuzestān&quot;) is an Iranian professional football club based in Ahvaz, Khuzestan, that plays in Persian Gulf Pro League. The club was founded in 1971 and is owned by Foolad Khuzestan Company. 

The club has won Iran Pro League twice, including a championship in the lower division, Azadegan League. In the 2004–05 season, Foolad became the champion of the fourth newly founded Iran Pro League (IPL), gaining a total of 64 points over 30 league matches. After several seasons, Foolad lost many of its key players through transfers and internal problems and also displayed a poor performance in the 2006 AFC Champions League. The club was subsequently relegated to the Azadegan League, second highest division in Iran at the end of 2006–07. However, Foolad was able to return to the IPL starting from the next season, 2008–09 Iran Pro League. Foolad won its second championship in 2013–14 season. The club also won their first Hazfi Cup title in the 2020–21 season.

Foolad&#x27;s home kit is red and yellow shirts, with the same color for shorts, accompanied by red socks. The colors used in clothing are derived from the symbol of the club.

==Club history==

===Establishment and first years (1971–1995)===
Foolad Khuzestan Football Club was founded on 2 March 1971 in Ahwaz, Iran by at that time, President of the Foolad Khuzestan Company Ali Akbar Davar. Foolad was a team that no one knew anything about until the dissolution of &quot;Jonoub Ahwaz&quot; in 1996. Foolad won the Ahwaz City Championship in 1991 and entered the 2nd division of the Khuzestan football league two years later. Foolad won the first group in its debut season and was promoted to the Ahwaz&#x27;s first league which they won in their debut season as well. This meant they would be promoted to the Khuzestan Provincial Leagues.

===Road to the Highest Division (1995–2001)===
In 1995, which was Foolad&#x27;s second year in the &quot;Khuzestan&#x27;s Second Division&quot;, they became provincial champions. That same year &quot;Jonoub Ahvaz&quot;, was contracted and Foolad took their place in Iran Football&#x27;s 2nd Division. In 1996, with Homayoun Shahrokhinejad as manager, the team was promoted to the 1st division. 

===Frančić era (2004–2006)===
The team was eventually bought by the &quot;Ahwaz Steel Mill&quot;. The team was finally able to win the IPL in the 2004–05 season but due to some ensuing internal problems and coaching difficulties could not perform well in the 2006 Asian Champions League.

===ACL and relegation (2006–2007)===
After a mediocre 2005–06, Foolad started the 2006–07 season with former Iranian national team coach Mohammad Mayeli Kohan, but he resigned halfway through the season as Foolad had achieved poor results. Youth club coach Nenad Nikolić temporarily replaced him and soon after Portuguese manager Augusto Inácio was named head coach. Foolad went through a terrible 2006–07 season finishing 15th and being relegated to the lower Azadegan League.

===Return to First Division and Jalali years (2007–2012)===
Foolad start the 2007–08 season at Azadegan League and won the playoff spot despite their strong leadership until the last weeks. In the playoff, they drew with Payam Mashhad in a two-leg matches and missed the promotion via away goal. A few weeks later they bought the right to play in Persian Gulf Cup from Sepahan Novin and promoted to IPL. Then Majid Jalali was announced as the club&#x27;s head coach with signing a three years contract where they had an average season with ending the season in the 7th place.

On September 1, 2009, Seifollah Dehkordi was elected as the club&#x27;s president after previous president Masoud Rezaeian resigned from his position. After the election of Dehkordi, Majid Jalali left the club despite good results. Luka Bonačić was named as Jalali&#x27;s successor but he could not please the club as he was not able to win a single match in first eight weeks and the club decided to bring Majid Jalali back where they finished the league 10th. At the Jalali&#x27;s final year as Foolad manager, the club ended the season at the 14th place, the worst since their promotion back to the league.

===League success under Faraki (2012–2014)===

After Jalali&#x27;s contract was not renewed, Naft Tehran manager Hossein Faraki was named as the club&#x27;s new head coach. He led Foolad to the 4th rank in his first season as the club&#x27;s manager, gaining an AFC Champions League spot for the second time in the Foolad&#x27;s history. In the 2013–14 Iran Pro League season, Faraki led the club to their second Iran Pro League title, his team finished with 57 points. They finished 2 points clear of second place Persepolis. Five days later, Foolad advanced to the Round of 16 of the AFC Champions League for the first time after they defeated El-Jaish of Qatar. Foolad lost to Al Sadd on away goals.

On 23 May 2014, Faraki resigned as the manager of the club, due to knee problems, despite two good seasons with Foolad. Dragan Skočić was named as his successor.

==Reserve team==
Foolad Novin is the reserve side of Foolad. In 2014 they were promoted to the Azadegan League for the second time in their history. Foolad Yazd is not Foolad&#x27;s reserve team, but is a feeder club, they also compete in the Azadegan League.

==Youth academy==

In April 1999, Foolad formed a youth academy. 

==Kit==

The name and symbol of the club adapted from its founder and owner company, Foolad. Its symbol means that is related to steel production process. The club&#x27;s logo repeatedly changed but the overall layout is preserved. After Foolad&#x27;s league title in 2006, club added a golden star above the team logo etched into the club&#x27;s shirt, but this was not accepted by the Islamic Republic of Iran Football Federation. So there is not any star on the club&#x27;s official logo.

Foolad began playing in red, yellow and black, but then changed the yellow to white since 1999. The kit has been made by Nike until 2002. Then Merooj and Daei Sport were the club&#x27;s kit manufacturers. Uhlsport is the current kit manufacturers, made the kits from past four years. The club currently doesn&#x27;t have any official sponsor as the club&#x27;s company name is inserted on the shirts.

* – Tefal was the sponsor of the team in only some matches not full season.

==Rivals==
The team competes in Ahvaz derby against Esteghlal Khuzestan which is a new born club. The first time the teams met each other was in season 2013–14 which Esteghlal Khuzestan lost that game.

<doc id="272999" wikidata="Q185635" url="?curid=272999" title="Tusk">
<text>Tusks are elongated, continuously growing front teeth that protrude well beyond the mouth of certain mammal species. They are most commonly canine teeth, as with narwhals, chevrotains, musk deer, water deer, muntjac, pigs, peccaries, hippopotamuses and walruses, or, in the case of elephants, elongated incisors. Tusks share common features such as extra-oral position, growth pattern, composition and structure, and lack of contribution to ingestion. Tusks are thought to have adapted to the extra-oral environments, like dry or aquatic or arctic. In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males&#x27; are larger. Most mammals with tusks have a pair of them growing out from either side of the mouth. Tusks are generally curved and have a smooth, continuous surface. The male narwhal&#x27;s straight single helical tusk, which usually grows out from the left of the mouth, is an exception to the typical features of tusks described above. Continuous growth of tusks is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth.

Other than mammals, dicynodonts are the only known vertebrates to have true tusks.

==Function==
Tusks have a variety of uses depending on the animal. Social displays of dominance, particularly among males, are common, as is their use in defense against attackers. Elephants use their tusks as digging and boring tools. Walruses use their tusks to grip and haul out on ice. It has been suggested that tusks&#x27; structure has evolved to be compatible with extra-oral environments.

== Size ==

Elephant tusks are sexually dimorphic, being on average larger in males than in females, and entirely absent in female Asian elephants. Elephants with large tusks each at least in weight are known as &quot;tuskers&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;big tuskers&quot; or &quot;great tuskers&quot;. While tuskers are rare today, it is thought that they were more common in the past, prior to human impact on elephant populations. The two record holders for longest and heaviest recorded African bush elephant tusks are around long measured along the outside curve, and in weight respectively, while the longest and heaviest Asian elephant tusks are long and respectively. Even larger tusks are known from some extinct proboscideans, such as species of &quot;Stegodon, Palaeoloxodon&quot;, and mammoths, with the longest tusk ever recorded being that of a specimen of &quot;&quot;Mammut&quot; borsoni&quot; from Greece, which measures in length, with an estimated weight of with some mammoth tusks exceeding in length and probably in weight. The largest walrus tusks can reach lengths of over . The longest narwhal tusks reach . The upward curving maxillary tusks of babirusa can reach lengths of over .

==Use by humans==
Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory, which is used in artifacts and jewellery, and formerly in other items such as piano keys. Consequently, many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered. The ivory trade has been severely restricted by the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

Tusked animals in human care may undergo tusk trimming or removal for health and safety concerns. Furthermore, surgical veterinary procedures to remove tusks have been explored to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.

<doc id="273003" wikidata="Q2297862" url="?curid=273003" title="Football in Iran">
<text>Football is the most popular sport in Iran, with wrestling and volleyball as close contenders. Football has been a part of life for Iranians for many decades now and is played in schools, streets, and football clubs nationwide.

For political and social reasons, women&#x27;s football grew little from the 1980s to 2020, and clubs such as Persepolis and Esteghlal did not even have a women&#x27;s football team in these years.

==History==
===Early days===
Football was played in Iran as early as 1898, when a team of British residents of Esfahan played a team of Armenians.
In south western Iran the game was introduced in 1907 by British sailors and workers. At that time they were working at port cities Bushehr, Khorramshahr, Bandar Abbas and major oil refineries such as Abadan and Masjed Soleiman in the province of Khuzestan, the latter area even boasting a football league. The local Iranian employees of the company first looked on, and then began replacing individual players on the teams, until they formed their own teams.

In 1907, the British Ambassador in Tehran Cecil Spring Rice founded Iran&#x27;s first Football Tournament which had only 3 teams: Embassy of Great Britain, Imperial Bank of Persia and Indo-European Telegraph Company.

In the same year, the Tehran Football Association Club, an organising body for arranging football matches, was established. All teams were made up of British residents of Tehran, although when teams didn&#x27;t have enough players they sometimes chose Iranian bystanders to come on the field and play. The matches were played at or around Mashq Square. The first Iranian player was Karim Zandi who played from 1908 to 1916. This period saw increasing interest in the game among Iranians.

In 1910, Samuel M. Jordan, the principal of the American School (currently known as Alborz High School) in Tehran, introduced football as part of the school&#x27;s curriculum. Four years later 1914, the start of World War I put an end to these football matches and programs.

In other parts of southern Iran, (e.g. cities such as Shiraz) football was introduced by the British officers of the South Persia Rifles (1916–1921) to the Iranian troops they commanded, who then spread the game among the civilian population. The period following World War 1 saw football matches recommence in Tehran. Then two years later, in 1920, a number of Iranian and British football enthusiasts founded the Iranian Football Association (Majmaa-i Football-i Iran) to encourage Iranian players and to popularize the game. The director of the Imperial Bank of Persia, James McMurray, became its president, and he was assisted by the legation doctor, A.R. Neligan; they each donated a cup to be awarded to winning teams.

1920 also saw the establishment of Iran&#x27;s first football club called &quot;Iran Club&quot;. Soon after the alumni of American College and the students of School of Political Science also formed teams. The Iran Club squad consisted of Karim Zandi, Khan Sardar brothers, Amir-Aslani brothers, Mohammad Ali Shokooh, Azizollah Afkkhami, Reza Kalantar, Sheybani, Hasan Meftah, Herand, Galustyan, Khajeh-Noori, Reza Rabizadeh, Hambarson, Ashrafi. This group of players won the Tehran Association Cup in 1923. In the same year a new club was established called Tehran Club, followed by the creation of the Armenian Sports Club and the Toofan Club, and in 1925 the Tehran Club reached the final and defeated the British Select Team of Tehran 2–1.

In this period a number of footballers who had played abroad, such as Hossein Sadaghiani and the Khan-Sardar brothers, who played in the Belgian Football Leagues, returned to Iran. Hossein Sadaghiani for instance after returning to Iran temporarily from Europe, helped to establish the first football club (Ferdowsi Club) in Mashhad. During his one-year stay in Mashhad, he arranged football matches between the club and the British Consulate-General. Before this, football was only played by foreign residents in Mashhad (especially the employees of the Telegraph Office and the British Consulate-General).

In places that had not entertained a significant foreign presence, such as Ardabil, it seems that the game was introduced in the 1920s by young men who had spent some time in the Caucasus.

===1950s to 1970s===
By the 1950s and early 60s, football had become a popular sport in Iran, and teams from Khuzestan were considered the most successful. Tehran then slowly started becoming the football capital of Iran, and numerous great clubs emerged from there. Shahin FC, Oghab FC, and Taj, were all Tehran teams established in the mid-1940s and are still active.
As the number of club teams increased the need for a national league became apparent, and ever since 1960, with the exception of a few years, a nationwide football league has existed in Iran. The Takhte Jamshid Cup, Azadegan League and the IPL being the most important ones.
===21st century===
On 27 December 2019, Zahra Khajavi broke the clean sheet record of Iranian football by not receiving any goal for 953 minutes. Also, she, along with Alireza Biranvand, are known as the record holders of the longest hand throws in Iranian football. As one of the best goalkeepers in the history of Iranian football, Khajavi was able to once again draw the attention of the domestic media to the Iranian women&#x27;s national football team. Her achievements played a key role in the progress of the women&#x27;s national football team in these years.

=== 2020s ===
In the 2020s, women&#x27;s football became more popular among young Iranians, both boys and girls.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Iran forced the fixtures to be played without spectators, bringing new financial problems that lasted for years for some clubs.

====Female spectators====
In the AFC Champions League (organised by the Asian Football Confederation, problems on the Iranian sides were attracting media attention. In addition, International Arabic and English-language media reported on the violation of women&#x27;s rights in Iranian stadiums, and the fact that Iranian women had been banned from football stadiums for about 40 years wince 2019, by the Iranian government. In 2018, FIFA, as the parent of the AFC, pressured Iran to let women into the stadiums in the ACL, but Iran only allowed a limited number of women to watch the 2018 final, which called by the media &quot;a show&quot;. In October 2019, Iranian women allowed to watch a 2022 World Cup qualifier, when the men&#x27;s team beat Cambodian football team 14–0. Up to 3,500 women attended the game in the 80,000-seat Azadi Stadium.

====Other challenges====

Persepolis and Esteghlal have been challenged by other sides due to direct ownership by the government of the Islamic Republic. In 2021, AFC investigated the matter.

== National teams ==

===The predecessor of Iran men&#x27;s national football team===

====Tehran XI====
In 1926 Tehran XI (selected players from Tehran Club, Toofan and Armenian Sports Club)
traveled across the border to Baku, USSR, this was the first away football match for an Iranian team. This Tehran Select team is the predecessor of Iran&#x27;s national football team.

In 1929 it was time for a return visit, and so a team from Baku was invited to play in Tehran in late November. To impress the visitors, grass had been planted on the state-owned football field. The last of the three games, all of which were won by the visitors, was attended by Abdolhossein Teymourtash, the powerful minister of court. The humiliating defeats, suffered on home ground, caused great consternation, so much so that some young men gave up football altogether. In subsequent years the interest in football waned, and newspapers hardly reported on those matches that did take place. However, all this changed with the return of crown prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from Switzerland in 1936 and arrival of Thomas R Gibson in the 1930s to promote the game.

*Head Coach: Mir Mehdi Varzandeh
*Squad: 
The results were as follow:

===World War Two period===
One man can be remembered, who contributed to Iranian football during the post-World War One period. Hossein Sadaghiani became active in sharing the knowledge of the game and also with growth of football, he became the first head coach of the Iranian national team, who later coached football teams of University of Tehran. The first match that the Iranian national football team played was on August 25, 1941, away at Afghanistan.

In 1942, when the Allied Forces were in Iran, Iran national football team defeated a British Military XI team in a friendly match played in Tehran. Match details as follow:

Iran team lineup were: Fathollah Minbashian, Mansour Hajian, Abbas Qarib, Aziz Farzanegan, Abbas Tandidehgar, Jamshid Malekshahi, Bakhtiar, Akbar Toofan, Ahmad Izadpanah and 2 more players. The team&#x27;s head coach was Hossein Sadaghiani.

British Army XI lineup included players such as Wilf Mannion, Migger and Bick, Bertie Mee, Jimmy McCabe.

===Post-World War Two period===

In the 1960s and 1970s, Iran established itself as one of Asia&#x27;s top sides, winning the Asian Cup in 1968, 1972 and 1976, the only team to win the tournament three times in a row. In 1964 Iran qualified for the Olympic Games, but they finished last in their group with one point which came in a 1–1 draw against Mexico. Iran also qualified for the 1972, 1976 and 1980 Olympic Games. In 1978, Iran qualified for its first FIFA World Cup, held in Argentina. In the 1980s the Iran–Iraq War hindered the development of the national team and Iran missed out on several World Cups due to withdrawing from the qualifying stage. After a twenty-year absence, Iran qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and recorded their first-ever World Cup victory, defeating the United States 2–1. Iran has also more recently qualified for the tournament in 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022, failing to advance past the group stage on each occasion.

=== Persian lionesses ===
The Iran women&#x27;s national football team, nicknamed the Lionesses, represents Iran in international women&#x27;s football around the world, and is controlled by the Football Federation of Iran. 
Iran plays their home matches on the Ararat Stadium.

===Youth national teams===
Iran fields youth national teams in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sections predominantly at the U17, U20 and U23 levels having enjoyed moderate success.

==Other football teams==
=== Men&#x27;s teams ===
Iran national futsal team: The Iran national futsal team represents Iran in international futsal competitions and is controlled by the Futsal Commission of the Iranian Football Federation. The &quot;Kings of Asian Futsal&quot; are by far the strongest Asian team and one of the best teams in the world according to the Futsal World Ranking. The Iranians are the regular participants of the FIFA Futsal World Cup reaching the third place in 2016 after eliminating the favorites, Brazil. Iran have won the first Futsal Confederations Cup in 2009 and also reached the second place in the Grand Prix de Futsal known as Futsal Mini-World Cup in multiple editions.

Iran national beach soccer team: Iran has won the AFC Beach Soccer Championship a record two times (2013, 2017) and has placed in the top four in every edition. Iran has also appeared in the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup seven times, reaching the quarterfinals on three occasions (2013, 2015, 2017), and finishing in third place once (2017).

=== Women&#x27;s teams ===

Iran women&#x27;s national beach soccer team, is being reviewed by the Iranian Football Federation.

==League system==
=== Men&#x27;s league system ===

The current structure has been in place since 2001. The Persian Gulf Pro League is the highest level of club football in Iran. Below it is the Azadegan League, also known as the 1st division, which consists of two twelve-team groups. One level further down from that is the 2nd division which is made up of 28 teams evenly distributed into two groups. One step down, and the final nationwide league, is the 3rd division. This level has eight groups and 45 teams. Each groups contains teams that are located in the same area of the nation. The final level of the football system consists of 28 provincial leagues. Local teams from each province participate in these leagues, and some of the leagues are divided into further divisions.

The system works with a promotion-relegation system, meaning that a team from the lowest level of the system can make it to the top level after a number of years. The number of teams in each league often changes from season to season, due to the lack of any professional management in the lower levels of the system. Currently the IPL is the only league that is considered professional, despite many of its rules about club facilities and management being broken. It is not uncommon for teams in the lower levels of the system to change team names because of sponsorship issues or for teams to completely withdraw from a competition.

The top four levels of the men&#x27;s system are managed by the FFIRI, while the bottom level leagues are managed by their respective provincial football committee. The Kowsar Women Football League is the primary women&#x27;s football league in Iran.

=== Women&#x27;s league system ===
The Kowsar Women Football League (, &quot;Lig-e Kâuser-e Banuan-e Futbal-e Iran&quot;) is a women&#x27;s football league, run by the Football Federation Islamic Republic of Iran. At the top of the Iranian football league system, it is the country&#x27;s primary competition for the sport. It was established in 2007. There is also a second division for women&#x27;s.

<doc id="273011" wikidata="Q7922845" url="?curid=273011" title="Vertical and horizontal (radio propagation)">
<text>In radio propagation, horizontal plane is used to plot an antenna&#x27;s relative field strength in relation to the ground (which directly affects a station&#x27;s coverage area) on a polar graph. Normally the maximum of 1.000 or 0 dB is at the top, which is labeled 0o, running clockwise back around to the top at 360°. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a percentage less than 100%, or decibels less than 0 dB. If the graph is of an actual or proposed installation, rotation is applied so that the top is 0o true north.

The vertical plane is used to plot an antenna&#x27;s relative field strength perpendicular to the ground (which directly affects a station&#x27;s coverage area) on a polar graph. 

Normally, the maximum of 1.000 or 0 dB is at the side (unless there is beam tilt), which is labeled 0°, to 90° at the top and −90° at the bottom. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a percentage less than 100%, or decibels less than 0 dB.

Most broadcast antennas use either line-of-sight or ground wave propagation (a slight refraction towards the ground) to reach their nearby listeners, and thus want a low angle in the vertical plane. Short wave transmitters want a somewhat higher elevation angle in the vertical plane to encourage skywave propagation, which would refract or reflect radio waves off the ionosphere and back to the ground at a great distance from the transmitter.

Omnidirectional antennas typically try to limit the range of their vertical plane radiation pattern to concentrate energy over a smaller range and increase gain.</text><links>

<text>Richard Bentall (born 30 September 1956) is a Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Sheffield in the UK.

==Early life==
Richard Pendrill Bentall was born in Sheffield in the United Kingdom. After attending Uppingham School in Rutland and then High Storrs School in his home town, he attended the University College of North Wales, Bangor as an undergraduate before registering for a PhD in Experimental Psychology at the same institution.

==Career==
After being awarded his doctorate, he moved to the University of Liverpool to undertake professional training as a clinical psychologist. He later returned to his alma mater of Liverpool to work as a lecturer, after a brief stint working for the National Health Service as a forensic clinical psychologist. Later, he studied for an MA in Philosophy Applied to Healthcare from the University of Wales, Swansea. He was eventually promoted to Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Liverpool. In 1999, he accepted a position at the University of Manchester, collaborating with researchers based there who were working in understanding the treatment of psychotic experiences. After returning in 2007 to a professorial position at Bangor University, where he retains an honorary professorship, he returned to the University of Liverpool in 2011, before moving to the University of Sheffield in 2017. His research continues to focus on the psychological mechanisms of severe mental illness and social factors that affect these mechanisms, which has led to a recent interest in public mental health. In 1989, he received the British Psychological Society&#x27;s Division of Clinical Psychology &#x27;May Davidson Award&#x27;, an annual award for outstanding contributions to the field of clinical psychology, in the first ten years after qualifying. In 2014 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

==Research==
He has previously published research on differences between human and animal operant conditioning and on the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. However, he is best known for his work in psychosis, especially the psychological processes responsible for delusions and hallucinations and has published extensively in these areas. His research on persecutory (paranoid) delusions has explored the idea that these arise from dysfunctional attempts to regulate self-esteem, so that the paranoid patient attributes negative experiences to the deliberate actions of other people. His research on hallucinations has identified a failure of source monitoring (the process by which events are attributed to either the self or external sources) as responsible for hallucinating patients&#x27; inability to recognize that their inner speech (verbal thought) belongs to themselves. Along with many other British researchers, he has used these discoveries to inform the development of new psychological interventions for psychosis, based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This work has included randomized controlled trials of CBT for first episode patients and patients experiencing an at risk mental state for psychosis.

In a 1992 thought experiment, Bentall proposed that happiness might be classified as a psychiatric disorder. The purpose of the paper was to demonstrate the impossibility of defining psychiatric disorder without reference to values. The paper was mentioned on the satirical television program &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and quoted by the novelist Philip Roth in his novel &quot;Sabbath&#x27;s Theater&quot;.

He has edited and written several books, most notably &quot;Madness Explained&quot;, which was a winner of the British Psychological Society Book Award in 2004. In this book, he advocates a psychological approach to the psychoses, rejects the concept of schizophrenia and considers symptoms worthwhile investigating in contrast to the Kraepelinian syndromes. (Refuting &quot;Kraepelin&#x27;s big idea&quot; that serious mental illness can be divided into discrete types is the starting chapter of the book.) A review by Paul Broks in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; summarised its position as: &quot;Like Szasz, Bentall is firmly opposed to the biomedical model, but he also takes issue with extreme social relativists who would deny the reality of madness.&quot; In the book, Bentall also argues that no clear distinction exists between those diagnosed with mental illnesses and the &quot;well&quot;. While this notion is more widely accepted in psychiatry when it comes to anxiety and depression, Bentall insists that schizotypal experiences are also common.

In 2009 he published &quot;Doctoring The Mind: Is Our Current Treatment Of Mental Illness Really Any Good?&quot; A review of this book by neuro-scientist Roy Sugarman argued that it allied itself with the anti-psychiatry movement in its critiques of biological psychiatry. The review in &quot;PsycCRITIQUES&quot; was more nuanced, pointing out that Bentall did not reject psycho-pharmacology, but that he was concerned over its overuse.

In 2010, Bentall and John Read co-authored a literature review on &quot;The effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy&quot; (ECT). It examined placebo-controlled studies and concluded ECT had minimal benefits for people with depression and schizophrenia. The authors said &quot;given the strong evidence of persistent and, for some, permanent brain dysfunction, primarily evidenced in the form of retrograde and anterograde amnesia, and the evidence of a slight but significant increased risk of death, the cost-benefit analysis for ECT is so poor that its use cannot be scientifically justified&quot;. Psychiatrists, however, sharply criticized this paper in passing by calling it an &quot;evidence-poor paper with an anti-ECT agenda&quot;.

In 2012, Bentall and collaborators in Maastricht published a meta-analysis of the research literature on childhood trauma and psychosis, considering epidemiological, case-control, and prospective studies. This study found that the evidence that childhood trauma confers a risk of adult psychosis is highly consistent, with children who have experienced trauma (sexual abuse, physical abuse, loss of a parent or bullying) being approximately three times more likely to become psychotic than non-traumatized children; there was a dose-response effect (the most severely traumatized children were even more likely to become psychotic) suggesting that the effect is causal. This finding, and other findings suggesting that there are many social risk factors for severe mental illness, has led to Bentall&#x27;s current interest in public mental health.

*Bernhard August Beskow (1837–1910), engraver
*Natanael Beskow (1865–1953), theologian
*Elsa Beskow (1874–1953), author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books (married to Natanael B.)
*Bo Beskow (1906–1988), painter (son of Elsa and Natanael B.)
*Per Beskow (1926−2016), Swedish biblical scholar
*Katarina Beskow (1867–1939), chess player
*Emil Beskow (1998 -?), World champion

== Other notable individuals with this surname ==

*Saskia Beskow, former New York City Ballet dancer

There are many U.S. Beskows who are not of Swedish descent. One group of German Beskows settled in South Dakota and were staunch anti-abolitionist store owners during the 1850s.

There are also US Beskows who are not of Swedish descent. One group of Norwegian Beskows settled in Wisconsin and still live there today.</text><links>

<text>No te duermas (&quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Asleep&quot;) was a Spanish-language television program, a late-night talk and variety show from Puerto Rico. It started airing in February 1990 as a late night show with comedian Antonio Sánchez &quot;El Gangster&quot; in WSTE-TV SuperSiete. Later on, the show moved to Telemundo Puerto Rico, enjoying great success.

==History==
The idea of the show came from two sources. Originally, producer Gabriel Suau approached Antonio Sánchez with the idea of a talk show called &quot;No te Duermas&quot;. Suau wanted to have Axel Anderson as host while Sánchez would intervene with comedy sketches, characters and interrupting the interviews. Sánchez, instead, presented Suau an idea he had for a show. Suau then decided to drop his original idea and gave Sánchez the opportunity to lead it.

In February 1990, the show debuted in Channel 7 (Super Siete) instantly peaking at #1 in local popularity charts. After a year, Telemundo made Suau an offer and the show moved in October 1991. The show continued to be #1 for two years, and stayed on the Top 10 for the following years.

In 2005, while negotiating their contract, Telemundo offered Sánchez the chance to do the program from Monday to Friday, and compete directly with Univision&#x27;s &quot;Anda Pa&#x27;l Cara&quot;. Sánchez accepted, changing also the overall format of the show. In February 2008, the show changed to a Monday through Thursday format, with &quot;Esto Esta Kñon&quot;, a political discussion and satire show, aired on Friday. This show is produced by Antonio Sánchez himself.

Near the end of 2008, Sánchez announced he would retire the show after almost 19 years. During December 2008, the show featured interviews with people that contributed to the show&#x27;s success during its history, and shows of old comedy sketches. The last show was aired on December 30, 2008.

Antonio Sánchez &quot;El Gangster&quot; returned with a live show called &quot;No Te Duermas: Una noche más&quot; August 31, 2019 at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico and included a live feed to a location in Orlando, Florida (to accommodate the many Puerto Ricans who have migrated there). The show hosted the same scenery, characters and humor that distinguished the television program, and then was aired on September 17, 2019, on WAPA TV.

==Hosts and models==
Sánchez has been the host of the show for its duration. However, he has been accompanied during most of the show&#x27;s history by a female co-host. Some of them have been:

* Lourdes Collazo (1990)
* Sandra Vanessa Mercado (1990)
* Jailene Cintrón (1991–1996)
* Yizette Cifredo (2003–2004)
* Laura Hernández (2005–2007)
* Daniela Droz (2008)

The show has also put models in the spotlight by being on a prime time show. Some of the most famous have been Taína, Glerysbeth, Maripily, La Burbu, Mara Cruz, and others.

==Show format==
The show features interviews to artists, music performances, curious facts, and comedy sketches featuring mostly characters by Sánchez himself. The show was criticized in its beginnings for its raunchy style and general portrait of women. This, however, has helped the show to maintain a strong male following.

===Guests===
Some of the show&#x27;s featured guests have included: 
* Dayivet Aleman
* Noris Jofre
* Bad Bunny

==Comedy Characters==

Here is a list of some of the comedy characters portrayed by Antonio Sánchez in his show:

* El poeta que todo lo compone (The poet who composes everything): a poet who always find his verses almost ending in obscene words but replaces them with another one.
* Lindín: an obese man (Sánchez in a suit) who finds himself immensely attractive.
* Kiko Jones: a spoof of Indiana Jones. His &quot;adventures&quot; are always intercut with scenes of real movies in a campy way to make it funnier.
* Super Moncho: a Puerto Rican version of Super Dave. A stunt man performing increasingly absurd stunts, before which he will always yell &quot;Pelo power!!!&quot; (he would then rip open his shirt and exposing chest hair made of magic marker and some times very little real hair) and ends up always failing. At the end he will always yells &quot;Estoy vivooo!!!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m alive!!!&quot;).
* Pedro Lambellagas (Pedro Scablicker): a news reporter with a lame voice and a unibrow. Most of his news reports are criticisms of the local government or funny takes on local news.
* Pepe Pirindingo: a taxi driver who&#x27;s always faced with crazy situations.
* Pepín Galarza: a naive and innocent geek. Somehow women are attracted to him putting him in extremely sensual situations. At that point he would always ask to the screen &quot;Gangster, ¿que hago?&quot; (Gangster, what should I do?. After receiving a good advice from Sánchez, he would go and do some stupid thing.
* Dr. Selástraga: a promiscuous doctor who&#x27;s always asking his female patients to get undressed.
* Minga: a gossiping woman who comments on celebrities and other everyday subjects. She would go on to have her own show (&quot;Minga y Petraca&quot;).
* Don Remigio: a horny old man who always pursues beautiful women and ends up getting hit. His sketches are usually featured in a silent movie style with fast-tracked editing and old music in the background.
* Tetron: a giant-breasted figure with flippers who came out of the shore of Puerto Rico&#x27;s beaches and bathed young girls in milk.
* Cuco Pasurín: a reporter with a jewfro and a fish tie who uses clips from other interviews to answer his questions. Usually ending his interview with a woman answering that she loves &quot;la morcilla&quot; (the blood sausage).

<text>Elizabeth Coleman (January 26, 1892April 30, 1926) was an early American civil aviator. She was the first African-American woman and first Native American to hold a pilot license, and is the earliest known Black person to earn an international pilot&#x27;s license. She earned her license from the &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; on June 15, 1921.

Born to a family of sharecroppers in Texas, Coleman worked in the cotton fields at a young age while also studying in a small segregated school. She attended one term of college at Langston University. Coleman developed an early interest in flying, but African Americans, Native Americans, and women had no flight training opportunities in the United States, so she saved and obtained sponsorships in Chicago to go to France for flight school.

She then became a high-profile pilot in notoriously dangerous air shows in the United States. She was popularly known as &quot;Queen Bess&quot; and &quot;Brave Bessie&quot;, and hoped to start a school for African-American fliers. Coleman died in a plane crash in 1926. Her pioneering role was an inspiration to early pilots and to the African-American and Native American communities.

==Early life==

Coleman was born on January 26, 1892, in Atlanta, Texas, the tenth of 13 children of George Coleman, an African American who may have had Cherokee or Choctaw grandparents, and Susan Coleman, who was African American. Nine of the children survived childhood, which was typical for the time. When Coleman was two years old, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas, where they lived as sharecroppers. Coleman began attending school in Waxahachie at the age of six. She walked four miles each day to her segregated, one-room school, where she loved to read and established herself as an outstanding math student. She completed her elementary education in that school.

Every season, Coleman&#x27;s routine of school, chores, and church was interrupted for her to participate in bringing in the cotton harvest. In 1901, George Coleman left his family. He moved to Oklahoma, or Indian Territory, as it was then called, to find better opportunities, but his wife and children did not follow. At the age of 12, Coleman was accepted into the Missionary Baptist Church School on scholarship. When she turned eighteen, she took her savings and enrolled in the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University in Langston, Oklahoma (now called Langston University). She completed one term before her money ran out and she returned home.

==Career==
===Chicago===
In 1915, at the age of 23, Coleman moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she lived with her brothers. In Chicago, she worked as a manicurist at the White Sox Barber Shop, where she heard stories of flying during wartime from pilots returning home from World War I. She took a second job as a restaurant manager of a chili parlor to save money in hopes of becoming a pilot herself. American flight schools of the time admitted neither women nor black people, so Robert S. Abbott, founder and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; newspaper, encouraged her to study abroad. Abbot publicized Coleman&#x27;s quest in his newspaper and she received financial sponsorship from banker Jesse Binga and the &quot;Defender&quot;.

===France===
Bessie Coleman took a French-language class at the Berlitz Language Schools in Chicago and then traveled to Paris, France, on November 20, 1920, so that she could earn her pilot license. She learned to fly in a Nieuport 564 biplane with &quot;a steering system that consisted of a vertical stick the thickness of a baseball bat in front of the pilot and a rudder bar under the pilot&#x27;s feet.&quot;

On June 15, 1921, Coleman became the first black woman and first Native American to earn an aviation pilot&#x27;s license and the first black person and first self-identified Native American to earn an international aviation license from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. She is also the first American of any race or gender to be awarded these credentials directly from the FAI, as opposed to applying through the National Aeronautic Association. Determined to polish her skills, Coleman spent the next two months taking lessons from a French ace pilot near Paris and, in September 1921, she sailed for America. She became a media sensation when she returned to the United States.

===Airshows===

With the age of commercial flight still a decade or more in the future, Coleman quickly realized that in order to make a living as a civilian aviator she would have to become a &quot;barnstorming&quot; stunt flier, performing dangerous tricks in the air with the then-still-novel technology of airplanes for paying audiences. But, to succeed in this highly competitive arena, she would need advanced lessons and a more extensive repertoire. Returning to Chicago, she could not find anyone willing to teach her, so in February 1922, she sailed again for Europe.

Coleman spent the next two months in France completing an advanced course in aviation. She then left for the Netherlands to meet with Anthony Fokker, one of the world&#x27;s most distinguished aircraft designers. She also traveled to Germany, where she visited the Fokker Corporation and received additional training from one of the company&#x27;s chief pilots. She then returned to the United States to launch her career in exhibition flying.

&quot;Queen Bess&quot;, as she was known, was a highly popular draw for the next five years. Invited to important events and often interviewed by newspapers, she was admired by both blacks and whites. She primarily flew Curtiss JN-4 Jenny biplanes and other aircraft that had been army surplus aircraft left over from the war. She made her first appearance in an American airshow on September 3, 1922, at an event honoring veterans of the all-black 369th Infantry Regiment of World War I. Held at Curtiss Field on Long Island near New York City, and sponsored by her friend Abbott and the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; newspaper, the show billed Coleman as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest woman flier&quot; and featured aerial displays by eight other American ace pilots, and a jump by black parachutist Hubert Julian.

Six weeks later, Coleman returned to Chicago, performing in an air show, this time to honor World War I&#x27;s 370th Infantry Regiment. She delivered a stunning demonstration of daredevil maneuversincluding figure eights, loops, and near-ground dips to a large and enthusiastic crowd at the Checkerboard Airdrome – now the grounds of Hines Veterans Administration Medical Center, Hines, Illinois, Loyola Hospital, Maywood, and nearby Cook County Forest Preserve.

The thrill of stunt flying and the admiration of cheering crowds were only part of Coleman&#x27;s dream. Coleman never lost sight of her childhood vow to one day &quot;amount to something&quot;. As a professional aviator, Coleman often would be criticized by the press for her opportunistic nature and the flamboyant style she brought to her exhibition flying. She also quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and daring pilot who would stop at nothing to complete a difficult stunt. 

In 1922, Bessie acquired a Curtiss JN-4D with an OX-5 engine from a Los Angeles Army depot. She’d arranged an airshow at the new Los Angeles County Fairgrounds (now Fairplex), but, on February 4, 1923, shortly after takeoff from Santa Monica the motor stalled, and the plane smashed into the ground. She survived and, despite a broken leg and fractured ribs, pleaded with the doctors to “patch her up” enough to perform at the airshow. Instead, she was grounded for several months.

Committed to promoting aviation and combating racism, Coleman spoke to audiences across the country about the pursuit of aviation and goals for African Americans. She absolutely refused to participate in aviation events that prohibited the attendance of African Americans.

In the 1920s, she met the Rev. Hezakiah Hill and his wife Viola on a speaking tour in Orlando, Florida. The community activists invited her to stay with them at the parsonage of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church on Washington Street in the neighborhood of Parramore. A local street was renamed &quot;Bessie Coleman&quot; Street in her honor in 2013. The couple, who treated her as a daughter, persuaded her to stay, and Coleman opened a beauty shop in Orlando to earn extra money to buy her own plane.

Through her media contacts, she was offered a role in a feature-length film titled &quot;Shadow and Sunshine&quot;, to be financed by the African American Seminole Film Producing Company. She gladly accepted, hoping the publicity would help to advance her career and provide her with some of the money she needed to establish her own flying school. But upon learning that the first scene in the movie required her to appear in tattered clothes, with a walking-stick and a pack on her back, she refused to proceed. &quot;Clearly ... [Bessie&#x27;s] walking off the movie set was a statement of principle. Opportunist though she was about her career, she was never an opportunist about race. She had no intention of perpetuating the derogatory image most whites had of most blacks,&quot; wrote Doris Rich.
==Legacy==
Coleman would not live long enough to establish a school for young black aviators, but her pioneering achievements served as an inspiration for a generation of African-American men and women. &quot;Because of Bessie Coleman,&quot; wrote Lieutenant William J. Powell in &quot;Black Wings&quot; (1934), dedicated to Coleman, &quot;we have overcome that which was worse than racial barriers. We have overcome the barriers within ourselves and dared to dream.&quot; Powell served in a segregated unit during World War I, and tirelessly promoted the cause of black aviation through his book, his journals, and the Bessie Coleman Aero Club, which he founded in 1929.

Coleman&#x27;s example proved an inspiration for a number of pioneers in aeronautics and eventually astronautics, including John Robinson, Cornelius Coffey, Willa Brown, Janet Harmon Bragg, Robert H. Lawrence Jr., and Mae Jemison.

==Death==

On April 30, 1926, Coleman was in Jacksonville, Florida. She had recently purchased a Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) in Dallas. Her mechanic and publicity agent, 24-year-old William D. Wills, flew the plane from Dallas in preparation for an airshow and had to make three forced landings along the way because the plane had been so poorly maintained. Upon learning this, Coleman&#x27;s friends and family did not consider the aircraft safe and implored her not to fly it, but she refused. On take-off, Wills was flying the plane with Coleman in the other seat. She was planning a parachute jump for the next day and was unharnessed as she needed to look over the side to examine the terrain.

About ten minutes into the flight, the plane unexpectedly went into a dive and then a spin at 3,000 feet above the ground. Coleman was thrown from the plane at , and was killed instantly when she hit the ground. Wills was unable to regain control of the plane, and it plummeted to the ground. He died upon impact. The plane exploded, bursting into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.

Funeral services were held in Florida, before her body was sent back to Chicago. While there was little mention in most media, news of her death was widely carried in the African-American press. Ten thousand mourners attended her ceremonies in Chicago, which were led by activist Ida B. Wells.

<doc id="273087" wikidata="Q726411" url="?curid=273087" title="Citroën C3">
<text>The Citroën C3 is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by Citroën since April 2002. It replaced the Citroën Saxo in the model line up, and is currently in its fourth generation. Initial models of the Citroën C3 were built using the same platform as the Peugeot 206. The third generation model was released in January 2017, and has been developed alongside the Peugeot 208 since 2019.

The C3 is produced in a five-door hatchback body style, with the first generation also being produced in a two-door convertible version, called the C3 Pluriel. A three-door hatchback, with a similar design as the second generation, was available as the Citroën DS3 and marketed as a premium model.

A mini MPV derivative of the C3 was announced in July 2008, called the C3 Picasso. In South America, a mini SUV version called the C3 Aircross, was produced and marketed only locally.

In September 2021, a new, low-cost model was introduced for the Indian and South American markets. During its introduction, Citroën CEO Vincent Cobée mentioned that the &quot;C3&quot; is the trade name for all Citroën B-segment hatchbacks around the world. This model was extensively modified and upgraded for the European market as the fourth-generation C3, which was introduced in October 2023. The third and fourth-generation C3 are available with a battery electric variant.


==First generation (FC/FN; 2002)==

 

After Jean-Pierre Ploué was appointed Director of the Citroën Design Center in 2000, he designed the C3 under the leadership of Donato Coco, who was already responsible for Citroën Xsara Picasso.

The first generation of the C3 was launched at the 2001 Frankfurt Motor Show, as well as the 2001 Bologna Motor Show, and began marketing in January 2002, as a five-door hatchback. It was available with 1.1, 1.4 and 1.6 litre petrol engines, and 1.4 and 1.6 litre common rail diesel engines. 
All models came as standard with a five speed manual transmission, except for the Stop &amp; Start model, which came with the &quot;SensoDrive&quot; gearbox, a five-speed automated manual transmission with paddle-shifters and &quot;manual&quot; and &quot;automatic&quot; modes. The top level was the only version that had the option of a four-speed hydraulic automatic transmission.

In accordance with the PSA Group policy, the C3&#x27;s chassis was used for the Peugeot 1007 and the Peugeot 207. Many components of the C3 are the same as those of the Peugeot 206. Some versions of the C3 feature a start-stop system that can automatically cut the engine when not needed to save fuel, such as in traffic, and restart it briskly to move on again. The vehicle was loosely styled after the Citroën 2CV.

An offroad-looking model called C3 X-TR was marketed from 2005 to 2009.

===Citroën C3 Lumiere===

The Citroën C3 Lumiere was a concept car that previewed the production Citroën C3, it was initially released in 1998 as a five-door hatchback, with four seats and rear suicide doors for easy access for passengers to the rear seats. It featured a five-speed manual transmission, and a 1.1 L TU1 I4 petrol engine upfront.

===Safety===
The C3 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for pedestrians from Euro NCAP in 2002.

===Facelift===
The C3 was given a redesign in October 2005, with the front end featuring a more imposing bumper, wider lower air intake, single air intake slit below the restyled radiator grille, and a repositioned number plate. The rear of the car was also given redesigned light clusters, with crystal coloured midsections.

The passenger compartment was also enhanced, with the fitting of a restyled dashboard with a high-quality finish, as well as a newer, more modern instrument cluster making the driver information easier to read.

The addition of light metallic grey embellishers around the central section of the fascia and air vents contributed to the updated interior, as did the completely redesigned front and rear door panels and trims. The steering was also improved so that it stiffens up with speed. Citroën also added a new 1.6 L 16 valve HDi diesel engine to the range, rated at . The Pluriel also received similar interior alterations but was otherwise unchanged.

As with the Peugeot 206+ and Renault Clio Campus, Citroën didn&#x27;t yet end the original C3 despite the new generation arrival. It stayed offered on selected European markets. During Autumn 2009, the brand announces the first-gen C3 will be marketed under a new name : Citroën C3 Génération. However, a few weeks later, the name is changed to Citroën C3 Classic. This name is used in France but also in other countries like Greece or Italy. Various names are used across Europe like C3 Hit Classic (Belgium), C3 First (UK, Germany) or C3 First+ (Switzerland). The first-gen C3 was manufactured in Spain until 2010, in France until Summer 2011 and sold across Europe until February 2011.

The South-American model was manufactured and sold until 2012.

===C3 Pluriel===
Citroën marketed the C3 Pluriel from 2003 to 2010 as a convertible with five open top variations, hence the name. The name Pluriel is a cognate with the English &quot;plural&quot;. This model was developed as a turnkey project by Italdesign. It was exclusively assembled in Spain.

The Pluriel can be configured as a hatchback with a multi-layer insulated top; a full-length landaulet, operable partially or to the back window or any stage in between, with a buffet minimizing wind deflector over the windshield; a fixed profile convertible, with the roof open to the back window, the roof assembly folds into a well in the trunk floor; a full convertible where roof side rails are unlatched and removed. and as a roadster pick up, where the back seats fold to a pickup like bed with a drop-down tailgate. The roof tended to let in water. 

The C3 Pluriel was introduced in July 2003, and was originally offered with a choice of a 1.4 or a 1.6 L petrol engine, and a 1.4 L diesel engine. The 1.6 L petrol came fitted, as standard, with an automated manual gearbox. The Pluriel was withdrawn in July 2010.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; placed the C3 Pluriel on its list of &quot;The 13 worst cars of the last 20 years&quot;, describing the car as &quot;useful as a chocolate teapot.&quot;

===Engines===
*1.1 L (1124 cc) &quot;TU1&quot; I4, 
*1.4 L (1360 cc) &quot;TU3&quot; I4, and 
*1.4 L (1398 cc) &quot;DV4 HDi&quot; diesel I4, and 
*1.4 L (1398 cc) &quot;DV4 HDi&quot; 16-valve diesel I4, and 
*1.4 L (1360 cc) &quot;ET3&quot; 16 valve I4, and 
*1.6 L (1560 cc) &quot;DV6 HDi&quot; 16 valve diesel I4, and 
*1.6 L (1560 cc) &quot;DV6 HDiF&quot; 16 valve diesel I4 with diesel particulate filter, and 
* 1.6 L (1587 cc) &quot;TU5&quot; 16 valve I4, and 

=== South America ===
The first generation C3 was manufactured in the Porto Real PSA plant from 2003 to August 2012. This version was sold locally and also exported to other Mercosur markets. The South American C3 significantly differentiated itself from its European counterpart in 2008 when it got a facelift, including exclusive front bumpers.

A limited number of CKD Citroën C3 have been assembled in Uruguay by local assembler Oferol.

==Second generation (SC; A51; 2009)==
The second generation of the C3 was revealed in June 2009, and made its official debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009. It features a new body design, with a 108 degree field of vision windscreen, similar to the one of the larger C4 Picasso, which is available on all versions, except the entry model VT.

The new C3 builds on the curvy profile of the previous model and has a look in keeping with other Citroën models and the older C3, although it is longer and wider than the old model. The lights at the front, bonnet, dashboard assembly, and other components are shared with the DS3.

On the new C3, the instrumentation is a mix of analogue dials beneath a styled cowl and a digital display for the fuel and trip computer. There is no temperature gauge (unlike the DS3), but a red and blue warning lamp to show hot or cold engines which come on as required. The drag coefficient is 0.307 &quot;C&quot;&quot;d&quot;.

In engineering terms, the PSA TU powerplants are carried over from the old car and Citroën also announced a new range of small petrol engines that PSA Peugeot Citroën developed in partnership with BMW. These &quot;Prince&quot; engines have double overhead 16 valve camshafts, on-demand oil and water pumps, and BMW&#x27;s patent injection and ignition technology.

They are designed for low emissions and for good performance and economy. The economy was improved by the standard-fit cruise control and speed limiter available on the VTR+, Airdream+, and Exclusive models.

All versions have a standard fit &quot;Gear Efficiency Indicator&quot; which graphically states what gear to be in and when to change up to optimise economy. They come in 1.4 L and 1.6 L versions with low emissions, as well as new diesel engines, all with emissions of under 120 g/km, plus an &quot;Airdream+&quot; model with 99 g/km using a new 1.6 HDI engine.

The New C3 was presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2009. It was launched in November 2009, as a 2010 model. Across Europe, the advertising slogan was known as &quot;The Visiospace&quot;, playing on the merit of the large windscreen and the improved vision afforded.

===Facelift===
Launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2013, the C3 hatchback was revised to featuring updated exterior and interior, and more efficient engines. The C3 facelift comes with updated chevrons and bumper-mounted LED daytime running lights at the front and new tail light clusters combined with new reflectors set underneath the rear bumper.

===Safety===
The C3 in its most basic Latin American market configuration received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in 2015.

The C3 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2009.

===Variants===

There are four trim levels in the C3 range, which range from the entry-level VT (which does not have the panoramic windscreen), the mid-range VTR+ and eco-efficient &quot;Airdream+&quot; (which has lower emissions) to the top of the range Exclusive, which has half cloth half Alcantara seats, extra chrome outside, alloy wheels, an alarm, folding mirrors, and power windows all around.

Trim levels are denoted by a small badge on the rear window frame on the VT/VTR+ and Airdream+ and by a small chrome badge on each front door on Exclusive models. Norev has produced a 1:43 scale model of the new Citroën C3 in Botticelli Blue, Metallic Green, and black.

===Engines and transmissions===


By 2016, a 1.6HDi with 5-speed gearbox was available.

==Third generation (SX/SY; 2016)==
The official pictures of the new C3 were revealed on 29 June 2016. The C3 takes front styling cues from the facelifted Citroën C4 Picasso, as well as the Grand C4 Picasso. It receives optional side Airbump mouldings as used on the Citroën C4 Cactus.

The new C3 is offered with a choice of nine exterior colours, and three contrast shades that appear on the roof, foglight trims, side mirrors, and Airbump surrounds. Citroën claims the range will offer a total of 36 different colour combinations.

===Safety===
The C3 in its standard European market configuration received 4 stars from Euro NCAP in 2017.

=== Facelift (2020) ===
The restyled version was revealed in February 2020. The main evolutions are on the front and on the headlights with new LEDs. There are two new colours, &quot;Spring Blue&quot; and &quot;Rouge Elixir&quot;, and two new interior atmospheres called &quot;Techwood&quot; and &quot;Emeraude&quot;.

Launched in 2023, C3 You is the new entry-level version.

===Engines and transmissions===

== Fourth generation (CC21) ==

=== Europe (2024) ===

The European market fourth-generation C3 was introduced on 17 October 2023 and produced in 2024. The model is based on the Smart Car Platform, which will underpin 7 models produced by Stellantis in the future. It is described as a more efficient alternative to other STLA modular architectures with focus on battery electric models.

Compared to the Indian market C3, the European version C3 features C-shaped LED headlights, an enclosed grille that features Citroën&#x27;s new logo, triple element LED DRLs, distinct front fenders and door designs, conventional grab door handles, different taillights, a different rear bumper design and the option of larger alloy wheels. The C3 is the first model to feature Citroën&#x27;s new design language and new logo, which were both previewed by the Oli Concept in 2022.

For the interior, the European version C3 features a layered dashboard layout, opposed to the Indian-market C3 which has an older interior layout with basic controls. It features the C-Zen Lounge concept with Citroën&#x27;s Heads Up Display (which replaces the traditional instrument cluster) and a flat bottom design steering wheel.

For the first time in history, the C3 is equipped with Citroën Advanced Comfort® Suspension along with new Citroën Advanced Comfort® Seats.

The design of the fourth-generation C3 resembles crossover SUVs, with a ground clearance, higher than its predecessor. The C3 also features a higher roof line, which creates a larger cabin with additional front headroom and of added rear knee room, despite being only longer and wider.

The ë-C3 is equipped with a 44 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery capable of an electric range of up to measured by the WLTP cycle. The electric motor allows the vehicle to reach in around 11 seconds.

Citroen simplified the fourth-generation C3 and ë-C3 range with two trim levels and no optional extras, but the only customisable option is the exterior colour. The basic trim does not come with an infotainment screen, however one can connect their phone so they can control the car&#x27;s media.

=== India and Latin America (2022) ===

The third generation C3 for Indian and Latin American markets was released on 16 September 2021 and produced since 2022. Produced in Brazil and India, the model has been described by Citroën as a &quot;modern hatchback&quot;, avoiding the &quot;crossover SUV&quot; branding.

The exterior has crossover SUV styling with its high ground clearance, high bonnet, roof rails and black cladding. There are split headlights connected to Citroen’s double-slat grill, the option of orange accents on the front bumper and side cladding, an upright rear hatch door and rectangular LED taillights.

The interior has a touchscreen infotainment system, a dimpled-effect on the dashboard panel, a raised driving position and the colour of the dashboard and seat fabrics can be customised.

In India, the C3 is praised for its dynamic qualities, but receives persistent criticism for the lack of equipment offered on the model. As a result of this criticism, Citroën revised its offering in this market in August 2024, adding automatic climate control, a new instrument cluster inherited from the Citroën C3 Aircross and Citroën Basalt, and 6 airbags as standard.

==== ë-C3 ====
In January 2023, Citroën unveiled the all-electric ë-C3 in India with a electric motor, a 29.2 kWh battery and a range of . The ë-C3 has blue &#x27;ë&#x27; badges on the front doors, a charging port on front fender, the omission of a tailpipe and the only interior difference is a selector switch instead of a gear knob compared to the regular C3.

<text>John Gabriel Stedman (1744 – 7 March 1797) was a Dutch States Army officer and writer best known for writing &quot;The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam&quot; (1796). This narrative covers describes his experience in Suriname between 1773 and 1777, where he was a soldier in a Dutch regiment deployed to assist colonial troops fighting against groups of Maroons. He first recorded his experiences in a personal diary that he later rewrote and expanded into the &quot;Narrative&quot;. The &quot;Narrative&quot; was a bestseller of the time and, with its firsthand depictions of slavery and other aspects of colonialism, became an important tool in the fledgling abolitionist movement. When compared with Stedman&#x27;s personal diary, his published &quot;Narrative&quot; is a sanitized and romanticized version of Stedman&#x27;s time in Surinam.

== Early life ==
Stedman was born in 1744 in Dendermonde, then in the Austrian Netherlands, to Robert Stedman, a Scotsman and officer in the Dutch Republic&#x27;s Scots Brigade, and his Franco-Dutch wife, Antoinetta Christina van Ceulen. He lived most of his childhood in the Dutch Republic with his parents, but also spent time with his uncle in Scotland. Stedman described his childhood as being &quot;chock-full of misadventures and abrasive encounters of every description&quot;.

==Military career==
Stedman&#x27;s military career began at the age of 16. His first commanded rank was ensign, under which he defended various Low Country outposts in the employment of the Dutch Stadthouder. His rank was later elevated to lieutenant. In 1771, Stedman reenlisted because of overwhelming debt after the death of his father.

Stedman left the Dutch Republic on 24 December 1772, after responding to a call for volunteers to serve in the West Indies. He was given the rank of Captain by way of a &quot;brevet&quot;, a temporary and honorary authorization for an officer to hold a higher rank. His corps comprised 800 volunteers to be sent to Surinam aboard the frigate &quot;Zeelust&quot; to assist local troops fighting against marauding bands of escaped slaves, known as Maroons, in the eastern region of the colony. The corps, which was trained for the battlefields of Europe, was unprepared for battle against the unfamiliar guerrilla tactics of its opponents.

After arriving in the colony, Stedman received orders from Colonel Fourgeoud, commander of the newly arrived troops. Fourgeoud was known for dining on gourmet meats, wine and other delicacies while his troops survived on meager and often spoiled rations. He treated Stedman cruelly, inventing tasks for him to complete and taking away his ammunition. Stedman believed that Fourgeoud neglected his duties as an officer, ignoring the well-being of his troops, and that he only retained his title through monetary bribes. Regarding Fourgeoud&#x27;s poor leadership, Stedman was uncompromising: &quot;I solemnly declare to have still omitted many other calamities that we suffered&quot;.

On 10 August 1775, shortly after falling ill in Surinam, Stedman wrote Colonel Fourgeoud a letter requesting both a furlough to regain health and six months&#x27; military pay that was owed him. Fourgeoud refused his request twice, although he granted similar requests to other officers. Stedman later wrote, &quot;This so incensed me that I not only wished him in Hell, but myself also, to have the satisfaction of seeing him burn&quot;.

In addition to the 800 European soldiers, Stedman fought alongside the newly formed Free Negro Corps, which consisted of Black slaves purchased from their enslavers. Soldiers of the unit were promised their freedom, a house with a garden plot and pay for service in action against the maroons. The Corps originally numbered 116 men, but 190 more were purchased and incorporated into the unit after the first group of troops displayed courage and perseverance in action.

Stedman served in seven campaigns in the forests of Surinam, each averaging three months. He only engaged in one battle, which took place in 1774 and concluded with the capture of the village of Gado Saby. A portrayal of this battle can be seen in the frontispiece of Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot;, which depicts Stedman standing over a dead slave in the foreground and a village burning in the distance.

Throughout these campaigns, ambushes occurred frequently and disease spread rapidly, resulting in an enormous loss of troops. These losses were so great that 830 additional European troops were sent from the Dutch Republic in 1775 to supplement the original 800. The campaigns were riddled with sickness, anger, fatigue, and death. Stedman observed the horrors of battle and the cat-and-mouse antics of both sides that resulted in merely pushing the battle across Surinam instead of quelling it.

==Surinam==
Surinam was first colonized by the governor of Barbados in the 1650s, then captured by the Dutch soon after, who quickly began to establish sugar plantations. In 1683 Surinam came under control of the Dutch West India Company. The colony developed an agricultural economy highly dependent on African slavery.

Two rivers were central to the colonies: the Orinoco and the Amazon. At the time of Stedman&#x27;s deployment, the Portuguese lived along the river Amazon and the Spanish along the river Orinoco. Dutch colonists were spread along the seaside and the French lived in a small settlement known as Cayenne.

==Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot;==
&quot;The Narrative of a Five Years Expedition against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam&quot; is an autobiographical account of Stedman&#x27;s experiences in Surinam from the year 1773 through 1777. While Stedman kept a diary of his time in Surinam, which is held by the University of Minnesota Libraries, the &quot;Narrative&quot; manuscript wasn&#x27;t composed until ten years after his return to Europe. In the &quot;Narrative&quot; manuscript, Stedman vividly describes the landscapes of Suriname, paying great attention to flora, fauna, and the social habits of indigenous, free and enslaved Africans, and European colonists in Suriname. His observations of life in the colony encompass the different cultures present at the time: Dutch, Scottish, native, African, Spanish, Portuguese, and French. Stedman also takes time to describe the day-to-day life in the colony.

The first pages of the &quot;Narrative&quot; record Stedman&#x27;s voyage to Surinam. He spends his days reading on the deck of the &quot;Boreas&quot;, attempting to avoid those sick from the turbulent sea. The &quot;Boreas&quot; was accompanied by another ship the &quot;Weftellingwerf&quot; and three new frigate built transports. Stedman first arrives in Surinam on 2 February 1773. Upon his arrival in Surinam, Stedman and the troops are met by residents of the fortress Amsterdam, along the Surinam River. Here, Stedman gives his first description of the landscape of Surinam. According to Stedman, the land abounded with delicious smells – lemon, orange, and shaddocks. The natives, dressed in loincloths, were somewhat shocking to Stedman at first, and he described them as &quot;bargemen as naked as when they were born.&quot;

Parts of the &quot;Narrative&quot; continue to focus on descriptions of Surinam&#x27;s natural environments. Stedman writes that parts of Surinam are mountainous, dry, and barren, but much of the land is ripe and fertile, enjoying a year-long growing season, with rains and a warm climate. He notes that in some parts the land is low and marshy, and crops are grown with a &quot;flooding&quot; method of irrigation similar to that used in ancient Egypt. Stedman also describes Surinam as having large uncultivated areas; there are immense forests, mountains (some with valuable minerals), deep marsh, swamps, and even large savanna areas. Some areas of the coast are inaccessible, with navigational obstructions such as rocks, riverbanks, quicksand, and bogs.

In his &quot;Narrative&quot;, Stedman writes about the contrast between the beauty of the colony and his first taste of the violence and cruelty endemic there. One of his first observations involves the torture of a nearly naked enslaved woman, chained to an iron weight. His narrative describes the woman receiving 200 lashes and carrying the weight for a month as a result of her inability to fulfill a task to which she was assigned.

Over the course of his &quot;Narrative&quot;, Stedman relays several stories regarding the state of the slaves and the horrors to which they are subjected. In one story detailed in his &quot;Narrative&quot;, involving a group sailing by boat, an enslaved mother was ordered by her mistress to hand over her crying baby. The mistress then threw the baby into the river, drowning it. The mother jumped into the river after her baby, whose body was recovered by fellow slaves. The mother later received 200 lashes for her defiant behavior. In another story, a small boy shoots himself in the head to escape flogging. In yet another, a man is completely broken on the rack and left for days to suffer until he died.

===Publication history===
Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; was published by Joseph Johnson, a radical figure who received criticism for the types of books he sold. In the 1790s, more than 50 percent of them were political, including Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot;. The books he published supported the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners and other oppressed peoples around the world. Johnson was an active member of the Society for Constitutional Information, an organization attempting to reform Parliament. He was condemned for the support and publication of writers who voiced liberal opinions, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine.

Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; became a major literary success. It was translated into French, German, Dutch, Italian, and Swedish, and was eventually published in more than twenty-five different editions, including several abolitionist tracts focused on Joanna. Stedman was highly acclaimed for his insights on the slave trade and his &quot;Narrative&quot; was embraced by the abolitionist cause. Paradoxically, it also became the handbook for counter-insurgency tactics in the tropics.

It took almost two centuries for a critical edition to be published. The unabridged critical edition, edited by Richard and Sally Price, was published in 1988. An abridged edition published in 1992 by Price and Price remains in print, as well as two editions published in 1962 and 1966 by the renowned antiquarian Stanbury Thompson. Of Thompson&#x27;s 1962 and 1966 editions, Price and Price write, &quot;Thompson&#x27;s work confused as much as it elucidated. Examination of the original notebooks and papers that Thompson had used (which are now in the James Ford Bell Library at the University of Minnesota) revealed that, not only had he inserted his own commentary into that of Stedman...but he had changed dates and spellings, misread and incorrectly transcribed a large number of words&quot;. A facsimile edition of the 1988 unabridged critical edition of Stedman&#x27;s original 1790 manuscript, edited by Richard and Sally Price, was published in 2010 by iUniverse and in 2016 by Open Road. This latter edition remains available.

===Blake&#x27;s illustrations===
Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; associated him with some of Europe&#x27;s foremost radicals. His publisher, Johnson, was imprisoned in 1797 for printing the political writings of Gilbert Wakefield. Johnson commissioned William Blake and Francesco Bartolozzi to create engravings for the &quot;Narrative&quot;. Blake engraved sixteen images for the book and delivered them in December 1792 and 1793, as well as a single plate in 1794. The images depict some of the horrific atrocities against slaves that Stedman witnessed, including hanging, lashing and other forms of torture. The Blake plates are more forceful than other illustrations in the book and have the &quot;fluidity of line&quot; and &quot;hallucinatory quality of his original work&quot;. It is impossible to compare Stedman&#x27;s sketches with the Blake plates because none of Stedman&#x27;s original drawings have survived. Through their collaboration, Blake and Stedman became close friends. They visited one another often, and Blake later included some of his images from Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; in his poem &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot;.

===Stedman the writer===
As a writer, Stedman was intrigued by Surinam, a &quot;New World&quot; full of complexities that were both familiar and foreign. Torn between the roles of &quot;incurable romantic&quot; and scientific observer, Stedman attempted to maintain an objective distance from this strange new world, but was drawn in by its natural beauty and what he perceived as its exoticness.

Stedman made a daily effort to take notes on the spot, using any material in sight that could be written on, including ammunition cartridges and bleached bone. Stedman later transcribed the notes and strung them together in a small green notebook and ten sheets of paper covered front and back with writing. He intended to use these notes and journals to produce a book. Stedman also made a point to write clearly and distinguish truth from hearsay. He was diligent about facts and focused primarily on firsthand accounts of events.

On 15 June 1778, just a year after returning to the Netherlands from Surinam, Stedman began piecing together these notes and journals into what would ultimately become his &quot;Narrative&quot;. In 1787, Stedman began showing pieces of his journal to friends in an attempt to secure financial backing for the publication of the manuscript. He also attempted to gain potential subscribers in major cities throughout Europe. On 8 February 1791, Stedman sent the first edition of his newly completed manuscript, along with a list of 76 subscribers, to Johnson.

In 1786, Stedman wrote a series of retrospective journal entries recalling the events of his life up to the age of 28. In this diary, he portrayed himself in the style and tone of such fictional characters as Tom Jones and Roderick Random. He elaborated on his opposition to authority figures, which he also described during his time in Surinam, and on the sympathy he felt towards creatures and humans unnecessarily punished or tortured. In these entries, Stedman tells of occasions throughout his life when he interceded on the behalf of others to alleviate suffering. Stedman insisted that he did not describe the events of his life with the intention of gaining success or fortune. He explained that he wrote &quot;purely following the dictates of nature, &amp; equally hating a made up man and a made up story.&quot;

===Discrepancies between published &quot;Narrative&quot; and personal diaries===

Stedman wrote his &quot;Narrative&quot; ten years after the events took place. The &quot;Narrative&quot; sometimes deviates from the diary, but Stedman was careful to provide his sources and state firsthand observations as opposed to outside accounts. One of the main differences between the two works involves Stedman&#x27;s representation of his relationship with Joanna. In the diary, he recounts numerous sexual encounters with enslaved women before he met Joanna, events which were removed from the &quot;Narrative&quot;. Stedman omitted a series of negotiations between himself and Joanna&#x27;s mother, during which she offers to sell Joanna to him. Stedman also removes the early sexual encounters from the &quot;Narrative&quot;, and Joanna is represented as a romantic figure whom Stedman describes with sentimental and flowery language, as opposed to an enslaved girl who served his sexual and domestic needs. Mary Louise Pratt refers to these changes as a &quot;romantic transformation of a particular form of colonial sexual exploitation&quot;.

==Stedman and slavery==
Stedman&#x27;s attitude toward slaves and slavery has been the subject of scholarly debate. In spite of the abolitionist utility of the text, Stedman himself was far from an abolitionist. A defense of slavery runs throughout the text, emphasizing problems that would arise from sudden emancipation. In fact, Stedman believed that slavery was necessary in some form to continue allowing European nations to indulge their excessive desires for commodities such as tobacco and sugar. A seemingly pro-slavery attitude is espoused throughout much of his text.

Stedman&#x27;s relationship with the slave Joanna further complicates his views toward slavery. Given Joanna&#x27;s status as a enslaved woman and her young age at the time their relationship began, their relationship may be considered a form of &quot;colonial sexual exploitation&quot;. Stedman described their relationship as one &quot;of romantic love rather than filial servitude,&quot; although Joanna&#x27;s feelings on the relationship are unknown - as is often the case with women of color who are said to have had consensual relationships with powerful white men, such as La Malinche and Sacagawea.

The &quot;Narrative&quot; is also an ethnocentric text. Some critics argue that the book made Stedman seem like a much more consistent pro-slavery advocate than he intended. But Stedman&#x27;s attitudes toward individual slaves did not coincide with his attitude toward the institution of slavery. His sympathy for the suffering slaves, expressed throughout the book, is consistently obfuscated by his opinion about slavery as an institution, which according to Werner Sollors was &quot;complicated, its representation strongly affected by the revisions.&quot;

==Sexual encounters==
According to the editorial introduction to the &quot;Narrative&quot;, Stedman &quot;larded his autobiographical sketch with amorous adventures.&quot; For example, as a young man growing up in Holland, Stedman had concurrent affairs with his landlord&#x27;s wife and her maid until the landlady became jealous and evicted both Stedman and the maid simultaneously. Stedman details frequent sexual encounters with free and enslaved women of African descent in his travel diary, beginning on 9 February 1773, the night he arrived in Suriname&#x27;s capital, Paramaribo. 9 February is recounted with the following entry: &quot;Our troops were disembarked at Parramaribo...I get at a tavern, go to sleep at Mr. Lolkens, who was in the country, I f—k one of his negro maids&quot;.

The personal journal that Stedman kept (and the sexual encounters mentioned therein) varies quite a bit from his published &quot;Narrative&quot;. The image-conscious Stedman, with a wife and children back in Europe, wanted to cultivate the impression of a gentleman rather than the serial adulterer he portrays in his diaries. Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; removes the depersonalized sex with women of color and replaces it with more detail regarding his relationship with Joanna. Price and Price summarize these changes as &quot;While his diaries depicted a society in which depersonalized sex between European men and slave women was pervasive and routine, his 1790 manuscript transformed Suriname into the exotic setting for a deeply romantic and appropriately tragic love affair.&quot;

===Joanna===

Stedman first mentions Joanna by name in his journal on 11 April 1773 in relation to his negotiation with her mother for the purchasing of Joanna&#x27;s sexual and domestic services: &quot;J—, her Mother, and Q— mother come to a close bargain with me, we put it of for reasons I gave them.&quot; Stedman eventually negotiates an arrangement with Joanna&#x27;s mother, which he indicates in this diary entry: &quot;J—a comes to stay with me. I give her presents to the value of about ten Pound sterling and am perfectly happy.&quot; In the 1790 manuscript edition of Stedman&#x27;s travel narrative, edited and expanded on from his travel diary, he praised the physical appearance of Joanna, &quot;bespeaking the Goodness of her heart&quot;.

Throughout the &quot;Narrative&quot;, Stedman praises Joanna&#x27;s character. He often describes instances of what he viewed as her loyalty and devotion to him through his absences and illnesses:

In the nineteenth century, abolitionists circulated Stedman and Joanna&#x27;s story, most notably in Lydia Maria Child&#x27;s collection &quot;The Oasis&quot; in 1834. The first abridged edition of Stedman&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; to concentrate on Joanna&#x27;s narrative was published in 1824, titled &quot;Joanna, or The Female Slave, a West Indian Tale&quot;. The anonymous compiler of the 1824 version writes in the preface that emancipation is &quot;neither practicable or advisable&quot; but advocates for &quot;the abolition of cruelty&quot;. In 1838, Isaac Knapp, a Boston abolitionist and printer, published &quot;Narrative of Joanna; An Emancipated Slave, of Surinam.&quot; Knapp founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832 along with William Lloyd Garrison. Knapp and Garrison also co-founded the abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot; in 1831. Like Lydia Maria Child&#x27;s version of Stedman and Joanna&#x27;s narrative included in the abolitionist collection &quot;The Oasis&quot; in 1834, &quot;Narrative of Joanna&quot; was circulated in a distinctly American abolitionist discourse.

Stedman and Joanna had a son, named Johnny. Johnny was eventually freed from slavery, but not Joanna. However, when Stedman returned to the Dutch Republic in June 1777, Joanna and their son stayed behind in Surinam. Stedman explained this by saying that Joanna refused to return with him:

Shortly after his return to the Dutch Republic, Stedman married a Dutch woman, Adriana Wierts van Coehorn, and started a family with her. According to Stanbury Thompson&#x27;s edition of Stedman&#x27;s journals, Joanna died in 1782, after which their son migrated to Europe to live with Stedman and was educated at Blundell&#x27;s School. Johnny later served as a midshipman in the Royal Navy and died at sea near Jamaica.

===Stedman&#x27;s family in Devon===
Stedman&#x27;s wife, Adriana, was the wealthy granddaughter of a well-known Dutch engineer. Together they settled in Tiverton, Devonshire, and had five children: Sophia Charlotte, Maria Joanna, George William, Adrian, and John Cambridge. Following the death of Joanna, Johnny joined their household. Adriana made no attempt to hide her feelings of resentment toward Johnny and Stedman often protected his son from her wrath. Stedman favored his first son and later wrote a journal almost entirely devoted to accounts of Johnny&#x27;s adolescence. After Johnny&#x27;s death, Stedman published a poem he wrote for his son, eulogizing their relationship. The last lines are as follows:

Stedman&#x27;s daughters were married to prosperous men of good families. His other sons joined the military. George William served as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and died while attempting to board a Spanish ship off the coast of Cuba in 1803. Adrian fought in the First Anglo-Sikh War for which he was later honored after participating in the Battle of Aliwal against the Sikhs, and died at sea in 1849. John Cambridge served as captain of the 34th Light Infantry of the East India Company military and was killed in an attack on Rangoon in 1824.

==Final years and death==
Little is known about the final years of Stedman&#x27;s life. The &quot;Army List&quot; continued to print his name until 1805, after he had been dead for eight years. On 5 July 1793, he was commissioned as a major in the second battalion of the Scots Brigade, and promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 3 May 1796. The title page of his book notes that he reached the rank of captain, via the brevet given at the start of his deployment in the West Indies. According to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, family tradition maintains that Stedman suffered a severe accident around 1796 which prevented him from commanding a regiment at Gibraltar. He retired to Tiverton, Devon. Instructions left by Stedman before his death requested that he be buried in the parish of Bickleigh next to self-styled gypsy king Bampfylde Moore Carew. He asked specifically to be interred at precisely midnight by torchlight. Stedman&#x27;s final request was apparently not honored in full, as his grave lies in front of the vestry door, on the opposite side of the church from Carew.

<doc id="273092" wikidata="Q4876193" url="?curid=273092" title="Beam tilt">
<text>Beam tilt is used in radio to aim the main lobe of the vertical plane radiation pattern of an antenna below (or above) the horizontal plane.

The simplest way is mechanical beam tilt, where the antenna is physically mounted in such a manner as to lower the angle of the signal on one side. However, this also raises it on the other side, making it useful in only very limited situations.

More common is electrical beam tilt, where the phasing between antenna elements is tweaked to make the signal go down (usually) in all directions. This is extremely useful when the antenna is at a very high point, and the edge of the signal is likely to miss the target (broadcast audience, cellphone users, etc.) entirely.

With electrical tilting, front and back lobes tilt in the same direction. For example, an electrical downtilt will make both the front lobe and the back lobe tilt down. This is the property used in the above example where the signal is pointed down in all directions. On the contrary, mechanical downtilting will make the front lobe tilt down and the back lobe tilt up. In almost all practical cases, antennas are only tilted down – though tilting up is technically possible.

The use of purely electrical tilt with no mechanical tilt is an attractive choice for aesthetic reasons which are very important for operators seeking acceptance of integrated antennas in visible locations.

In GSM and UMTS cellular networks, mechanical tilt is almost always fixed whereas electrical tilt can be controlled using remote actuators and position sensors, thus reducing operating expenses. Remote electrical tilt is abbreviated as RET and it is part of the Antenna Interface Standards Group&#x27;s open specification for the control interface of antenna devices.

Occasionally, mechanical and electrical tilt will be used together in order to create greater beam tilt in one direction than the other, mainly to accommodate unusual terrain. Along with null fill, beam tilt is the essential parameter controlling the focus of radio communications, and together they can create almost infinite combinations of 3-D radiation patterns for any situation.

== Beam tilt optimization ==
Beam tilt optimization is a network optimization technique used in mobile networks aiming at controlling the inclination of the vertical tilt angle of the antenna in order to optimize a set of network performance indicators.

Different studies in beam tilt optimization focus on Coverage-Capacity Optimization (CCO), for which the goal is to control the beam tilt in order to jointly optimize the radio coverage and capacity in the network cells and reduce interference from neighbouring cells.

There exists mainly two types of approaches to beam tilt optimization:

# Rule-based algorithms: consist of optimization strategies based on domain knowledge and control theory, and mainly based on the optimization of utility metrics, or threshold-based policies employing Fuzzy Logic (FL) to model representative network performance indicators.
# Data-driven algorithms : consist of optimization strategies based on the use learning techniques based on the availability of network data (e.g. Contextual Bandit (CB) techniques), or by directly interacting with the environment (e.g. Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques )

<text>Knights and Knaves is a type of logic puzzle where some characters can only answer questions truthfully, and others only falsely. The name was coined by Raymond Smullyan in his 1978 work &quot;What Is the Name of This Book?&quot;

The puzzles are set on a fictional island where all inhabitants are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie. The puzzles involve a visitor to the island who meets small groups of inhabitants. Usually the aim is for the visitor to deduce the inhabitants&#x27; type from their statements, but some puzzles of this type ask for other facts to be deduced. The puzzle may also be to determine a yes–no question which the visitor can ask in order to discover a particular piece of information.

One of Smullyan&#x27;s examples of this type of puzzle involves three inhabitants referred to as A, B and C. The visitor asks A what type they are, but does not hear A&#x27;s answer. B then says &quot;A said that they are a knave&quot; and C says &quot;Don&#x27;t believe B; they are lying!&quot; To solve the puzzle, note that no inhabitant can say that they are a knave. Therefore, B&#x27;s statement must be untrue, so they are a knave, making C&#x27;s statement true, so they are a knight. Since A&#x27;s answer invariably would be &quot;I&#x27;m a knight&quot;, it is not possible to determine whether A is a knight or knave from the information provided.

Maurice Kraitchik presents the same puzzle in the 1953 book &quot;Mathematical Recreations&quot;, where two groups on a remote island – the Arbus and the Bosnins – either lie or tell the truth, and respond to the same question as above.

In some variations, inhabitants may also be alternators, who alternate between lying and telling the truth, or normals, who can say whatever they want. A further complication is that the inhabitants may answer yes–no questions in their own language, and the visitor knows that &quot;bal&quot; and &quot;da&quot; mean &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; but does not know which is which. These types of puzzles were a major inspiration for what has become known as &quot;the hardest logic puzzle ever&quot;.

== Examples ==

A large class of elementary logical puzzles can be solved using the laws of Boolean algebra and logic truth tables. Familiarity with Boolean algebra and its simplification process will help with understanding the following examples.

Alice and Bob are residents of the island of knights and knaves.

=== Both knaves ===
Alice says, &quot;We are both knaves”.

In this case, Alice is a knave and Bob is a knight. Alice&#x27;s statement cannot be true, because a knave admitting to being a knave would be the same as a liar telling the truth that &quot;I am a liar&quot;, which is known as the liar paradox. Since Alice is a knave this means she must have been lying about them &quot;both&quot; being knaves, and so Bob is a knight.

=== Same or different kinds ===
Alice says, &quot;We are the same kind,&quot; but Bob says, &quot;We are of different kinds.&quot;

In this scenario they are making contradictory statements, so one must be a knight and one must be a knave. Since that is exactly what Bob said, Bob must be the knight, and Alice is the knave.

=== Identity alone ===
If all one wants to know is whether someone is a knight or a knave, this can be tested by simply asking a question to which the answer is already known. In the film &quot;The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser&quot;, a character solves the puzzle of whether a man is a knight or a knave by suggesting asking the man &quot;whether he was a tree frog&quot;.

=== Fork in the road ===

This is perhaps the most famous rendition of this type of puzzle: This version of the puzzle was further popularised by a scene in the 1986 fantasy film, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, in which the protagonist finds herself faced with two doors with guardians who follow the rules of the puzzle. One door leads to the castle at the centre of the labyrinth, and one to certain death. It had also appeared some ten years previously, in a very similar form, in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;.
This version of the puzzle was also used in the episode &quot;Jack Tales&quot; of the 2nd season of the American animated TV series &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;. It was again used in 4th season of the Belgian reality TV show &quot;De Mol&quot; in 2016.
There are several ways to find out which way leads to freedom. All can be determined by using Boolean algebra and a truth table.

In &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s solution is to ask one of the guards: &quot;Would tell me that door leads to the castle?&quot; With this question, the knight will tell the truth about a lie, while the knave will tell a lie about the truth. Therefore, the given answer will always be the opposite of the correct answer to the question of whether the door leads to the castle.

Another posited solution is to ask either man if they would say that their own path leads to freedom. In this case, the idea is that the knave, rather than lying about a truthful answer, will be forced to lie about the lie he would tell (ie, answer with a double negative), thus both knight and knave will give the correct answer.

=== Goodman&#x27;s 1931 variant ===
The philosopher Nelson Goodman anonymously published another version in the Boston Post issue of June 8, 1931, with &quot;nobles&quot; never lying and &quot;hunters&quot; never telling the truth. Three inhabitants &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; meet some day, and &quot;A&quot; says either &quot;I am a noble&quot; or &quot;I am a hunter&quot;, we don&#x27;t yet know which. Then &quot;B&quot;, in reply to a query, says &quot;&quot;A&quot; said, &#x27;I am a hunter&#x27;&quot;. After that, &quot;B&quot; says &quot;&quot;C&quot; is a hunter&quot;. Then, &quot;C&quot; says &quot;&quot;A&quot; is noble&quot;. Now the problem is, which is each, and why?

Since a hunter always lies, they cannot admit their own identity: therefore, A could not have admitted to being a hunter. This means that B must be a hunter, his allegation directed at C must be false, and therefore A and C must be nobles.

Goodman reports the puzzle came back to him from various directions, including a 1936 Warsaw Logicians&#x27; meeting via Carnap; some echo versions were corrupted by joining &quot;B&quot; two utterances into a single one, which make the puzzle unsolvable. Some years later, Goodman heard about the fork in the road variant; having scruples about counterfactuals, he devised a non-subjunctive, non-contrary-to-fact question that can be asked.

<text>WSTE-DT (channel 7), branded on air as Teleisla, is a Spanish-language independent television station serving San Juan, Puerto Rico, that is licensed to Ponce. It is owned by TelevisaUnivision. The station maintains its studios on Calle Carazo in Guaynabo. To provide island-wide coverage, WSTE maintains a network of five transmitter sites, located at Cerro Maravilla in Ponce, at Cerro La Marquesa in Aguas Buenas, at Cerro Canta Gallo in Aguada, on Highway 22 in Arecibo, and at the Monte del Estado in San Germán.

==History==
===WRIK-TV===
The station first signed on as WRIK-TV on February 2, 1958, after receiving the FCC permit to go on the air on channel 7. It was the first television station in Ponce, and the fourth in Puerto Rico, after WKAQ-TV, WAPA-TV (both were established four years earlier), and WORA-TV (established three years earlier). It was owned by Alfredo Ramírez de Arellano. Its news director was Manuel Morales-Flores, with Felix Suria as production manager and Edmund Reid as its chief engineer. The station maintained a transmitter—originally located at El Vigía—and studios at the Edificio Darlington—the first high-rise building in Ponce, completed in 1952. Two years later, the transmitter was relocated to the Hotel Ponce Intercontinental.

WRIK-TV operated as a Spanish-language independent station; it carried some 18 daily programs, including news, movies, cartoons, and soap operas, among others. One notable show, airing in the late afternoons, was &quot;El Show de Tío Carlitos&quot;. In 1964, the station&#x27;s staff had expanded to include George A. Mayoral, president, general manager William Cortada, commercial manager and news director Luis A. &quot;Wito&quot; Morales, promotional manager Monsita M. Diaz, and chief engineer Americo Cintron. The transmitter was relocated atop Cerro Maravilla in 1967.

===Rikavisión===
In 1969, Ramírez de Arellano announced the sale of 80 percent of WRIK-TV to United Artists Corporation for a reported $7 million. Under United Artists, WRIK began operating from color-equipped studios in Ponce and San Juan and rebranded as Rikavisión. The station&#x27;s logo was a rooster. From San Juan, the station broadcast &quot;El Show de Tito Rodriguez&quot; for two seasons; the station also produced &quot;Ahi Va Eso&quot; (with Awilda Carbia, Jacobo Morales and Norma Candal), &quot;Contigo Anexo 3&quot; (which included a young Lou Briel), &quot;Showtime&quot; (with Wilkins), &quot;Las Caribelles&quot;, &quot;El Show de Carol Myles&quot;, and children&#x27;s show &quot;Rikalandia&quot; (hosted by Sandra Zaiter). One notable 1971 show was &quot;María&quot;, with Lucy Boscana. The station continued some programming from Ponce, including local newscasts. Its news anchor was Rafael L. Torres, in whose name the Southern Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce later created an Excellence in Journalism award.

====Cerro Maravilla incident====
In 1978, two pro-independence activists attempted to blow up the WRIK-TV transmitter tower at Cerro Maravilla in an effort to call attention to their cause. Their plan was discovered by police and the two young men were ambushed by police at the peak during their operation. They were arrested and then murdered by the police while still in their custody at the peak.

===Teleluz (1979–1987)===
In 1979, WRIK-TV was acquired by Puerto Rican producer Tommy Muñiz, owner of AM radio station WLUZ (or Radio Luz); its callsign was subsequently changed to WLUZ-TV (branded as &quot;Teleluz&quot;) on March 28, 1979.

Programs shown during this era included a continuation of Sandra Zaiter&#x27;s children&#x27;s show and live, low-budgeted professional boxing telecasts from around Puerto Rico on Saturday nights. Boxers who fought on Teleluz frequently included Julian and Rafi Solis, Felix Trinidad Sr. and Victor Callejas.

===SuperSiete / Teleisla (1987–present)===
Financial troubles forced Muñiz to sell the station to Malrite Communications Group for $1.3 million in 1985. In 1987, the station was rebranded as SuperSiete, and on February 18, 1987, the station changed its call letters to WSTE.

The station experienced limited success at the time using colorful motion graphics and a new logo as well as major advertising in newspapers, and televising popular American sitcoms of the time, such as &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, along with major Hollywood movies. It also was acknowledged for its children&#x27;s show &quot;El Show de Burbujita y Bolillo&quot;, produced by Milly Cangiano, and its Saturday morning cartoons. Around this time, one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s longest-running shows, &quot;No te Duermas&quot; with Antonio Sánchez &quot;El Gangster&quot;, began airing on channel 7 as well. WSTE also produced a successful game show, &quot;La Hora de Oro&quot; with Hector Marcano and Sánchez, and two family-oriented sitcoms, &quot;Maripili&quot; and &quot;El Cuartel de la Risa&quot;. SuperSiete also broadcast five daily news segments named &quot;Noticapsulas&quot; (literal translation: news capsules) hosted by news reporter Doris Torres.

In 1991, Malrite bought WLII-TV and WSUR-TV and sold WSTE to Siete Grande Television, Inc., owned by Florida entrepreneur Jerry Hartman. WSTE was then branded as &quot;El Nuevo SuperSiete&quot; (&quot;The New SuperSeven&quot;). During the 1990s, WSTE was rebranded as &quot;Tele-Isla&quot; during prime time hours. Due to the failure of the new programming, and the lack of full island coverage by WLII at the time, WSTE began re-broadcasting WLII&#x27;s prime time programming mainly for the western and central areas of Puerto Rico.

In 1995, WLII entered into an affiliation agreement with WORA-TV. This created a conflict with the FCC, as WLII&#x27;s programming was being rebroadcast by two different stations across the island; WLII and WSTE in the north, WSUR-TV and WSTE in the south, and WSTE, WNJX-TV and WORA-TV in the west. During this time, the channel proudly showed its coverage channels on its &quot;ident&quot;, as 11-9-7-5-22. After admonishment by the FCC, WLII dropped WSTE and WNJX-TV coverage.

After that point (sometime in 1995) and to this day, the station mostly airs infomercials and locally-produced advertisements for car dealerships. The station aired horse racing from Hipodromo Camarero from 2013 to 2020.

On March 23, 2007, Siete Grande Television, Inc. announced it would sell WSTE to Univision Communications. The sale was approved by the FCC on October 11, 2007. On June 23, 2009, the station&#x27;s call letters were revised to WSTE-DT.

The channel&#x27;s SuperSiete &quot;ident&quot; animation, logo, and name survived for over 25 years, dating back to 1987. A new logo with the Teleisla branding was introduced a few months before the FCC-mandated digital transition date of June 12, 2009. On January 2, 2012, WSTE-DT introduced a new logo in the form of a four-color clover (orange representing morning, green representing afternoon, violet representing weekend, and blue representing nightly programming). The station also expanded its broadcast day to 1:00 a.m. On November 1, 2012, Dish Network began carrying WSTE-DT on channel 12. In early 2016, WSTE-DT expanded its broadcast schedule to 24 hours a day, and adding the health program &quot;Hablando de Salud&quot; from 1:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:


===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WSTE shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, at noon on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 8 to channel 7 for its post-transition operations.

===Transmitter facilities===
To effectively cover all of Puerto Rico, WSTE used booster-type translator facilities across the island prior to the analog shutdown. In order for this booster system to work without any interference, WSTE&#x27;s main transmitter had to be kept silent. The Ponce area was thus served from an auxiliary station transmitting at 100 kW. WSTE now uses a five-site, digital distributed transmission system to cover the island as the booster system had done before it.

<text>The Peugeot 106 is a supermini produced by French automaker Peugeot between 1991 and 2003. Launched in September 1991, it was Peugeot&#x27;s entry level offering throughout its production life, and was initially sold only as a three-door hatchback, with a five-door hatchback joining the range in the beginning of 1992. Production ended in July 2003.

For the first year of production, the 1.0 and 1.1 petrol engines came with a carburettor, but were replaced by fuel injected engines from the end of 1992, as a result of EEC emissions regulations.

==Phase I (1991–1996) ==
The &quot;10&quot; line of Peugeot superminis had commenced in 1972 with the launch of the 104, one of the first modern European superminis. The 104 was effectively replaced by the Peugeot 205 in 1983, but remained in production for some markets until 1988. There was no &quot;105&quot;.

The 106 was introduced as a three-door hatchback in continental Europe in September 1991, and two months later in the United Kingdom. The initial engine range had 1.0, 1.1 and 1.4 petrol engines, as well as a 1.5 diesel.

The early 1.0 and 1.1s were carburetted, but were replaced with fuel injection after a year due to EC emissions requirements.

==Phase II (1996–2003)==
It was updated in July 1996, with changes including the introduction of side impact bars and availability of driver and passenger airbags for the first time, with the new 1.6 GTI joining the range as the spiritual successor to the hugely popular and highly regarded 205 GTI, which had been discontinued in 1994.

In January 1996, the Peugeot 106 also formed the basis for the near identical looks and size Citroën Saxo.

The 106&#x27;s successor, the Peugeot 107, along with rebadged versions, Citroën C1 and Toyota Aygo, was launched two years later in June 2005, as a joint venture with Toyota.
==High performance variants==

Marketed as having &quot;fewer frills, more thrills&quot;, the Rallye version had trademark steel wheels painted white. Power steering, central locking, and electric windows were omitted to keep the weight down to .

There were pre and post facelift versions of the 106 Rallye known to enthusiasts as S1 and S2 models, with the latter having a 103 bhp 1.6 litre (TU5J2) engine in place of the original high revving Rallye specific 1.3 100 bhp (TU2J2) engine fitted to pre facelift cars.

Contrary to some sources, the S1 models did not share the same engine with the 205 Rallye and AX Sport, which used a carburettor TU24 engine. The dimensions of the aluminium S1 block resemble those of the 1.4 iron block with slightly lowered capacity to comply with the rules of the lower French rally classes at the time (under 1,300 cc). The S1 (TU2J2) and S2 (TU5J2) were fuel injected, employing Magneti Marelli multi point fuel injection systems.

The S1 Rallye were designed as a homologation special to compete in the 1300 cc rally class. It featured a four-cylinder, 8-valve, high compression engine with an aggressive cam profile designed to come &quot;on song&quot; between 5,400 and the 7,200 rpm redline.

This engine coupled to a short ratio five speed gearbox made the 1.3 more of a sprinter than a cruiser. 70 mph on the motorway was a noisy 4,000 rpm in fifth gear, but given enough tarmac, the 1.3 would redline in top gear at 115 mph.

The 106 was competitive in racing, but also made a practical small family car. All cars had steel wheels, and Rallye decals and seat coverings featuring a one or three colour flash, which again varied between early and late cars. With facelift came new top model named Peugeot 106 GTI with 1.6 litre 16 valves engine that produce 120 hp. It came with new exterior body kit and new wheels. On some markets in Europe, it was badged S16 or Rallye.

==Electric version==
In 1995, Peugeot launched an electric powered version of the 106, called the 106 Electrique. This was offered in a number of European countries including France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway and the United Kingdom.

The electric powertrain was developed and built by French engineering company Heuliez. The car used Nickel-cadmium battery technology manufactured by Saft Groupe S.A., had a top speed of 56 mph (90 km/h) and had an official range of .

Despite the high price of the vehicle, Peugeot anticipated demand for around 15,000 to 20,000 Peugeot 106 Électriques each year, with an expected total production run of 100,000 vehicles. In the end, only 6,400 Peugeot 106 Électriques were sold between 1995 and 2003, most purchased by the French Administration.

<text>The Peugeot 406 is a large family car that was produced by French automaker Peugeot between 1995 and 2004. Available in saloon, estate and coupé bodystyles with a choice of petrol or turbodiesel engines, the 406 replaced the Peugeot 405 in Peugeot&#x27;s lineup, and was itself replaced by the Peugeot 407.

==Phase 1==
The styling of the 406 is heavily influenced by its predecessor, the 405, which began to be phased out from the 406&#x27;s launch in September 1995, and eventually finished production in Europe in 1997, when the last estate models were discontinued. United Kingdom sales of the 406 began in February 1996.

The initial design of the Coupe was originally offered to Fiat by Pininfarina in about 1990, only for Fiat to reject the design and design its own coupe.

The 406 was notably successful in the United Kingdom, having broken into the country&#x27;s key fleet sales market, with a high percentage of units becoming company cars and taxis.

In August 2002, a Peugeot 406 HDi set the world record for the longest distance driven on a single tank of fuel. The car travelled across Australia between Melbourne to Rockhampton, with a total distance of 2,348 km. Knock-down kit versions of the car were also built at the Yontrakit Industrial Factory in Lad Krabang, Bangkok, Thailand.

Equipment

Initial trim levels consisted of SR, ST and top of the line SV with various optional features. 406 had many advanced optional features such as electric seats with memory, rain sensor, variable electronic suspension control, speed sensitive power steering and rear windscreen wiper on the saloon.

There was also a factory body kit available.

Suspension

For the front suspension, it has an inverted MacPherson suspension. For the rear suspension, Peugeot developed an all new and model exclusive multilink called RS10. It consist of three transverse control arms and a longitudinal arm.

Special features of the RS10 was that it could produce more negative toe on the outer wheel for stability in corners and more negative camber for stability when the rear end rises in emergency braking.

Engines

The car was available with a range of petrol engines: 1.6 8V, 1.8 16V and 2.0 16V, 2.0 8V turbo and 3.0(2946cc) V6 24V

For diesel, there was three engines: 1.9 8V turbodiesel, 2.1 12V turbodiesel and 2.0HDi 8V

== Coupé ==
The two door coupé, launched at the 1996 Paris Motor Show, was both designed and manufactured by Italian design studio Pininfarina, with choices of a 2.0 L four cylinder engine or a 3.0 L V6, and halfway through 2001, a 2.2 L HDi diesel engine. A total of 107,633 coupés were made.

The coupé has the same platform and suspension as saloon and estate but with some upgrades to enhance ride handling. All models had a wider track of 16mm from coupé specific rims and additional 36mm at the rear from different spindle and lower control arm. Ride height is lowered 16mm. V6 also received a 26mm front strut brace and 305mm Brembo 4-pot calipers front brakes.

Interior had the same dashboard, centre console and steering wheel as saloon and estate. It had five gauge instrument panel with chrome rings on all models.

=== Engines ===
==Phase 2==


The facelifted 406 saloon was introduced in February 1999 and safety, strength and speed enhancements resulted in improved Euro NCAP performance. Where the old 406 had one star and a struck off star, the post facelift models gained three stars.

New engine series was launched with the new and improved EW/DW Engine Family with greater power, torque and fuel efficiency along with increased refinement, making it comparatively quiet for a diesel. There was also a direct injected petrol dubbed HPi. The old 2.0 litre turbo petrol engine was succeeded by the N/A 2.2 petrol with VCT. Diesel engines got narrower radiator and the intercooler horizontally to the left beside the radiator.

The exterior front and rear got new bumpers and lights. As all models of the coupé the saloon and estate now had 16 inch wheels in some of the trim levels.

The interior was also updated to improve comfort and sound insulation. Updated equipment included automated digital climate control/air conditioning on most models except the most basic and a multi function display for warning messages, trip computer, radio and external temperature. Rear view mirror with auto dim was also a new feature.

Halfway into 2001, there was an important update for the 406 with the implementation of the PSA and Renault developed VAN bus, can be recognised by the updated next generation steering column stalks that implemented the radio and cruise control stalk in one module. Also a new diesel engine appeared with this update; the 2.2HDi 16 valve with DPF.

The top of the range &quot;Executive&quot; model was specified a ten speaker JBL sound system, electrically adjusted and heated leather seats and a memory position for the electric seats and mirrors.

=== Gallery ===
== Coupé Phase 2 ==
Exterior was mostly unchanged on the coupé. Side turnlight was the first update and new rims and a new front bumper was added later on.

Interior was updated in the same manner as the saloon and estate with updated dashboard and instrument panel and colours.

Technical updates also followed the saloon/estate. But the engine range grew to four with the addition of the 2.2 petrol and 2.2HDi, the latter with Brembo front brakes.


==Awards==
The 406 was awarded 1997 &quot;What Car?&quot; &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, as well as 1997 and 2001 Caravan Club &quot;Towcar of the Year&quot;. It was also awarded Semperit Irish Car of the Year for 1997, however, it lost out by a narrow margin of 15 points in the 1996 European Car of the Year award to the Fiat Bravo/Brava.

==Motorsport==

Laurent Aïello won the 1997 ADAC Deutsche Super Touren Wagen-Cup driving a Peugeot 406 for Peugeot Esso. The 406 was also used in the British Touring Car Championship between 1996 and 2004.

<text>The Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner are a range of vans produced since 1996 and marketed under the Citroën and Peugeot marques. They are sold as light commercial vehicles or as a passenger multi-purpose-vehicle variant with rear seats and windows. They were initially a product of the French PSA Group, which later became part of the multinational Stellantis conglomerate. The third generation has also been sold under the Opel and Vauxhall Motors marques as the Combo, by Toyota as the Proace City from 2019, and by Fiat as the Doblò from 2022.

The panel vans are available in passenger versions named the Berlingo Multispace and Partner Combi, Partner Tepee, and Peugeot Rifter for the third generation. In Italy, the first generation of the Partner was known as the Peugeot Ranch. They were initially based on the Citroën ZX/Peugeot 306 estate floorpan and mechanicals.

With their rectangular, box-like cargo space and aerodynamic front, conceptually they can be considered the descendants of the Citroën 2CV panel van (AK400). The new 2018 Citroën Berlingo and Peugeot Partner/Rifter also share their design with the new Vauxhall/Opel Combo, following GM&#x27;s sale of Opel to PSA.

Both the Berlingo and Partner have been produced in CNG and electric versions and with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines.

==First generation (M49; 1996) ==
The Berlingo/Partner was officially launched in July 1996.

When the Berlingo was first shown at the Mondial de l&#x27;Automobile (Paris Motor Show) in 1996, a set of three concept cars was also presented:
*Berlingo Coupé de Plage
*Berlingo Berline Bulle
*Berlingo Grand Large
The Berline Bulle concept was a roomy small car, that could be considered as a precursor for the C3. Only one of these concepts was actually developed, the Grand Large version, which was developed into the Multispace and Combi people carriers/leisure vans.

Until 2010, the pre-facelift models were still produced in Argentina. The updated model finally arrived this year.

=== Facelift (M59; 2002) ===
A revised version, featuring a new instrument cluster, as seen in the Peugeot 206, redesigned interior and front end, was released in September 2002 (Berlingo I / Partner I).

During 2004, there was a minor facelift, including changes to the grille and light clusters.

After the launch of the second generation Berlingo and Rifter, the first generation models stayed offered. They took the names &quot;Citroën Berlingo First&quot; and &quot;Peugeot Partner Origin&quot;.

In 2010, the Citroën Berlingo First Electrique and the Peugeot Partner Origin Electric were launched. These two electric vans were powered by the Monégasque firm Venturi, which assembled them in Solesmes, Sarthe.

In Argentina, Peugeot launched an off-road version of its Partner, called Partner Patagónica. This model had various names when it was sold across Europe in the 2000s, including Partner Ushuaïa Grand Raid, Partner Escapade, Partner Grande Escapade, Partner VTC, Partner Indiana, and others.

From 2013, the Berlingo and the Partner were discontinued in Europe. Both LCV and passenger versions continued their career in South America, where they are still produced years after.

Passenger vans Berlingo Multispace and Partner Patagónica received an update in June 2021. More parts of both vehicles are now manufactured locally. It means they now have barn doors (already manufactured locally for LCV Berlingo and Partner), replacing their tailgate that was imported from Europe.

The Berlingo and the Partner got a minor facelift in January 2023. The Berlingo adopted an updated Citroën logo (until there it still used the sharp logo from before 2009) and a new grille, in plastic. The Partner adopted the same grille and lost the piece of chrome around its front logo.

=== Engines ===
The vans were designed to be powered by petrol, diesel, electric, or CNG.

=== Electric version ===
The first-generation Berlingo was available first with a nickel-cadmium battery (Citroën Berlingo Electrique) from 1998 to 2005. After that was discontinued, a small electric fleet was built for La Poste using the first-generation Berlingo chassis, equipped with a ZEBRA molten salt battery and a powertrain from Venturi Automobiles; this fleet was delivered in 2010.

==Second generation (B9; 2008)==
Two different models replaced the first generation of the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo in 2008, a smaller vehicle (the Citroën Nemo/Peugeot Bipper, which also replaced recently discontinued Citroën C15 First) and larger (the Citroën Berlingo II/Peugeot Partner II).

The Berlingo II, styled by Gilles Vidal, used the PSA PF2 platform (like the Citroën C4), and therefore is slightly larger, and considerably more expensive than its predecessor.

The Berlingo and Partner were officially unveiled in January 2008, with the Berlingo launched first, in the European market, in April 2008, followed by the Partner in May 2008. Mexico sold this generation alongside the original Partner, as do a few other countries, as the Grand Raid and Partner Origin.

An electric version with a traction motor and battery derived from the Mitsubishi i-MiEV was available from 2013. In March 2017, a five-seater Citroen e-Berlingo Multispace was announced.
===Russia===
This generation is also manufactured and sold in Russia as the Peugeot Partner (and as the passenger oriented Peugeot Partner Crossway), Citroën Berlingo (and Citroën Berlingo Multispace) and exclusive Opel Combo Cargo (and Opel Combo Life) since March 2021.
===Engines===


== Third generation (K9; 2018) ==
The third generation Berlingo and a new Peugeot Rifter was officially unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Auto Show. The model is also sold as the fourth generation Opel and Vauxhall Combo after the PSA Group bought Opel in March 2017 and, from the end of 2019, as the Toyota Proace City, following the extension of the partnership in utility vehicles between PSA and Toyota. The Proace City was officially unveiled at the 2019 Commercial Vehicle Show in Birmingham. The Fiat-badged version was released as the Fiat Doblò in June 2022 in both ICE and e-Doblò electric version.

The third generation Berlingo is the first of the nameplate to be launched in Japan, in October 2019.

In January 2022, Stellantis stops marketing the internal combustion versions (diesel and gasoline) of its passenger vans in United Kingdom, Norway and European Union countries. This decision is motivated by a decision to reduce the average emissions of vehicles marketed by the company in Europe in accordance with EU regulations on emissions. As a result, the Berlingo, Rifter and Combo Life are now only offered in their battery electric version. Panel vans are not affected by this change, nor are Toyota-badged models, as the Japanese manufacturer is in line with the objectives of the CAFE regulations. The internal combustion variants of the Stellantis passenger vans are expected to return in 2023 with a mild-hybrid system.

=== Electric versions===

On 14 January 2021, Citroën unveiled the electric ë-Berlingo Van, which was followed 6 days later by the Opel Combo-e Cargo and the Vauxhall Combo-e, and again 6 days later by the Peugeot e-Partner. On 26 February 2021 Peugeot introduced e-Rifter, and on 4 May 2021, Toyota unveiled Proace City Electric and Proace City Verso Electric.

In 2023, production began at the Ellesmere Port factory.

=== Variants ===
====Caselani Fourgonnette====
Inspired by the 1951 Citroën 2CV Fourgonnette, it is a retro-bodied Berlingo coach-built by the Italian firm Caselani, with production of the 200 units starting on 1 October 2022. It was unveiled at the 2022 Paris Motor Show.

==== Commercial versions ====
==== Passenger versions ====
===Facelift===
A facelift was revealed on 23 October 2023, introducing technological updates.
Engine on the european market are the 1.2 Turbo Puretec 110 HP and the two diesel 1.5 BlueHDi DV5 with 100 and 130 HP. A 1.2 Turbo Mild hybrid Euro 7 version with 122 HP is planned in the mid 2025.

<doc id="273154" wikidata="Q3614488" url="?curid=273154" title="Source amnesia">
<text>Source amnesia is the inability to remember where, when or how previously learned information has been acquired, while retaining the factual knowledge. This branch of amnesia is associated with the malfunctioning of one&#x27;s explicit memory. It is likely that the disconnect between having the knowledge and remembering the context in which the knowledge was acquired is due to a dissociation between semantic and episodic memory – an individual retains the semantic knowledge (the fact), but lacks the episodic knowledge to indicate the context in which the knowledge was gained.

Memory representations reflect the encoding processes during acquisition. Different types of acquisition processes (e.g.: reading, thinking, listening) and different types of events (e.g.: newspaper, thoughts, conversation) will produce mental depictions that perceptually differ from one another in the brain, making it harder to retrieve where information was learned when placed in a different context of retrieval. Source monitoring involves a systematic process of slow and deliberate thought of where information was originally learned. Source monitoring can be improved by using more retrieval cues, discovering and noting relations and extended reasoning.

== Causes ==
Source amnesia is not a rare phenomenon – everybody experiences it on a near daily basis as, for much of our knowledge, it is important to remember the knowledge itself, rather than its source. However, there are extreme examples of source amnesia caused by a variety of factors.

=== Frontal lobe damage ===
Individuals with frontal lobe damage have deficits in temporal context memory; source memory can also exhibit deficits in those with frontal lobe damage. It appears that those with frontal lobe damage have difficulties with recency and other temporal judgements (e.g., placing events in the order they occurred), and as such they are unable to properly attribute their knowledge to appropriate sources (i.e., have source amnesia). Those individuals with frontal lobe damage have normal recall of facts, but they make significantly more errors in source memory than control subjects, with these effects becoming apparent as shortly as 5 minutes after the learning experience. Individuals with frontal lobe damage often mistakenly attribute the knowledge they have to some other source (e.g., they read it somewhere, saw it on TV, etc.) but rarely attribute it to having learned it over the course of the experiment. It appears that frontal lobe damage causes a disconnection between semantic and episodic memory – in that the individuals cannot associate the context in which they acquired the knowledge to the knowledge itself.

=== Age-related ===
Elderly individuals have been shown to exhibit source amnesia. Compared to younger individuals, in experiments where the individuals are presented with obscure or even made up trivia facts, older people remember less information overall in both recall and recognition tasks and they often misattribute the source of their knowledge, at time periods of both long and short delays.

This effect is potentially due to the neuronal loss associated with aging occurring mainly in the frontal lobes. It has been previously noticed that frontal lobe damage can cause source amnesia, so the loss of neurons in this area of the brain associated with aging may very well be the cause of the age-related source amnesia seen.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), which is known to be associated with frontal lobe dysfunction, is implicated as a cause of source amnesia. In laboratory conditions, one study found source monitoring to be so poor that the AD participants were correctly performing source memory attributions at approximately chance. This lack of ability to attribute the source of memories is likely related to AD patients&#x27; deficits in reality monitoring. Reality monitoring, the process of distinguishing whether information originated from an external or an internal source, relies on judgement processes to examine the qualitative characteristics of the information in order to determine if the information was real or imagined. It appears that it is this process that is experiencing the dysfunction, which causes mild confabulation in some AD patients, as well as being related to the source amnesia experienced in some individuals with AD.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Schizophrenia is associated with episodic memory deficits often characterized by a confusion of internal stimuli and real events. It appears that individuals with schizophrenia often display failures in monitoring/remembering the source of information, especially for self-generated items – that is, they display source amnesia. This is a stable trait in this disease – one experiment found that over a two-year period, an individual&#x27;s rate of source attributing errors was maintained, despite fluctuations in medication status and the individual&#x27;s symptoms. This effect is possibly due to the malformation of associations among aspects of an episode needed for remembering its source; one neuroimaging study found that individuals with schizophrenia had lower activation of areas associated with source memory.

Individuals with schizophrenia who display source memory deficits often do so due to reality-monitoring dysfunction, which is a contributing factor towards the hallucinations that characterize the disorder. One study found that schizophrenia patients were not only slower, but also less accurate, at tasks involving reality-monitoring. The hallucinations that characterize schizophrenia are a result of deficit in reality monitoring – they exhibit an inability to differentiate between internally and externally derived information. Overall, there is evidence of a relationship between source monitoring errors and the disorganized thinking that characterizes those who have schizophrenia in that there is a strong tendency for those people with hallucinations to attribute their internally generated events (i.e.: hallucinations and delusions) to an external source (e.g., the experimenter). That is, schizophrenia is characterized by failing to encode themselves as the source of the idea, compounded by attributing these ideas/beliefs to an external source, all of which leads to those individuals with schizophrenia exhibiting behaviours typical of those with source amnesia; they misattribute the source of their knowledge, ideas, or beliefs.

=== Post traumatic stress disorder ===
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive, vivid recollections of the traumatic event and impoverished episodic memory for all other events. Those individuals with PTSD experience memory distortions caused by source amnesia, as well as false memory construction and unintentional integration of information that was not present for the original memory. Not only do individuals with this condition experience less vivid and decontextualized episodic memory for all events outside of the traumatic experience, but also, individuals with PTSD have difficulties with identifying the source of both emotional and neutral information overall. Those with PTSD may have poorer recall for the source of their knowledge due to deficits in the encoding process which creates weaker relationships between the item and its context.

=== Depression ===
Depression is associated with overly generalized memories and individuals with depression perform more poorly on source memory attribution tasks as compared to non-depressed individuals. These individuals show a memory bias for remembering negative information, possibly due to enhanced amygdala activity during the encoding of emotional (particularly negative) information. Overall, there is a relationship between the emotional arousal of an episode and its source memory – there is some evidence that the enhanced processing of negative memories results in poorer source memory, and thus individuals who are depressed would have increased amounts of source amnesia.

=== Hypnosis ===
Hypnosis as a cause of source amnesia involves carrying out hypnosis and having the subjects remember post-hypnotically, experiences they had during hypnosis as tested by asking the individuals about esoteric knowledge that they learned during hypnosis. These individuals typically have no recall of the hypnotic experience whatsoever; however, when tested on these obscure pieces of knowledge they are able to supply the correct answer, demonstrating their source amnesia. The subjects often attribute their knowledge of the obscure facts to learning experiences other than during hypnosis (e.g.: &quot;I read it somewhere,&quot; &quot;Somebody must have told me,&quot; etc.).

== Diagnostic tests ==

=== Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)===
The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is widely used in clinical settings to test for cognitive impairments, such as frontal lobe disorder which has been associated with source amnesia.

;Procedure:
Two sets of 12 identical cards forms the visuo-spatial component for the test. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards.

;Results:
Patients with frontal lobe dysfunction and ultimately source amnesia, will have much greater difficulty finishing this task successfully through method of strategy.

=== Verbal fluency test ===
The verbal fluency test is a widely and commonly used test to assess for frontal lobe dysfunction in patients.

;Procedure:
Participants are asked to generate words beginning with letters that had previously been introduced to them (e.g.: generate a word beginning with &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;R&#x27;). They are given three 1-min trials (one trial per letter). The goal is to say as many different words possible that begin with the given letter.

;Results:
The Verbal fluency test can assess for damage in the prefrontal lobes, which has been associated with patients who have source amnesia. Patients with frontal lobe disorder have trouble putting verbal items into a proper sequential order, monitor personal behaviors as well as a deficient judgment in recency. All of these behaviors are required for the proper recall of the source of a memory.

=== Stroop Color-Naming Task ===

Research has shown that the Stroop effect has numerous findings related to age and its effect on memory. The test measures speed and accuracy skills of naming colors and colored words, to determine the effects of aging on the brain which is thought to be a cause of source amnesia.

;Procedure: 
The participant is asked to read a series of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first component of the task, known as the &quot;word-reading condition of the task&quot;, the participant is asked to read as quickly as possible a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. The participant is then asked to name the color of a series of colored blocks.

In the second component of the task or &quot;the color word-naming condition&quot;, the participant is instructed to name the color of a sequence of words presented in another color (e.g.: the word is &quot;red&quot; but the color of the word is printed in green, the participant must name the color of the ink, not the actual word).

;Results: 
In healthy patients, the condition of naming the color, is slower than the first task of just reading the word. 
Patients with prefrontal damage (source amnesia) will name the color and ignore the word, even as the rules change and they are told to name just the word, the color continues to be named on following trials.

Relating back to age, the findings of this study concluded that aging begins to affect one&#x27;s ability to successfully finish the Stroop test in the 6th and 7th decade of life. This branch of cognitive aging has been found to mainly affect the prefrontal lobes. The Stroop Color-Naming Task measures the degree to which one has source amnesia. The severity of the damage to the prefrontal lobes directly correlates to the speed of which an individual can complete the Stroop Color-Naming Task. The more damage one has endured to this part of the brain, the slower they will complete the task.

=== Old-New Recognition Test ===

Decisions made in the context of this test will be based more on familiarity than deep inspection of the contents of memories.

People with source amnesia during this test feel &#x27;phantom&#x27; feelings of familiarity towards words that are semantically related (e.g.: candy, sugar, sweet) and will more often claim to have seen a word that was not presented during the experiment.

;Procedure: 
Showing the participant a list of words and assessing at different time intervals to see if the participant remembers which words were presented and which were not. For example, a list of 15 words could be given to a participant to study from. The experimenter will then test the participant&#x27;s knowledge of the list 20 minutes later by presenting the list of studied words mixed in randomly with several &#x27;lure&#x27; words (words that are semantically similar to the previously studied words but not the same) and new words.

If the participant is successful in this task, they have distinguished between the previously learned words and the lure words.

This experiment can be tested multiple times with the same participant over different time periods (e.g.: 3 months later then tested again 6 months later).

;Results: 
Participants are more likely to show source amnesia with the &#x27;lure&#x27; words but not with the newly presented words. This means that they confuse the familiarity of the semantically similar words with words that they studied in the original list.

== Prevention ==
Research suggests that source amnesia results from poor memory encoding of a particular context opposed to poor retrieval of a context specific memory, except within the case of amnesiacs. This is because content must be encoded along with context in order for the two to be integrated into memory. Since poor encoding may be responsible for source amnesia, it is not likely that a person will be able to retrieve a specific source memory in the future if it was not properly encoded. This makes it difficult to create treatments for source amnesia because the information may not be integrated properly within the brain. Certain prevention strategies have been studied in order to target at-risk populations and teach them how to prevent the loss of contextual memory as well as how to improve source memory in the general population.

===General population===
While source amnesia appears to be the most prevalent in populations with specific brain impairments, it is possible for individuals without deficits in memory to experience source amnesia. This may happen if a person only encodes content and does not integrate the context-specific information into memory. Research suggests that context-specific information is better recalled in situations that involve emotional stimuli or words. This suggests that source memory may benefit from thinking about emotions related to the content in order to better encode source related information. This is related to theories on flashbulb memory.

=== Children ===
Children are more likely to correctly identify source information if they have been taught to think about the relation between the speaker and the information being shared. This holds true whether the children think about perceptual or emotional ties to the speaker but the effect appears larger when emotional context is considered. The increase in accurate source encoding is not without a cost as it was demonstrated that children who improved their source encoding typically remembered less than controls when it came to recalling semantic or non-source information. This suggests that there may be a trade-off when it comes to different types of memory in children because they are only able to attend to a certain amount of information at one time.

=== Older adults ===
Older adults may have memory impairments as a result of the natural aging process. These memory impairments may be due to degeneration of the frontal lobe and other age related changes. It is very common for older adults to experience increased source amnesia for memories compared to younger adults. Prevention of source amnesia in older adults may include memory training programs in an attempt to increase cortical thickness in the brain. Research suggests that even the brains of older adults may be capable of continuing plasticity. In one particular study, older adults were exposed to 8-week long memory training programs. These memory-training programs involved serial memory recall practice using mental imagery as a mnemonic device. Adults involved in the memory-training program showed significant improvement in their source memory specifically. In addition to the memory benefits, increased cortical thickness was shown using MRI scans. While this research has not been tested in a longitudinal study, it suggests that older adults and perhaps other at-risk groups for source amnesia could benefit from explicit memory training exercises.

Another way in which older adults can avoid source amnesia is to think about the relationship between the content and context of an experience or memory. This preventative measure must be taken when information is being encoded in order to direct attention to the source and to be aware of how it relates to the content. Participants experiencing source amnesia performed at the same level of groups not at risk of source amnesia when these strategies were implicated suggesting that those who do not experience this memory deficit may integrate content and context implicitly.

== Implications in eyewitness testimony ==
Eyewitness testimonies are an integral aspect in the criminal court system as judges and juries depend on them as evidence to determine a verdict. However, studies have shown that source amnesia can interfere with a witness&#x27;s memory because any incorrect post-event information encountered, results in distorted memories and source confusion. Post-event information can come from leading questions, statements made by the media or co-witnesses. Since improper encoding causes source amnesia, witnesses who are stressed or distracted during the event and fail to pay attention are susceptible to encoding wrong details into their memory, claiming to have seen things they only imagined. This causes grave legal implications given that it can result in wrongful convictions; therefore, it is important that interrogation practices are carefully carried out.

== Related phenomena ==

=== Post-hypnotic amnesia ===
Post-hypnotic source amnesia is the phenomenon where an individual is taught obscure information while under hypnosis and then asked to recall this information during their conscious state, however, they do not remember how or when that knowledge was taught to them. Studies have shown that subjects are unable to remember anything that occurred during hypnosis and when asked how they acquired the knowledge to answer the questions, they tended to rationalize their incapability to indicate how they learned it. This phenomenon is similar to flashbulb memories or tip-of-the-tongue.

=== Misattributed familiarity ===
Misattributed familiarity is the failure to recall the correct source of where the information came from and instead, the individual attributes the knowledge to an incorrect source. This results from an error in the decision-making process that confuses the origin of the information.

=== Cryptomnesia ===
Cryptomnesia occurs when an individual is certain that a certain word, idea, song, etc. is their own original thought when in actuality it was retrieved from memory without their knowledge, resulting in accidental plagiarism. In order to prevent this, source monitoring is required to avoid attributing the thought as one&#x27;s own. However, this slows down the quick retrieval of memory needed in daily life, such as in conversation. This has seen to occur in the music industry and has the implication of copyright infringement over songs, as well as in the formation of scientific research ideas.

<text>The Portland Breakers were an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL) in the mid-1980s. Before moving to Portland, Oregon, the franchise was previously in Boston, Massachusetts as the Boston Breakers and New Orleans, Louisiana as the New Orleans Breakers.

A new United States Football League – legally distinct from its predecessor, but using its team nicknames – was started in April 2022. A new version of the New Orleans Breakers is one of eight teams competing.

==History==
===Boston Breakers===
The team started out in 1983 as the Boston Breakers, owned by Boston businessman George Matthews and former New England Patriots wide receiver Randy Vataha. However, finding a stadium proved difficult. The lack of a professional-quality stadium had stymied previous attempts at pro football in Boston before the Patriots arrived in 1960.

The largest stadium in the region was Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough, home of the Patriots. However, it was owned by the Sullivan family, owners of the Patriots, and Matthews and Vataha were not willing to have an NFL team as their landlord. As a result, their initial choice for a home facility was Harvard Stadium, but Harvard University rejected them almost out of hand. They finally settled on Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University, which seated only 21,000 people – the smallest stadium in the league. The team&#x27;s cheerleaders were called &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;.

Coach Dick Coury put together a fairly competitive team led by quarterback Johnnie Walton (then 36 years old, a former Continental Football League and World Football League alumnus who had been out of football since the late 1970s) and Canadian Football League veteran halfback Richard Crump. The Breakers finished 11-7, finishing one game behind the Chicago Blitz for the final playoff spot. Walton, who had retired from pro football years earlier and had spent the previous three years coaching college football, was the league&#x27;s seventh ranked passer. Coury was named coach of the year.

Despite fielding a fairly solid team, playing in Nickerson Field doomed the team in Boston. The stadium had been built in 1915 as Braves Field and had not aged well. It was so small that the Breakers lost money even when they sold out as visiting teams got a portion of the gate proceeds. The Breakers and Washington Federals were the only teams to draw fewer than 14,000 per game in 1983. The other 10 teams drew over 18,000 per game. (The fans who came to the games were generally passionate; the documentary &quot;Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?&quot; made note of a particular Breakers victory in which fans stormed the field afterward.) 

Concluding that Nickerson Field was not suitable even for temporary use, Matthews again approached Harvard, but the school refused again. He then hashed out a deal to move to Foxborough, but ultimately decided against being a tenant of an NFL team. He considered an offer to sell a stake in the team to Jacksonville, Florida businessman Fred Bullard, but pulled out after Bullard proposed firing Coury in favor of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. (Bullard would ultimately land an expansion franchise, the Jacksonville Bulls.) After floating offers to move to Seattle, Honolulu, and Portland, Matthews decided to move to New Orleans. He sold a 31 percent interest to New Orleans real estate developer Joe Canizaro, and the move was approved by the USFL on October 18, 1983. Matthews later sold his remaining stake to Canizaro, but Vataha remained as team president.

===New Orleans Breakers===

In New Orleans, the team played in the Louisiana Superdome, also home to the NFL&#x27;s New Orleans Saints. They started out the season 5-0, and all signs pointed to them running away with the Southern Division. However, they only won three more games to finish 8-10. This included a 35-0 thrashing by the Philadelphia Stars and losses in their last six games, a skid fittingly capped off with an embarrassment by the Washington Federals in the season finale. In spite of adding NFL star tight end Dan Ross and rookie halfbacks Buford Jordan and Marcus Dupree (whose signing was technically against USFL rules as he was underage), the team struggled. Walton was inconsistent and ultimately retired after the season, while Dupree would experience constant problems with his knees throughout his time with the Breakers.

Years later, defensive lineman Jeff Gaylord recalled that the Breakers&#x27; slide came because many of his teammates were sucked into New Orleans&#x27; drug culture. According to Gaylord, cocaine use ran rampant in the locker room, and its lure was too strong for many of his teammates who had grown up poor.

On the positive side, New Orleans supported the team well, averaging 30,557 per game. Many of them came to see Dupree, who grew up in neighboring Mississippi. Jordan ran for 1,276 yards (fourth in the league), and Ross and wide receiver Frank Lockett had strong years.

After the season, league owners decided to go for broke and move to a fall schedule starting in 1986. This put teams like New Orleans, Michigan, and Philadelphia in an awkward situation. Canizaro believed he could not hope to compete directly with the Saints, even though the Breakers were one of the few USFL teams that could have potentially run their NFL rivals out of town. At the time, the Saints were mired in decades-long mediocrity, having only managed to get to .500 twice in their history. Then-owner John W. Mecom Jr. was looking to sell or move the team. However, rather than play a lame-duck spring 1985 season in New Orleans, Canizaro opted to move the team for the second time in as many years.

Tommy Lister Jr. attempted to cross over into football after a successful track and field career at California State University, Los Angeles; he played the 1984 preseason with the team but failed to make the regular season roster. Lister then returned to Los Angeles, where he pursued an acting and professional wrestling career.

===Portland Breakers===

Searching for a home, Canizaro considered moving to Sacramento and Columbus, and even weighed merging with the Birmingham Stallions. However, he was particularly intrigued when he visited Portland. It was a fairly large market with a reasonably adequate facility by USFL standards, Civic Stadium (which seated 32,000 people at the time). The move to Portland was announced on It marked a return home of sorts for Coury, who had led the World Football League&#x27;s Portland Storm in 1974. Initially, Portland seemed to welcome the Breakers with open arms. The Breakers sold 6,000 of its highest-priced tickets within twelve hours.

On the field the team struggled, as the strain of playing in three cities in three years finally caught up with them. The team opted to go with former Jacksonville starter Matt Robinson as Walton&#x27;s replacement, rather than seeking a more proven USFL quarterback without a home, like Craig Penrose, Alan Risher, or Mike Hohensee, or trading for someone like Oakland&#x27;s Fred Besana, or even signing an NFL veteran. Robinson ultimately proved to be a less-than-adequate replacement for Walton, finishing with a 62.6 QB rating. Halfback Jordan had another strong year with over 800 yards gained, as did Lockett. However, their season effectively ended when Dupree suffered a season-ending knee injury in the season opener. While they managed to upend four playoff teams, they never recovered from a six-game losing streak and finished 6-12.

The Breakers were one of nine teams slated to play in the USFL&#x27;s first fall season, and were slated to be one of only two teams west of the Mississippi River. However, they had only drawn 19,919 per game, not enough to break even. This was partly because Civic Stadium was in an area of downtown with little parking (a stop on the MAX Light Rail line would not open for another decade). With such meager attendance, meeting payroll became an adventure. At one point midway through the season, the players were only paid every other week. With four games to go, the checks stopped coming altogether. They were forced to waive their entire roster after missing their final payroll. Coury later recalled that he and his staff never got paid the full salaries stipulated in their contracts.

After talks to merge with other teams failed, Canizaro folded the franchise while the USFL&#x27;s antitrust suit against the NFL was underway, citing over $17 million in losses over three years. It had been obvious even before Canizaro folded the franchise that the Breakers would never play another down.

Canizaro was the only league owner who moved his team twice and both moves were long distance. There was some discussion of transplanting the Denver Gold organization to Portland, but this idea was abandoned as the Gold (whose owners opposed moving to the fall) instead merged with the Jacksonville Bulls. The entire league suspended operations not long after, when it was awarded only three dollars in damages.

The Breakers had the distinction of being the only team to play for the entire duration of the USFL for three cities, each season in a different city without relocating mid-season. Unlike many USFL teams, the Breakers never changed its name, logo, or colors when it relocated.

===Top &quot;name&quot; players===
Among the top &quot;name&quot; Breakers players were: linebacker Marcus Marek; halfbacks Marcus Dupree and Buford Jordan; quarterbacks Johnnie Walton and Matt Robinson; kicker Tim Mazzetti; punter Jeff Gossett; offensive tackle Broderick Thompson; and tight end Dan Ross.

===Coaches and executives===
Coury was the team&#x27;s coach for all three seasons. He was no stranger to Portland, having coached the Storm of the World Football League in 1974. Defensive coordinator was the late Pokey Allen who would later take Portland State University to two national championship games. Division I journeyman Bob Shaw who was hired after leaving Lou Holtz&#x27;s staff at the University of Arkansas and served in both New Orleans and Portland. The offensive coordinator during the 1983 season was College Football Hall of Fame and former NFL Most Valuable Player Roman Gabriel. After the 1984 season, Jim Fassel was hired as offensive coordinator, but after five months on the job, he left to become head coach at the University of Utah. In 1985, the offensive coordinator was Pete Kettela, a former head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos. Allen would hire former Breaker executive Steven &quot;Dream&quot; Weaver as his marketing director and whose publicity stunts raised his Portland State teams to national acclaim. The team president for the Portland Breakers was John Ralston, who was also a founder of the USFL. Other executives included Jack Galmiche, John Brunelle, and Brian Feldman. Feldman was the only executive who worked in all three cities.

<text>The Philadelphia / Baltimore Stars were a professional American football team which played in the United States Football League (USFL) in the mid-1980s. Owned by real-estate magnate Myles Tanenbaum, they were the short-lived league&#x27;s dominant team, playing in all three championship games and winning the latter two. They played their first two seasons in Philadelphia as the Philadelphia Stars before relocating to Baltimore, where they played as the Baltimore Stars for the USFL&#x27;s final season. Coached by Jim Mora, the Stars won a league-best 41 regular season games and 7 playoff games.

== Founding ==
On May 11, 1982, the announcement of the USFL was officially made by league owner and antique dealer, David Dixon. The league&#x27;s Philadelphia team would be owned by real estate developer Myles H. Tanenbaum. He had originally wanted to name the team the Stallions in honor of Rocky Balboa, who was nicknamed &quot;The Italian Stallion.&quot; However, when the Birmingham entry snapped up the Stallions name, Tanenbaum settled on &quot;Stars.&quot;

George Perles was originally named as the team&#x27;s head coach in July 1982. Perles, previously an assistant coach for the NFL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Steelers, never coached a game for the Stars, opting to take the head coach position for Michigan State instead. On January 15, 1983, the Stars hired Jim Mora to be their head coach.

==1983 season==

The Stars began in Philadelphia in the USFL&#x27;s inaugural 1983 season and played their home games at Veterans Stadium (the &quot;Vet&quot;). They compiled the league&#x27;s best regular season record of , and advanced to the 1983 USFL championship game. Their &quot;Doghouse Defense&quot; allowed only 204 points in an 18-game season—the least in the history of the league. The Stars were led by fourth-year quarterback Chuck Fusina (1978 Heisman Trophy runner-up), fifth-year wide receiver Scott Fitzkee, rookie halfback Kelvin Bryant of North Carolina, rookie offensive tackle Irv Eatman of UCLA, rookie linebacker Sam Mills, and second-year safety Scott Woerner. The team also featured Towson&#x27;s all-star rookie punter Sean Landeta. At the conclusion of the regular season, Bryant was named the USFL&#x27;s Player of the Year by the Associated Press.

The Stars entered the playoffs as the top-seeded team. In the Semi-Finals, the Stars defeated the preseason favorites to win the 1983 title—George Allen&#x27;s Chicago Blitz—by withstanding seven turnovers and erasing a 21-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 44–38 in overtime. In the league title game at Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium on July 17, the Stars lost to Jim Stanley&#x27;s Michigan Panthers, 24–22. Just as they had against the Blitz, the Stars opened the game sluggishly, but finished with a flourish, after allowing the Panthers to carry a 17–3 lead into the fourth quarter. Many observers of the time believed that the Stars, Panthers and Blitz were almost NFL-quality units.

One of the few blemishes on the Stars&#x27; first season was the box office. They only attracted 18,650 fans per game. In addition to bad weather, there were lingering memories of a massive gate-papering scandal involving the World Football League&#x27;s Philadelphia Bell in 1974. The Bell had claimed that a total of over 120,000 fans had attended their first two games, but it subsequently emerged that all but 19,000 of the tickets had been given away for free or for significantly reduced prices.

==1984 season==
The Stars remained in Philadelphia for the 1984 season but were forced to relocate their post-season home games to Franklin Field due to a conflict with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Stars roared through the regular season with the league best record, and routed George Allen&#x27;s Arizona Wranglers, 23–3 for the league title in Florida at Tampa Stadium on July 15. It was the last traditional professional football championship for the city of Philadelphia until the Eagles&#x27; Super Bowl LII victory at the end of the 2017 season, and its first since the 1960 NFL championship. The Stars were also becoming increasingly popular among fans, as average home attendance jumped from approximately 18,000 in 1983 to 28,000 in 1984.

After the league championship game, the Stars played a rare post-season exhibition game with Tampa Bay in England on July 21, and defeated the Bandits 24–21 at Wembley Stadium in London.

==Relocation to Baltimore==
The league&#x27;s owners, led by Donald Trump of the New Jersey Generals, voted to move play to the fall following the 1985 season. This put the Stars in a difficult position. Tanenbaum said that the Stars would have had to start the 1986 season on an extended road trip due to the Phillies sharing Veterans Stadium as well. Had the Phillies advanced to the World Series, the Stars would not be able to play a home game until November at the earliest. Moving full-time to Franklin Field was quickly ruled out due to the Penn Quakers football team playing there on Saturdays when the USFL had planned to play in the fall. The only other football venue in Philadelphia was John F. Kennedy Stadium, next door to the Vet. However, the 60-year-old stadium was in a poor state of repair after not being well maintained in several years; it would be condemned only four years later. In any case, it seated over 100,000 people, meaning even a decent-sized USFL crowd would have been swallowed up in the environment.

At the time, the Philadelphia Eagles were in visible distress only five years after making it to the Super Bowl due to Eagles owner Leonard Tose&#x27;s gambling and other debts. The Stars were one of the few USFL teams that had a realistic possibility of forcing their NFL counterparts out of town. At one point, Tose unsuccessfully tried to trade the Eagles for the equally distressed Buffalo Bills and/or relocate to Arizona. However, officials with the city of Philadelphia had shown clear favoritism to the Eagles despite their financial struggles, scuttling Tose&#x27;s efforts and securing an agreement to keep the Eagles in Philadelphia.

With no venue in the Delaware Valley suitable even for temporary use, Tanenbaum moved the team to Baltimore, which was still smarting from the loss of the NFL Colts three years earlier. Indeed, even as Tanenbaum prepared to move the Stars, the city of Baltimore was attempting to strip the Colts from owner Robert Irsay via eminent domain.

It initially appeared that the Stars would be bolstered by a merger with the Pittsburgh Maulers. Owner Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. had folded the Maulers after just one season because knew he could not even begin to compete with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He agreed to join Tanenbaum as a minority partner, but decided to get out altogether soon afterward.

Baltimore welcomed the Stars with open arms. Tanenbaum quickly signed a broadcasting deal with Baltimore&#x27;s most powerful radio station, WBAL, and built a good relationship with then-mayor William Donald Schaefer. However, he ran into a problem when he discovered that the Stars could not play at Baltimore&#x27;s Memorial Stadium until 1986 due to objections from the Baltimore Orioles. Reportedly, Orioles general manager Hank Peters and manager Joe Altobelli were concerned about the Stars tearing up the turf, and persuaded owner Edward Bennett Williams to lock out the Stars. With no other stadium in the immediate Baltimore area suitable for temporary use, Tanenbaum was forced to play at the University of Maryland&#x27;s Byrd Stadium in College Park, southwest of Baltimore and a Washington suburb (coincidentally, the Washington USFL franchise, the Federals, moved to Orlando as the Orlando Renegades the same season). This was all compounded by the Washington Redskins&#x27; success during these years which included playing in the Super Bowl in January 1983 and 1984. Further complicating matters, the team kept its operations in Philadelphia and commuted to College Park for games—effectively consigning the Stars to 18 road games for the league&#x27;s lame-duck spring season.

==1985 season==
At least in part due to all the moving, the Stars initially struggled in 1985, but won nine of their last 13 games to secure a wild-card berth. They did so in front of a mostly empty Byrd Stadium, however. While Baltimore-area fans were happy to see the return of pro football after a two-year absence, they balked at making the 35-minute drive down Interstate 95 to see the Stars play in College Park. Most were waiting for the team to begin play in the city&#x27;s venerable Memorial Stadium a year later.

As a result, attendance sagged to the point that the Stars might have lost home-field advantage for the playoffs even with a winning record. ABC Sports, embarrassed at the dwindling attendance from around the league, told Usher it did not want to televise playoff games in near-empty stadiums. Since ABC had disproportionate influence on league affairs due to the structure of its contract with the USFL, Usher had little choice but to agree. However, the Stars managed to upend the favored New Jersey Generals and Birmingham Stallions in successive weeks to reach the title game at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Once there, the Stars won the USFL title beating the Bobby Hebert-led Oakland Invaders, 28–24. Soon afterward, Tanenbaum sold controlling interest to fellow real estate magnate Stephen Ross.

As it turned out, this was the final USFL game ever played. On July 29, 1986, a federal grand jury found in favor of the USFL in its antitrust suit against the NFL. However, the USFL was only awarded $1 in damages, tripled to $3 under antitrust law. The league&#x27;s abandonment of Philadelphia was a factor in the adverse jury award. The jury foreman explained that while they agreed the NFL was a monopoly, they could not agree on the size of the award. As a result, the jury misinterpreted the law and decided on the $1 award, feeling it would be changed by the presiding judge. However, the judge was not able to increase the amount once it was stipulated by the jury. As a result, the league suspended operations a day later, never to return.

Number 19 was never issued to any player in that lone season out of respect to the Colts&#x27; great Johnny Unitas.

==Legacy==

The Stars are widely acknowledged to have been the best team to see the field in USFL history.

The Stars won 41 of 54 regular-season games and were 7–1 in the postseason. For the team&#x27;s entire run, they were coached by Jim Mora (Sr), who later became a head coach in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts. Mora was actually the Stars&#x27; second choice; Tannenbaum originally hired Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator George Perles, but Perles opted instead to take the open job at his alma mater, Michigan State.

Carl Peterson, who later became the president/general manager/chief executive officer of the Kansas City Chiefs, served as the team&#x27;s General Manager for all three seasons.

Sean Landeta and Sam Mills both also had successful careers in the NFL. Landeta was one of the top punters in the NFL for two decades, and was the last former USFL player still active in the NFL at the time of his retirement in 2006. Mills had a sterling career with the Saints (alongside Mora) and the Carolina Panthers. The Panthers retired Mills&#x27; No. 51 jersey after his death from cancer in 2005.

Landeta and Bart Oates were also teammates with the New York Giants. Oates signed with the Giants in 1985. Both Oates and Landeta went on to win a combined five Super Bowl rings throughout their NFL careers. Both won two rings apiece with the Giants in 1986 and 1990, while Oates earned an additional ring with the San Francisco 49ers in 1994. Oates was selected to five Pro Bowls during his career and to the UPI All-NFC team three times. He was extremely durable, starting 125 consecutive games during his Giants career.

<doc id="273174" wikidata="Q1342909" url="?curid=273174" title="Albert DeSalvo">
<text>Albert Henry DeSalvo (September 3, 1931 – November 25, 1973) was an American murderer and rapist who was active in Boston, Massachusetts, in the early 1960s. He is known to have confessed to being the &quot;Boston Strangler&quot;, a serial killer who murdered 13 women in the Boston area between 1962-64. Due to physical evidence, DeSalvo&#x27;s confession was believed, yet he was only prosecuted in 1967 for a series of unrelated rapes, for which he was convicted and imprisoned until his death in 1973. DeSalvo&#x27;s claims to have murdered multiple women was disputed, and debates continued regarding which crimes he truly had committed.

By the early 21st century, techniques for DNA capture and analysis could allow for the re-investigation of some criminal cases. In July 2013, an analysis of semen found around the body of Mary Sullivan, the last of the Strangler&#x27;s victims, was matched to DNA obtained from DeSalvo&#x27;s nephew. Because men who are descended from a common male ancestor carry the same y-DNA, investigators believed that this finding linked DeSalvo to the killing of Sullivan. The DNA match excluded 99.9% of the remaining population. Later that month, authorities exhumed DeSalvo&#x27;s body and found that his DNA was a match.

==Early life==
Albert DeSalvo was born on September 3, 1931, in Chelsea, Massachusetts, as the third of six children to Charlotte (née Roberts) and Frank DeSalvo. DeSalvo&#x27;s father was a violent alcoholic who abused his wife; in one of the many times he attacked her in front of the children, he knocked out all her teeth and bent her fingers back until they broke. He would also bring home prostitutes and engage in sexual acts with them in front of his wife and young children.

The young DeSalvo began torturing animals as a child. In early adolescence, he engaged in acts of petty theft and shoplifting, frequently crossing paths with the law. In November 1943, the 12-year-old DeSalvo was first arrested for battery and robbery. The following month he was sent to the Lyman School for Boys. In October 1944, DeSalvo was paroled and started working as a delivery boy. In August 1946, nearly fifteen years old, he was returned to the Lyman School after being convicted of auto theft.

After completing his second sentence, DeSalvo joined the United States Army. He was honorably discharged after his first tour of duty. DeSalvo re-enlisted and, despite being tried in a court-martial, was again honorably discharged. He served as a Military Police sergeant with the 2nd Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment.

At the time of the Boston Strangler murders, DeSalvo lived at 11 Florence Street Park in Malden, Massachusetts, across the street from the junction of Florence and Clement streets.

==Murders==

Between June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, thirteen single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in the Boston area; their deaths were eventually tied to a serial killer dubbed the Boston Strangler. Most of the women were sexually assaulted in their apartments before being strangled with articles of clothing. The oldest victim died of a heart attack. Two others were stabbed to death, one of whom was also badly beaten. Without signs of forced entry into their dwellings, the victims were assumed to have either known their killer or voluntarily allowed him into their homes.
In late 1964, in addition to the Strangler murders, the Boston Police Department (BPD) were trying to solve a series of rapes committed by a man who had been dubbed the &quot;Measuring Man&quot; or the &quot;Green Man.&quot; On October 27, a stranger entered a young woman&#x27;s home in East Cambridge posing as a detective. He tied his victim to her bed, sexually assaulted her and left after undoing her restraints, apologizing as he departed. The woman&#x27;s description led police to identify the assailant as DeSalvo. 

When his photo was published, many women identified DeSalvo as the man who had assaulted them. Earlier on October 27, DeSalvo had posed as a motorist with car trouble and attempted to enter a home in Bridgewater. The owner of the home, Richard Sproules (a future police chief of Brockton), became suspicious. He ultimately fired a shotgun at DeSalvo, who fled the scene.

Under arrest for his role in the &quot;Green Man&quot; rapes, DeSalvo was initially not suspected of being involved with the Strangler murders. He had confessed to fellow inmate George Nassar, who notified his attorney, F. Lee Bailey. Bailey subsequently took over DeSalvo&#x27;s defense. Though there were some inconsistencies in his account, DeSalvo cited details of the Strangler case that had not been made public. However, police had not found physical evidence to substantiate his confession. Only after DeSalvo was charged with rape did he give a detailed confession of his activities as the Strangler. This took place on two occasions: under hypnosis induced by William Joseph Bryan, and without hypnosis during interviews with Assistant Attorney General John Bottomly.

For his 1967 trial, DeSalvo was evaluated by Harry Kozol, a neurologist who had established the first sex offender treatment center in Massachusetts. Bailey arranged a plea bargain to lock in DeSalvo&#x27;s guilt in exchange for excluding the death penalty as punishment. He also wanted to preserve the possibility of an eventual insanity verdict.

Bailey was angered by the jury&#x27;s decision to sentence DeSalvo to life without parole. He said, 
&quot;My goal was to see the Strangler wind up in a hospital, where doctors could try to find out what made him kill. Society is deprived of a study that might help deter other mass killers who lived among us, waiting for the trigger to go off inside them.&quot;

===Victims===
==Imprisonment and death==
DeSalvo was sentenced to life in prison in 1967. In February of that year, he escaped with two fellow inmates from Bridgewater State Hospital, triggering a full-scale manhunt. A note was found on his bunk addressed to the superintendent. In it, DeSalvo stated he had escaped to focus attention on the conditions in the hospital and his own situation. Three days after the escape he called his lawyer to turn himself in. His lawyer then sent the police to re-arrest him in Lynn, Massachusetts. Following the escape, he was transferred to the maximum security prison known at the time as Walpole, where he later recanted his Strangler confessions.

On November 25, 1973, he was found stabbed to death in the prison infirmary. Robert Wilson, who was associated with the Winter Hill Gang, was tried for DeSalvo&#x27;s murder, but the trial ended in a hung jury. Bailey later stated that DeSalvo was killed for selling amphetamines in the prison for less than the inmate-enforced syndicate price.

DeSalvo&#x27;s papers are housed in the Lloyd Sealy Library Special Collections at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. His papers include his correspondence, mainly with the members of the Bailey family, and gifts sent to the Baileys of jewelry and leatherwork crafted by DeSalvo while in prison.

==DNA evidence==
On July 11, 2013, Boston law enforcement officials announced that DNA evidence had linked DeSalvo to the rape and murder of 19-year-old Mary Sullivan. DeSalvo&#x27;s remains were exhumed, and DNA test results proved DeSalvo was the source of seminal fluid recovered at the scene of Sullivan&#x27;s 1964 murder.

==Controversies==
===Doubts===
Though DeSalvo was conclusively linked to Mary Sullivan&#x27;s murder, doubts remain as to whether he committed all of the Boston Strangler homicides — and whether another killer could still be at large. When he confessed, people who knew him personally did not believe him capable of the crimes. It was also noted that the women allegedly killed by &quot;The Strangler&quot; were of widely varying ages, social status and ethnicities, and that their deaths involved inconsistent modi operandi.

Susan Kelly, an author who has had access to the files of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&#x27; &quot;Strangler Bureau&quot;, argued in her book that the murders were the work of several killers, rather than that of a single individual. Another author, former FBI profiler Robert Ressler, has said, &quot;You&#x27;re putting together so many different patterns [regarding the Boston Strangler murders] that it&#x27;s inconceivable behaviorally that all these could fit one individual.&quot;

In 2000, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, an attorney specializing in forensic cases from Marblehead, Massachusetts, began representing the families of DeSalvo and of Mary A. Sullivan, a 19-year-old who was among the Strangler&#x27;s final victims in 1964. A former print journalist, Sharp obtained court approval to exhume both Sullivan and DeSalvo for DNA testing, filed several court actions to obtain information and physical evidence from the government, and worked with various film producers to create documentaries so as to better educate the public. Through these efforts, Sharp was able to identify several inconsistencies between DeSalvo&#x27;s confessions and the crime scene evidence.

For example, DeSalvo did not, as he claimed, strangle Sullivan with his bare hands; instead, she was strangled by ligature. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden noted that DeSalvo incorrectly stated the time of the victim&#x27;s death—a detail that DeSalvo got wrong in several of the murders, said Susan Kelly. Finally, James Starrs, professor of forensic science at George Washington University, told a news conference that a semen-like substance on her body did not match DeSalvo&#x27;s DNA and could not associate him with her murder.

The victim&#x27;s nephew, Casey Sherman, wrote a book, &quot;A Rose for Mary&quot; (2003), in which he expanded upon the evidence—and leads from Kelly&#x27;s book—to conclude that DeSalvo could not be responsible for her death, and to try to determine her killer&#x27;s identity. Sharp continues to work on the case for the DeSalvo family.

On July 11, 2013, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley stated that DNA testing had revealed a &quot;familial match&quot; between DeSalvo and forensic evidence in the Sullivan killing, leading authorities to request the exhumation of DeSalvo&#x27;s body in order to provide a definitive forensic link of DeSalvo to the murder of Mary Sullivan. Nine days later, investigators announced that the comparison of crime scene evidence and DeSalvo&#x27;s DNA &quot;leaves no doubt that Albert DeSalvo was responsible for the brutal murder of Mary Sullivan&quot;.

===George Nassar===
George Nassar, the inmate DeSalvo reportedly confessed to, is among the suspects in the case. In 1967 he was given a life sentence for the shooting death of an Andover, Massachusetts, gas station attendant. In 2008 and again in 2009, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied Nassar&#x27;s appeals of his 1967 conviction. In 2006, Nassar argued in court filings that he had been unable to make his case in a previous appeal, because he was in federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, in the 1980s and therefore did not have access to Massachusetts legal resources. The court noted that Nassar had returned to Massachusetts in 1983, yet he did not plead his case for more than two decades. Nassar also filed a motion for a new trial in Essex County, which was denied, as was his 2011 petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.

Ames Robey, a former prison psychiatrist who analyzed both DeSalvo and Nassar, has called Nassar a misogynistic, psychopathic killer and a far more likely suspect in the Strangler murders than DeSalvo. Several followers of the case have also declared Nassar to be the real Strangler, claiming that he fed details of the murders to DeSalvo. DeSalvo, they speculated, knew that he would spend the rest of his life in jail for the &quot;Green Man&quot; attacks, and &quot;confessed&quot; so that Nassar could collect reward money that they would split—thus providing support to DeSalvo&#x27;s wife and two children. Another motive was his tremendous need for notoriety. DeSalvo hoped that the case would make him world-famous; Robey testified that &quot;Albert so badly wanted to be the Strangler&quot;.

In a 1999 interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Nassar denied involvement in the murders, saying that the speculation had destroyed his chances for parole. &quot;I had nothing to do with it&quot;, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m convicted under the table, behind the scenes.&quot;

===Other===
In 1971, the Texas legislature unanimously passed a resolution honoring DeSalvo for his work in &quot;population control&quot;—after the vote, Waco Representative Tom Moore Jr. admitted that he had submitted the legislation as an April Fool&#x27;s Day joke against his colleagues—his declared intent was to prove that they pass legislation with no due diligence given to researching the issues beforehand. Having made his point, he withdrew the resolution.

<text>Numerous theoretical accounts of memory have differentiated memory for facts and memory for . Psychologist Endel Tulving (1972; 1983) further defined these two declarative memory conceptions of explicit memory (in which information is consciously registered and recalled) into semantic memory wherein general world knowledge not tied to specific events is stored and episodic memory involving the storage of context-specific information about personal experiences (i.e. time, location, and surroundings of personal knowledge). Conversely, implicit memory (non declarative) involves perhaps unconscious registration (lack of awareness during encoding), yet definite unconscious recollection. Skills and habits, priming, and classical conditioning all utilize implicit memory.

An essential aspect of episodic memory includes date and time encoding in the subject&#x27;s past. For such processing, the details surrounding the memory (where, when, and with whom the experience took place) must be preserved and are necessary for an episodic memory to form, otherwise the memory would be semantic. For instance, one may possess an episodic memory of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, including the fact that he was watching Walter Cronkite announce that Kennedy had been murdered. However, if the contextual details of this event were lost, remaining would be a semantic memory that John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The ability to recall episodic information concerning a memory has been termed source monitoring, and is subject to distortion that may lead to source amnesia.

<text>WLII-DT (channel 11), branded on-air as TeleOnce, is a television station licensed to Caguas, Puerto Rico, serving the U.S. territory as an affiliate of Univision and UniMás. Owned by Liberman Media Group, the station maintains studio facilities on Calle Carazo in Guaynabo, with additional studios at The Mall of San Juan. Its transmitter is located near the Bosque Estatal de Carite mountain reserve.

TeleOnce operates two satellite stations: WSUR-DT (channel 9) in Ponce and [[WOLE-DT]] (channel 12) in Aguadilla.

== History ==

=== Telecadena Perez-Perry (1960–1981) ===
In 1960, Rafael Perez Perry received authorization from the government to start WKBM-TV on May 23, broadcasting on channel 11, as part of his new &#x27;Telecadena Perez-Perry&#x27; chain of television stations. Some of the shows that WKBM-TV aired during these years included:
* &quot;Una Hora Contigo&quot; and &quot;Tira y Tapate&quot; with Myrta Silva
* &quot;Yo Soy el Gallo&quot; with José Miguel Class
* &quot;El Show de Carmita&quot; with Carmita Jiménez
* &quot;El Show de Lissette&quot;, &quot;El Show de Iris Chacón&quot;, &quot;El Hit del Momento&quot;, and &quot;El Super Show Goya&quot; with Enrique Maluenda, Lillian Hurst, and Luz Odilia Font
* &quot;Una Chica llamada&quot;: &quot;Ivonne Coll&quot; and &quot;Cambia Cambia&quot; with Alfred D. Herger
* &quot;Almorzando&quot; and &quot;Del Brazo&quot; with Ruth Fernández
* &quot;Mediodia Circular&quot; with Vilma Carbia

At the time, Perez Perry owned one of the most successful radio stations on the island, WKVM (810 AM). Perez Perry died of a heart attack of unknown cause while he was working on the transmitter in the late 1970s; his death eventually resulted in WKBM-TV declaring bankruptcy in 1981. The station went silent that year. Its former competition benefited from WKBM&#x27;s demise—not only from a reduction in competition itself, but also from the availability of many of the stations&#x27; former hosts and talent.

=== TeleOnce (1986–2002) ===
In 1985, production company Lorimar-Telepictures (with the Telepictures division now part of Warner Bros. Television) acquired the station from bankruptcy court. The callsign became WLII-TV on December 12, and was branded as &#x27;TeleOnce&#x27; on April 27, 1986, with a new slogan: &quot;&quot; ().

Warner Communications (now part of Warner Bros. Discovery) gained indirect ownership of the stations after it bought Lorimar-Telepictures in 1988. The station became a success around this time by airing popular American programs translated in Spanish, especially &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. However, its lack of a repeater or rebroadcaster on the western portion of the island continued to put it behind the competition, WKAQ-TV (channel 2) and WAPA-TV (channel 4). This changed when WNJX-TV (channel 22) in Mayagüez signed an affiliation agreement with the station in the late 1980s. WLII was subsequently sold to Malrite Communications Group in 1991 after it sold WSTE-TV (channel 7); Malrite merged with Raycom Media in 1998.

On January 1, 1995, at midnight, TeleOnce entered into its first marketing agreement with a television station in western Puerto Rico, WORA-TV (channel 5), which at that time had ended an affiliation agreement with WKAQ-TV. In turn, WKAQ-TV switched its affiliation agreement to WOLE-TV (channel 12), which was WAPA-TV&#x27;s repeater station at the time; this left WAPA-TV out of the western Puerto Rico television market for the first time in 30 years.

Some of the shows that aired on WLII during this time included:

* &quot;En Un Día&quot;, &quot;R con R&quot;
* &quot;El Show de Awilda&quot;
* &quot;Dime la Verdad&quot;
* &quot;Ellas al Mediodía&quot;
* &quot;La Noche es Nuestra&quot;
* &quot;Fiesta&quot;
* &quot;A Fuego&quot;
* &quot;Pulso Preciso&quot;
* &quot;Lio&quot;
* &quot;El Super Show&quot;
* &quot;Que Suerte que es Domingo&quot;
* &quot;Anda Pa&#x27;l Cará&quot;
* &quot;Entrando por la Cocina&quot;
* &quot;NBA Jam&quot;
* &quot;Atácate&quot; (a Spanish-language version of &quot;NBA Inside Stuff&quot;)
* &quot;El Kiosko Budweiser&quot;
In addition, the station aired live boxing fights during the weekends—some of which were hosted and promoted by Ivonne Class, the first Puerto Rican woman to become a boxing promoter.

In the late 1980s, actresses Ángela Meyer and Camille Carrión founded Empresas Meca, a production company, which produced some of the last telenovelas shot in Puerto Rico: &quot;La Isla&quot;, &quot;Ave de Paso&quot; (starring Yolandita Monge), &quot;Yara Prohibida&quot;, and &quot;La Otra&quot;.

=== Univision Puerto Rico (2002–2021) ===
In 2002, Univision entered into a local marketing agreement with Raycom Media to operate WLII and WSUR-TV. At the time, WLII had a longtime local marketing agreement with another Puerto Rican station, WSTE (channel 7), which Univision honored. Both WLII and WSUR-TV were sold to Univision Communications in 2005; Univision bought WSTE at the end of 2007. Although Univision operated a second network, UniMás, in the mainland United States, WSTE remained an independent station. In 2005, WLII relocated from its studios in the Puerta de Tierra area of San Juan to a new facility in Guaynabo.

On October 17, 2014, WLII-DT laid off 109 staffers and canceled most of its local programming, becoming a repeater of Univision network programming with minimal local content. With the move, the station&#x27;s daily talk show, &quot;Ruben &amp; Co.&quot;, became the only local program still produced by WLII. In addition, WLII shared a general manager with Univision&#x27;s Puerto Rico radio stations.

On February 25, 2020, investment firms ForgeLight (launched by founder, CEO, and ex-Viacom CFO Wade Davis) and Searchlight Capital agreed to acquire the 64% controlling stake of Univision Communications which owned WLII-DT, while minority owner Televisa continued to hold its 36% stake with the company. However, both Searchlight and ForgeLight had a stake in Hemisphere Media Group, which owns WAPA-TV in San Juan. Univision was required to divest WLII and its satellite stations in order to comply with ownership limits.

=== Liberman purchase and the return of TeleOnce (2021–present) ===
On August 27, 2020, Univision announced that WLII and its satellite stations would be acquired by Liberman Media Group, a company owned by Estrella Media founder Lenard Liberman, for $1 million each. The sale was completed on December 10, 2020. Univision retained WSTE-DT, WKAQ-AM, and WKAQ-FM. It was also reported that WLII would bring back the TeleOnce branding, which the station used for 15 years from 1986 to 2002. On January 19, 2021, Liberman Media Group named Winter Horton as the new general manager for the station.

WLII-DT (and its repeaters) aired as Univision Puerto Rico until February 18, 2021, when the on-screen branding switched to TeleOnce at 8 p.m. The station held a press conference unveiling the new station logo and a new slate of programming, which included the return of local newscasts after more than six years since the dissolution of the original news department. Longtime WAPA-TV news director José Enrique Cruz was named as an adviser for the newly established news department. The debut of new shows, like &quot;Ahora Es que Es&quot; and a new season of &quot;La Comay&quot;, brought high ratings for the revamped network.

On March 2, 2021, WLII&#x27;s second digital subchannel launched as a UniMás affiliate, branded as UniMás Puerto Rico.

On July 2, 2021, Liberman Media Group and TeleOnce entered a distribution agreement with SBS operated stations WACX-DT11 in Orlando, Florida, and WGCT-LD in Tampa, Florida, to show TeleOnce programming on their stations. Local programs &quot;La Comay&quot;, &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot;, and &quot;Ahora Es que Es&quot; began airing on Mega TV stations either live or on the same day they originally aired in Puerto Rico. This agreement marked the first time that local Puerto Rican programming was exported to the mainland United States since the launch of WAPA America in 2004.

On December 8, 2021, WLII-DT unveiled their new studio facility at The Mall of San Juan. The facility, which occupies one of the empty anchor spaces at the shopping center, was unveiled during the station&#x27;s upfront presentation which was held at the site. The station&#x27;s new game show, &quot;La Boveda de Mr. Cash&quot;, was the first to broadcast live from the new studios when it premiered on March 1, 2022.

=== WSUR-TV history (1958–present) ===
WSUR-TV was founded on February 20, 1958, by American Colonial Broadcasting. In 1963, the station was located on Avenida Tito Castro (Puerto Rico Highway 14) in the La Rambla sector of Barrio Machuelo Abajo; its transmitter tower was located within the municipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, and it was an affiliate of WAPA-TV, but carried two local programs from Ponce. The station transmitted its analog signal over VHF channel 9.

Currently, WSUR originates no local programming of its own. Its tower is now located at Cerro Jayuya in the border between the municipality of Ponce with Jayuya.

==Programming==
=== &quot;Las Noticias&quot; (1986–2014, 2021–present) ===


Las Noticias Teleonce is the flagship news program for WLII and its repeater stations, it is currently anchored by Celimar Adames Casalduc during its day editions and by Ricardo Curras and Shirlyan Odette during its night edition.

The news program originated in 1986 and ran four editions weekdays and two on weekends until its abrupt cancellation in 2014 by Univision who decided to close the station&#x27;s news department. In 2020, Univision sold TeleOnce to Liberman Media Group and the new ownership quickly reopened the station&#x27;s news department and revived &quot;Las Noticias&quot;.

===&quot;Tu Mañana/En La Mañana&quot; (1991–2014, 2023–present)===

On March 11, 1991, a weekday morning news program, &quot;Tu Mañana&quot;, made its debut; the program was anchored by Carlos Ochoteco and Cyd Marie Fleming and featured segments such as panels of experts on different topics. Over the course of its history the program was hosted by Burni Torres and Felipe Gomez, Nuria Sebazco and Elwood Cruz, and finally, Grisell Mamery and Gredmarie Colón. After the closure of the station&#x27;s news department &quot;Tu Mañana&quot; was cancelled. The show&#x27;s revival finally arrived in 2023 after Liberman Media Group&#x27;s purchase of WLII from Univision. The new version of the show will now be called &quot;En La Mañana&quot; and it premiered on October 30, 2023.

===&quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot; (2017–present)===


In November 2017, it was announced that the political analysis show &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot; would move to Univision Puerto Rico after initially premiering on NCN Television and Sistema TV. The show, hosted by radio personality and former PPD legislator Ferdinand Perez with a panel of journalists and political analysts discussing current events, began airing soon thereafter during the 6 p.m. spot, before bouncing around several timeslots on the station. Currently the program airs at 7 p.m. and features Alex Delgado from NotiUno, Cyd Marie Fleming and Margarita Aponte as contributors, both of whom were original reporters for &quot;Las Noticias&quot; prior to it shutting down in 2014.

On August 28, 2022, the show premiered its new special Sunday edition called &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura: Puerto Rico Habla&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Puerto Rico Speaks&quot;&#x27;). The show works as a town hall meeting where a live audience is welcomed and encouraged to ask questions on social problems and a panel of experts and local politicians is present to respond to these issues and offer solutions. The specials will air once a month on Sundays in the show&#x27;s usual time slot of 7 p.m. and will take place from the channel&#x27;s studios at The Mall of San Juan.

===&quot;Acuéstate con Francis&quot; (2021–2022)===

On June 11, 2021, WLII announced the surprise signing of Puerto Rican comedian Francis Rosas, who had worked as part of comedy projects on WAPA-TV for over 20 years. The deal with Rosas allowed the comedian to launch his own comedy show with him serving as executive producer and his production company (Rosas and Pitbull, Co.) working alongside WLII&#x27;s owner, Liberman Media Group, in the production of other future projects.

At the time of Rosas&#x27; signing with WLII, the comedian was still under contract with WAPA-TV&#x27;s Sanco Productions, owned by actor and comedian Sunshine Logroño. On July 2, 2021, Logroño and his wife Gilda Santini sued Francis Rosas and his production company for breach of contract (Rosas had signed a 2-year extension to his contract with WAPA-TV in January 2021); additionally, the lawsuit asked Rosas to pay $100,000 in damages and included a request for the court to prohibit Rosas from appearing on any television network until the end of his deal in October 2022. On July 15, 2021, The First Instance Court of San Juan denied the injunction by Logroño to prohibit Rosas from appearing on any other television network until 2022, stating: &quot;The court recognized an artists&#x27; liberty of working where they pleased.&quot;

On September 27, 2021, it was announced that the title of Rosas&#x27; upcoming show would be &quot;Acuéstate con Francis&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Go to Bed with Francis&quot;&#x27;). The show&#x27;s premiere date was scheduled for October 11, 2021, at 10 p.m. Rosas described the show as a family show that would follow a late-night talk show format, featuring sketches, interviews, and games with a variety of guests and a live studio audience. The show officially premiered on October 11, 2021, featuring guests Félix Trinidad, Celimar Adames Casalduc, and musical guest Nio Garcia who performed his single &quot;Tus Poses&quot;. The premiere also featured special appearances by Danilo Beauchamp and Alejandro Gil, who worked alongside Rosas on WAPA-TV; the duo teased joining Rosas on WLII in the future.

On July 13, 2022, WLII-DT operator Liberman Media Group cancelled the show. The final episode aired on Friday July 15, 2022, and featured Rosas&#x27; comedy partners Danilo Beuchamp and Alejandro Gil, urban artist Alejo, and influencer Andrea Ojeda Cruz &quot;La Peki&quot; as guests; it closed with the show&#x27;s house band playing the chorus to Chumbawamba&#x27;s &quot;Tubthumping&quot;. Rosas is expected to continue to work with the station and will develop a new show through his production company.

===&quot;La Boveda de Teleonce&quot; (2021–present)===


Premiering on March 1, 2022, from TeleOnce&#x27;s new studio facility at The Mall of San Juan, as &quot;La Boveda de Mr. Cash&quot; (Mr. Cash&#x27;s Vault) the game show was initially hosted by Josue Carrión and featured a series of games where participants would try and win cash prizes and an opportunity to enter The Vault where they would have 30 seconds to retrieve prizes such as electronics, home appliances and more. Initially scheduled to premiere on January 31, the date was pushed back,

On August 5, 2022, WLII announced that &quot;La Boveda&quot; would move to prime time—starting August 22, 2022, the show would air at 8 p.m., following &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot;. It was also announced that Josué Carrión would not continue as host and the show would be renamed &quot;La Boveda&quot; (&quot;&#x27;The Vault&quot;&#x27;); co-hosts Andrea Rivera, Luis Fontánez &quot;Finito&quot;, and Awilda Herrera continued hosting the show after Carrión exit and were joined by musician Andres Waldemar as co-host.

The new version of the show, which premiered on August 22, 2022, featured the introduction of TeleBingo a live bingo game where the audience watching at home got to play using bingo cards distributed through the local newspaper &quot;El Vocero&quot; and local supermarkets and restaurants. The prize is $1,000 for the winner of the live bingo game but if there&#x27;s no winner by the end of the week that prize money will continue to double until there is a winner.

On June 27, 2023, host Andres Waldemar announced through his social media pages that he would no longer be hosting &quot;La Bóveda&quot; after almost one year on the show. The network announced that comedian Danilo Beauchamp would take over as host of the show.

===&quot;PR En Vivo&quot; (2022–present)===
Following the cancellation of &quot;Acuestate con Francis&quot; in July 2022, it was clarified that although the show was ending, comedian Francis Rosas was still under contract with Liberman Media Group and that he was already working on his next project for the station. On September 16, 2022, it was announced on &quot;La Comay&quot; that the station planned to premiere a new midday show featuring Rosas alongside radio personality Deddie Romero as co-host. On September 27, the station confirmed that the show would be called &quot;PR En Vivo&quot; (&quot;&#x27;PR Live&quot;&#x27;) and would air weekdays at 12:30 p.m. and have a half-hour duration. It premiered on October 10, 2022. The show features Rosas and Romero discussing a variety of lifestyle issues, news, and conducting interviews with guests. A biweekly (Mondays and Wednesdays) segment featuring PNP Representative Jorge &quot;Georgie&quot; Navarro will also give viewers the opportunity to call in and report local issues to be resolved by the politician.

On January 30, 2024, it was announced that &quot;PR En Vivo&quot; would now be an hour show starting February 12. With the extra half hour added, the show is now set to start at 11 a.m. and serve as a lead in for &quot;Las Noticias: Al Mediodía&quot;.

===&quot;El Poder del Pueblo&quot; (2022–present)===
In January 2022, Gary Rodriguez signed an agreement with WLII to join the station&#x27;s newscast &quot;Las Noticias&quot; and eventually develop his own show. On October 21, 2022, WLII-DT announced a new project titled &quot;El Poder Del Pueblo&quot; (&quot;&#x27;The People&#x27;s Power&quot;&#x27;), which would focus on community issues affecting Puerto Ricans. Rodriguez would host the show and be joined by Jessica Serrano and Shalimar Rivera (who previously worked for the station on the cancelled &quot;Ahora Es que Es&quot;). Additionally, the show would feature Ricardo Eladio Martínez (who previously worked on &quot;La Comay&quot; as a reporter), Carlisa Colón (making the jump from WKAQ-TV where she guest-hosted &quot;Alexandra a las 12&quot;), Rocky &quot;The Kid&quot;, and professor Jorge Suárez Cáceres. The program premiered on October 31, 2022, at the 2:55 p.m. timeslot and served as a lead-in for &quot;Las Noticias&quot;. The addition of &quot;El Poder Del Pueblo&quot; increased WLII-DT&#x27;s local programming production to 35 hours per week.

The program is filmed at the channel&#x27;s studios in Guaynabo. It follows a panel show format wherein Rodriguez sets up a topic for Rivera, Gallart, and Colón to discuss while the audience can voice their own positions through on-screen polls. Jessica Serrano and Ricardo Eladio serve as on-field reporters covering news stories outside the studio. Additionally, the program features segments with collaborators such as Janet Parra, who served as a prosecutor for the Puerto Rico Justice Department and will be in charge of breaking down local crime stories and their subsequent court proceedings. Local politicians Jorge Suarez, Jorge Colberg, and Joanne Rodriguez Veve also feature as collaborators with occasional segments.

On January 17, 2023, Rocky &quot;The Kid&quot; announced he was leaving the show just three months after the premiere. Gallart cited burn out and wanting to spend more time with his family while announcing his decision on &quot;La Comay&quot;. Though other personalities have been filling Gallart&#x27;s role, a permanent replacement has not been announced yet.

On November 1, 2023, just a day after the show&#x27;s first anniversary, the show went through a major change of its presenters. Carlisa Colón announced she was leaving the show to go back to WKAQ-TV and Shalimar Rivera was relieved of her duties by the production. Former senator and political commentator Zoe Laboy would make the jump from WKAQ-TV to join &quot;El Poder del Pueblo&quot; as a result of these changes, her first episode aired on November 6, 2023.

===&quot;En Alerta&quot; (2024–present)===

After the abrupt ending of the &quot;La Comay&quot; show in December 2023, TeleOnce needed a new show for the 5:55 p.m. time slot. On January 5, 2024, the station announced the new show would be called (&quot;On Alert&quot;) and would feature extraordinary stories and unexpected situations, the format of the program is compared to that of &quot;Primer Impacto&quot; and &quot;Al Rojo Vivo&quot;. On January 10, 2024, TeleOnce announced that the show would be hosted by Jessica Serrano (who also works as a reporter on ) and Yan Ruiz (who was La Comay&#x27;s sidekick before the show&#x27;s abrupt ending). The show premiered on January 15, 2024, at 5:55 p.m. and has a duration of 35 minutes due to TeleOnce&#x27;s decision to add an extra half-hour to &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot; and have that show start at 6:30 p.m.

===&quot;Pa&#x27; Ganar y Reir con Teleonce&quot; (2024–present)===

Veteran actor Adrián García is also expected to join the show to act alongside Sais in comedy sketches.

<text>The SS1 (short for , ) is the standard assault rifle of the Indonesian armed forces and Indonesian National Police. It is based on the FN FNC rifle but modified in order to meet ergonomic and tropical environment needs.

The assault rifles are gas-operated automatic carbines with a foldable butt and are designed to meet the NATO standard. SS1 weapons are high performance light individual weapons that have been used by the Indonesian armed forces, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as police. It was adopted into Indonesian service in 1991.

It is currently being phased out and replaced by the Pindad SS2. The SS1 would possibly be used by reserve or paramilitary forces when the SS2 is fully adopted into service.

The SS1 is manufactured by PT Pindad, Bandung, Indonesia under the license from Fabrique Nationale, Belgium.

==History==
In 1976 from experiences gained in the field, an idea to create a new assault rifle to replace the existing standard issue or SP series battle rifle surfaced. In 1977 a prototype dubbed SS-77 () was born. The SS-77 assault rifle design and operating system were based on the ArmaLite AR-18, utilizing a gas-operated, rotating bolt mechanism. It has a magazine capacity of 30 rounds chambered in 5.56x45 mm caliber with Safe-Semi-Auto firing modes. The SS-77 assault rifle design includes both a standard long-barreled version and a carbine (short-barreled) variant with a folding stock. In 1978, 150 prototypes with foldable stock were produced, 30 were sent to the Army Research and Development Service (Dislitbangad) for testing purposes.

In 1979, the SS-77 was further developed using 7.62x51mm ammunition, resulting in the SS-79 (). The Indonesian Army (TNI AD) and the Department of Defense and Security () intended to adopt it as the standard infantry rifle, replacing the SP-1 as previously planned. However, due to considerations issued by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in 1982, the decision was not to produce it from scratch due to the lengthy time frame and high research and development costs.

As a cost-saving and time-efficient approach, BPPT proposed licensing existing assault rifles that had already proven their durability and reliability in the field. During the initial evaluation, six types of assault rifles were considered: the German HK33, the American M16A1, the Belgian FNC, the Swiss SIG SG 540, the Austrian Steyr, and the Pietro Beretta AR70.

Chief of Staff of the Army&#x27;s order in May 1978 to the Commanding General (Danjen) of the Education and Training Development Command (Kobangdiklat) to form a trial team, consisting of related elements, namely:

* Director of Research and Development of the Education and Training Development Command (Dirlitbang Kobangdiklat) as chairman
* Event activities (Lakgiat) carried out by: Col. Inf. Alex Suseno
* Infantry Center (Pussenif) from the Engineering Department: Major Inf. Pieter Hermanus
* Pindad from Head of the Weapons Development and Research Section (Kabanglitbangjat) and Military equipment (Almil): Major CPL. Sutartro
* Meanwhile, the troops were a Company of the Kostrad&#x27;s 328th Airborne Battalion (Yonif 328 Linud Kostrad) with Battalion Commander Major Inf. Bambang Sembodo

the trials included:

* Ease of disassembling, and assembling weapons in the field
* Ease of lining up, formations, and marching
* Reliability combat tests in the field

The trial results are based on the assessment criteria and the assessment sequence is as follows:

# HK33
# M16A1
# FNC
# AR70
# SG 540
# Steyr

Then the possibility of further production in Pindad was evaluated.

From the test results, three strong candidates emerged: HK33, M16A1, and the FNC. While the HK33 was the top choice, its use of a delayed blowback system instead of a gas-operated mechanism (a must requirement by Indonesia), complex and expensive technology, and certain components (especially the barrel) made local production unfeasible, certain components also have to be supplied from Germany especially rollers. Consequently, the adoption of HK33 was canceled.

The M16A1, which was favored by the troops for its light weight was the second candidate, faced stringent requirements. These included importing ammunition, main mechanical system components, and barrels directly from the United States. In 1977, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) aimed to transform the Indonesian Army Military Industries (Pindad) Small Arms Factory in Bandung into a co-production facility for M16A1 rifles. Both Colt Industries and Lockheed Aircraft Corporation submitted proposals. By 13 December 1977, the Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) was processing Colt’s request for an export license. At year’s end, the DSAA awaited contract details to draft a Memorandum of Understanding for approval by the Secretary of State and Congress. On 23 August 1978, Indonesia invited the US to negotiate regarding the use of the weapon. As a result, the US said that Indonesia could only produce 150,000 M16A1s, and not all components could be made in Indonesia, such as the trigger housing, munitions, upper and lower mechanical housings, and barrel. Consequently, the adoption of the M16A1 was canceled.

Ultimately, the FNC (the third candidate) was chosen and officially became the modern infantry assault rifle used by the entire Indonesian National Armed Forces. The decision to select the FNC was influenced by the ease of technology transfer offered by the principal manufacturer, FN Herstal SA from Belgium, which agreed to provide up to 100% technology transfer. With FNC, all technology is given, starting from the smallest down to the production machines, so that true technology transfer can be achieved.

Another key consideration was that the FNC assault rifle had already adopted a 7-inch barrel and used SS-109 ammunition (full metal jacket) as per NATO standards. Subsequently, in February 1983, BPPT, representing the Indonesian government, reached an agreement with FN Herstal SA of Belgium. As part of the deal, PT Pindad was required to produce a minimum of 200,000 FNC rifles. After meeting this requirement, no further royalties needed to be paid to the principal. Initially, the TNI imported these assault rifles directly from Belgium. It wasn’t until 1984 that production began at the PT Pindad factory in Kiara Condong, Bandung, Indonesia, after completing all necessary preparations. The officially designated name for this assault rifle became SS-1 (). According to the agreement, FN Herstal agreed to finance the repair and retrofit program of existing 20,000 FNCs that had issues which were already purchased by Dephankam.

After 10,000 FN FNC rifles were bought for the Indonesian military, Pindad secured a license in 1984 from FN to manufacture the FNC. Indonesia adopted the SS1s into official service by 1991.

A 2009 seizure of Pindad SS1 rifles alongside P2 pistols in the Philippines has led to a special investigation on Pindad on whether weapon smuggling did take place. The Indonesian government, in response, made preparations to form a special agency to handle all overseas trade. The Ministry of State Enterprises conducted an investigation against Pindad over the seizure of its firearms.

==Design==
The external looks of the SS1s are strongly similar to the FN FNC, ranging from the pistol grip to the stock, receiver and barrel. Optics can be mounted onto the SS1 rifles, but a special optic mount must be installed first before any optic can be used.

The SS1s are designed by Pindad to allow for the use of their own indigenous SPG-1A underbarrel grenade launcher, inserted underneath the barrel. Most SS1 rifle models, with the exception of the SBC-1, are made with selective fire modes that consist of single, three round burst and full auto firing modes.

==Variants==

*SS1-V1
:The V1 is the primary variant, and is most widely used by Indonesian regular infantry forces, with standard barrel and folding stock.

* : Confiscated by Philippine customs officials when a ship bound to Mali, passing by the Philippines to deliver 10 P2 pistols, was raided after arriving in Philippine waters. The Malian government had ordered 100 SS-1V1 rifles. The rifles were meant to be used by Malian Ministry of Internal Security and Civil Protection. According to Fernandino Tuason of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service, he had received credible information that certain politicians were planning to use the weapons, mostly Galils, for destabilization efforts for the presidential elections scheduled to be held in 2010. Pindad officials have explained the misunderstanding since the SS1 rifles are not Galils. The Manila Bulletin has been the only media outlet to check that the Galils are not Galil rifles, but SS1s. In addition, they are presenting evidence that the small arms shipment is legal. It&#x27;s suggested that a gun-running syndicate is the culprit for getting Indonesian-made weapons to the Philippines. According to further investigation, end user certificates issued by Indonesia were faked.

Some notable production credits of Vig&#x27;s include L7&#x27;s &quot;Bricks are Heavy&quot; (1992) and the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; (1993).

A native of Wisconsin, Vig studied at the University of Wisconsin and performed in local bands Spooner and Fire Town. He set up his own recording studio in Madison, Smart Studios, with bandmate Steve Marker. After becoming well known as a producer, he formed and played drums with Garbage, which sold 17 million records over a ten-year period. Vig returned to producing full-time when Garbage went on hiatus in 2005. The band reconvened in 2010 to record material for their fifth album. In 2012, &quot;NME&quot; ranked Vig the ninth greatest producer of all time.

==Early life==
Vig was born in Viroqua, Wisconsin, son of DeVerne William Vig (1922–2021) and Betty Jeanette (1931–2005), née Brewster. DeVerne Vig was a hospital staff doctor who practiced medicine with his twin, David, and their elder brother, Edward, in Viroqua for nearly forty years; Betty Vig was a music teacher and clinic administrator who played an active role in the community as a Sunday School teacher, Girl Scout leader, and director of the Country Club and Viroqua Bloodmobile Service. Vig has two siblings, Chris and Lisa. Vig acquired the nickname Butch as a child, due to the severe crew cut his father gave him. Vig studied piano for six years. After seeing The Who perform on &quot;The Smothers Brothers&quot;, he swapped his piano for a $60 drum kit.

Moving to Madison, Vig enrolled at the University of Wisconsin to study film direction.

==Career==

===Early musical career===
While a student at the University of Wisconsin, Vig met his eventual Garbage bandmate Steve Marker. Vig contributed several electronic music soundtrack pieces to low-budget films, including one song on &quot;Slumber Party Massacre&quot;, a Hollywood B-movie. This soundtrack work stirred Vig&#x27;s interest in the manipulation of sound. Vig joined a number of garage pop bands, including Eclipse, and in 1978 joined Spooner with Duke Erikson, Dave Benton, Jeff Walker and Joel Tappero.

The following year, Vig helped Marker build a home studio in Marker&#x27;s basement. Benton, Marker and Vig also started a small label, Boat Records, to release records of Spooner – which included their 1979 debut EP, &quot;Cruel School&quot; – and other bands they liked, which led to around twenty local acts. The self-producing was later described by Vig as &quot;kind of a trial by fire&quot;.

In 1984, Vig and Marker founded Smart Studios in Madison, while still performing drums in Spooner at night and driving a taxi cab during the day. When Spooner lost momentum, Vig formed a band called First Person with Marker and Phil Davis and a side project called Fire Town featuring Davis and Erikson. Fire Town quickly became Vig&#x27;s priority, and after their first album was signed to Atlantic Records. Atlantic hired producer Michael Fondelli to work with Fire Town on their second album. While the sessions did not do well, and the resulting record sank, Vig learned a lot of production techniques from the process. Fire Town split, and Vig reformed Spooner for a final album before working as a producer became his full-time career.

===Production career===
Vig&#x27;s first high-profile production work was in 1991, when he produced albums by two bands, The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Gish&quot; and Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Vig incorporated overdubs and vocal double tracking, whereas Nirvana&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Bleach&quot; (produced by Jack Endino), had a more &quot;lo-fi&quot; sound. Kurt Cobain originally refused to double-track his vocals and guitars but Vig reportedly got him to comply by saying &quot;John Lennon double-tracked&quot;. Cobain would later criticize Vig for the album&#x27;s slickness, although this might be due to Andy Wallace&#x27;s mixing of the album. Cobain said in a 1993 MTV interview that &quot;Butch Vig...recorded the album perfectly&quot;. The success of &quot;Nevermind&quot; earned Vig the nickname &quot;Nevermind Man&quot;, according to the BBC. Billy Corgan welcomed Vig&#x27;s elaborate production on The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. This album met with widespread acclaim and strong sales, breaking another indie band into the mainstream. Vig also produced two critically praised Sonic Youth albums, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Dirty&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star&quot;.

Vig worked with Jimmy Eat World on their sixth album, &quot;Chase This Light&quot;, released in October 2007. His first production for an English band was 2008&#x27;s &quot;All or Nothing&quot; by The Subways. He also worked with Against Me!, producing their two Sire Records releases, &quot; New Wave&quot; and &quot; White Crosses&quot;, as well as working with singer Laura Jane Grace on her solo EP, &quot;Heart Burns&quot;. Vig produced the eighth studio album by Green Day, 2009&#x27;s &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Recently, Vig has been partnered in duties by his engineer and mixer Billy Bush, who also worked on Garbage&#x27;s albums and live tours.

Vig composed and produced the soundtrack for the film &quot;The Other Side&quot;. In 2009 Vig recorded two new tracks for the long-awaited greatest hits release by the Foo Fighters, most notably the single &quot;Wheels&quot; and ultimately produced their April 2011 follow-up, &quot;Wasting Light&quot;. In 2010, Vig produced Muse&#x27;s single &quot;Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever),&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; soundtrack.

In 2020, Vig produced the soundtrack for the 2021 film &quot;Puppy Love&quot;, including tracks by Portugal. The Man, LP, Mickey Avalon, Wayne Newton, and others.

===Garbage===

Vig stated, &quot;Part of the reason why I started Garbage was that by the time I&#x27;d done &quot;&#x27;Nevermind&quot;,&#x27; I&#x27;d recorded – I swear to God – 1,000 bands that were just guitar-bass-drums. I was reading about all these other records that I was getting excited about – like Public Enemy using a sampler in the studio – and I just decided I wanted to do a bit of a U-turn.&quot; Afterwards, they hired Scottish singer Shirley Manson and began composing together.

Garbage released a string of singles in 1995–1996, including &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; and &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;. Their debut album, &quot;Garbage&quot;, was an unexpected smash, selling over 4 million copies and certified double platinum in the UK, United States and Australia. Garbage won the Breakthrough Artist award at the 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards. The band then spent two years working on follow-up album, &quot;Version 2.0&quot;, which topped the charts in the UK upon its 1998 release and the following year was nominated for two Grammy Awards, Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. &quot;Version 2.0&quot; went on to match the sales of its predecessor. Garbage followed this up by performing and co-producing the theme song to the nineteenth James Bond movie, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;.

Despite being named one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Top 10 Albums of The Year, Garbage&#x27;s 2001 third album, &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot;, failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded in late 2003, but regrouped to complete fourth album &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; in 2005, peaking at a career-high #4 in the U.S. The band cut short their concert tour in support of &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; announcing an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;, emphasizing that they had not broken up, but wished to pursue personal interests. In 2006, Vig returned to producing while Manson worked on a solo album (as yet unreleased). Garbage ended their hiatus in 2007, and released greatest hits retrospective &quot;Absolute Garbage&quot;. Worldwide, the band have sold over 17 million albums. The band got back together in 2010 and began recording their new album, &quot;Not Your Kind of People&quot;, which was released internationally on May 14, 2012. This was followed by &quot;Strange Little Birds&quot;, released on June 10, 2016.

===The Emperors of Wyoming===
In 2011, Vig formed an alt-country band called The Emperors of Wyoming with Phil Davis, Frank Anderson and Pete Anderson. They released a self-titled album on September 17, 2012.

===5 Billion in Diamonds===
In 2017, Vig debuted his band 5 Billion in Diamonds. Their self titled debut album was released on August 11, 2017. Their second, &quot;Divine Accidents&quot;, was released on November 20, 2020.

==Personal life==
Vig is married to Beth Halper, a former DreamWorks A&amp;R executive; they have a daughter, Bo Violet. They live in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.
