<text>Rhinoplasty (, nose + , to shape), commonly called nose job, medically called nasal reconstruction, is a plastic surgery procedure for altering and reconstructing the nose. There are two types of plastic surgery used – reconstructive surgery that restores the form and functions of the nose and cosmetic surgery that changes the appearance of the nose. Reconstructive surgery seeks to resolve nasal injuries caused by various traumas including blunt, and penetrating trauma and trauma caused by blast injury. Reconstructive surgery can also treat birth defects, breathing problems, and failed primary rhinoplasties. Rhinoplasty may remove a bump, narrow nostril width, change the angle between the nose and the mouth, or address injuries, birth defects, or other problems that affect breathing, such as a deviated nasal septum or a sinus condition. Surgery only on the septum is called a septoplasty.

In closed rhinoplasty and open rhinoplasty surgeries – a plastic surgeon, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), or an oral and maxillofacial surgeon (jaw, face, and neck specialist), creates a functional, aesthetic, and facially proportionate nose by separating the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the nasal framework, altering them as required for form and function, suturing the incisions, using tissue glue and applying either a package or a stent, or both, to immobilize the altered nose to ensure the proper healing of the surgical incision.

==History==

Treatments for the plastic repair of a broken nose are first mentioned in the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a transcription of text dated to the Old Kingdom from 3000 to 2500 BCE.

The &quot;Ebers Papyrus&quot; ( 1550 BC), an Ancient Egyptian medical papyrus, describes rhinoplasty as the plastic surgical operation for reconstructing a nose destroyed by rhinectomy. Such a mutilation was inflicted as a criminal, religious, political, and military punishment in that time and culture.

Rhinoplasty techniques are described in the ancient Indian text &quot;Sushruta samhita&quot; by Sushruta, where a nose is reconstructed by using a flap of skin from the cheek.

During the Roman Empire (27 BC – 476 AD) the encyclopaedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus ( 25 BC – 50 AD) published the 8-tome &quot;De Medicina&quot; (On Medicine, 14 AD), which described plastic surgery techniques and procedures for the correction and the reconstruction of the nose and other body parts.

At the Byzantine Roman court of the Emperor Julian the Apostate (331–363 AD), the royal physician Oribasius ( 320–400 AD) published the 70-volume &quot;Synagogue Medicae&quot; (Medical Compilations, 4th century AD), which described facial-defect reconstructions that featured loose sutures that permitted a surgical wound to heal without distorting the facial flesh; how to clean the bone exposed in a wound; debridement, how to remove damaged tissue to forestall infection and so accelerate healing of the wound; and how to use autologous skin flaps to repair damaged cheeks, eyebrows, lips, and nose, to restore the patient&#x27;s normal visage.

In Italy, Gasparo Tagliacozzi (1546–1599), professor of surgery and anatomy at the University of Bologna, published &quot;Curtorum Chirurgia Per Insitionem&quot; (The Surgery of Defects by Implantations, 1597), a technico–procedural manual for the surgical repair and reconstruction of facial wounds in soldiers. The illustrations featured a re-attachment rhinoplasty using a biceps muscle pedicle flap; the graft attached at 3-weeks post-procedure; which, at 2-weeks post-attachment, the surgeon then shaped into a nose.

In Great Britain, Joseph Constantine Carpue (1764–1846) published the descriptions of two rhinoplasties: the reconstruction of a battle-wounded nose, and the repair of an arsenic-damaged nose. (cf. Carpue&#x27;s operation).

In Germany, rhinoplastic technique was refined by surgeons such as the Berlin University professor of surgery Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe (1787–1840), who published &quot;Rhinoplastik&quot; (Rebuilding the Nose, 1818) wherein he described 55 historical plastic surgery procedures, and his technically innovative free-graft nasal reconstruction (with a tissue-flap harvested from the patient&#x27;s arm), and surgical approaches to eyelid, cleft lip, and cleft palate corrections. Dr. von Gräfe&#x27;s protégé, the medical and surgical polymath Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794–1847), who was among the first surgeons to anaesthetize the patient before performing the nose surgery, published &quot;Die Operative Chirurgie&quot; (Operative Surgery, 1845), which became a foundational medical and plastic surgical text (see strabismus, torticollis). Moreover, the Prussian Jacques Joseph (1865–1934) published &quot;Nasenplastik und sonstige Gesichtsplastik&quot; (Rhinoplasty and other Facial Plastic Surgeries, 1928), which described refined surgical techniques for performing nose-reduction rhinoplasty via internal incisions.

In the United States, in 1887, the otolaryngologist John Orlando Roe (1848–1915) performed the first modern endonasal rhinoplasty (closed rhinoplasty) in order to treat saddle nose deformities.

In the early 20th century, Freer, in 1902, and Killian, in 1904, pioneered the submucous resection septoplasty (SMR) procedure for correcting a deviated septum; they raised mucoperichondrial tissue flaps, and resected the cartilaginous and bony septum (including the vomer bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), maintaining septal support with a 1.0-cm margin at the dorsum and a 1.0-cm margin at the caudad, for which innovations the technique became the foundational, standard septoplastic procedure. In 1929, Peer and Metzenbaum performed the first manipulation of the caudal septum, where it originates and projects from the forehead. In 1934, Aurel Rethi introduced the open rhinoplasty approach featuring an incision to the nasal septum to facilitate modifying the tip of the nose. In 1947, Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981) endonasally resolved a septal deviation with a minimalist hemitransfixion incision, which conserved the septum; thus, he advocated for the practical primacy of the closed rhinoplasty approach. In 1957, A. Sercer advocated the &quot;decortication of the nose&quot; (&quot;Dekortication des Nase&quot;) technique which featured a columellar-incision open rhinoplasty that allowed greater access to the nasal cavity and to the nasal septum.

The endonasal rhinoplasty was the usual approach to nose surgery until the 1970s, when Padovan presented his technical refinements, advocating the open rhinoplasty approach; he was seconded by Wilfred S. Goodman in the later 1970s, and by Jack P. Gunter in the 1990s. Goodman impelled technical and procedural progress and popularized the open rhinoplasty approach. In 1987, Gunter reported the technical effectiveness of the open rhinoplasty approach for performing a secondary rhinoplasty; his improved techniques advanced the management of a failed nose surgery.

In early 2021, it was reported that a trend that involved getting a rhinoplasty had emerged on the social media platform TikTok. The trend became known as the #NoseJobCheck trend and involved users of the platform posting videos that showed how their noses looked before and after their rhinoplasty surgeries, with a specific audio soundtracking the video. From October 2020 to January 2021, the #NoseJobCheck audio had been used in over 120,000 videos and videos with the #NoseJobCheck hashtag had accumulated over one billion views.

==Anatomy of the human nose==
===The structures of the nose===

For plastic surgical correction, the structural anatomy of the nose comprises: A. the nasal soft tissues; B. the aesthetic subunits and segments; C. the blood supply arteries and veins; D. the nasal lymphatic system; E. the facial and nasal nerves; F. the nasal bone; and G. the nasal cartilages.

==== A. The nasal soft tissues ====

*Nasal skin – Like the underlying bone-and-cartilage (osseo-cartilaginous) support framework of the nose, the external skin is divided into vertical thirds (anatomic sections); from the glabella (the space between the eyebrows), to the bridge, to the tip, for corrective plastic surgery, the nasal skin is anatomically considered, as the:

# Upper third section – the skin of the upper nose is thin, subcutaneous fat layer is thicker and relatively distensible (flexible and mobile), but then tapers, adhering tightly to the osseo-cartilaginous framework, and becomes the thinner skin of the dorsal section, the bridge of the nose.
# Middle third section – the skin overlying the bridge of the nose (mid-dorsal section) is the thinnest, least distensible, nasal skin, because it most adheres to the support framework.
# Lower third section – the skin of the lower nose is as thicker and less mobile, because it has more sebaceous glands, especially at the nasal tip. Subcutaneous fat layer is very thin.

* Nasal lining – At the vestibule, the human nose is lined with a mucous membrane of squamous epithelium, which tissue then transitions to become columnar respiratory epithelium, a pseudo-stratified, ciliated (lash-like) tissue with abundant seromucous glands, which maintains the nasal moisture and protects the respiratory tract from bacteriologic infection and foreign objects.
* Nasal muscles – The movements of the human nose are controlled by groups of facial and neck muscles that are set deep to the skin; they are in four functional groups that are interconnected by the nasal superficial aponeurosis—the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS)—which is a sheet of dense, fibrous, collagenous connective tissue that covers, invests, and forms the terminations of the muscles.

===== The movements of the nose are affected by =====

# the elevator muscle group – which includes the procerus muscle and the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle.
# the depressor muscle group – which includes the alar nasalis muscle and the depressor septi nasi muscle.
# the compressor muscle group – which includes the transverse nasalis muscle.
# the dilator muscle group – which includes the dilator naris muscle that expands the nostrils; it is in two parts: (i) the dilator nasi anterior muscle, and (ii) the dilator nasi posterior muscle.

==== B. Aesthetics of the nose – nasal subunits and nasal segments ====
To plan, map, and execute the surgical correction of a nasal defect or deformity, the structure of the external nose is divided into nine aesthetic nasal subunits, and six aesthetic nasal segments, which provide the plastic surgeon with the measures for determining the size, extent, and topographic locale of the nasal defect or deformity.

===== The surgical nose as nine &quot;aesthetic nasal subunits&quot; =====

# tip subunit
# columellar subunit
# right alar base subunit
# right alar wall subunit
# left alar wall subunit
# left alar base subunit
# dorsal subunit
# right dorsal wall subunit
# left dorsal wall subunit

In turn, the nine aesthetic nasal subunits are configured as six aesthetic nasal segments; each segment comprehends a nasal area greater than that comprehended by a nasal subunit.

===== The surgical nose as six &quot;aesthetic nasal segments&quot; =====

# the dorsal nasal segment
# the lateral nasal-wall segments
# the hemi-lobule segment
# the soft-tissue triangle segments
# the alar segments
# the columellar segment

Using the co-ordinates of the subunits and segments to determine the topographic location of the defect on the nose, the plastic surgeon plans, maps, and executes a rhinoplasty procedure. The unitary division of the nasal topography permits minimal, but precise, cutting, and maximal corrective-tissue coverage, to produce a functional nose of proportionate size, contour, and appearance for the patient. Hence, if more than 50 percent of an aesthetic subunit is lost (damaged, defective, destroyed) the surgeon replaces the entire aesthetic segment, usually with a regional tissue graft, harvested from either the face or the head, or with a tissue graft harvested from elsewhere on the patient&#x27;s body.

==== C. Nasal blood supply – arteries and veins ====
Like the face, the human nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus supplied with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel supply to the nose is two-fold: (i) branches from the internal carotid artery, the branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery, the branch of the posterior ethmoidal artery, which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from the external carotid artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the greater palatine artery, the superior labial artery, and the angular artery.

The external nose is supplied with blood by the facial artery, which becomes the angular artery that courses over the superomedial aspect of the nose. The sellar region (sella turcica, &quot;Turkish chair&quot;) and the dorsal region of the nose are supplied with blood by branches of the internal maxillary artery (infraorbital artery) and the ophthalmic arteries that derive from the internal common carotid artery system.

Internally, the lateral nasal wall is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) and by the anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind). The nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery, and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the greater palatine artery. These three vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation. The nasal veins are biologically significant, because they have no vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the cavernous sinus, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose. Hence, because of such an abundant nasal blood supply, tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise post-operative healing.

==== D. Lymphatic system of the nose ====
The pertinent nasal lymphatic system arises from the superficial mucosa, and drains posteriorly to the retropharyngeal nodes (in back), and anteriorly (in front), either to the upper deep cervical nodes (in the neck), or to the submandibular glands (in the lower jaw), or into both the nodes and the glands of the neck and the jaw.

==== E. Nerves of the nose ====
The sensations registered by the human nose derive from the first two branches of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve. The nerve listings indicate the respective innervation (sensory distribution) of the trigeminal nerve branches within the nose, the face, and the upper jaw (maxilla).

;The indicated nerve serves the named anatomic facial and nasal regions:

===== Ophthalmic division innervation =====

*Lacrimal nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the lateral orbital (eye socket) region, except for the lacrimal gland.
*Frontal nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the forehead and the scalp.
*Supraorbital nerve – conveys sensation to the skin areas of the eyelids, the forehead, and the scalp.
*Supratrochlear nerve – conveys sensation to the medial region of the eyelid skin area, and the medial region of the forehead skin.
*Nasociliary nerve – conveys sensation to the skin area of the nose, and the mucous membrane of the anterior (front) nasal cavity.
* Anterior ethmoid nerve – conveys sensation in the anterior (front) half of the nasal cavity: (a) the internal areas of the ethmoid sinus and the frontal sinus; and (b) the external areas, from the nasal tip to the rhinion: the anterior tip of the terminal end of the nasal-bone suture.
* Posterior ethmoid nerve – serves the superior (upper) half of the nasal cavity, the sphenoids, and the ethmoids.
*Infratrochlear nerve – conveys sensation to the medial region of the eyelids, the palpebral conjunctiva, the nasion (nasolabial junction), and the bony dorsum.

===== The maxillary division innervation =====

*Maxillary nerve – conveys sensation to the upper jaw and the face.
*Infraorbital nerve – conveys sensation to the area from below the eye socket to the external nares (nostrils).
*Zygomatic nerve – through the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic arch, conveys sensation to the cheekbone areas.
* Superior posterior dental nerve – sensation in the teeth and the gums.
* Superior anterior dental nerve – mediates the sneeze reflex.
*Sphenopalatine nerve – divides into the lateral branch and the septal branch, and conveys sensation from the rear and the central regions of the nasal cavity.

The supply of parasympathetic nerves to the face and the upper jaw (maxilla) derives from the greater superficial petrosal (GSP) branch of cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve. The GSP nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve (of the sympathetic nervous system), derived from the carotid plexus, to form the vidian nerve (in the vidian canal) that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion (an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve), wherein only the parasympathetic nerves form synapses, which serve the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nose and of the palate, via the (upper jaw) maxillary division of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve.

==== F. Bony anatomy of the nose ====
In the upper portion of the nose, the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone. Above and to the side (superolaterally), the paired nasal bones connect to the lacrimal bones, and below and to the side (inferolaterally), they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla (upper jaw). Above and to the back (posterosuperiorly), the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The vomer bone lies below and to the back (posteroinferiorly), and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx, (the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). The floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone, the roof of the mouth.

The nasal septum is composed of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.

==== G. The cartilaginous pyramid of the nose ====
The cartilaginous septum (&quot;septum nasi&quot;) extends from the nasal bones in the midline (above) to the bony septum in the midline (posteriorly), then down along the bony floor. The septum is quadrangular; the upper half is flanked by two triangular-to-trapezoidal cartilages: the upper lateral-cartilages, which are fused to the dorsal septum in the midline, and laterally attached, with loose ligaments, to the bony margin of the pyriform (pear-shaped) aperture, while the inferior ends of the upper lateral-cartilages are free (unattached). The internal area (angle), formed by the septum and upper lateral-cartilage, constitutes the internal valve of the nose; the sesamoid cartilages are adjacent to the upper lateral-cartilages in the fibroareolar connective tissue.

Beneath the upper lateral-cartilages lay the lower lateral-cartilages; the paired lower lateral-cartilages swing outwards, from medial attachments, to the caudal septum in the midline (the medial crura) to an intermediate crus (shank) area. Finally, the lower lateral-cartilages flare outwards, above and to the side (superolaterally), as the lateral crura; these cartilages are mobile, unlike the upper lateral cartilages. Furthermore, some persons present anatomical evidence of nasal scrolling—i.e., an outward curving of the lower borders of the upper lateral-cartilages, and an inward curving of the cephalic borders of the alar cartilages.

===External nasal anatomy ===
The form of the nasal subunits—the dorsum, the sidewalls, the lobule, the soft triangles, the alae, and the columella—are configured differently, according to the race and the ethnic group of the patient, thus the nasal physiognomies denominated as: African, platyrrhine (flat, wide nose); Asiatic, subplatyrrhine (low, wide nose); Caucasian, leptorrhine (narrow nose); and Hispanic, paraleptorrhine (narrow-sided nose). The respective external nasal valve of each nose is variably dependent upon the size, shape, and strength of the lower lateral cartilage.

=== Internal nasal anatomy ===
In the midline of the nose, the septum is a composite (osseo-cartilaginous) structure that divides the nose into two similar halves. The lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses, the superior concha, the middle concha, and the inferior concha, form the corresponding passages, the superior meatus, the middle meatus, and the inferior meatus, on the lateral nasal wall. The superior meatus is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus; the middle meatus provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses; and the inferior meatus provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct.

The internal nasal valve comprises the area bounded by the upper lateral-cartilage, the septum, the nasal floor, and the anterior head of the inferior turbinate. In the narrow (leptorrhine) nose, this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway. Generally, this area requires an angle greater than 15 degrees for unobstructed breathing; for the correction of such narrowness, the width of the nasal valve can be increased with spreader grafts and flaring sutures.

==Nasal analysis==

The surgical management of nasal defects and deformities divides the nose into six anatomic subunits: (i) the dorsum, (ii) the sidewalls (paired), (iii) the hemilobules (paired), (iv) the soft triangles (paired), (v) the alae (paired), and (vi) the columella. Surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire anatomic subunit affected by the defect (wound) or deformity, thus, the entire subunit is corrected, especially when the resection (cutting) of the defect encompasses more than 50 percent of the subunit. Aesthetically, the nose—from the nasion (the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction) to the columella-labial junction—ideally occupies one-third of the vertical dimension of the person&#x27;s face; and, from ala to ala, it ideally should occupy one-fifth of the horizontal dimension of the person&#x27;s face.

The nasofrontal angle, intersection of the line from the nasion to the nasal tip with the line from the nasion to the glabella, usually is 115-130 degrees; the nasofrontal angle is more acute in the male face than in the female face. The nasofacial angle, intersection of the line from the nasion to the nasal tip with the line from the nasion to the pogonion, is approximately 30–40 degrees. The nasolabial angle, the slope between the columella and the philtrum, is approximately 90–95 degrees in the male face, and approximately 100–105 degrees in the female face. Therefore, when observing the nose in profile, the normal show of the columella (the height of the visible nasal aperture) is 2 mm; and the dorsum should be rectilinear (straight). When observed from below (worm&#x27;s-eye view), the alar base configures an isosceles triangle, with its apex at the infra-tip lobule, immediately beneath the tip of the nose. The facially proportionate projection of the nasal tip (the distance of the nose&#x27;s tip from the face) is determined with the Goode Method, wherein the projection of the nasal tip should be 55–60 percent of the distance between the nasion (nasofrontal junction) and the tip-defining point. A columellar double break might be present, marking the transition between the intermediate crus of the lower-lateral cartilage and the medial crus.

The Goode Method determines the extension of the nose from the facial surface by comprehending the distance from the alar groove to the tip of the nose, and then relating that measurement (of nasal-tip projection) to the length of the nasal dorsum. The nasal projection measurement is obtained by delineating a right triangle with lines parting from the nasion (nasofrontal juncture) to the alar–facial–groove. Then, a second, perpendicular delineation, that traverses the tip-defining point, establishes the ratio of projection of the nasal tip; hence, the range of 0.55:1 to 0.60:1, is the ideal nasal-tip-to-nasal-length projection.

Systematic approaches to nasal analysis have been described. For example, the 10-7-5 method allows for methodical analysis of the nose. It describes 10 features from the frontal view, 7 features from the lateral view, and 5 features from the basal view.

3D simulations and planning can be used to communicate the patients existing deformities, and plan or propose the desired approach. 3-dimensional cameras allow photographic capture, inspection, analysis, and modification to understand the existing nasal anatomy, and communicate a potential result to the patient.

==Patient characteristics==
To determine the patient&#x27;s suitability for undergoing a rhinoplasty procedure, the surgeon clinically evaluates them with a complete medical history (anamnesis) to determine their physical and psychological health. The prospective patient must explain to the physician–surgeon the functional and aesthetic nasal problems that they have. The surgeon asks about the ailments&#x27; symptoms and their duration, past surgical interventions, allergies, drugs use and drugs abuse (prescription and commercial medications), and a general medical history. Furthermore, additional to physical suitability is psychological suitability—the patient&#x27;s psychological motive for undergoing nose surgery is critical to the surgeon&#x27;s pre-operative evaluation of the patient.

The complete physical examination of the rhinoplasty patient determines if he or she is physically fit to undergo and tolerate the physiologic stresses of nose surgery. The examination comprehends every existing physical problem, and a consultation with an anaesthesiologist, if warranted by the patient&#x27;s medical data. Specific facial and nasal evaluations record the patient&#x27;s skin-type, existing surgical scars, and the symmetry and asymmetry of the aesthetic nasal subunits. The external and internal nasal examination concentrates upon the anatomic thirds of the nose—upper section, middle section, lower section—specifically noting their structures; the measures of the nasal angles (at which the external nose projects from the face); and the physical characteristics of the naso-facial bony and soft tissues. The internal examination evaluates the condition of the nasal septum, the internal and external nasal valves, the turbinates, and the nasal lining, paying special attention to the structure and the form of the nasal dorsum and the tip of the nose.

Furthermore, when warranted, specific tests—the mirror test, vasoconstriction examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are included to the pre-operative evaluation of the prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient&#x27;s cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient&#x27;s inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient affected by alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.

==Surgical rhinoplasty==
There is limited evidence that a single dose of corticosteriods decreases oedema and bleeding first two days post operation but the difference is not maintained after this. Swelling and edema can take at least 1-year to diminish. Certain adjuncts, including fat grafting may help quicken the time to edema and bruising resolution.

===Open rhinoplasty versus closed rhinoplasty===
The plastic surgical correction of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the nose restores functional and aesthetic properties by the surgeon&#x27;s manipulations of the nasal skin, the subcutaneous (underlying) cartilage-and-bone support framework, and the mucous membrane lining. Technically, the plastic surgeon&#x27;s incisional approach classifies the nasal surgery either as an open rhinoplasty or as a closed rhinoplasty procedure. In open rhinoplasty, the surgeon makes a small, irregular incision to the columella, the fleshy, exterior-end of the nasal septum; this columellar incision is additional to the usual set of incisions for a nasal correction. In closed rhinoplasty, the surgeon performs every procedural incision endonasally (exclusively within the nose), and does not cut the columella.


==== Procedural differences ====
Except for the columellar incision, the technical and procedural approaches of open rhinoplasty and of closed rhinoplasty are similar; yet closed rhinoplasty procedure features:
* Reduced dissection (cutting) of the nasal tissues—no columellar incision
* Decreased potential for the excessive reduction (cutting) of the nasal-tip support
* Reduced post-operative edema
* Decreased visible scarring
* Decreased iatrogenic (inadvertent) damage to the nose, by the surgeon
* Increased availability for effecting &quot;in situ&quot; procedural and technical changes
* Palpation that allows the surgeon to &quot;feel&quot; the interior changes effected to the nose
* Shorter operating room time
* Quicker post-surgical recovery and convalescence for the patient

==== The &quot;ethnic nose&quot; ====
The open rhinoplasty approach affords the plastic surgeon advantages of ease in securing grafts (skin, cartilage, bone) and, most importantly, in securing the nasal cartilage properly, and so better to make the appropriate assessment and remedy. This procedural aspect can be especially difficult in revision surgery, and in rhinoplastic alteration of the thick-skinned &quot;ethnic nose&quot; of the person of color. The study, &quot;Ethnic Rhinoplasty: a Universal Preoperative Classification System for the Nasal Tip&quot; (2009), reports that a nasal-tip classification system, based upon skin thickness, has been proposed to aid the surgeon in determining if an open rhinoplasty or a closed rhinoplasty can best correct the defect or deformity affecting the patient&#x27;s nose.

==== Cause ====
Cause, the open and closed approaches to rhinoplastic correction resolve: (i) nasal pathologies (diseases intrinsic and diseases extrinsic to the nose); (ii) an unsatisfactory aesthetic appearance (disproportion); (iii) a failed primary rhinoplasty; (iv) an obstructed airway; and (v) congenital nose defects and deformities.

==== Congenital abnormalities ====

* Cleft lip and palate in combination; cleft lip (&quot;cheiloschisis&quot;) and cleft palate (&quot;palatoschisis&quot;), individually.
* Congenital nasal abnormalities
* Genetically derived ethnic-nose abnormalities

==== Acquired abnormalities ====

* Allergic and vasomotor rhinitis – inflammations of the mucous membrane of the nose caused by an allergen, and caused by circulatory and nervous system disorders.
* Autoimmune system diseases
* Bites – animal and human
* Burns – caused by chemicals, electricity, friction, heat, light, and radiation.
* Connective-tissue diseases
* Inflammatory conditions
* Nasal fractures
* Naso-orbito-ethmoidal fractures – damages to the nose and the eye-sockets; and damage to the bones and the walls of the nasal cavity; it is the ethmoid bone that separates the brain from the nose.
* Neoplasms – malignant and benign tumors
* Septal hematoma – a mass of (usually) clotted blood in the septum
* Toxins – chemical damages caused by inspired substances – e.g. powdered cocaine, aerosol antihistamine medications, et cetera.
* Traumatic deformities caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, and blast trauma.
* Venereal infection – e.g., syphilis

=== Ultrasonic rhinoplasty ===
Recently, ultrasonic rhinoplasty which was introduced by Massimo Robiony in 2004 has become an alternative to traditional rhinoplasty. Ultrasonic rhinoplasty uses piezoelectric instruments to reshape atraumatically nasal bones, also known as rhinosculpture. Ultrasonic rhinoplasty uses piezoelectric instruments (scrapers rasps, saws) that affect only the bones and the stiff cartilages through ultrasonic vibrations, as the instruments used in dental surgery. The use of piezoelectric instruments requires a more extended approach than the isial one, allowing to visualize the whole bony vault, to reshape it with rhinosculpture or to mobilize and stabilize bones after controlled osteotomies.

==Surgical procedure==
A rhinoplastic correction can be performed on a person who is under sedation, under general anaesthesia, or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then reshapes them, sutures the incisions, and applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a bone graft, or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal . The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient&#x27;s body. Homologous (donor) rib cartilage is also sometimes used if the patient&#x27;s own cartilage is unsuitable. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft, it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of autologous graft is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge. The main types of grafts to support and reposition the nasal tip (or the central/medial limb of the tripod) are either columellar strut, or the septal extension graft. Both are useful and effective, but the septal extension graft (SEG) is shown to impart greater control, and less changes over time.

For the benefit of the patient and the physician–surgeon, a photographic history of the entire rhinoplastic procedure is established; beginning at the pre-operative consultation, continuing during the surgical operation procedures, and concluding with the post-operative outcome. To record the &quot;before-and-after&quot; physiognomies of the nose and the face of the patient, the specific visual perspectives required are photographs of the nose viewed from the anteroposterior (front-to-back) perspective; the lateral view (profiles), the worm&#x27;s-eye view (from below), the bird&#x27;s-eye view (overhead), and three-quarter-profile views.

* Photograph A. – Open rhinoplasty: At rhinoplasty&#x27;s end, after the plastic surgeon has sutured (closed) the incisions, the corrected (new) nose will be dressed, taped, and splinted immobile to permit the uninterrupted healing of the surgical incisions. The purple-ink guidelines ensured the surgeon&#x27;s accurate cutting of the defect correction plan.
* Photograph B. – Open rhinoplasty: The new nose is prepared with paper tape in order to receive the metal nasal-splint that will immobilize it to maintain its correct shape as a new nose.

* Photograph C. – Open rhinoplasty: After the preliminary taping of the nose, a custom-made, metal nasal-splint, designed, cut, and formed by the surgeon, is emplaced to immobilize and protect the tender tissues of the new nose during convalescence.
* Photograph D. – Open rhinoplasty: The taping, emplacement of the metal splint, and dressing of the new nose complete the rhinoplasty procedure. The patient then convalesces, and the wound dressing will be removed at 1-week post-procedure.

* Photograph 1. – Open rhinoplasty: The incisions are endonasal (in the nose), and thus are hidden. The skin-incision to the columella aids the plastic surgeon in precisely suturing to hide the scar—except for the columellar incision (red-dot guideline) across the nasal base. The columellar incision allows the surgeon to view the size, shape, and condition of the nasal cartilages and bones to be corrected.
* Photograph 2. – Open rhinoplasty: The nasal interior. The scissors indicate the lower lateral cartilage (blue), which is one of the wing-shaped cartilages that conform the tip of the nose. The jagged red delineation indicates the locale of the columellar incision. Once the skin has been lifted from the bone-and-cartilage framework, the surgeon performs the nasal correction tasks.
* Photograph 3. – Open rhinoplasty: To narrow the tip of a too-wide nose, the surgeon first determines the cause of the excess nasal width. The suture being emplaced will narrow the tip of the nose. The red delineation indicates the edge of the nose-tip cartilage, which is narrowed when the surgeon tightens the folded cartilage apex. The suture (light blue) ends in the needle (white); tweezers (green) hold the nasal cartilage in place for the suturing.
* Photograph 4. – Nasal hump excision: The black delineation indicates the desired nose-reduction outcome: a straight nose. The nasal hump is bone (red) above the scalloped grey line, and cartilage (blue) below the scalloped grey line. The surgeon cuts the cartilage portion of the hump with a scalpel, and chisels the bone portion with an osteotome (bone chisel). After chiselling away the main mass of the nasal hump with an osteotome, the surgeon then sculpts, refines, and smoothens the cut nasal bones with rasps (files).

===Types of rhinoplasty===
In plastic surgical praxis, the term primary rhinoplasty denotes an initial (first-time) reconstructive, functional, or aesthetic corrective procedure. The term secondary rhinoplasty denotes the revision of a failed rhinoplasty, an occurrence in 5–20 per cent of rhinoplasty operations, hence a revision rhinoplasty. The corrections usual to secondary rhinoplasty include the cosmetic reshaping of the nose because of a functional breathing deficit from an over aggressive rhinoplasty, asymmetry, deviated or crooked nose, areas of collapses, hanging columella, pinched tip, scooped nose and more. Although most revision rhinoplasty procedures are &quot;open approach&quot;, such a correction is more technically complicated, usually because the nasal support structures either were deformed or destroyed in the primary rhinoplasty; thus the surgeon must re-create the nasal support with cartilage grafts harvested either from the ear (auricular cartilage graft) or from the rib cage (costal cartilage graft).

A functional rhinoplasty refers to a rhinoplasty performed to alleviate nasal obstruction, whereas a cosmetic rhinoplasty refers to a rhinoplasty performed for aesthetic reasons. Procedures performed as part of a functional rhinoplasty typically include septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction, and spreader graft placement.

Results

Can be good if performed by an experienced practitioner. As in all plastic surgery procedures, there can be some unpredictability, and biologic systems can heal in different ways.

===Nasal reconstruction===
In reconstructive rhinoplasty, the defects and deformities that the plastic surgeon encounters, and must restore to normal function, form, and appearance include broken and displaced nasal bones; disrupted and displaced nasal cartilages; a collapsed bridge of the nose; congenital defect, trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), autoimmune disorder, cancer, intranasal drug-abuse damages, and failed primary rhinoplasty outcomes. Rhinoplasty reduces bony humps, and re-aligns the nasal bones after they are cut (dissected, resected). When cartilage is disrupted, suturing for re-suspension (structural support), or the use of cartilage grafts to camouflage a depression allow the re-establishment of the normal nasal contour of the nose for the patient. When the bridge of the nose is collapsed, rib-cartilage, ear-cartilage, or cranial-bone grafts can be used to restore its anatomic integrity, and thus the aesthetic continuity of the nose. For augmenting the nasal dorsum, autologous cartilage and bone grafts are preferred to (artificial) nose prostheses, because of the reduced incidence of histologic rejection and medical complications.

===Surgical anatomy for nasal reconstruction===
The human nose is a sensory organ that is structurally composed of three types of tissue: (i) an osseo-cartilaginous support framework (nasal skeleton), (ii) a mucous membrane lining, and (iii) an external skin. The anatomic topography of the human nose is a graceful blend of convexities, curves, and depressions, the contours of which show the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton. Hence, these anatomic characteristics permit dividing the nose into nasal subunits: (i) the midline (ii) the nose-tip, (iii) the dorsum, (iv) the soft triangles, (v) the alar lobules, and (vi) the lateral walls. Surgically, the borders of the nasal subunits are ideal locations for the scars, whereby is produced a superior aesthetic outcome, a corrected nose with corresponding skin colors and skin textures.

;Nasal skeleton
Therefore, the successful rhinoplastic outcome depends entirely upon the respective maintenance or restoration of the anatomic integrity of the nasal skeleton, which comprises (a) the nasal bones and the ascending processes of the maxilla in the upper third; (b) the paired upper-lateral cartilages in the middle third; and (c) the lower-lateral, alar cartilages in the lower third. Hence, managing the surgical reconstruction of a damaged, defective, or deformed nose, requires that the plastic surgeon manipulate three anatomic layers:

# the osseo-cartilagenous framework – The upper lateral cartilages that are tightly attached to the (rear) caudal edge of the nasal bones and the nasal septum; said attachment suspends them above the nasal cavity. The paired alar cartilages configure a tripod-shaped union that supports the lower third of the nose. The paired medial crura conform the central-leg of the tripod, which is attached to the anterior nasal spine and septum, in the midline. The lateral crura compose the second-leg and the third-leg of the tripod, and are attached to the (pear-shaped) pyriform aperture, the nasal-cavity opening at the front of the skull. The dome of the nostrils defines the apex of the alar cartilage, which supports the nasal tip, and is responsible for the light reflex of the tip.
# the nasal lining – A thin layer of vascular mucosa that adheres tightly to the deep surface of the bones and the cartilages of the nose. Said dense adherence to the nasal interior limits the mobility of the mucosa, consequently, only the smallest of mucosal defects (&lt; 5 mm) can be sutured primarily.
# the nasal skin – A tight envelope that proceeds inferiorly from the glabella (the smooth prominence between the eyebrows), which then becomes thinner and progressively inelastic (less distensible). The skin of the mid-third of the nose covers the cartilaginous dorsum and the upper lateral cartilages and is relatively elastic, but, at the (far) distal-third of the nose, the skin adheres tightly to the alar cartilages, and is little distensible. The skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid anatomic unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim, and the patency (openness) of the nostrils (anterior nares). To preserve this nasal shape and patency, the replacement of the alar lobule must include a supporting cartilage graft—despite the alar lobule not originally containing cartilage; because of its many sebaceous glands, the nasal skin usually is of a smooth (oiled) texture. Moreover, regarding , when compared to the skin of other facial areas, the skin of the nose generates fine-line scars that usually are inconspicuous, which allows the surgeon to strategically hide the surgical scars.

===Principles of rhinoplastic reconstruction===
;Principles
The technical principles for the surgical reconstruction of a nose derive from the essential operative principles of plastic surgery: that the applied procedure and yield the most satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcome. Hence, the rhinoplastic reconstruction of a new nasal subunit, of virtually normal appearance, can be done in a few procedural stages, using intranasal tissues to correct defects of the mucosa; cartilage battens to brace against tissue contraction and depression (topographic collapse); axial skin flaps designed from three-dimensional (3-D) templates derived from the topographic subunits of the nose; and the refinement of the resultant correction with the subcutaneous sculpting of bone, cartilage, and flesh. Nonetheless, the physician-surgeon and the rhinoplasty patient must abide the fact that the reconstructed nasal subunit is not a nose proper, but a collagen-glued collage—of forehead skin, cheek skin, mucosa, vestibular lining, nasal septum, and fragments of ear cartilage—which is perceived as a nose only because its contour, skin color, and skin texture are true to the original nose.

;Restoration
In nasal reconstruction, the plastic surgeon&#x27;s ultimate goal is recreating the shadows, the contours, the skin color, and the skin texture that define the patient&#x27;s &quot;normal nose&quot;, as perceived at conversational distance (c. 1.0 metre). Yet, such an aesthetic outcome suggests the application of a more complex surgical approach, which requires that the surgeon balance the patient&#x27;s required rhinoplasty, with the patient&#x27;s aesthetic ideal (body image). In the context of surgically reconstructing the patient&#x27;s physiognomy, the &quot;normal nose&quot; is the three-dimensional (3-D) template for replacing the missing of a nose (aesthetic nasal subunit, aesthetic nasal segment), which the plastic surgeon re-creates using firm, malleable, modelling materials—such as bone, cartilage, and flaps of skin and of tissue. In repairing a partial nasal defect (wound), such as that of the alar lobule (the dome above the nostrils), the surgeon uses the undamaged, opposite (contralateral) side of the nose as the 3-D model to fabricate the anatomic template for recreating the deformed nasal subunit, by molding the malleable template material directly upon the normal, undamaged nasal anatomy. To effect a total nasal reconstruction, the template might derive from quotidian observations of the &quot;normal nose&quot; and from photographs of the patient before they sustained the nasal damage.

The surgeon replaces missing parts with tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, cartilage with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin texture of the damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts, because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal skin, better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting, nasal skin is the best source of nasal skin. Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal skin flap is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.

The most effective nasal reconstruction for repairing a defect (wound) of the nasal skin, is to re-create the entire nasal subunit; thus, the wound is enlarged to comprehend the entire nasal subunit. Technically, this surgical principle permits laying the scars in the topographic transition between and among adjacent aesthetic subunits, which avoids juxtaposing two different types of skin in the same aesthetic subunit, where the differences of color and texture might prove too noticeable, even when reconstructing a nose with skin flaps. Nonetheless, in the final stage of nasal reconstruction—replicating the &quot;normal nose&quot; anatomy by subcutaneous sculpting, the surgeon does have technical allowance to revise the scars, and render them (more) inconspicuous.

===Reasons for reconstruction===

Reconstruction rhinoplasty is indicated for the correction of defects and deformities caused by:
# Skin cancer. The most common cause (etiology) for a nasal reconstruction is skin cancer, especially the lesions to the nose of melanoma and basal-cell carcinoma. This oncologic epidemiology occurs more readily among the aged and people who reside in very sunny geographic areas; although every type of skin is susceptible to skin cancer, white-skin is most epidemiologically prone to developing skin cancer. Furthermore, regarding plastic surgical scars, the age of the patient is a notable factor in the timely, post-surgical healing of a skin cancer defect (lesion); in terms of , the very elastic skin of young people has a greater regenerative propensity for producing scars that are thicker (stronger) and more noticeable. Therefore, in young patients, the strategic placement (hiding) of the rhinoplastic scars is a greater aesthetic consideration than in elder patients; whose less elastic skin produces scars that are narrower and less noticeable.
# Traumatic nasal defect. Although trauma is a less common rhinoplastic occurrence, a nasal defect or deformity caused by blunt trauma (impact), penetrating trauma (piercing), and blast trauma (blunt and penetrating) requires a surgical reconstruction that abides the conservational principles of plastic surgery, as in the corrections of cancerous lesions.
# Congenital deformities. The unique plastic properties of the bone, cartilage, and skin of patients&#x27; affected by congenital defects, and associated anomalies, are considered separately.

===Surgical techniques===
The effectiveness of a rhinoplastic reconstruction of the external nose derives from the contents of the surgeon&#x27;s armamentarium of skin-flap techniques applicable to correcting defects of the nasal skin and of the mucosal lining; some management techniques are the bilobed flap, the nasolabial flap, the paramedian forehead flap, and the septal mucosal flap.

;I. Bilobed flap
The design of the bilobed flap derives from the creation of two adjacent random transposition flaps (lobes). In its original design, the leading flap is applied to cover the defect, and the second flap, is emplaced where the skin flexes more, and fills the donor-site wound (from where the first flap was harvested), which then is closed primarily, with sutures. The first flap is oriented geometrically, at 90 degrees from the long axis of the wound (defect), and the second flap is oriented 180 degrees from the axis of the wound. Although effective, the bilobed flap technique did create troublesome &quot;dog ears&quot; of excess flesh that required trimming and it also produced a broad skin-donor area that was difficult to confine to the nose. In 1989, J. A. Zitelli modified the bilobed flap technique by: (a) orienting the leading flap at 45 degrees from the long axis of the wound; and (b) orienting the second flap at 90 degrees from the axis of the wound. Said orientations and emplacements eliminated the excess-flesh &quot;dog ears&quot;, and thus required a smaller area of donor skin; resultantly, the broad-based, bilobed flap is less prone to the &quot;trap door&quot; and the &quot;pin cushion&quot; deformities common to skin-flap transposition procedure.
;Surgical technique – the bilobed flap
The design of the bilobed flap co-ordinates its lobes with the long axis of the nasal defect (wound); each lobe of the flap is emplaced at a 45-degree angle to the axis. The two lobes of the bilobed flap rotate along an arc, of which all points are equidistant from the apex of the nasal defect.
* Based upon the available area of nasal skin, the surgeon selects the locale for the bilobed flap, and orients the pedicle. If the defect is in the lateral aspect of the nose, the pedicle is based medially. If the defect is at the nasal tip, or at the nasal dorsum, the pedicle is based laterally. An ideal location for the second flap is along the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral nasal wall.
* The nasal wound is cut and shaped into a teardrop form, by the cutting out of a Burrow&#x27;s triangle of flesh on the side of pedicle base. Cutting out the Burrow&#x27;s triangle (skin and subcutaneous fat) permits the moving the pedicle flap, to emplace it without buckling the tissues adjacent to the graft.
* Using a 20 mm calliper as a protractor—one tip at the apex of the wound—the surgeon delineates two semi-circles, an inner semi-circle, and an outer semi-circle. The outer semi-circle defines the necessary length of the two lobes of the skin flap. The inner semi-circle bisects the center of the original wound, and continues across the donor skin, establishing limit measure of the pedicle common to the two lobes of the flap. The surgeon then draws two lines from the apex of the wound; the first line drawn is at an angle of 45 degrees from the long axis of the wound, and the second line drawn is at a 90-degree angle from the axis of the wound. The two lines delineate the central axes of the two lobes of the bilobed flap.
* The delineation of each of the two lobes of the flap begins and ends at the inner semi-circle, and extends to the outer semi-circle, to the point where it intersects its central axis. The width of the first lobe is approximately 2 mm narrower than the width of the wound; the width of the second lobe is approximately 2 mm narrower than the width of the first lobe.
* After the cutting from the tissue donor-site, the bilobed flap is elevated to a plane between the subcutaneous fat and the nasalis muscle. The wound is deepened, down to the nasal skeleton, to accommodate the tissue thickness of the bilobed flap. Technically, cutting the wound, enlarging it, is preferable, and safer, than trimming (thinning) the flap to fit the wound.
* Undermining the donor site for the second lobe allows closing it primarily; it also eliminates excess-skin &quot;dog-ears&quot; at the donor site. Moreover, if the donor site cannot be closed with sutures, or if the skin blanches (whitens) when sutured, usually because of excessively tight sutures, the tension is decreased by reducing the size (length, width, depth) of the wound with deep sutures that will allow it to heal more readily.

;II. Nasolabial flap
In the 19th century, the surgical techniques of J.F. Dieffenbach (1792–1847) popularized the nasolabial flap for nasal reconstruction, for which it remains a foundational nose surgery procedure. The nasolabial flap can be either superiorly based or inferiorly based; of which the superiorly based flap is the more practical rhinoplastic application, because it has a more versatile arc of rotation, and the donor-site scar is inconspicuous. Depending upon how the defect lay upon the nose, the flap pedicle-base can be incorporated either solely to the nasal reconstruction, or it can be divided into a second stage procedure. The blood supply for the flap pedicle are the transverse branches of the contralateral angular artery (the facial artery terminus parallel to the nose), and by a confluence of blood vessels from the angular artery and from the supraorbital artery in the medial canthus, (the angles formed by the meeting of the upper and lower eyelids). Therefore, the incisions for harvesting the nasolabial flap do not continue superiorly beyond the medial canthal tendon. The nasolabial flap is a random flap that is emplaced with the proximal (near) portion resting upon the lateral wall of the nose, and the distal (far) portion resting upon the cheek, which contains the main angular artery, and so is perfused with retrograde arterial flow.

;Surgical technique – the nasolabial flap
The pedicle of the nasolabial flap rests upon the lateral nasal wall, and is transposed a maximum of 60 degrees, in order to avoid the &quot;bridge effect&quot; of a flap emplaced across the nasofacial angle.
* The surgeon designs the nasolabial flap and sets its central axis at a 45-degree angle from the (long) axis of the nasal dorsum. The shape of the skin flap is cut from the wound template fabricated by the surgeon.
* An incision is made to the flap (without an anaesthetic injection of epinephrine), which then is elevated and oriented, in an inferior-to-superior direction, between the subcutaneous fat and the muscle fascia.
* The cutting continues until the skin flap can be freely transposed upon the nasal defect. A Burrow&#x27;s triangle is excised from the skin between the medial border of the flap and the nasal dorsum; the triangle can be cut either before or after the elevation of the nasolabial.
* The flap then is bent back (reflected), and can be thinned (cut) under loupe magnification; however, a nasolabial flap cannot be thinned as easily as an axial skin-flap.
* After the nasolabial flap has been emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall that is less than 15 mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15 mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes excessive stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) the skin of the cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1 mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).

;III. Paramedian forehead flap
The paramedian forehead flap is the premier autologous skin graft for the reconstruction of a nose, by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial skin flap based upon the supraorbital artery (an ophthalmic artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an ophthalmic artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus in order to enhance the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the skin flap is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.

The paramedian forehead flap has two disadvantages, one operational and one aesthetic: Operationally, the reconstruction of a nose with a paramedian forehead flap is a two-stage surgical procedure, which might a problem for the patient whose health (surgical suitability) includes significant, secondary medical risks. Nonetheless, the second stage of the nasal reconstruction can be performed with the patient under local anaesthesia. Aesthetically, although the flap donor-site scar heals well, it is noticeable, and thus difficult to conceal, especially in men.
;Surgical technique – the paramedian forehead flap

The surgeon designs the paramedian forehead flap from a custom-fabricated three-dimensional metal foil template derived from the measures of the nasal defect to be corrected. Using an ultrasonic scanner, the flap-pedicle is centre-aligned upon the Doppler signal of the supraorbital artery. Afterwards, the distal one-half of the flap is dissected and thinned to the subdermal plexus.
* The surgeon fabricates a metal foil template derived from the dimensions of the nasal wound.
* Applying a Doppler ultrasonic scanner, the surgeon identifies the axial pedicle of the tissue-flap (composed of the supraorbital artery and the supratrochlear artery), usually at the base, next to the medial brow; the point usually is between the midline and the supraorbital notch.
* Tracing the Doppler pulse of the blood flow of the supraorbital artery as far as possible, its delineation is continued as a vertical line, until it intersects with the hairline of the patient. The line extended from the pulse of the blood flow is the central axis of the forehead flap.
* The length of the flap is determined by placing an un-folded, un-stretched 4 × 4-inch gauze upon the wound, and with it measuring from the pedicle base to the distal (farthest) point of the wound. This measure is the length of the central axis of the skin flap.
* The template is rotated 180 degrees and placed over the distal (far) portion of the axis of the skin flap; the surgeon outlines it with a surgical marker. The outline markings are continued proximally and parallel to the central axis, maintaining a 2-cm width for the proximal flap.
* Without applying an injection of anaesthetic epinephrine, the flap is incised (cut), and the distal one-half is elevated between the frontalis muscle and the subcutaneous fat.
* At approximately the mid-portion of the forehead, the surgeon deepens the plane of the dissection down to the submuscular plane. The dissection continues toward the brow and the glabella (the smooth prominence between the eyebrows) until the skin flap is sufficiently mobile to allow its relaxed transposition upon the nose.
* Under loupe magnification, the distal portion of the forehead flap is de-fatted, down to the subdermal plexus. Yet, the fat-removal should be conservative, especially if the patient is either a tobacco smoker or a diabetic, or both, because such health factors negatively affect blood circulation and tissue perfusion, and thus the timely and correct healing of the surgical scars to the nose.
* The flap is allowed to perfuse, while the donor site is sutured closed by means of the wide undermining deep to the frontalis muscle. At that time, diluted epinephrine can be injected to the forehead skin, but not to the near the pedicle of the forehead flap. Moreover, if the distal wound is wider than 25 mm, it usually is not closed by primary intention, with sutures, but is allowed to heal by secondary intention, by re-epithelialisation.
* The forehead flap is attached to the nasal wound with subcutaneous sutures and skin sutures. If the excess tension of a suture compromises the color of the skin flap, the suture can be loosened, with a skin hook, and observed for 10–15 minutes; if the skin color remains compromised (white), the suture is removed.
* Upon the complete attachment of the paramedian forehead flap to the nose, the surgical wounds are dressed only with antibiotic ointment.

;IV. Septal mucosal flap
The septal mucosal tissue flap is the indicated technique for correcting defects of the distal half of the nose, and for correcting almost every type of large defect of the mucosal lining of the nose. The septal mucosal tissue flap, which is an anteriorly based pedicle-graft supplied with blood by the septal branch of the superior labial artery. To perform such a nasal correction, the entire septal mucoperichondrium can be harvested.

;Surgical technique – the septal mucosal flap
The surgeon cuts the anteriorly based septal mucosal tissue-flap as widely as possible, and then releases it with a low, posterior back-cut; but only as required to allow the rotation of the tissue-flap into the nasal wound.

* The surgeon measures the dimensions (length, width, depth) of the nasal wound, and then delineates them upon the nasal septum, and, if possible, incorporates an additional margin of 3–5 mm of width to the wound measurements; furthermore, the base of the mucosal tissue flap should be at least 1.5-cm wide.
* The surgeon then makes two parallel incisions along the floor and the roof of the nasal septum; the incisions converge anteriorly, towards the front of the nasal spine.
* Using an elevator, the flap is dissected in a sub-mucoperichondrial plane. The (far) distal edge of the flap is cut with a right-angle Beaver blade, and then is transposed into the wound. The exposed cartilages will reepithelialise (regenerate the epithelium), provided the opposite (contralateral) side of the septal mucosa is undisturbed.

A technical variant of the septal mucosal flap technique is the trap-door flap, which is used to reconstruct one side of the upper half of the nasal lining. It is emplaced in the contralateral nasal cavity, as a superiorly based septal mucosal flap of rectangular shape, like that of a &quot;trap-door&quot;. This septomucosal flap variant is a random flap with its pedicle based at the junction of the septum and the lateral nasal skeleton. The surgeon elevates the flap of septal mucosa to the roof of the nasal septum, and then traverses it into the contralateral (opposite) nasal cavity through a slit made by removing a small, narrow portion of the dorsal roof of the septum. Afterwards, the septomucosal flap is stretched across the wound in the mucosal lining of the lateral nose.

===Surgical management===
The following rhinoplastic techniques are applied to the surgical management of: (i) partial-thickness defects; (ii) full-thickness defects; (iii) reconstruction; and (iv) total nasal reconstruction.

;I. Partial-thickness defects
A partial-thickness defect is a wound with adequate soft-tissue coverage of the underlying nasal skeleton, yet is too large for primary intention closure, with sutures. Based upon the locale of the wound, the surgeon has two options for correcting such a wound: (i) healing the wound by secondary intention (re-epithelialisation); and (ii) healing the wound with a full-thickness skin graft. Moreover, because it avoids the patched appearance of a skin-graft surgical correction, healing by secondary intention can successfully repair nasal wounds up to 10 mm in diameter; and, if the resultant scar proves aesthetically unacceptable, it can be revised later, after the wound has healed.

In the event, larger nasal wounds (defects) do successfully heal by secondary intention, but do present two disadvantages. First, the resultant scar often is a wide patch of tissue that is aesthetically inferior to the scars produced with other nasal-defect correction techniques; however, the skin of the medial canthus is an exception to such scarring. The second disadvantage to healing by secondary intention is that the contracture of the wound might distort the normal nasal anatomy, which can lead to a pronounced deformity of the alar rim area. For this reason, healing by secondary intention generally is not recommended for defects of the distal third of the nose; nonetheless, the exception is a small wound directly upon the nasal tip.

Full-thickness skin grafts are the effective wound-management technique for defects with a well-vascularized, soft-tissue bed covering the nasal skeleton. The patient&#x27;s ear is the preferred skin-graft donor site from which to harvests grafts of pre-auricular skin and grafts of post-auricular skin, usually with an additional, small amount of adipose tissue to fill the wound cavity. Yet, nasal correction with a skin graft harvested from the patient&#x27;s neck is not recommended, because that skin is low-density pilosebaceous tissue with very few follicles and sebaceous glands, thus is unlike the oily skin of the nose.

The technical advantages of nasal-defect correction with a skin graft are a brief surgery time, a simple rhinoplastic technique, and a low incidence of tissue morbidity. The most effective corrections are with a shallow wound with sufficient, supporting soft-tissue that will prevent the occurrence of a conspicuous depression. Nonetheless, two disadvantages of skin-graft correction are mismatched skin color and skin texture, which might result in a correction with a patch-work appearance; a third disadvantage is the natural histologic tendency for such skin grafts to contract, which might distort the shape of the corrected nose.

;II. Full-thickness defects
Full-thickness nasal defects are in three types: (i) wounds to the skin and to the soft tissues, featuring either exposed bone or exposed cartilage, or both; (ii) wounds extending through the nasal skeleton; and (iii) wounds traversing all three nasal layers: skin, muscle, and the osseo-cartilaginous framework. Based upon the dimensions (length, width, depth) and topographic locale of the wound and the number of missing nasal-tissue layers, the surgeon determines the rhinoplastic technique for correcting a full-thickness defect; each of the aesthetic nasal subunits is considered separately and in combination.

;(a) Medial canthus
The skin between the nasal dorsum and the medial canthal tendon is uniquely suited to healing by secondary intention; the outcomes often are superior to what is achieved with either skin grafts or skin-flaps and tissue-flaps. Because the medial canthal tendon is affixed to the facial bone, it readily resists the forces of wound contracture; moreover, the animation (movement) of the medial brow also lends resistance to the forces of wound contracture. Furthermore, the medial canthal region is aesthetically hidden by the shadows of the nasal dorsum and of the supraorbital rim, thereby obscuring any differences in the quality of the color and of the texture of the replacement skin (epithelium).

Healing by secondary intention (re-epithelialisation) occurs even when the wound extends to the nasal bone. Although the rate of healing depends upon the patient&#x27;s wound-healing capacity, nasal wounds measuring up to 10 mm in diameter usually heal in at 4-weeks post-operative. Nonetheless, one potential, but rare, complication of this nasal correction approach is the formation of a medial canthal web, which can be corrected with two opposing Z-plasties, technique which relieves the disfiguring tensions exerted by the scar tissue&#x27;s contracture, its shape, and location on the nose.


;(b) Nasal dorsum and lateral nasal wall defect
The size of the nasal defect (wound) occurred, in either the dorsum or the lateral wall, or both, determines the reconstructive skin-flap technique applicable to the corresponding aesthetic nasal subunits.

* A wound of less than 10 mm in diameter can be managed either by primary intention healing (suturing) or by secondary intention healing (re-epithelialisation).
* A wound measuring 10–15 mm in diameter can be reconstructed with a single-stage modified bilobed flap, because it best matches the skin color and the skin texture of the wounded aesthetic subunit. Although not every scar can be hidden at the margins of the aesthetic nasal subunits concerned, the superior scarring ability of those nasal skin areas minimizes such an histologic disadvantage. In a patient whose basal-cell carcinoma was excised with Mohs surgery, the scar of the nasal reconstruction (an 11 mm full-thickness, laterally based, bilobed-flap applied down to the bone and the cartilage), was hidden by aligning the axis of the second lobe to and emplacing the skin graft at the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose.
* A wound greater than 15 mm in diameter can be corrected with a paramedian forehead flap, which will reconstruct either the entire nasal dorsum or the lateral wall of the nose, as required. The surgical management of such wounds (&lt; 15 mm dia.) usually requires enlarging the wound as necessary, in order for the skin graft to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit being corrected. Moreover, if the wound comprehends the dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose, then a cheek-advancement skin flap is the applicable correction for replacing the lateral nasal skin up to its junction with the dorsum; afterwards, a paramedian forehead flap is applied to resurface the nasal dorsum.
* A wound in the lateral nasal wall that is greater than 15 mm in diameter can also be corrected with a superiorly based, nasolabial-flap, which is especially suited for correcting distal defects that lay among the convexities of the nasal tip and the alar lobule. The nasolabial flap can correct defects that comprehend the distal two-thirds of the nose, if there is a supply of skin sufficient for constructing the base of the flap pedicle; and the donor sites cannot be closed primarily. Yet, bulkiness is the principal disadvantage of the nasolabial flap—except in elderly patients with atrophic cheek skin; nonetheless, it is technically effective for patients unsuitable for a two-stage rhinoplasty with a paramedian forehead flap.
* Nasal defects involving either the bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage. Small defects of the nasal dorsum can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear. The correction of large-area defects of the nasal dorsum requires the stable support of a bone graft affixed either with a lag screw or with a low-profile plate. A costal graft (from the rib cage) is ideal for such a repair, because it can be harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip; other potential donor sites for nasal dorsum reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull, the iliac crest, and the inner table of the ilium proper.
* To correct a defect of the nasal lining of the upper two-thirds of the nose, the wound dimensions (length, width, depth) determine the technique. A nasal-lining defect of less than 5 mm in diameter can be closed primarily, with sutures. A nasal-lining defect 5–15 mm in diameter can be closed with a random transposition flap harvested from a nasal area that remains protected, either by the nasal bones or by the upper lateral cartilages; and the flap donor-site can be healed by secondary intention, re-epithelialisation. For a mucosa defect greater than 15 mm in diameter, the indicated correction is a superiorly based &quot;trap door&quot; septal mucosal flap, grafted to the roof of the nasal septum.

;(c) Nasal tip defect
The width of the human nasal-tip ranges 20–30 mm; the average width of the nasal tip, measured between the two alar lobules, is approximately 25 mm.

* A nasal skin defect of less than 15 mm in diameter can be managed with a bilobed flap; the surgeon trims the edges of the wound (defect) to match its dimensions (length, width, depth) to the natural curve at the border of the nasal tip. If the wound is eccentric, the skin-flap is positioned so that the lateral base of the graft occupies the largest portion of the wound&#x27;s surface.
* If the nasal-tip wound is greater than 15 mm in diameter, the surgeon enlarges it to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit affected by the defect, and the reconstruction of the nasal subunit done with a forehead flap. If the nasal-tip defect also involves the nasal dorsum, a forehead flap is indicated for reconstructing the entire nasal-tip and dorsum.
* If an alar cartilage is missing, either partially or entirely, it is reconstructed with cartilage grafts. The defect of an alar dome, which retains adequate anatomic support-tripod configuration, can be corrected with an onlay graft harvested either from the nasal septum or from the conchal cartilage of an ear. The surgeon forms the cartilage graft into the shape of a shield—its widest margins become the replacement alar domes. Typically, the shield cartilage graft is stacked in two layers, in order to transmit the desired light reflex characteristic of the nasal tip.
* Defects of the lateral crura can be corrected with a flat strut of formed cartilage, but, if the support of the medial crura is absent, then a columella strut must be inserted, and attached at the level of the anterior nasal spine. If a strut of nasal-septum cartilage proves too weak, then a rib cartilage strut can be applied to provide the adequate nasal support; afterwards, the strut is covered with onlay grafts.
* Absent alar cartilages can be replaced using all of the conchal cartilage from both ears; two strips, each 10 mm wide, are harvested from the antihelical fold, and then are applied as replacement alar wings. The surgeon attaches them to the anterior nasal spine, and to each side of the (pear-shaped) pyriform aperture; the remainder of the harvested conchal cartilage is applied as onlay grafts to augment the nasal tip.
* A nasal-tip lining defect is unusual, because of its midline location; yet, the reconstruction is with an anteriorly based septal mucosal flap that is rotated into place to provide adequate coverage and correction of the nasal lining defect.
* Vertical lobule division (VLD) is a common technique for nasal tip refinement, which involves the medial crural angle and the lateral crural angle.

;(d) Alar lobule defect
The appropriate surgical management of an alar lobule defect depends upon the dimensions (length, width, depth) of the wound. Anatomically, the nasal skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim, and provides unobstructed airflow through the nostrils, the &quot;anterior nares&quot;.

* When most of the alar lobule tissue is missing, the nose collapses; the correction is with an ear concha cartilage-graft harvested from the antihelix, a donor site where the cartilage is most rigidly curved, thus is ideal for replacing an alar lobule.
* Nasal skin defects can be corrected with a medially based bilobed flap, which is emplaced to provide adequate skin coverage for wounds limited to the alar lobule. If the entire lobule is missing, it might be necessary to leave the second-lobe donor-site wound partially open; it will close at 2–4 weeks post-operative; afterwards, the scar can be revised. Nonetheless, the alternative surgical correction is a two-stage, superiorly based, nasolabial flap.
* If the alar lobule defect also comprehends the lateral wall of the nose, the defect can be closed either with a superiorly based nasolabial-flap or with a forehead flap. If the cheek skin is thin and atrophic, a nasolabial flap is the recommended reconstruction; otherwise, a forehead flap is recommended, because the thickness of forehead skin is a superior match for nasal skin and tissue. Mucosal lining defects of the alar lobule can be resurfaced with a bipedicled mucosal advancement-flap harvested from inside the lateral wall of the nose. Likewise, larger defects of the mucosa do require correction with an anteriorly based septal mucosal flap.

;III. and total nasal reconstruction
The reconstruction rhinoplasty of an extensive defect or of a total nasal defect is an extension of the plastic surgical principles applied to resolving the loss of a regional aesthetic subunit. The skin layers are replaced with a paramedian forehead flap, but, if forehead skin is unavailable, the alternative corrections include the Washio retroauricular-temporal flap and the Tagliacozzi flap. The nasal skeleton is replaced with a rib-graft nasal dorsum and lateral nasal wall; septal cartilage grafts and conchal cartilage grafts are applied to correct defects of the nasal tip and of the alar lobules.

The nasal lining of the distal two-thirds of the nose can be covered with anteriorly based septal mucosal flaps; however, if bilateral septal-flaps are used, the septal cartilage does become devascularized, possibly from iatrogenic septal perforation. Furthermore, if the nasal defect is beyond the wound-correction scope of a septal mucosal flap, the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranial-flap (harvested from the frontal bone) or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia (harvested from the head), either of which can be lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction.

===Corrections of defect and deformity===
* Cancer – The excision of cancerous nasal skin can cause the loss of skin and internal support cartilage; such resections (surgical removal) usually are via the Mohs&#x27; chemosurgical technique. After removing the cancerous tissues, the reconstructive rhinoplasty will provide skin coverage using either skin grafts or pedicle flaps, (see Nasal Reconstruction, Paramedian Forehead Flap). If the resection of the cancerous skin leads to losing the nose tip, cartilage grafts can be used for support, and to prevent long-term distortion consequent to the force of the contracture of scar tissue.

* Congenital deformity – The correction of vascular malformations and cleft lip and palate abnormalities. In vascular malformations, the progression of the disease distorts the skin and the underlying structure of the nose. Cleft lip and cleft palate defects usually distort the size, position, and orientation of the nasal-tip cartilages. Reconstruction of vascular malformations can involve laser treatment of the skin, and surgical excision of the deformed tissues. When the underlying cartilage support structure is disturbed, cartilage grafts and suturing of the native nasal cartilages can help improve nasal aesthetics by re-orienting the nasal tip cartilages; and cartilage-graft refinements to the nose tip are performed as required.
* Obstructed airways – The restoration of normal breathing by correcting nasal obstruction caused by a cosmetic rhinoplasty wherein nasal cartilages were over-aggressively trimmed, and the nose appears pinched, which compromises nasal potency (airflow), especially when the patient attempts deep inspiration. These grafting techniques restore normal breathing by increasing the size of the nose tip with baton grafts (internal cartilage), and spreader grafts to widen the nasal middle vault. Furthermore, to improve breathing a septoplasty can be performed concurrent to the reconstructive surgery; likewise, if there is turbinate hypertrophy, an inferior turbinectomy can be performed.
* Perforated septum – The reconstruction of a saddle nose caused by a (collapsed) perforated septum, or by autoimmune problems such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), relapsing polychondritis, by intranasal drug use, and by excessive nasal aerosol use. The saddle nose deformity resulting from lost dorsum support is reconstructed using autologous bone grafts and rib cartilage grafts.
* Rhinophyma – The correction of late-stage Rosacea, wherein the nasal skin is infected with acne rosacea that reddens, thickens, and enlarges the nose tip; an exemplar case is the American actor W.C. Fields. Although antibiotic acne treatments (e.g. Acutane) can halt the progression of Rosacea, the thickened skin and the fleshy obscuring of the nasal tip can only be corrected with rhinoplasty. Laser excision of abnormally thickened skin is the best rhinoplastic treatment for Rhinophyma; the CO2 laser and the infrared are the most effective treatments.

* Wide nose – To narrow a too-wide nose, the plastic surgeon cuts, contours, and rearranges the craniofacial bones to achieve the desired functional and aesthetic outcome of a narrower, straighter nose. To leave no visible, surgical scars upon the new nose, the surgeon effects the osteotome (bone chisel) incisions to the nasal bones beneath the facial skin.

Illustration 1: The surgeon cuts the excessively wide bones of the upper nasal dorsum (violet) with an osteotome (bone chisel), then detaches, corrects, and relocates them inwards, to a position, between the ocular orbits (red), that narrows the width of the nasal dorsum.

Illustration 2: The surgeon chisels two cuts (incisions) to the nasal bones, each incision begins at the nasal cavity. The first incision begins at the yellow dot and extends upwards, along the green arrow, until meeting the zig-zag line (red). The second incision begins at the blue dot and extends upwards, along the black arrow, until meeting the zig-zag line (red). Once cut and loosened from the face, the nasal bone pieces are corrected, then pushed inwards and re-set, thus narrowing the nose.

===Post–surgical recovery===
;Convalescence
The rhinoplasty patient returns home after surgery, to rest, and allow the nasal cartilage and bone tissues to heal the effects of having been forcefully cut. Assisted with prescribed medications—antibiotics, analgesics, steroids—to alleviate pain and aid wound healing, the patient convalesces for about 1-week, and can go outdoors. Post-operatively, external sutures are removed at 4–5 days; the external cast is removed at 1-week; the stents are removed within 4–14 days; and the &quot;panda eyes&quot; periorbital bruising heal at 2-weeks. If an alar base reduction is performed conjunctively within the Rhinoplasty, these sutures need to be removed within 7–10 days post operatively. Throughout the first year post-operative, in the course of the rhinoplastic wounds healing, the tissues will shift moderately as they settle into being a new nose. Furthermore, as rhinoplasty climbs the ladder of surgical procedures performed to achieve an aspired appearance, especially amongst women, the relationship between body image and mental state must be examined in order to destigmatize motives behind the surgical intervention.

===Risks===
Rhinoplasty is safe, yet complications can arise; post-operative bleeding is uncommon, but usually resolves without treatment. Infection is rare, but, when it does occur, it might progress to become an abscess requiring the surgical drainage of the pus, whilst the patient is under general anaesthesia. Adhesions, scars that obstruct the airways, can form a bridge across the nasal cavity, from the septum to the turbinates, and lead to difficulty breathing and may require surgical removal. If too much of the osseo-cartilaginous framework is removed, the consequent weakening can cause the external nasal skin to become shapeless, resulting in a &quot;polly beak&quot; deformity, resembling the beak of a parrot. Likewise, if the septum is unsupported, the bridge of the nose can sink, resulting in a &quot;saddle nose&quot; deformity. The tip of the nose can be over-rotated, causing the nostrils to be too visible, resulting in a porcine nose. If the cartilages of the nose tip are over-resected, it can cause a pinched-tip nose. If the columella is incorrectly cut, variable-degree numbness might result, which requires a months-long resolution. Other deformities that may result from a rhinoplasty include Rocker deformity, inverted V deformity, and open room deformity. Furthermore, in the course of the rhinoplasty, the surgeon might accidentally perforate the septum (septal perforation), which later can cause chronic nose bleeding, crusting of nasal fluids, difficult breathing, and whistling breathing. A turbinectomy may result in empty nose syndrome.

==Non-surgical rhinoplasty==

Non-surgical rhinoplasty is a medical procedure in which injectable fillers, such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, are used to alter and shape a person&#x27;s nose without invasive surgery. The procedure fills in depressed areas on the nose, lifting the angle of the tip or smoothing the appearance of bumps on the bridge. The procedure does not alter nose size, though it can be used to correct some functional birth defects.

Originally developed at the turn of the twenty-first century, early attempts used biologically harmful soft-tissue fillers such as paraffin wax and silicone. After 2000, physicians use minimally invasive techniques using modern fillers.

<doc id="280993" wikidata="Q159817" url="?curid=280993" title="Carlos, Prince of Asturias">
<text>Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias (8 July 154524 July 1568), was the eldest son and heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain. His mother was Maria Manuela of Portugal, daughter of John III of Portugal. Carlos was known to be mentally unstable and was imprisoned by his father in early 1568, dying after half a year of solitary confinement. His imprisonment and death were utilized in Spain&#x27;s Black Legend. His life inspired the play &quot;Don Carlos&quot; by Friedrich Schiller and the opera &quot;Don Carlos&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi.

==Life==
Carlos was born in Valladolid, Spain on 8 July 1545 to double first cousins Philip of Spain and María Manuela of Portugal. His paternal grandfather, Emperor Charles V, was the reigning king of Spain. Carlos&#x27;s mother Maria died four days after the birth of her son from a hemorrhage she had following the birth.

Carlos was born with unequal leg length and lordosis, resulting in his shoulders and stance being asymmetrical. His physical abnormalities and behavioral issues are often attributed to inbreeding as he was a member of the House of Habsburg and the House of Aviz. Carlos had only four great-grandparents instead of the typical eight, and his parents had a coefficient of relationship of 25%, which is the same as if they had been half siblings. He also had only six great-great-grandparents, instead of the maximum 16; his maternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings, his maternal grandfather and his paternal grandmother were also siblings, and his two great-grandmothers were sisters.

===Early years===
Following the death of his mother, Carlos was raised by his paternal aunts, Maria and Joanna, until their marriages in 1548 and 1552. His childhood was &quot;emotionally deprived&quot;: Philip II spent long periods abroad and, after Joanna&#x27;s departure, Carlos endured a marked lack of affection. According to the courtier Gamiz, Carlos was spoiled and prone to tantrums. At some point, Philip appointed Honorato Juan as the prince&#x27;s tutor, and later García Álvarez de Toledo y Osorio.

Carlos began exhibiting violent behavior at a young age, often directing his aggression towards servants and animals. He reportedly once tried to force a shoemaker to eat shoes that he found unsatisfactory. His conduct and character gained notoriety at court, drawing the attention of foreign ambassadors. The Venetian ambassador, Girolamo Soranzo, thought that Carlos was &quot;ugly and repulsive&quot;. Another Venetian, Paolo Tiepolo, wrote: &quot;He [Prince Carlos] wished neither to study nor to take physical exercise, but only to harm others.&quot; It is unclear whether he had any intellectual disabilities, or whether his intellectual ability was impaired by the 1562 brain injury.

In 1556, Emperor Charles V abdicated and retired to the Monastery of Yuste in southern Spain, leaving the Spanish holdings of his empire to Philip, Carlos&#x27;s father. While en route to Yuste, the Emperor paused at Valladolid and met his grandson. Perceived as 
reckless and ill-mannered, Carlos left a poor impression. Charles was so displeased with the prince that he cautioned Philip against bringing him to Flanders for the homage ceremony from the states.

In 1559, Carlos became engaged to Elizabeth of Valois, eldest daughter of King Henry II of France. However, to hasten the reconciliation between Spain and France, Elizabeth married Philip instead. Three other brides were then suggested for the Prince: Mary, Queen of Scots; Margaret of Valois, youngest daughter of Henry II of France; and Anna of Austria, who was a daughter of Philip&#x27;s cousin, Emperor Maximilian II and Philip&#x27;s sister Maria. Although it was agreed in 1564 that Carlos should marry Anna, the marriage was continually postponed by Philip, much to Carlos&#x27;s frustration. Anna would later become Philip&#x27;s fourth wife.

Beginning in 1560, Carlos suffered recurrent feverish attacks, suspected to be caused by malaria. For the sake of his health, court physicians advised that the prince be moved to Alcalá de Henares. In 1561, Philip arranged for Carlos to be educated in the Universidad de Alcalá de Henares alongside his uncle, Juan of Austria, and cousin, Alexander Farnese.

===Inheritance and head injury===
The 15-year-old Carlos was recognised in 1560 as the heir-apparent to the Castilian throne, and three years later as heir-apparent to the Crown of Aragon as well. He was also heir-presumptive to the throne of Portugal as a paternal cousin of King Sebastian. Because of his eminence, he often attended meetings of the Council of State (which dealt with foreign affairs) and was in correspondence with his aunt Margaret, who governed the Low Countries in his father&#x27;s name.
In April 1562, while at the University of Alcalá, Carlos sustained a severe head injury after falling down a staircase. Initially deemed non-threatening, his condition rapidly deteriorated; within ten days he was experiencing delusions and excruciating pain. Fearing for his son&#x27;s life, Philip sought various remedies, consulting numerous physicians and resorting to placing the relics of Diego de Alcalá by the prince&#x27;s bedside. By late May, Carlos&#x27;s condition began to improve. While Philip credited the miraculous power of the Franciscan corpse, modern historians attribute the prince&#x27;s recovery to either a trepanation of the skull performed by the anatomist Andreas Vesalius or the application of ointments by a Moorish doctor. After his recovery, Carlos became even wilder, more unstable in his temper and unpredictable in his behaviour.

===Insanity===
Allegedly, Carlos sympathized with Flemish rebels and made contacts with representatives of Count Egmont and Floris of Montmorency, leaders of the revolt against Philip in the Low Countries. There were purported plans of fleeing to the Netherlands and declaring himself king, with the support of the rebels. While it is known that Carlos harbored a strong desire to go to the Netherlands, most historians have dismissed the theory that he was involved with Flemish insurgents.

Throughout 1567, Carlos exhibited escalating emotional instability, marked by violent episodes. One notable incident involved his command to set a house on fire after he was accidentally splashed with water thrown from a window of the house.

Carlos often complained about his father&#x27;s resistance to giving him positions of authority. Hoping to placate his son by increasing his sense of responsibility, Philip appointed Carlos president of the Council of State in 1567. However, the prince showed no interest in the Council or in familiarizing himself with political matters.

Although he initially promised Carlos rule over the Low Countries in 1559, Philip came to realize his son&#x27;s inability to be trusted with positions of power. Consequently, instead of fulfilling his promise, Philip granted the position of Governor of the Netherlands to the Duke of Alba. Outraged at being robbed of his position, Carlos attempted to attack the duke but was quickly restrained.

In the autumn of 1567, he made another attempt to flee to the Netherlands
 by asking John of Austria to take him to Italy. John asked for 24 hours to make his decision, during which he revealed Carlos&#x27;s plan to Phillip who immediately denied permission for the trip.

After being denied, Carlos attempted to shoot John of Austria. A servant had unloaded Carlos&#x27;s gun while he lured John into his room. After Carlos discovered his gun was unloaded, he attacked John with bare hands. After hearing about the attack, Philip ordered that Carlos be confined in his room without contact to the outside world.

Just before midnight on 17 January 1568, Philip II, in armour, and with four councillors, entered Don Carlos&#x27; bedchamber in the Alcázar of Madrid where they declared his arrest, seized his papers and weapons, and nailed up the windows. Carlos threatened suicide, which then caused him to be banned from having knives or forks in his room.

===Death===
In addressing public opinion and other European courts, Philip attempted to justify Carlos&#x27;s imprisonment without revealing the prince&#x27;s actual transgressions or mental state. This absence of transparency fueled widespread speculation that would later be weaponized by Philip&#x27;s enemies. By July, Carlos&#x27;s hunger strikes left him in an &quot;appallingly thin&quot; state. On 24 July 1568, the prince died in his room, possibly as a result of starvation. His death was used as one of the core elements of the Spanish Black Legend in the Netherlands, which needed to justify a revolt against the king, which subsequently caused The Eighty Years&#x27; War. It was later claimed that he was murdered by poison on the orders of King Philip, especially by William the Silent in his &quot;Apology&quot;, a 1581 propaganda work against the Spanish king. The idea of the poisoning had been held by central and north European historians, based on the pieces of propaganda produced in the Netherlands, until the 20th century, while most Spanish and Italian historians kept claiming that evidence and documentation pointed at a death by natural causes.

==Legend and literature==
Don Carlos is also portrayed in the novel &quot;The Spanish bridegroom&quot; by English author Jean Plaidy, where the delusional and increasingly mad and dangerous prince forms a close relationship with his French stepmother, Elizabeth of Valois, defying all attempts by his desperate father to civilise him.

The idea of King Philip confining and murdering his own son later played a minor role in establishing the anti-Spanish Black Legend in England, and a major one in forming it in the Netherlands, Germany and central Europe. The propaganda created from it formed the basis for Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s 1787 tragedy &quot;Don Karlos, Infant von Spanien&quot;.

Schiller based his work on a novel written in 1672 by the French Abbé, César Vichard de Saint-Réal, which was also the source used by the English writer Thomas Otway for his play &quot;Don Carlos, Prince of Spain&quot;. In both works, romantic tragedies that combine nationalism and romantic love, Carlos incarnates the ideal of the romantic knight, noble and brave. He is presented as the lover of young Elizabeth of Valois, Philip&#x27;s wife, as they both fight for freedom and for their love against a cruel, despotic, merciless, and far-too-old-for-Isabel Philip II and his court of equally cruel and despotic Spaniards. Finally, the hero is defeated by treason due to his excess of nobility.

Schiller&#x27;s play was adapted into several operas, most notably Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1867, also known under its Italian title, &quot;Don Carlo&quot;). Verdi&#x27;s opera is probably the version of the story most familiar to modern audiences, as it is a mainstay of the operatic repertoire and is still frequently performed. In it, Carlos is portrayed sympathetically as a victim of court intrigues, and little reference is made to his mental instability or violent tendencies.

The story of a king jailing his own son is also the basis for the Spanish play &quot;La vida es sueño&quot; (&quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;) (1635), by Pedro Calderón de la Barca; however, this play does not explicitly refer to Don Carlos, starts with a different premise, and was likely inspired by a combination of religious reflection and Plato&#x27;s cave, in the line of Spanish Neoplatonism.

==In popular media==
The role of Carlos is portrayed by Canadian actor Mark Ghanimé in the CW show &quot;Reign&quot;. He was portrayed as a sexual deviant, who enjoyed being whipped, and showed interest in ruling Scotland with a crown matrimonial. &quot;Reign&quot; does hold true to the facts of brain damage, but instead of a fall, Don Carlos&#x27;s head is impaled by a piece of wood from his &quot;sex horse&quot;.

Carlos is portrayed by Joseph Cuby as a 14 year old sadist betrothed to Princess Mariella (Francesca Annis) in the TV series &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot; (1962) episode &quot;Visit to Spain&quot;.

==In &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;==

John Foxe, in &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot;, better known as &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot; (2nd ed., 1570), wrote the following about Carlos:

Unfortunately, the graphic understates his problems. Joanna Trastamara (also known as Joanna of Castille) was mother of Catherine as well.

<text>Mammaplasty (also called mammoplasty or mastoplasty) refers to a group of surgical procedures, the goal of which is to reshape or otherwise modify the appearance of the breast. There are three main types of mammoplasty:
# Augmentation mammaplasty is commonly performed to increase the size, change the shape, and/or alter the texture of the breasts. This usually involves the surgical implantation of breast implants.
# Reduction mammaplasty is commonly performed to reduce the size, change the shape, and/or alter the texture of the breasts. This involves the removal of breast tissue.
#Reconstructive mammoplasty is breast reconstruction that is done after mastectomy to give the breasts an appearance that is more normal/familiar.

== Social context ==
Mammaplasty started a surgical procedure to help relieve women of the excess weight of their breasts; it was only later that it was used for cosmetic purposes. There is social pressure on women to subscribe to socially prescribed beauty standards of how their bodies must be, and one part of this is the pressure on women to have &#x27;perfect breasts&#x27;. Earlier records of such surgery were either for medical purposes or to make a person fit in more easily with a certain social group. It was in the beginning of the 20th century that Hippolyte Morestin and Eugene Hollander started breast reduction (reduction mammoplasty) for beauty purposes only. By the 1930s though, breast reduction had become more of aesthetic surgery than reconstructive surgery.

It is still however used for medical purposes and female celebrities vocally getting such surgery has allowed for more to undertake it and speak up openly about it, a recent example of it being Ariel Winter, who plays Alex in Modern Family, undergoing breast reduction surgery after years of back and neck pain.

== Augmentation mammaplasty ==
Breast augmentation, sometimes referred to as a &quot;boob job&quot; by patients, involves using breast implants or fat transfer to increase the size of one&#x27;s breasts. This procedure can also restore breast volume lost after weight reduction or pregnancy, achieve a more rounded breast shape or improve natural breast size asymmetry. For some women, breast augmentation is a way to feel more confident. For others, it is part of rebuilding the breast for various conditions.

Breast augmentation is performed with implants (see below) that can be placed under a chest muscle or over a chest muscle. In general, all breast augmentations are minimally invasive procedures, involving incisions that are usually between 3 and 5 cm in length. Breast augmentation is a relatively straightforward procedure. As with any surgery, some uncertainty and risk are associated with breast augmentation surgery.

=== What breast augmentation surgery can do ===
* Increase fullness and projection of the breasts
* Improve balance of breast and hip contours
* Enhance self-image

=== Risks ===
Breast augmentation poses various risks, including:
* Scar tissue that distorts the shape of the breast implant (capsular contracture)
* Breast pain
* Infection
* Changes in nipple and breast sensation
* Implant leakage or rupture

== Reduction mammaplasty ==
Breast reduction surgery is also known as reduction mammaplasty or mammoplasty. It is a cosmetic surgical procedure aimed at reducing large or sagging breasts to a more comfortable size and shape. Large ptotic (sagging) breasts can become troublesome for patients, leading to potentially debilitating symptoms and a poor quality of life. Patients seeking breast reduction commonly present with complaints of migraines, back pain, neck pain, severe discomfort, unwanted harassment, poor self-image and anxiety among other symptoms. These patients can benefit greatly from a reduction in breast size, as most symptoms are relieved by reduction mammaplasty.

=== Reasons for treatment ===
Many women with large breasts experience varying degrees of physical and psychological distress, often including:
* Pain in the breasts, neck, back or shoulders;
* Bad posture;
* Inability to participate in sports;
* Low self-esteem; and
* Increased self-consciousness.

The goal of the surgery is to reduce the breast size so that they are more comfortable and proportional to the woman&#x27;s physique.

=== Benefits ===
Thousands of mammaplasties are performed every year, and most women are happy with the results. A study of 66 women who had undergone breast reduction reported that the women showed a 94% satisfaction with the results of the procedure (in terms of size, shape, nipple position, and sensation in the breast). This study also reported great improvement in self-esteem, and problems with appearance, exercise and embarrassment over breast size were substantially reduced.

Overall, this and other studies have shown that breast reduction improves function, wellbeing and quality of life for women with excessively large or sagging breasts.

=== Risks ===
Specific risks of breast reduction surgery include:
* Infection;
* Wound breakdown;
* Bleeding;
* Asymmetry of breasts (size and shape);
* Abnormal scarring;
* Loss of sensation in the nipple or breast skin;
* Breastfeeding problems; and
* Need for repeat surgery.

== Breast cancer and reconstructive mammaplasty ==
Research has indicated that breast reduction surgery, for women who are at high risk for breast cancer, may serve as an effective primary prevention strategy for tackling breast cancer and is not shown to increase chances of the breast cancer coming back or making it harder to check this through a mammography. As opposed to mastectomy, therapeutic mammoplasty has emerged as a way to address breast cancer in women with larger breasts and where early breast cancer is detected, this helps align with the cosmetic needs of the person in question and has positive health benefits as well.

Many reports have also addressed the relationship between breast cancer and augmentation mammaplasty using implants. Most of them report that there is no increased rate of breast cancer in patients with augmentation mammaplasty. On the contrary, several studies have reported that the rate of breast cancer is actually lower in patients with augmentation mammaplasty. These studies argue that the lower incidence rate of breast cancer is probably due to the lower calorie intake of patients who wish to have augmentation mammaplasty. These patients, being on the thinner side, do not have a tendency toward breast cancer.

A concern for breast cancer survivors can be the physical appearance of their breasts after the surgical procedures required to cure breast cancer in several cases. Reconstructive mammaplasty is breast reconstruction that is done after mastectomy to give the breasts an appearance that is more normal/familiar. Some factors that are considered before deciding whether such surgery would be apt are the size and shape of the breasts before operation, the amount of tissue remaining after the mastectomy, chance of the cancer returning, and what the mastectomy scar looks like and where it is. Mammoplasty has also evolved as a way for women to address physical changes that mastectomy brings about to their bodies. Surgery to reconstruct the breasts can be started along with the mastectomy or after the body has healed from the mastectomy.

Mammograms in general are not performed on reconstructed breasts that have had implants, it is recommended that a woman who has had a breast implant let the radiology technician know of it, before a mammogram, as special steps may be necessary for ensuring correct results and not causing harm to the implant.

<doc id="280996" wikidata="Q332681" url="?curid=280996" title="Martin of Aragon">
<text>Martin the Humane (29 July 1356 – 31 May 1410), also called the Elder and the Ecclesiastic, was King of Aragon, Valencia, Sardinia and Corsica and Count of Barcelona from 1396 and King of Sicily from 1409 (as Martin II). He failed to secure the accession of his illegitimate grandson, Frederic, Count of Luna, and with him the rule of the House of Barcelona came to an end.

==Background==
Martin was born in 1356, in either Girona or Perpignan, both then in the Principality of Catalonia. He was the second son of King Peter IV of Aragon and Eleanor of Sicily (Leonora), princess of the Sicilian branch of the House of Aragon.

As a cadet prince of the Aragonese royal family, Martin was given the County of Besalú. In Barcelona on 13 June 1372, Martin married María López de Luna (d. Villarreal, 20 December 1406), the daughter and heiress of Lope, Lord and 1st Count of Luna and Lord of Segorbe and his wife Brianda de Got, who was born in Provence and was related to Pope Clement V.

In 1380 his father appointed him lord and regent of the island of Sicily, then known also as Trinacria, since its queen Maria of Sicily, who was also Martin&#x27;s cousin, was underage (Maria&#x27;s father, Frederick III the Simple, died in 1377). As a son of Eleanor of Sicily, Martin was himself an heir to the island, should Maria&#x27;s family die out. Martin&#x27;s only living son, Martin the Younger, about seventeen years old, was married in 1391 to the Queen of Sicily.

After the marriage, Martin the Younger left Aragon and, having arrived in Palermo, was crowned, together with Maria, King of Sicily, becoming Martin I of Sicily. The Sicilians did not like the Aragonese marriage too much (also because it had been celebrated by the antipope Clement VII and the Sicilians were supporters of Pope Urban VI and then of Pope Boniface IX) and, led by the Alagona family, rebelled already in 1392 and from that date opposed the Aragonese authority. In the same 1392, Martin the Elder was sent to Sicily at the head of an expedition (which had been organized to intervene in Sardinia, but during the trip it was diverted to Sicily) to help his son, Martin the Younger and Queen Maria. The arrival of Martin the Elder in Sicily led to the conquest of Trapani and Palermo, but he was unable to defeat the opponents, who resisted until 1398, the year in which peace returned and the son and daughter-in-law were able to govern the whole island again. 

==Kingship==
In 1396, Martin succeeded his elder brother John I, who had died sonless, on the throne of Aragon. However, Sicilian nobles were causing unrest and so Martin was kept in Sicily. Meanwhile, Martin&#x27;s wife, María López de Luna, claimed the throne on his behalf and acted as his representative until he arrived in 1397. Still, the delay opened the way for more problems and quarrels to surface in Aragon. His right to the throne was contested, first by Count Matthew of Foix on behalf of his wife Joanna, elder daughter of John I. However, Martin succeeded in quashing an invasion by troops of the count. After the death of the childless Joanna, John I&#x27;s younger daughter Yolande of Aragon, who had married the Angevin King Louis II of Naples, continued the claim, as did her sons.

Martin launched crusades against the Moors in North Africa in 1398 and 1399.

Aragon had been trying to subjugate Sardinia since the reign of James II, and gradually the Aragonese had conquered most of the island. However, in the 1380s, during the reign of Martin&#x27;s father Peter IV, the remaining independent principality of Arborea became a fortress of rebellion and the Aragonese were rapidly driven back by Eleanor of Arborea, so that practically the whole of Sardinia was lost. King Martin sent his son Martin the Younger, by then king of Sicily through his marriage to Queen Maria, to reconquer Sardinia. The son won the Battle of Sanluri (San Luis, San Luigi) in 1409, drove away the Genoese allies of the Sardinians, and subjugated a vast number of Sardinian nobles. This soon caused Arborea&#x27;s total loss of independence. Soon after the battle, however, Martin the Younger died suddenly, due to malaria. Martin of Aragon then succeeded his son as King of Sicily, taking the title of Martin II.

Overall, the Crown of Aragon enjoyed external peace during Martin&#x27;s reign and he worked to quell internal strife caused by nobles, factions and bandits. He supported the Avignon line of Popes and Pope Benedict XIII, who was Aragonese, held the seat throughout Martin&#x27;s reign. Martin&#x27;s military intervention rescued the imprisoned Benedict in 1403 from the clutches of his rivals and the Pope settled in Valencia&#x27;s countryside.

== Issue ==
Martin had four legitimate children by Queen Maria: Martin the Younger (b. 1374/1376), James (b. 1378), John (b. 1380), and Margaret (b. 1384/1388). The three younger children all died early, and so after Martin the Younger&#x27;s death, King Martin appointed his cousin James II, Count of Urgell, the closest legitimate agnate of the House of Barcelona, as Governor-General of all the kingdoms of Aragon, a position that belonged traditionally to the heir presumptive. Martin still married secondly on 17 September 1409 to his cousin Margaret of Prades, daughter of Peter of Aragon, Baron of Entenza, but the short marriage was childless.

==Succession==
Martin died, in the monastery of Valldonzella, outside the city walls of Barcelona on 31 May 1410. While the reason remains unclear, it is supposed that the cause was either plague (present in the area at the time), uremic coma (the king suffered from severe obesity that affected his health) or the possibility of having been poisoned, only supported by Renaissance chronicler Valla. The story of the king&#x27;s death associated with laughter (following a joke told by Borra the jester while Martin was suffering from indigestion) although lacking in historical evidence, has been recorded. Despite the demands to have an heir declared, the physical incapacity of the king prevented him from giving a clear name, and to the question of giving permission to give to the throne to the person who would be most legitimate for it he gave a terse &quot;Hoc&quot; (Yes).

All of Martin&#x27;s legitimate descendants, born of his marriage with Queen Maria, were already dead, and his second marriage did not produce any children. Only an illegitimate grandson, Frederick, Count of Luna, a natural son of Martin the Younger, and an illegitimate daughter – ineligible for succession due to the rules established during the reign of James I of Aragon – continued the direct line of inheritance. The king, despite his desire and some effort, was unable to obtain sufficient confirmation of Frederick as his successor prior to his death. As a result, Martin&#x27;s death led to a two-year interregnum, during which at least five contenders for the throne came forward, including Frederick of Luna and James II of Urgell. Succession of the Crown of Aragon was determined by the Compromise of Caspe on 28 June 1412, in which Martin&#x27;s nephew Ferdinand, infante of Castile was chosen as the next king, establishing the House of Trastámara.

<text>Gastric distention is the enlargement of the stomach, and can be due to a number of causes.

Physiologic (normal) gastric distension occurs when eating. Distension of the upper stomach stimulates the secretion of stomach acid, while distension of the lower stomach stimulates gastrin secretion. Distension of the stomach also stimulates the secretion of ghrelin.

Other causes include:
* binge eating associated with bulimia nervosa
* tumors causing obstruction
* diabetic neuropathy
* scarring due to pyloric gastritis
* delayed gastric emptying

To identify the cause of gastric distention, an upper endoscopy or barium upper GI imaging should be done.

<doc id="280998" wikidata="Q354779" url="?curid=280998" title="Jacob Epstein">
<text>Sir Jacob Epstein (10 November 1880 – 21 August 1959) was an American and British sculptor who helped pioneer modern sculpture. He was born in the United States, and moved to Europe in 1902, becoming a British subject in 1910.

Early in his career, in 1912, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; described Epstein as &quot;a Sculptor in Revolt, who is in deadly conflict with the ideas of current sculpture.&quot; Revolting against ornate, pretty art, he made bold, often harsh and massive forms in bronze or stone. His sculpture is distinguished by its vigorous rough-hewn realism. Avant-garde in concept and style, his works often shocked audiences. This was not only a result of their, often explicit, sexual content, but also because they abandoned the conventions of classical Greek sculpture favoured by European academic critics and sculptors, to experiment instead with the aesthetics of art traditions as diverse as those of India, China, ancient Greece, West Africa and the Pacific Islands. His larger sculptures were his most expressive and experimental, but also his most vulnerable.

Such factors may have focused disproportionate attention on certain aspects of Epstein&#x27;s long and productive career, throughout which he aroused hostility, especially challenging taboos surrounding the depiction of sexuality. He often produced controversial works that challenged ideas on what was appropriate subject matter for public artworks. Epstein would often sculpt the images of friends, casual acquaintances, and even people he spotted on the street. He worked even on his dying day. He also painted; many of his watercolours and gouaches were of Epping Forest, where he lived for a time. These were often exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in London.

Bronze portrait sculpture formed one of Epstein&#x27;s staple products, and perhaps the best known. These sculptures were often executed with roughly textured surfaces, expressively manipulating small surface planes and facial details.

Epstein was Jewish, and negative reviews of his work sometimes took on an antisemitic flavour, though he did not attribute the &quot;average unfavorable criticism&quot; of his work to antisemitism.

After Epstein died, Henry Moore wrote a tribute in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; which included a recognition of Epstein&#x27;s central role in the development of modern sculpture in Britain. &quot;He took the brickbats, he took the insults, he faced the howls of derision with which artists since Rembrandt have learned to become familiar. And as far as sculpture in this century is concerned he took them first... We have lost a great sculptor and a great man.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Epstein was born at 102 Hester Street on the Lower East Side of New York City. His parents were Max Epstein, formerly Jarogenski or Jarudzinski, and Mary Epstein, née Solomon, both of whom were Orthodox Jews and whose families had emigrated from Augustów in Poland. The family was middle-class, owning a number of businesses and tenements, and Jacob was the third of their eight surviving children.

As a child Epstein suffered from pleurisy and he left school aged thirteen. Between 1893 and 1898 he attended classes at the Art Students League of New York. In 1898 he organised an exhibition at the Hebrew Institute for a group of local Jewish artists and in 1899 opted to stay at Hester Street when his family moved to Madison Avenue, supporting himself by working as a tenement inspector and, briefly, as a physical education instructor. He also began selling his drawings and provided illustrations for two articles by the journalist Hutchins Hapgood. Epstein spent the winter of 1899 working as an ice-cutter with his friend Bernard Gussrow at Greenwood Lake in New Jersey.

In 1900, the Hester Street tenement Epstein was living in burnt down and, as well as losing all his sketches and drawings, he became homeless. With the help of the local settlement movement he took a job as a farmhand in Southboro, Massachusetts. Returning to Manhattan in June 1901 he worked in a bronze foundry while taking classes for sculptor&#x27;s assistants at the Art Students League of New York. Epstein&#x27;s first major commission was to illustrate Hutchins Hapgood&#x27;s 1902 book &quot;The Spirit of the Ghetto&quot;. Epstein used the money from the commission to leave New York City for Paris in September 1902.

===Paris 1902–1905===
On his second full day in Paris, during October 1902, Epstein saw the funeral procession of Emile Zola and witnessed some of the anti-semitic abuse directed at the passing cortège. Epstein studied at the École des Beaux-Arts from October 1902 until March 1903 and then, from April 1903 to 1904, at the Académie Julian where he was taught by Jean-Paul Laurens. He shared a studio in Montparnasse with Bernard Gussrow and throughout 1904 and 1905 appears to have studied independently in various Paris museums. He regularly visited the Louvre to view its collection of non-European sculpture, studied Indian and Far Eastern art in the Musée Guimet and artworks from China in the Musée Cernuschi.

Epstein visited Rodin in his studio and met Margaret Dunlop, known as Peggy, (1873-1947) who encouraged him to visit London, which he did in 1904. There he spent some time viewing sculptures from African and Polynesian cultures in the British Museum, all of which were to have a profound influence on his future work.

===London 1905–1907===
After destroying the contents of his Paris studio, Epstein moved to London in 1905 with Dunlop, whom he married in November 1906. The couple lived at Stanhope Street near Regent&#x27;s Park before moving to the Stamford Street Studios in Fulham. With a reference from Rodin, Epstein gained access to a number of society figures, notably George Bernard Shaw and Robbie Ross and to a circle of artists associated with the New English Art Club, NEAC, including Muirhead Bone and Augustus John. He had a wax model shown in a large exhibition of Jewish art at the Whitechapel Art Gallery during 1906 and an oil painting included in the NEAC&#x27;s December 1906 show. In 1907, Epstein moved his studio to 72 Cheyne Walk where he began working on his first major public commission, a series of statues for the new British Medical Association building in London.

===The Strand sculptures, 1908===
Throughout 1907 and 1908, Epstein created eighteen large sculptures for the second-floor façade of Charles Holden&#x27;s new building for the British Medical Association, BMA, on The Strand (now Zimbabwe House) in central London. Epstein created models of each figure in his studio and these were then cast in plaster. The plaster models were taken to the Strand where they were copied in stone by a firm of commercial architectural carvers, John Drymond of Westminster Bridge Road. Epstein then made minor adjustments and changes to the stone figures. This process of using models, casts and commercial carvers was the norm for architectural sculpture at the time and was one Epstein soon came to reject. 
Although the six figures representing aspects of medicine and science attracted little attention, the twelve statues representing different stages of life were greatly criticised, notably by the National Vigilance Association, whose offices were opposite the building. Their view that the figures, particularly that of the heavily pregnant &quot;Maternity&quot; and the male nudes, were sexually explicit and insulting to Edwardian sensibilities was taken up by various newspapers. In June 1908 the London Evening Standard described the sculptures as &quot;statuary which no careful father would wish his daughter, or no discriminating young man his fiancée to see.&quot; A police officer was called to climb the scaffolding to inspect the statues as was the Bishop of Stepney, Cosmo Gordon Lang, who approved of them. Several other public figures and artists defended the works and, at a meeting of its governing council in July 1908, the BMA agreed to keep them in place.

In art-historical terms, the Strand sculptures represented Epstein&#x27;s first thoroughgoing attempt to break away from traditional European iconography in favour of elements derived from classical India sculpture. The female figures in particular incorporated the posture and hand gestures of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu art from the subcontinent.

While working on the Strand statues, Epstein was asked by Augustus John to create a portrait of his two-year-old son, Romilly. This 1907 bronze &quot;Romilly John&quot; became the first of a series of such portraits of the child. In 1909, Epstein carved a stone version that he retained for the rest of his life. The 1908 controversy over the Strand statues left Epstein depressed and short of money. For the rest of 1908 he worked on portraits and small pieces, notably busts of Euphemia Lamb and his first portrait bust of Mary McEvoy.

===The Tomb of Oscar Wilde, 1908–1912===
Near the end of 1908, without any prior discussion or advance warning, Robbie Ross announced that Epstein was the chosen sculptor for a new tomb of Oscar Wilde in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. After a period spent studying Wilde&#x27;s writings, Epstein designed a monument featuring a large statue of Narcissus. After several months, he changed his mind and destroyed that, almost-complete, monument in favour of a new design carved directly in stone. The decision to carve directly in stone, then a new and radical departure for contemporary sculptors, may reflect the influence of Epstein&#x27;s then friend and collaborator Eric Gill. Throughout the second half of 1910, Epstein and Gill met on an almost daily basis, but eventually they fell out. Earlier that year they had held long discussions with other artists, including Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy, about the formation of a religious brotherhood. They also planned the construction on the Sussex Downs of a colossal monument to art, which Gill referred to &quot;as a sort of twentieth-century Stonehenge.&quot; During the time they worked together, both Epstein and Gill produced significant works on similar themes, notably Epstein&#x27;s &quot;Sun God&quot; and Gill&#x27;s &quot;Cocky Kid&quot; and they both carved portrait heads of Romilly John. Epstein&#x27;s third Romilly John head, entitled &quot;Rom&quot;, was carved from a rectangular limestone block, which he retained, complete with chisel-marks, as a base for the child&#x27;s head, so that it appeared as if the figure had emerged from the rock. Both &quot;Rom&quot;, and another carving called &quot;Sun Goddess&quot;, show the influence of oriental and Egyptian art on Epstein and how far he was moving away from more classical and accepted traditions of sculpture. 

Epstein spent nine months in Gill&#x27;s studio at Ditchling carving, from a block of Hopton Wood stone, the new design for Wilde&#x27;s tomb and for which Gill designed the inscription. This design was clearly influenced by the massive Assyrian sculptures Epstein knew from the British Museum and featured, in his words &quot;a vast, winged figure ... the conception of poet as messenger&quot; with smaller figures representing Fame, Intellectual Pride and Luxury. In June 1912, Epstein had the completed tomb displayed in his London studio for public viewing. The work received positive reviews and was highly praised in the British press, including by publications that had been critical of the Strand statues.

Following an introduction from Augustus John in 1910, John Quinn, a wealthy American collector and patron to the modernists, visited Epstein&#x27;s studio to view the Wilde tomb and quickly became the artist&#x27;s major patron and collector of his work. After his death in 1924, several of Quinn&#x27;s Epsteins were acquired by public collections in the United States.

By September 1912, after a prolonged dispute with the French customs authorities over the import duty payable, Wilde&#x27;s tomb was installed in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. The Paris authorities deemed the monument offensive due to the flying creature&#x27;s testicles and had it covered with a tarpaulin. They demanded that Epstein remove the offending parts or cover them up. He refused and on several occasions visited the cemetery and, with the help of friends including Nina Hamnett and Brancusi, removed the tarpaulin only for the cemetery authorities to replace it later. This standoff, with Epstein travelling between London and Paris on a frequent basis, continued until August 1914 when Robbie Ross, against Epstein&#x27;s wishes, had a butterfly-shaped plaque made as a fig-leaf to cover the creature&#x27;s testicles. Epstein refused to attend the official unveiling, which was performed by Aleister Crowley. Crowley subsequently presented Epstein with the fig-leaf from the tomb one evening at the Café Royal in London.

During his time in Paris defending the Wilde tomb, as well as Brancusi, Epstein met and befriended Modigliani and Picasso, each of whom influenced his future work. In May and June 1912, Epstein was among the artists hired to produce artworks for a new London nightclub, The Cave of the Golden Calf, which brought him into contact with a number of younger artists, notably Wyndham Lewis and the poet T. E. Hulme. This led to Epstein becoming associated with the short-lived Vorticism movement and contributing two illustrations to the first edition of the Vorticist magazine &quot;Blast&quot;.

===Pett Level 1913–1916===

Early in 1913, after living in rented rooms in Montparnasse for three months, the Epsteins moved to a secluded bungalow in the village of Pett Level in East Sussex. Using the garden shed there as a studio, over the next three years Epstein produced a number of notable works.

At Pett Level, Epstein became aware of the dark green mineral Serpentinite, which he called Flenite, and used it for sculptures, including &quot;Flenite Women&quot; and &quot;Flenite Relief,&quot; which showed an infant emerging from the womb. He carved two figures of pregnant women, one of which was eventually acquired by the Tate. &quot;Cursed Be the Day wherein I was Born&quot; was the plaster figure of a child, painted red, apparently crying or screaming. He created three marble sculptures of pairs of doves mating, the first two of which were shown in group exhibitions during 1913 and at his solo exhibition at the Twenty-One Gallery in December 1913. The reviews of all these works, in both the popular press and the art journals, were almost universally hostile and insulting to Epstein.

In London, Epstein rented a room above a bookshop in Devonshire Street and used a garage in the adjacent mews to began work on &quot;Rock Drill&quot;, which was too large for the Pett Level shed. By the summer of 1914 he was close to completing the work but could not afford to have it cast in steel and made the upper figure in plaster instead.

===World War I===
The start of World War I in 1914 saw the closure of a number of London art galleries and left Epstein in financial difficulties, unable to sell any work and with a large number of unfinished pieces. In March 1915, at a London Group exhibition at the Goupil Gallery, Epstein exhibited several works, including the Flenite pieces and &quot;Doves&quot; plus, for the first, and only, time in public, &quot;Rock Drill&quot;. By making an actual, unaltered, industrial drill an integral part of the sculpture, Epstein must have expected criticism. The menacing body mounted on the drill appeared to be assembled from machine parts, including a head on a shaft with the only organic feature the foetus within the creature&#x27;s open rib-cage. The critic&#x27;s response was almost universally hostile and abusive. P.G. Konody described &quot;Rock Drill&quot; as &quot;unutterably loathsome&quot; and Augustus John persuaded John Quinn not to buy it. Even the supportive reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; concluded that the &#x27;incongruity&#x27; of the work was &#x27;too difficult for the mind to grasp&#x27;.
In May 1916, Epstein, apparently mortified at the continuing slaughter of the war, made the decision to break up the sculpture. He removed the drill entirely and reduced the upper figure to a legless one-armed torso, which he had cast in gunmetal. When shown at the London Group in the summer of 1916, the torso appeared more of a victim than the menacing figure of the original sculpture. At this point Epstein began to concentrate less on avant-garde sculpture and embrace more figurative forms of working.

Later in 1915 Epstein showed a number of portrait busts, including those of Iris Beerbohm-Tree and Lilian Shelley, at a National Portrait Society exhibition, all of which received positive reviews and sold well. He subsequently produced a notable portrait bust of Admiral Lord Fisher. During 1916, the Epsteins left Pett Level and moved to Guildford Street in the Bloomsbury area of central London.

As Epstein had become a naturalized British subject in December 1910 he was eligible for conscription into the British armed forces. After lobbying by Margaret Epstein, John Quinn and others, a three-month exemption from conscription was granted, which allowed Epstein to prepare for a major solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in February and March 1917. The exhibition drew large crowds and was a critical and commercial success. A further three-month exemption from conscription was granted, but after a press campaign featuring objections from, among others, G. K. Chesterton and the sculptor Adrian Jones, plus a question in the House of Commons, the concession was withdrawn. By September 1917 Epstein was a private in the 38th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, known as the Jewish Legion, stationed at the Crownhill barracks, Plymouth.

Several attempts were made to have Epstein created an official war artist. His release from active service and secondment to the newly formed Imperial War Museum was approved by Field Marshal Haig in December 1917 but promptly withdrawn after the sculptor George Frampton raised objections. The scheduled departure of his regiment to the Middle East precipitated a breakdown in Epstein. After he was found wandering on Dartmoor, and spent a period in hospital, he was discharged from the army in July 1918 without having left England. After the war ended, Muirhead Bone purchased, for the Imperial War Museum, three portrait busts of military subjects by Epstein including &quot;The Tin Hat&quot; and &quot;Sergeant D F Hunter, VC&quot;.

===&quot;The Risen Christ&quot;===
Epstein spent most of 1919 making portrait sculptures but also returned to work on a large bronze, &quot;The Risen Christ&quot;, which he had abandoned when called up. When exhibited at the Leicester Galleries in February 1920, the seven-foot figure of a gaunt, accusing Christ figure provoked a torrent of abuse towards Epstein, some of which was racist in nature. The controversy brought over a thousand people a day through the turnstiles of the Leicester Galleries for the exhibition. &quot;The Risen Christ&quot; was bought by the explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard and eventually acquired by the National Galleries of Scotland.

===The Hudson memorial===

In 1922, Epstein secured a commission from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, RSPB, for a memorial in Hyde Park, London to the author and naturalist W. H. Hudson. By early 1923, he had produced a model of Hudson beside a tree, looking at a bird. The RSPB approved the design but the park authorities objected and requested a new design. Epstein&#x27;s new design focused on the character, Rima, from Hudson&#x27;s novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; and, after submitting numerous treatments of the figure, a final design was approved in February 1924. When Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin unveiled the memorial on 19 May 1925, there were gasps of horror at the sight of the bare-breasted figure Epstein had created. Arthur Conan Doyle organised a petition to have the memorial removed.
 The Daily Mail ran the headline &quot;Take this horror out of the Park&quot; while the Morning Post described Rima as &quot;hideous, unnatural, unEnglish&quot; and a question was asked in the House of Commons about &quot;this specimen of Bolshevik art&quot;. The abuse aimed at Rima and Epstein lasted for years. The memorial was vandalised with paint in November 1925 and, at different times, during the 1930s was defaced with swastikas and fascist slogans.

In January 1924 the Leicester Galleries held their third exhibition of Epstein&#x27;s works. The exhibition attracted few sales but did elicit a critical and damaging review in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; by Roger Fry and an unsigned and overtly racist article in &quot;The New Age&quot;. Through Muirhead Bone, Epstein was commissioned by the government of Poland to create a portrait bust of Joseph Conrad. Epstein, wrote Conrad, &quot;has produced a wonderful piece of work of a somewhat monumental dignity, and yet—everybody agrees—the likeness is striking.&quot; The Polish government refused to accept the work, completed a few months before Conrad died, and it was eventually, in 1960, acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London.

===America 1927===
In 1927 Epstein agreed to hold an exhibition in New York at the Ferargil Gallery on West 47th Street and spent most of that year preparing fifty works for the show. The exhibition was a success, with several pieces selling including two bought by public collections. During his four months in America, Epstein made three portrait busts, most notably one of the singer Paul Robeson.

In early 1928 the Epstein family moved to 18 Hyde Park Gate, a five-storey house with a ballroom that became Epstein&#x27;s studio and allowed him to start gathering together his unsold and unfinished works from various sheds and garages around London. He also retained Deerhurst, a cottage and studio at Loughton in Epping Forest.

===&quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Day&quot;===

A commission from Charles Holden for two sculptures for the new headquarters building of the London Electric Railway generated further controversy in 1929. Epstein&#x27;s sculptures &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; above the entrances of 55 Broadway were criticised as indecent, ugly and primitive although some critics, notably R. H. Wilenski, regarded them as a major achievement. Starting in October 1928 Epstein carved the two figures &quot;in-situ&quot; as the upper floors of the building were being built above him. Aware of the potential for controversy, he was not identified, in public at least, as the sculptor until May 1929 when &quot;Night&quot; was completed to a storm of criticism. A debate raged for some time over demands to remove the statues. To placate the railway board, Holden persuaded Epstein to modify the penis of the smaller of the two figures represented on &quot;Day&quot;. An attempt to vandalise &quot;Night&quot; was made in October 1929, a few days before the Hudson memorial was defaced. The controversy affected Epstein&#x27;s ability to gain commissions for large public works, which largely dried up for twenty years.

===Early 1930s===
Without any commissions for large public monuments throughout the 1930s, Epstein worked on a number of large sculptures on religious subjects of personal significance to himself, while supporting his family with commissions for portrait busts and by selling paintings of flowers and landscapes.

In 1929, Epstein carved &quot;Genesis&quot;, a massive, marble, three-ton figure of a pregnant woman with a swollen belly and a face based on an African mask. When shown as part of Epstein&#x27;s February 1930 exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, the response to &quot;Genesis&quot; was vicious, not just from the popular press but from more serious journals. Epstein took particular exception to an insulting review by the artist Paul Nash. After a break of almost twenty years, Epstein returned to the sculpture &quot;Sun God&quot; and began, in 1932, to carve a new relief on the rear side of the block, a hunched male figure with two infant forms across his body, titled &quot;Primeval Gods&quot;.

In 1932, Epstein opened an exhibition of watercolours at The Redfern Gallery. The exhibition was based on Old Testament characters and scenes.

Epstein spent the summer of 1933 at his cottage in Epping Forest and, in the space of two months, painted over a hundred landscapes and flower compositions. These were shown at Tooth&#x27;s Gallery that Christmas and these Christmas exhibition of his paintings became a popular annual event. During September 1933, on his way to America, Albert Einstein spent some weeks at Roughton Heath, Norfolk, and agreed to sit for Epstein over seven days. Epstein remembered his meeting with Einstein as, &quot;His glance contained a mixture of the humane, the humorous and the profound. This was a combination which delighted me. He resembled the ageing Rembrandt.&quot;

===&quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, 1934===

Throughout 1934 Epstein struggled with carving a huge block of marble that proved so tough it regularly broke his tools until he had a new set of instruments made for the work. &quot;Behold the Man (Ecce Homo)&quot; depicted a squat Christ with a huge head that, in Epstein&#x27;s words, was &#x27;a symbol of man, bound, crowned with thorns and facing with a relentless and over-mastering gaze of pity and prescience our unhappy world&#x27;. First shown, unfinished, at the Leicester Galleries in March 1935, &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; led to a storm of criticism including accusations of blasphemy. Some newspapers considered the work so grotesque they refused to publish photographs of it. Anthony Blunt wrote a positive review for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, stating that the scale of the work was more suitable for a large church rather than an art gallery. Epstein never sold the work and it remained in his studio throughout his life. In 1958 he was approached by the rector of Selby Abbey in Yorkshire, who asked if Epstein would leave &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; to the abbey in his will. He agreed but local church members raised a petition that persuaded the church authorities to overrule the rector and refuse the gift. It was not until 1969, that &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, donated by Epstein&#x27;s widow Kathleen Garman, was finally installed in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral.

===The Strand sculptures, 1935–1937===

By 1926, the British Medical Association had vacated their Strand headquarters and the building was sold to the government of New Zealand which, in 1928, commissioned a structural survey of Epstein&#x27;s 1908 statues. This survey found extensive signs of erosion, weathering and other damage among them. No further action was taken at that time but in 1935 the building was sold to the government of Southern Rhodesia and the new owners soon announced their intention to remove Epstein&#x27;s statues from the building. A vigorous campaign was again launched to preserve the figures. The leaders of nine of Britain&#x27;s leading art organisations, but notably not the Royal Academy, signed a letter supporting the preservation of the statues. That campaign was a success until 1937 when, as some bunting, erected for the coronation of George VI, was being removed from the building, a piece of one figure was knocked off and fell to the pavement below. The London County Council instructed the owners to make the building safe. The owners declared all the projecting features of the statues to be unsafe and were to be removed. Attempts to find an alternative solution, such as removing and re-carving elements of the statues, were hindered when Epstein insulted the Southern Rhodesian High Commissioner in a press interview. The parts hacked off included the heads and hands of all eighteen figures, the feet of most of them and other key defining elements, such as the foetus from the &quot;Matter&quot; statue and the figure of a new-born baby from &quot;Infancy&quot;. Several of these pieces were eventually acquired by the National Gallery of Canada and one of the heads was later found at a school in Bulawayo.

===Late 1930s===
In the second half of the 1930s alongside his sculpture work, Epstein took on other projects in different media. With the artist Bernard Meninsky, he designed and painted the stage curtain for the ballet &quot;David&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in central London. The curtain, now lost, was considered a great success. Considerably less appreciated was Epstein&#x27;s illustrations for an edition of &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; by Baudelaire. Commissioned to produce twenty drawings, Epstein created sixty illustrations that he considered among his best work in any medium, but when shown at Tooth&#x27;s Gallery in December 1936, met with near universal disapproval.

During 1936, Epstein started carving a large block of alabaster in his Hyde Park Gate studio. Inspired by Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, he carved &quot;Consummatum Est&quot;, a horizontal figure of the crucified Christ with the stigmata wounds on his hands and feet visible. Epstein began, in 1938, to sculpt &quot;Adam&quot;, a seven foot high figure carved from a three-ton block of alabaster. The directors of the Leicester Galleries were reluctant to include the naked giant figure with his oversized genitals and muscles in Epstein&#x27;s June 1939 exhibition but feared he would withdraw all his work from the gallery if they didn&#x27;t accept it. &quot;Adam&quot; was of great personal significance to Epstein who had, throughout the first half of 1939, worked day and night on the figure. Alongside the usual outrage that greeted much of Epstein&#x27;s work, Oswald Mosley&#x27;s fascist group threatened to attack it.

A photograph of the unfinished &quot;Adam&quot; formed the frontispiece of the first edition of Epstein&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Let There Be Sculpture&quot; which was published in 1940. Forty pages, a fifth of the book, was devoted to Epstein&#x27;s account of the Strand sculptures controversy.

===World War II===
During the Second World War, Epstein was asked to undertake six commissions for the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee. After completing bronze busts of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, General Sir Alan Cunningham, Air Marshal Sir Charles Portal and Ernest Bevin, Epstein accepted a commission to create busts of John Anderson and Winston Churchill. He completed the bust of Winston Churchill in early 1947. By then, Churchill was living in Hyde Park Gate across the road from Epstein and the two became friendly. Epstein had numerous casts of the Churchill bust made and it was among his most popular works.

Throughout the war, Epstein continued to paint flowers and woodland scenes of Epping Forest and hold commercially successful Christmas exhibitions of those works. He also worked on two large private projects, &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; and &quot;Lucifer&quot;. First exhibited in February 1942, &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot;, based on a Bible story, depicts two figures, one winged, locked in an embrace carved from a four-ton block of alabaster, streaked with veins of pink and brown.

Epstein imagined the fallen angel Lucifer as a tall, winged, androgynous figure with male genitals and a female face, that of the Kashmiri model Sunita Devi, all cast in a golden patinated bronze. The front of the Leicester Galleries had to be removed to get the statue inside for its first public showing in October 1945. Despite positive reviews, &quot;Lucifer&quot; remained unsold until 1946 when A. W. Lawrence, the brother of T. E. Lawrence, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom Trust purchased it with the intention of donating it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The Fitzwilliam refused the donation as did both the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate but several other museums did show interest and Epstein was pleased when the statue entered the collection of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, where it remains.

&quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; was bought by a businessman, Charles Stafford, who already owned Epstein&#x27;s &quot;Adam,&quot; which he had been exhibiting in local fairs and fetes for its shock value. In Blackpool, he installed &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; in an old song booth on the promenade behind an &#x27;Adults Only&#x27; sign. Eventually Stafford sold &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; and &quot;Adam&quot;, plus &quot;Consummatum Est&quot; which he also owned, to Louis Tussaud. Tussaud returned the works to Blackpool where, along with &quot;Genesis&quot;, they were exhibited in the anatomical curiosities section of his waxworks. The works were displayed alongside dancing marionettes, diseased body parts, and conjoined twin babies in jars. Placing his work within the context of freakish curiosity was a constant source of anguish to Epstein.

===1950s===
After the Second World War there was a notable change in attitudes to Epstein and, nearing seventy, he was about to enjoy a sustained period of recognition and one of the busiest periods of his artistic life. Early in 1950, he received his first commission in twenty years for a public monument, the statue &quot;Youth Advancing&quot;, for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Epstein&#x27;s 1947 carving of &quot;Lazarus&quot; was bought by New College, Oxford and installed in the chapel there in January 1952.

In 1947, the architect Louis Osman was employed by the nuns of the Convent of the Holy Child to rebuild their bomb-damaged buildings on Cavendish Square in central London. Osman&#x27;s design featured a bridge that linked two parts of the complex and would support a large sculpture. The nuns were keen to have a sculpture of the Madonna and Child and planned to employ a Catholic sculptor for the work. Osman was determined to have a work by Epstein and, without consulting the nuns, had him produce a maquette. When the convent rejected Epstein&#x27;s design on cost grounds, he and Osman, with help from Kenneth Clark and the Arts Council, agreed to cover the cost themselves. The convent agreed to Epstein&#x27;s design provided he would listen to any suggestions they made. After Epstein accepted their concerns about the face of the Madonna and changed the head from one based on Kathleen Garman to one modelled on her friend Marcella Bazrtti, the convent began working hard to raise funds for the sculpture to be cast in lead. Unveiled on 14 May 1953 by Rab Butler, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Cavendish Square &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; met with near universal praise.

While working on &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; during 1951 and 1952, Epstein undertook other major projects. In August 1951 he travelled to the United States to view the site in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia where the Philadelphia Museum of Art had commissioned him to create a large sculpture group, &quot;Social Consciousness&quot;; he was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held there in the summer of 1949. In London, the Tate hosted a large retrospective exhibition of his work in September 1952 with fifty-nine sculptures and twenty drawings.

===Final works===
The success of &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; in 1953 led to a dramatic reappraisal of Epstein&#x27;s work in general and to more public commissions.
That year he received commissions from Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff and, from the British Government, a commission for a statue of Field Marshall Jan Smuts to be placed in Parliament Square. Such was the scale and quantity of work Epstein took on, he was given the use of an extra large studio in the Royal College of Art. There he worked on the three large figure groups comprising &quot;Social Consciousness&quot; during 1953, the &quot;Liverpool Resurgent&quot; figure and parts of the giant &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; for Llandaff Cathedral. The cathedral had originally commissioned the figure to be made in gilded plaster but, after Epstein offered to pay for it to be cast in metal, the church authorities agreed to cover the cost of an aluminium casting. It was not until April 1957, that &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;, was unveiled, suspended above the nave of the cathedral on a concrete arch designed by George Pace.

Epstein was appointed an Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours. Epstein strongly suspected that Winston Churchill had nominated him for the honour. In 1955, he received a request from Basil Spence, the architect building the new Coventry Cathedral, to produce a small maquette for a giant sculpture of St Michael&#x27;s Victory over the Devil; he also received a commission from the Trade Union Congress, TUC, for a war memorial for their new headquarters building. The following year, Westminster Abbey commissioned a memorial to William Blake for Poet&#x27;s Corner. As soon as he finished the maquette for Coventry Cathedral, Epstein began making the head and wings of the full-size figure without waiting for the cathedral authorities to approve the project. When reports of the work appeared in the press, Spence made it clear to Epstein that the cathedral was under no obligation to accept it. Epstein said he would do it for his own benefit. When the bishop and cathedral officials visited Epstein&#x27;s studio to view the work they were greatly impressed and quickly approved the contract for the work. In a 1956 letter to a friend, Epstein wrote that he was &quot;inundated with requests for work on buildings, large works which I don&#x27;t know I will ever be able to accomplish. I was for so long without any commissions, I don&#x27;t feel like turning down anything that comes my way, but it is all coming too late I&#x27;m afraid.&quot;

During 1958, Epstein was too ill to attend the unveiling of the war memorial he had carved at the centre of the TUC Headquarters in London, being in hospital with pleurisy and a thrombosis. While the TUC leadership made no secret of their hatred of the carving, several Labour MPs were greatly impressed and the critic Terence Mulally praised it as &quot;a tragic monument on a grand scale.&quot; After spending time convalescing in Italy and France, Epstein resumed working, creating a portrait sculpture of Princess Margaret and starting work on the large Bowater House Group sculpture. Epstein&#x27;s final works included a posthumous portrait of David Lloyd George for the Houses of Parliament and the Bowater House Group, which he completed on the day he died in August 1959.

===Personal life===

Despite being married to and continuing to live with Margaret Dunlop, Epstein had a number of relationships with other women that brought him his five children: Peggy Jean (1918–2010), Theodore Garman, known as Theo, (1924–1954), Kitty Garman (1926–2011), Esther (1929–1954) and Jackie (1934–2009). In 1921, Epstein began the longest of these relationships, with Kathleen Garman, one of the Garman sisters, mother of his three middle children, which continued until his death. Margaret tolerated Epstein&#x27;s infidelities, allowed his models and lovers to live in the family home and raised Epstein&#x27;s first child, Peggy Jean, who was the daughter of Meum Lindsell, one of Epstein&#x27;s previous lovers, and his last, Jackie, whose mother was the painter Isabel Nicholas. Evidently, Margaret&#x27;s tolerance did not extend to Epstein&#x27;s relationship with Kathleen Garman, as in 1922 Margaret shot and wounded Kathleen in the shoulder.

Margaret Epstein died in 1947 and he married Kathleen Garman in 1955. Their eldest daughter, also named Kathleen but known as &quot;Kitty&quot;, married the painter Lucian Freud in 1948 and was the mother of his daughters Annie and Annabel. She is the subject of Freud&#x27;s painting &quot;Portrait of Kitty&quot;. In 1953 they divorced. She married a second time in 1955, to economist Wynne Godley. They have one daughter.

==Death and legacy==
Epstein died in August 1959 at his Hyde Park Gate home and was interred in Putney Vale Cemetery on 24 August 1959 with a service conducted by Dr Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury. A memorial service was held on 10 November 1959 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with a plaster cast of &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; hung in the cathedral for the event. His widow explained why she had buried her Jewish husband in a Christian cemetery: &quot;I chose Putney Vale because of its trees. I did not want to affront Jewish people so I asked a rabbi if he would bury my husband in Christian ground according to the Jewish faith. He said he would not bury him in ground that was not consecrated Jewish. So we had what is called a service.&quot;

A memorial exhibition of 170 sculptures by Epstein was held during the Edinburgh Festival in 1961. The exhibition included the four works that had been at Blackpool in Louis Tussaud&#x27;s shows. After Epstein died the four works, &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot;, &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Consummatum Est&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot;, were bought by a group led by Lord Harewood and Jack Lyons. &quot;Adam&quot; is now in the entrance hall of Harewood House, &quot;Consummatum Est&quot; is in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and &quot;Genesis&quot; is at The Whitworth in Manchester. Since 1996, &quot;Jacob and the Angel&quot; has been part of the Tate collection alongside several other works by Epstein including &quot;Sun God / Primeval Gods&quot;, a version of &quot;Doves&quot; and &quot;Torso in Metal&quot;.

In 1961, two hundred plaster casts by Epstein were donated by Kathleen Garman to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. With Epstein&#x27;s former pupil Sally Ryan, Garman created the Garman Ryan Collection, a collection of works by Epstein and other artists that she donated, in 1973, to the people of Walsall, exhibited at The New Art Gallery Walsall. Ryan also donated Epstein&#x27;s 1927 seated bronze &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, which she had bought in the 1930s, to the Riverside Church, New York City in 1960.

By 1912, Epstein had begun collecting west African, ancient Egyptian, pre-Columbian American, Oceanic and other non-western artworks, having purchased pieces of Fang work, including a reliquary figure, in Paris that year. By 1931 he owned over 200 pieces of ethnographic art and, eventually, built up one of the largest such private collections in existence with over a thousand objects. After his death, when the collection was broken up and sold at auction, the British Museum purchased several substantial pieces.

Epstein&#x27;s art is to be found all over the world. Highly original for its time, it substantially influenced the younger generation of sculptors such as Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. According to June Rose&#x27;s biography, during the early 1920s Moore visited Epstein in his studio and was befriended by the older sculptor. Epstein, Moore, and Hepworth all expressed deep fascination with non-western art in the British Museum.

<doc id="281015" wikidata="Q1074604" url="?curid=281015" title="Recovery position">
<text>In first aid, the recovery position (also called semi-prone) is one of a series of variations on a lateral recumbent or three-quarters prone position of the body, often used for unconscious but breathing casualties.

An unconscious person, a person who is assessed on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at eight or below, in a supine position (on the back) may not be able to maintain an open airway as a conscious person would. This can lead to an obstruction of the airway, restricting the flow of air and preventing gaseous exchange, which then causes hypoxia, which is life-threatening. Thousands of fatalities occur every year in casualties where the cause of unconsciousness was not fatal, but where airway obstruction caused the patient to suffocate. This is especially true for unconscious pregnant women; once turned on to their left side, pressure is relieved on the inferior vena cava, and venous return is not restricted. The cause of unconsciousness can be any reason from trauma to intoxication from alcohol.

It is not necessarily used by health care professionals in an institutional setting, as they may have access to more advanced airway management techniques, such as tracheal intubation.

==Purpose==
The recovery position is designed to prevent suffocation through obstruction of the airway, which can occur in unconscious supine patients. The supine patient is at risk of airway obstruction from two routes:
*Mechanical obstruction: In this instance, a physical object obstructs the airway of the patient. In most cases this is the patient&#x27;s own tongue, as the unconsciousness leads to a loss of control and muscle tone, causing the tongue to fall to the back of the pharynx, creating an obstruction. This can be controlled (to an extent) by a trained person using airway management techniques.
*Fluid obstruction: Fluids, usually vomit, can collect in the pharynx, effectively causing the person to drown. The loss of muscular control which causes the tongue to block the throat can also lead to the stomach contents flowing into the throat, called &quot;passive regurgitation&quot;. Fluid which collects in the back of the throat can also flow down into the lungs. Another complication can be stomach acid burning the inner lining of the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia.

Placing a patient in the recovery position gives gravity assistance to the clearance of physical obstruction of the airway by the tongue, and also gives a clear route by which fluid can drain from the airway.

The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) does not recommend one specific recovery position, but advises on six key principles to be followed:
#The casualty should be in as near a true lateral position as possible with the head dependent to allow free drainage of fluid.
#The position should be stable.
#Any pressure of the chest that impairs breathing should be avoided.
#It should be possible to turn the victim onto the side and return to the back easily and safely, having particular regard to the possibility of cervical spine injury.
#Good observation of and access to the airway should be possible.
#The position itself should not give rise to any injury to the casualty.

==History==
The earliest recognition that placing unconscious patients on their side would prevent obstruction of the airway was by Robert Bowles, a doctor at the Victoria Hospital in Folkestone, England. In 1891 he presented a paper with the title &quot;&#x27;On Stertor, Apoplexy, and the Management of the Apoplectic State&#x27;&quot; in relation to stroke patients with noisy breathing from airway obstruction (also known as stertor).

This paper was taken up by anaesthetist Frederick Hewitt from the London Hospital who advised a sideways position for postoperative patients. This thinking was, however, not widely adopted, with surgical textbooks 50 years later still recommending leaving anaesthetised patients in a supine position.

First aid organisations were similarly slow in adopting the idea of the recovery position, with 1930s and 1940s first aid manuals from the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance both recommending lying a patient on their back. The 1938 British Red Cross First Aid Manual goes so far as to instruct &quot;place the head in a such as position that the windpipe is kept straight, keeping the head up if the face is flushed, and in line with the body if it is pale&quot;. By contrast, the St. John manual advocated turning the head to the side, but it was not until the 1950 40th edition of the St. John Manual that it was added &quot;if breathing is noisy (bubbling through secretions), turn the patient into the three-quarters prone position&quot;, which is very similar to a modern recovery position.

A large number of positions were experimented with, mostly in Europe, as the United States did not widely take up the recovery position until its adoption by the American Heart Association in 1992. Positions included the &quot;Coma Position&quot;, &quot;Rautek&#x27;s Position&quot; and the &quot;HAINES (High Arm IN Endangered Spine) position&quot;.

In 1992, the European Resuscitation Council adopted a new position where the arm nearest the floor was brought out in front of the patient, whereas it had previously been placed behind the patient. This change was made due to several reported cases of nerve and blood vessel damage in the arms of patients.

ILCOR made its recommendations on the basic principles for recovery positions in 1996, but does not prescribe a specific position, and consequently, there are several in use around the world.

<doc id="281028" wikidata="Q170885" url="?curid=281028" title="Essential oil">
<text>An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile (easily evaporated at normal temperatures) chemical compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetheroleum, or simply as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. An essential oil is essential in the sense that it contains the essence of the plant&#x27;s fragrance—the characteristic fragrance of the plant from which it is derived. The term &quot;essential&quot; used here does &quot;not&quot; mean required or usable by the human body, as with the terms essential amino acid or essential fatty acid, which are so called because they are nutritionally required by a living organism.

Essential oils are generally extracted by distillation, often by using steam. Other processes include expression, solvent extraction, &quot;sfumatura&quot;, absolute oil extraction, resin tapping, wax embedding, and cold pressing. They are used in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, air fresheners and other products, for flavoring food and drink, and for adding scents to incense and household cleaning products.

Essential oils are often used for aromatherapy, a form of alternative medicine in which healing effects are ascribed to aromatic compounds. Aromatherapy may be useful to induce relaxation, but there is not sufficient evidence that it can effectively treat any condition. Improper use of essential oils may cause harm including allergic reactions, inflammation and skin irritation. Children may be particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of improper use. Essential oils can be poisonous if ingested or absorbed through the skin.

==Production==
===Distillation===

Most common essential oils such as lavender, peppermint, tea tree oil, patchouli, and eucalyptus are distilled. Raw plant material, consisting of the flowers, leaves, wood, bark, roots, seeds, or peel, is put into an alembic (distillation apparatus) over water. As the water is heated, the steam passes through the plant material, vaporizing the volatile compounds. The vapors flow through a coil, where they condense back to liquid, which is then collected in the receiving vessel.

Most oils are distilled in a single process. One exception is &quot;ylang-ylang&quot; (&quot;Cananga odorata&quot;) which is purified through a fractional distillation.

The recondensed water is referred to as a hydrosol, hydrolat, herbal distillate, or plant water essence, which may be sold as another fragrant product. Hydrosols include rose water, lavender water, lemon balm, clary sage, and orange blossom water.

===Expression===
Most citrus peel oils are expressed mechanically or cold-pressed (similar to olive oil extraction). Due to the relatively large quantities of oil in citrus peel and low cost to grow and harvest the raw materials, citrus-fruit oils are cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange oils are obtained as byproducts of the citrus industry.

Before the discovery of distillation, all essential oils were extracted by pressing.

===Solvent extraction===
Most flowers contain too little volatile oil to undergo expression, but their chemical components are too delicate and easily denatured by the high heat used in steam distillation. Instead, a solvent such as hexane or supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract the oils. Extracts from hexane and other hydrophobic solvents are called &quot;concretes&quot;, which are a mixture of essential oil, waxes, resins, and other lipophilic (oil-soluble) plant material.

Although highly fragrant, concretes contain large quantities of non-fragrant waxes and resins. Often, another solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, is used to extract the fragrant oil from the concrete. The alcohol solution is chilled to for more than 48 hours which causes the waxes and lipids to precipitate out. The precipitates are then filtered out and the ethanol is removed from the remaining solution by evaporation, vacuum purge, or both, leaving behind the &quot;absolute&quot;.

Supercritical carbon dioxide is used as a solvent in supercritical fluid extraction. This method can avoid petrochemical residues in the product and the loss of some &quot;top notes&quot; when steam distillation is used. It does not yield an absolute directly. The supercritical carbon dioxide will extract both the waxes and the essential oils that make up the concrete. Subsequent processing with liquid carbon dioxide, achieved in the same extractor by merely lowering the extraction temperature, will separate the waxes from the essential oils. This lower temperature process prevents the decomposition and denaturing of compounds. When the extraction is complete, the pressure is reduced to ambient and the carbon dioxide reverts to a gas, leaving no residue.

===Production quantities===

Estimates of total production of essential oils are difficult to obtain. One estimate, compiled from data in 1989, 1990, and 1994 from various sources, gives the following total production, in tonnes, of essential oils for which more than 1,000 tonnes were produced.

==Uses and cautions==
Taken by mouth, many essential oils can be dangerous in high concentrations. Typical effects begin with a burning feeling, followed by salivation. Different essential oils may have drastically different pharmacology. Some act as local anesthetic counterirritants and, thereby, exert an antitussive (cough suppressing) effect. Many essential oils, particularly tea tree oil, may cause contact dermatitis. Menthol and some others produce a feeling of cold followed by a sense of burning.

In Australia essential oils (mainly eucalyptus) have been increasingly causing cases of poisoning, mostly of children. In the period 2014–2018, there were 4,412 poisoning incidents reported in New South Wales.

==Use in aromatherapy==
Aromatherapy is a form of alternative medicine in which healing effects are ascribed to the aromatic compounds in essential oils and other plant extracts. Aromatherapy may be useful to induce relaxation, but there is not sufficient evidence that essential oils can effectively treat any condition. Scientific research indicates that essential oils cannot treat or cure any chronic disease or other illnesses. Much of the research on the use of essential oils for health purposes has serious methodological errors. In a systemic review of 201 published studies on essential oils as alternative medicines, only 10 were found to be of acceptable methodological quality, and even these 10 were still weak in reference to scientific standards. Use of essential oils may cause harm including allergic reactions and skin irritation; After receiving a facial at an all-natural salon, a person experienced severe skin irritation, which highlighted the potential dangers of using &quot;clean&quot; beauty products marketed as being made from natural ingredients. This incident underscores the misconception that natural compounds are always safe, revealing a growing awareness within the beauty industry about the risks associated with essential oils, which can lead to allergic reactions and skin damage; there has been at least one case of death.

== Use as pesticide ==

Research has shown that some essential oils have potential as a natural pesticide. In case studies, certain oils have been shown to have a variety of deterring effects on pests, specifically insects and select arthropods. These effects may include repelling, inhibiting digestion, stunting growth, decreasing rate of reproduction, or death of pests that consume the oil. However, the molecules within the oils that cause these effects are normally non-toxic for mammals. These specific actions of the molecules allow for widespread use of these &quot;green&quot; pesticides without harmful effects to anything else other than pests. Essential oils that have been investigated include rose, lemon grass, lavender, thyme, peppermint, basil, cedarwood, and eucalyptus.

Although they may not be the perfect replacement for all synthetic pesticides, essential oils have prospects for crop or indoor plant protection, urban pest control, and marketed insect repellents, such as bug spray. Certain essential oils have been shown in studies to be comparable, if not exceeding, in effectiveness to DEET, which is currently marketed as the most effective mosquito repellent. Although essential oils are effective as pesticides when first applied in uses such as mosquito repellent applied to the skin, it is only effective in the vapor stage. Since this stage is relatively short-lived, creams and polymer mixtures are used in order to elongate the vapor period of effective repellency.

In any form, using essential oils as green pesticides rather than synthetic pesticides has ecological benefits such as decreased residual actions. In addition, increased use of essential oils as pest control could have not only ecological, but economical benefits as the essential oil market diversifies and popularity increases among organic farmers and environmentally conscious consumers. some EOs are authorized, and in use, in the European Union: &quot;Melaleuca&quot; oil as a fungicide, citronella oil as a herbicide, &quot;Syzygium aromaticum&quot; oil as a fungicide and bactericide, &quot;Mentha spicata&quot; oil as a plant growth regulator; &quot;Citrus sinensis&quot; oil (only in France) for &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot; on &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; and &quot;Trialeurodes vaporariorum&quot; on &quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot;; and approvals for oils of &quot;Thymus&quot;, &quot;C. sinensis&quot;, and &quot;Tagetes&quot; as insecticides are pending.

== Use in food ==

In relation with their food applications, although these oils have been used throughout history as food preservatives, it was in the 20th century when essential oils were considered as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

GRAS substances according to the FDA
===As antimicrobials===
The most commonly used essential oils with antimicrobial action are: β-caryophyllene, eugenol, eugenol acetate, carvacrol, linalool, thymol, geraniol, geranyl acetate, bicyclogermacrene, cinnamaldehyde, geranial, neral, 1,8-cineole, methyl chavicol, methyl cinnamate, methyl eugenol, camphor, α-thujone, viridiflorol, limonene, (&quot;Z&quot;)-linalool oxide, α-pinene, &quot;p&quot;-cymene, (&quot;E&quot;)-caryophyllene, γ-terpinene.

Some essential oils are effective antimicrobials and have been evaluated for food incorporation in vitro. However, actual deployment is rare because much higher concentrations are required in real foods. Some or all of this lower effectiveness is due to large differences between culture medium and foods in chemistry (especially lipid content), viscosity, and duration of inoculation/storage.

==Dilution==

Essential oils are usually lipophilic (literally: &quot;oil-loving&quot;) compounds that are immiscible (not miscible) with water. They can be diluted in solvents like pure ethanol and polyethylene glycol.

==Raw materials==
Essential oils are derived from sections of plants. Some plants, like the bitter orange, are sources of several types of essential oil.

===Balsam of Peru===
Balsam of Peru, an essential oil derived from &quot;Myroxylon&quot; plants, is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in animal care products. However, national and international surveys identified balsam of Peru among the &quot;top five&quot; allergens most commonly causing patch test allergic reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.

===Garlic oil===
Garlic oil is an essential oil derived from garlic.

===Eucalyptus oil===

Most eucalyptus oil on the market is produced from the leaves of &quot;Eucalyptus globulus&quot;. Steam-distilled eucalyptus oil is used throughout Asia, Africa, Latin America and South America as a primary cleaning/disinfecting agent added to soaped mop and countertop cleaning solutions; it also possesses insect and limited vermin control properties. Note, however, there are hundreds of species of eucalyptus, and perhaps some dozens are used to various extents as sources of essential oils. Not only do the products of different species differ greatly in characteristics and effects, but also the products of the very same tree can vary grossly.

===Lavender oil===
Lavender oil has long been used in the production of perfume. However, studies have shown it can be estrogenic and antiandrogenic, causing problems for prepubescent boys and pregnant women, in particular. Lavender essential oil is also used as an insect repellent.

===Rose oil===

Rose oil is produced from the petals of &quot;Rosa damascena&quot; and &quot;Rosa centifolia&quot;. Steam-distilled rose oil is known as &quot;rose otto&quot;, while the solvent extracted product is known as &quot;rose absolute&quot;.

==Toxicity==

The potential toxicity of essential oil is related to its level or grade of purity, and to the toxicity of specific chemical components of the oil. Many essential oils are designed exclusively for their aroma-therapeutic quality; these essential oils generally should not be applied directly to the skin in their undiluted form. Some can cause severe irritation, provoke an allergic reaction and, over time, prove toxic to the liver. If ingested or rubbed into the skin, essential oils can be highly poisonous, causing confusion, choking, loss of muscle coordination, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, seizures, and possibly severe allergic reactions or coma.

Some essential oils, including many of the citrus peel oils, are photosensitizers, increasing vulnerability of the skin to sunlight.

Industrial users of essential oils should consult the safety data sheets to determine the hazards and handling requirements of particular oils. Even certain therapeutic-grade oils can pose potential threats to individuals with epilepsy or pregnant women.

Essential oil use in children can pose a danger when misused because of their thin skin and immature livers. This might cause them to be more susceptible to toxic effects than adults.

===Flammability===
The flash point of each essential oil is different. Many of the common essential oils, such as tea tree, lavender, and citrus oils, are classed as Class 3 Flammable Liquids, as they have a flash point of 50–60 °C.

===Gynecomastia===
Estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity have been reported by &quot;in vitro&quot; study of tea tree oil and lavender essential oils. Two published sets of case reports suggest that lavender oil may be implicated in some cases of gynecomastia, an abnormal breast tissue growth in prepubescent boys. The European Commission&#x27;s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety dismissed the claims against tea tree oil as implausible, but did not comment on lavender oil. In 2018, a BBC report on a study stated that tea tree and lavender oils contain eight substances that when tested in tissue culture experiments, increasing the level of estrogen and decreasing the level of testosterone. Some of the substances are found in &quot;at least 65 other essential oils&quot;. The study did not include animal or human testing.

===Handling===
Exposure to essential oils may cause contact dermatitis. Essential oils can be aggressive toward rubbers and plastics, so care must be taken in choosing the correct handling equipment. Glass syringes are often used, but have coarse volumetric graduations. Chemistry syringes are ideal, as they resist essential oils, are long enough to enter deep vessels, and have fine graduations, facilitating quality control. Unlike traditional pipettes, which have difficulty handling viscous fluids, the chemistry syringe, also known as a positive displacement pipette, has a seal and piston arrangement which slides inside the pipette, wiping the essential oil off the pipette wall.

===Ingestion===
Some essential oils qualify as GRAS flavoring agents for use in foods, beverages, and confectioneries according to strict good manufacturing practice and flavorist standards. Pharmacopoeia standards for medicinal oils should be heeded. Some oils can be toxic to some domestic animals, cats in particular. The internal use of essential oils can pose hazards to pregnant women, as some can be abortifacients in dose 0.5–10 mL, and thus should not be used during pregnancy.

===Pesticide residues===
Concern about pesticide residues in essential oils, particularly those used therapeutically, means many practitioners of aromatherapy buy organically produced oils. Not only are pesticides present in trace quantities, but also the oils themselves are used in tiny quantities and usually in high dilutions. Where there is a concern about pesticide residues in food essential oils, such as mint or orange oils, the proper criterion is not solely whether the material is organically produced, but whether it meets the government standards based on actual analysis of its pesticide content.

===Pregnancy===
Some essential oils may contain impurities and additives that may be harmful to pregnant women. Certain essential oils are safe to use during pregnancy, but care must be taken when selecting quality and brand. Sensitivity to certain smells may cause pregnant women to have adverse side effects with essential oil use, such as headache, vertigo, and nausea. Pregnant women often report an abnormal sensitivity to smells and taste, and essential oils can cause irritation and nausea when ingested.

===Toxicology===
The following table lists the or median lethal dose for common oils; this is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested animal population. LD50 is intended as a guideline only, and reported values can vary widely due to differences in tested species and testing conditions.
==Standardization of derived products==
In 2002, ISO published ISO 4720 in which the botanical names of the relevant plants are standardized. The rest of the standards with regards to this topic can be found in the section of ICS 71.100.60 

==History==
The resins of aromatics and plant extracts were retained to produce traditional medicines and scented preparations, such as perfumes and incense, including frankincense, myrrh, cedarwood, juniper berry and cinnamon in ancient Egypt may have contained essential oils. In 1923, when archaeologists opened Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s tomb, they found 50 alabaster jars of essential oils.

Essential oils have been used in folk medicine over centuries. The Persian physician Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, was first to derive the fragrance of flowers from distillation, while the earliest recorded mention of the techniques and methods used to produce essential oils may be Ibn al-Baitar (1188–1248), an Arab Al-Andalusian (Muslim Spain) physician, pharmacist and chemist.

Rather than refer to essential oils themselves, modern works typically discuss specific chemical compounds of which the essential oils are composed, such as referring to methyl salicylate rather than &quot;oil of wintergreen&quot;.

Essential oils are used in aromatherapy, a branch of alternative medicine that uses essential oils and other aromatic compounds. Oils are volatilized, diluted in a carrier oil and used in massage, diffused in the air by a nebulizer or diffuser, heated over a candle flame, or burned as incense.

<doc id="281068" wikidata="Q468672" url="?curid=281068" title="Frederick the Simple">
<text>Frederick III (or IV) (in Italian, &quot;Federico&quot;; 1 September 1341 – Messina 27 July 1377), called the Simple, was King of Sicily from 1355 to 1377. He was the second son of Peter II of Sicily and Elisabeth of Carinthia. He succeeded his brother Louis. The documents of his era call him the &quot;infante Frederick, ruler of the kingdom of Sicily&quot;, without any regnal number.

&quot;Frederick the Simple&quot; is often confused with an earlier Sicilian monarch, his grandfather Frederick II, who chose to call himself &quot;Frederick III&quot; even though he was actually only the second King Frederick to occupy the Sicilian throne; his self-appellation was sometimes retained by later generations of genealogists and historians, producing rival numberings of Sicilian kings named Frederick. The first King Frederick on the Sicilian throne was the latter&#x27;s great-grandfather, King Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.

Frederick III was born in Catania and succeeded to his brother Louis in 1355 under the regency of his sister, Euphemia of Sicily. In his youth the reign was under the control of powerful Sicilian barons, in particular of Artale I Alagona. The beginning of Frederick III&#x27;s reign was also plagued by the Black Death, to which his elder brother and predecessor had succumbed. On 25 December 1369, Frederick ordered all Jews to wear a badge indicating their heritage. The badge consisted of a piece of red material, not smaller than the largest royal seal; men were required to wear it under the chin, and women on the chest. In 1372 he was able to come to peace terms with Naples and Pope Gregory XI, obtaining the title of tributary King of &quot;Trinacria&quot;.

After the death of his mother&#x27;s cousin, Margaret of Tyrol in 1369, Frederick remained the sole descendant of the House of Gorizia-Tyrol which had ruled a vast territory in the Eastern Alps, comprising Tyrol, Carinthia and Carniola. However, due to his problems at home, he is not known to have ever raised any claims to those territories which thus passed to the Habsburgs.

==Marriages==
On 11 April 1361, Frederick married firstly Constance of Aragon, daughter of King Peter IV of Aragon. They had only one daughter, Maria.

On 17 January 1372, Frederick married secondly Antonia of Baux. This marriage was designed to seal the Treaty of Villeneuve of 1372, by which Frederick&#x27;s right to rule Sicily was recognised by Naples and the Papacy. There were no children from this marriage. Frederick was betrothed again to Antonia Visconti, but he died before the wedding and was succeeded by his only child, Queen Maria.

<doc id="281144" wikidata="Q3566373" url="?curid=281144" title="Madrasi chess">
<text>Madrasi chess is a chess variant invented in 1979 by Abdul Jabbar Karwatkar. The game uses the conventional rules of chess with the addition that when a piece is attacked by a piece of the same type but opposite colour (for example, a black queen attacking a white queen) it is paralysed and becomes unable to move, capture or give check.
==Paralysis==
Most of the time, two like pieces attack each other mutually, meaning they are both paralysed. &quot;En passant&quot; pawn captures are an exception to this, since the attack is not mutual. (The status of an &quot;en passant&quot; capture is open to debate, according to Pritchard.)

This paralysis rule is not usually extended to the kings, meaning that as in orthodox chess, the two kings cannot move to adjacent squares; when it &quot;is&quot; extended to kings, the variant is called &quot;Madrasi rex inclusive&quot; (sometimes shortened to &quot;Madrasi RI&quot;). Although it is possible to play complete games of both Madrasi chess and Madrasi RI, they have mainly been used as a condition in chess problems.
The diagram demonstrates some of the peculiarities of Madrasi. The black king is not in check from the rook on c5, because it (the rook) is attacked by the black rook on g5, meaning it is paralysed. In its turn, the c5 rook attacks the g5 rook, paralysing it. Likewise, the white rook on g2, also attacked by the g5 rook, is paralysed. The black rook on h4, however, is not paralysed, and is free to move. The knights on d8 and f7 also attack each other, as do the pawns on c2 and d3, so these pieces are also paralysed. Note that the bishop on d1 is not paralysed by knight on f2 attacking it – units have to be of a similar type (both knights, both bishops and so on) for paralysis to happen.

===Releasing paralysis===
There are two ways in which a paralysis may be released. The first is for a non-paralysed pieces to make a capture. In the example, White cannot play cxd3 because his pawn is paralysed, but he can play Nxd3, thus unparalysing his c2 pawn. The second way to unparalyse a piece is to cut off the line of attack from the paralysing unit by interposing a third piece. For example, 1.Be5 in the diagram cuts the line of attack from the g5 rook to the c5 rook and so unparalyses it. As a result, the white rook on c5 is now giving check. The only way for Black to escape the check in this instance is to re-paralyse the checking rook, which can be done by 1...Rc4. White then has the reply 2.bxc4 which is checkmate: Black has no safe squares for his king, he cannot capture the checking unit, he cannot interpose a piece between the checking unit and the king, and he cannot paralyse the checking unit (note that ...Rxe5 paralysing the c5 rook is not possible, because the g5 rook is paralysed by its counterpart on g2).

<doc id="281146" wikidata="Q139637" url="?curid=281146" title="David Copperfield (illusionist)">
<text>David Seth Kotkin (born September 16, 1956), known professionally as David Copperfield, is an American stage magician and illusionist described by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the most commercially successful magician in history.

Copperfield&#x27;s television specials have been nominated for 38 Emmy Awards, winning 21. Known for his combination of storytelling and illusion, his performance, in a career spanning more than 40 years, have earned 11 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a knighthood by the French government. He has been named a Living Legend by the US Library of Congress.

His illusions have included the disappearance of a Learjet aircraft (1981), the vanishing and reappearance of the Statue of Liberty (1983), levitating over the Grand Canyon (1984), walking through the Great Wall of China (1986), escaping from Alcatraz prison (1987), the disappearance of an &quot;Orient Express&quot; train dining car (1991) and flying on stage for several minutes (1992).

As of 2006, he had sold 33 million tickets and grossed over US$4 billion, more than any other solo entertainer in history by a large margin. In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his earnings at $63 million for the previous 12 months and ranked him the 20th highest-earning celebrity in the world.

In 2006 he bought 11 resort islands in The Bahamas, which he renamed Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay.

== Early life and education ==
Copperfield was born David Seth Kotkin in Metuchen, New Jersey, the son of Jewish parents Rebecca Kotkin (née Gispan; 1924–2008), an insurance adjuster, and Hyman Kotkin (1922–2006), who owned and operated Korby&#x27;s, a men&#x27;s haberdashery in Warren, New Jersey. His mother was born in Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine, while his paternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from the Ukrainian SSR. In 1974 he graduated from Metuchen High School.

Copperfield started his career as a ventriloquist at age eight with his own Jerry Mahoney puppet. When he was 10, he began practicing magic as &quot;Davino the Boy Magician&quot; in his neighborhood, and at 12, he became the youngest person admitted to the Society of American Magicians. A shy loner, the young Copperfield saw magic as a way to fit in and, later, to meet women. As a child, he attended Camp Harmony, a day camp in nearby Warren, New Jersey, where he began practicing magic and ventriloquism, an experience he credits with the origins of his creative style. As he described it, &quot;At Camp Harmony, we spent two weeks searching for a guide who&#x27;d been kidnapped by Indians. It was just a game, but I was living it. My whole life goes back to that camp experience when I was three or four.&quot; As a teenager, he became fascinated with Broadway and frequently sneaked into shows, especially musicals by Stephen Sondheim or Bob Fosse. By age 16, he was teaching a course in magic at New York University.

== Career and business interests ==
At 18, Copperfield enrolled at New York City&#x27;s Jesuit-based Fordham University, but, three weeks into his freshman year, he left to play the lead role in the musical &quot;The Magic Man&quot; in Chicago. At that time, he adopted the stage name David Copperfield, taken from the Charles Dickens novel, because he liked its sound. He sang, danced, and created most of the original illusions in the show. &quot;The Magic Man&quot; became the longest-running musical in Chicago history.

At age 19, he created and headlined for several months the first &quot;Magic of David Copperfield&quot; show at the Pagoda Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the help of sound and lighting designer Willy Martin. Copperfield&#x27;s career in television began in earnest when he was discovered by Joseph Cates, a producer of Broadway shows and television specials. Cates produced a magic special in 1977 for ABC called &quot;The Magic of ABC&quot;, hosted by Copperfield, as well as several &quot;The Magic of David Copperfield&quot; specials on CBS between 1978 and 2001. There have been 18 Copperfield TV specials and 2 documentaries between September 7, 1977, and April 3, 2001.

Copperfield also played the character The Magician in the 1980 horror film &quot;Terror Train&quot; and had an uncredited appearance in the 1994 film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;. Most of his media appearances have been through television specials and guest spots on television programs. 

One of his most famous illusions occurred on television on April 8, 1983: A live audience of 20 tourists was seated in front of a giant curtain attached to two lateral scaffoldings built on Liberty Island in an enclosed viewing area. Copperfield, with help from Jim Steinmeyer and Don Wayne, raised the curtain before lowering it again a few seconds later to reveal that the space where the Statue of Liberty once stood was empty. A helicopter hovered overhead to give an aerial view of the illusion and the statue appeared to have vanished, with only the circle of lights surrounding it still present and visible. Before making the statue reappear, Copperfield explained in front of the camera why he wanted to perform this illusion. He wanted people to imagine what it would be like if there were no liberty or freedom in the world today and what the world would be like without the freedoms and rights we enjoy. Copperfield then brought the statue back, ending the illusion by saying that &quot;our ancestors couldn&#x27;t (enjoy rights and freedoms), we can and our children will&quot;. Both the disappearance and the reappearance of the statue were filmed in long take to demonstrate the absence of camera tricks. This illusion was featured in season four of &quot;The Americans&quot;, in an episode entitled “The Magic of David Copperfield V: The Statue of Liberty Disappears,” and in the 2019 HBO documentary &quot;Liberty: Mother of Exiles&quot;.

In 1986, Copperfield debuted a new variation on the classic sawing a woman in half illusion. Copperfield’s Death Saw illusion was presented as an escape gone wrong, sawing himself, rather than an assistant, in half with a large rotary saw blade which descended from above. Copperfield’s Death Saw has become one of his most well-known illusions.

In 1996, in collaboration with Francis Ford Coppola, David Ives, and Eiko Ishioka, Copperfield&#x27;s Broadway show &quot;Dreams &amp; Nightmares&quot; broke box office records in New York at the Martin Beck Theatre. Reviewer Greg Evans described the sold-out show in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine: &quot;With a likable, self-effacing demeanor that rarely comes across in his TV specials, Copperfield leads the audience through nearly two hours of truly mind-boggling illusions. He disappears and reappears, gets cut in half, makes audience members vanish and others levitate. Copperfield climaxes his show with a flying routine, seven years in the making, that defies both logic and visual evidence, he could probably retire just by selling his secrets to future productions of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;&quot;.

Also in 1996, Copperfield joined forces with Dean Koontz, Joyce Carol Oates, Ray Bradbury and others for &quot;David Copperfield&#x27;s Tales of the Impossible&quot;, an anthology of original fiction set in the world of magic and illusion. A second volume, &quot;David Copperfield&#x27;s Beyond Imagination&quot;, was published in 1997. In addition to the two books, Copperfield wrote an essay as part of NPR&#x27;s &quot;This I Believe&quot; series and This I Believe, Inc.
In May 2001, Copperfield entertained guests at a White House benefit for UNICEF by performing a new illusion in which he sawed singer and actress Jennifer Lopez into six pieces while standing up. This illusion was an update of one he performed in one of his early TV specials on actress Catherine Bach, and has never been performed publicly in any of his stage or TV appearances.

In 2002, he was the subject of an hour-long biographical special on &quot;A&amp;E&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Biography&quot; channel.

On April 5, 2009, Copperfield made his first live TV appearance for some time when he entertained the audience at the 44th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards with two illusions. First, he made singer Taylor Swift appear inside an apparently empty translucent-sided elevator as it was lowered from the ceiling; he then sawed her in half in his Clearly Impossible illusion.

On May 7, 2009, Copperfield was dropped by Michael Jackson from Jackson&#x27;s residency at the O2 Arena after a disagreement over money. Copperfield wanted $1 million (£666,000) per show. Copperfield denied the reports of a falling-out, saying &quot;don&#x27;t believe everything you read.&quot; News of Copperfield&#x27;s collaboration with Jackson first surfaced on April 1, 2009, and has since been described as a possible April Fool&#x27;s prank.

In July 2009, he filmed a number of scenes for a cameo appearance in episode 8 of the short-lived TV drama &quot;The Beautiful Life&quot;. In these scenes, he worked alongside actresses Mischa Barton and Sara Paxton performing a number of illusions including a sawing in half of Barton&#x27;s character Sonja Stone in a specially-developed box-less version of the illusion. Due to the show&#x27;s cancellation after just two episodes had been aired, episode 8 was never completed and the footage of Copperfield&#x27;s performances remains unseen.

In August 2009, Copperfield took his show to Australia.

In January 2011 Copperfield joined the cast of the feature film &quot;Burt Wonderstone&quot; with Steve Carell, Jim Carrey, James Gandolfini and Olivia Wilde. Copperfield and his team developed illusions used in the film. He also coached Carell and Wilde on how to perform the &#x27;Impossible Sawing&#x27; illusion, in which Wilde&#x27;s character is sawed in half and her halves separated without the use of any covering or camera tricks. Copperfield has served as technical advisor on several other films, including &quot;The Prestige&quot; and &quot;Now You See Me&quot;. He also served as a co-producer of the film &quot;Now You See Me 2&quot;.

In July 2012, OWN-TV network aired a one-hour special and interview with Copperfield as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Next Chapter&quot; series. The show featured many aspects of Copperfield&#x27;s personal life and family—with tours of his island home and Las Vegas conjuring museum—and a sampling of his illusions and magic effects. During the interview, he and his girlfriend Chloé Gosselin, a French fashion model, announced their engagement and appeared together briefly with their young daughter, strolling down the beach on the island.

In 2018, the New York Historical Society hosted “Summer of Magic: Treasures from the David Copperfield Collection.” The exhibit recounted the history of magic in New York and displayed some of Copperfield’s most popular illusions, like the Death Saw, and historical magical ephemera, including some of Copperfield’s collection of Houdini memorabilia.

Copperfield made the missing star from the original Star-Spangled Banner flag reappear in an illusion on Flag Day 2019, in partnership with Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History. The missing star, which is believed to have been removed in the nineteenth century, reappeared inside a box that seemed to levitate.

Copperfield notes that his role models were not magicians, that &quot;My idols were Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and Orson Welles and Walt Disney ... they took their individual art forms and they moved people with them... I wanted to do the same thing with magic. I wanted to take magic and make it romantic and make it sexy and make it funny and make it goofy ... all the different things that a songwriter gets to express or a filmmaker gets to express&quot;. This approach, despite its obvious popularity with audiences, has its share of detractors within the profession. One magician has described Copperfield&#x27;s stage presentations as &quot;resembling entertainment the way Velveeta resembles cheese&quot;.

=== International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts ===
Copperfield owns the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, which houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of historically significant magic memorabilia, books and artifacts. Begun in 1991 when Copperfield purchased the Mulholland Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts, which contained the world&#x27;s largest collection of Houdini memorabilia, the museum comprises approximately 80,000 items, including Houdini&#x27;s Water Torture Cabinet and Metamorphosis Trunk, Orson Welles&#x27; Buzz Saw illusion, and automata created by Robert-Houdin. Copperfield&#x27;s 1991 Mulholland purchase, which formed the core of his collection, engendered criticism from some magicians. One told a reporter, &quot;David Copperfield buying the Mulholland Library is like an Elvis impersonator winding up with Graceland.&quot; In 1992, Copperfield agreed to purchase the largest private magic collection in the world from Dr. Robert Albo to add to the museum. It houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of &quot;Houdiniana&quot; (the second largest being Houdini Museum of New York).

The museum is not open to the public; tours are reserved for &quot;colleagues, fellow magicians, and serious collectors&quot;. Located in a warehouse at Copperfield&#x27;s headquarters in Las Vegas, the museum is entered via a secret door in what described by &quot;Forbes&quot; as a &quot;mail-order lingerie warehouse&quot;. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t need to be secret, it needs to be respected&quot;, Copperfield said. &quot;If a scholar or journalist needs a piece of magic history, it&#x27;s there.&quot;

=== Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay ===
In 2006, Copperfield bought eleven Bahamian islands called Musha Cay. Renamed &quot;The Islands of Copperfield Bay&quot;, the islands are a private resort. Guests have reportedly included Oprah Winfrey and John Travolta. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was married there. Copperfield has said that the islands may contain the Fountain of Youth, a claim that resulted in him receiving a Dubious Achievement Award from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 2006.

=== &quot;Magic Underground&quot; restaurant ===
David Copperfield&#x27;s Magic Underground was planned to be a restaurant based on Copperfield&#x27;s magic. At Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, a sign on Hollywood Boulevard during the late 1990s indicated the restaurant was coming soon. Signs also appeared around Pleasure Island and outside Disney-MGM Studios. A Magic Underground restaurant was also to open in New York&#x27;s Times Square. Plans included eventual expansion into Disneyland in Anaheim, California, as well as Paris and Tokyo. The restaurants were to have magic props and other items on the walls; magicians would go around to tables doing sleight of hand tricks. There was also to be a larger stage for larger stunts. The restaurant in Times Square was 85% completed, but amid disputes between the creative team and the financial team and enormous cost overruns, finances dried up from the investors, the project was canceled, and Disney canceled the lease. Copperfield was not an investor in the project; the investors reportedly lost $34 million, and subcontractors placed $15 million in liens.

=== Recorded message for expanded gambling in Maryland ===
In October 2012, Maryland residents received a robocall from Copperfield supporting a ballot initiative that would expand gambling in the state.

=== Copperfield&#x27;s Secrets on the Moon ===
Copperfield&#x27;s magic secrets and related technological innovations are etched into nickel plates, designed to last billions of years, as part of the Arch Mission Foundation &quot;lunar library&quot; that crashed into the moon in April 2019 during an attempted landing of the lunar module Beresheet. It is believed the payload survived.

=== Accidents and injuries ===
On March 11, 1984, while rehearsing an illusion called &quot;Escape From Death&quot; where he was shackled and handcuffed in a tank of water, Copperfield became tangled in the chains and started taking in water and banging into the sides of the tank. He was pulled from the water after 80 seconds, hyperventilating and in shock, taken to a Burbank hospital, and found to have pulled tendons in arms and legs. He was in a wheelchair for a week and used a cane for a period thereafter.

While doing a rope trick at a show in Memphis in 1989, Copperfield accidentally cut off the tip of his finger with sharp scissors. He was rushed to the hospital and the fingertip was reattached.

On December 17, 2008, during a live performance in Las Vegas, a 26-year-old assistant named Brandon was sucked into the spinning blades of a high industrial fan that Copperfield walks through. The assistant sustained multiple fractures to his arm, severe bleeding, and facial lacerations that required stitches. Copperfield canceled the rest of the performance and offered the audience members refunds.

=== Magic as an art form ===
Since 2016, Copperfield has campaigned for Congressional Resolution 642, which would “recognize magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure&quot;. The campaign has been unsuccessful as of November 2022.

=== Las Vegas residency ===
, Copperfield performs daily, with 15 shows scheduled each week, at the David Copperfield theater in the MGM Grand Las Vegas. Each show is 90 minutes in duration.

== Litigation ==
On July 11, 1994, Copperfield sued magician and author Herbert L. Becker in order to prevent publication of Becker&#x27;s book which reveals how magicians perform their illusions. Becker won the lawsuit but, because of a secrecy agreement Becker signed with Copperfield and an independent finding that Becker&#x27;s description of Copperfield&#x27;s methods was inaccurate, the publisher removed the section on Copperfield from the book before publication. In 1997, Becker sued Copperfield and Lifetime Books for $50 million for breach of contract between himself and Lifetime Books, the publisher of his book &quot;All the Secrets of Magic Revealed&quot;. Copperfield settled at the last moment and the publisher lost during the court trial.

In 1997, Copperfield and Claudia Schiffer sued &quot;Paris Match&quot; for $30 million after the magazine claimed their relationship was a sham, that Schiffer was paid for pretending to be Copperfield&#x27;s fiancée and that she did not even like him. In 1999, they won an undisclosed sum and a retraction from &quot;Paris Match&quot;. Copperfield&#x27;s publicist confirmed that Schiffer had a contract to appear in the audience at Copperfield&#x27;s show in Berlin where they met, but was not under contract to be his &quot;consort&quot;.

On August 25, 2000, Copperfield unsuccessfully sued Fireman&#x27;s Fund Insurance Company for reimbursement of a $506,343 ransom paid to individuals in Russia who had commandeered the entertainer&#x27;s equipment there.

In 2004, John Melk, co-founder of Blockbuster Inc., and previous owner of Musha Cay, sued Copperfield for fraud after Copperfield purchased the island chain, alleging that Copperfield had deliberately obscured his identity during the purchase and that he would not have sold the island to Copperfield. Copperfield claimed that Melk had agreed to sell the property to Copperfield&#x27;s Imagine Nation Company, and that Copperfield negotiated the deal through a third party because he feared Melk was &quot;seeking to exploit&quot; Copperfield&#x27;s celebrity status by demanding an unfair price. The terms of the settlement are undisclosed.

On November 6, 2007, Viva Art International Ltd and Maz Concerts Inc. sued Copperfield for nearly $2.2 million for breach of contract and the Indonesian promoter of Copperfield&#x27;s canceled shows in Jakarta held on to $550,000 worth of Copperfield&#x27;s equipment in lieu of money paid to Copperfield that had not been returned. Copperfield countersued, and the dispute was resolved in July 2009.

In 2018, a lawsuit alleging that a British tourist and audience member Gavin Cox was injured during a November 2013 performance, was resolved in Copperfield&#x27;s favor. He was found &quot;not liable&quot;.

In August 2024, David Copperfield was sued by the board of the Galleria condominium in Manhattan, New York, for $2.5 million connected to the negligence and damage of his unit that threatens the building&#x27;s structural integrity.

=== Sexual assault allegations ===
Copperfield was accused of sexual assault in 2007 by Lacey L. Carroll. A federal grand jury in Seattle closed the investigation in January 2010 without bringing charges. In January 2010, the Bellevue City Prosecutor&#x27;s Office brought misdemeanor charges against Carroll for prostitution and allegedly lying to police in another case. Carroll filed a civil lawsuit against Copperfield, which was dropped in April 2010. In January 2018, Copperfield was accused of drugging and assaulting a teenager in 1988. Copperfield published a statement in response on January 24, 2018. 

In January 2024, Copperfield&#x27;s name was listed as one of the associates of American financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In May 2024, it was revealed that Copperfield met with Epstein at least three times, and that Copperfield called and left messages for Epstein 16 times between 2004 and 2005, though lawyers for Copperfield insist that Copperfield &quot;was not a friend of Jeffrey Epstein&quot; and that he &quot;never&quot; called Epstein personally. Johanna Sjoberg, a woman who later accused Epstein of abusing her, claimed that she met Copperfield at a dinner at Epstein&#x27;s house in 2004 during which Copperfield asked her if she &quot;was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls,&quot; though lawyers for Copperfield claim that the question was merely posed out of &quot;concern&quot; for Sjoberg.

In May 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an investigation in which 16 women accused Copperfield of engaging in sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior, with the alleged incidents spanning a time range from the late 1980s to 2014. The allegations include claims that Copperfield drugged three women before having sexual relations with them, and more than half of the allegations were from women who were under 18 at the time of the alleged incidents. In response, lawyers for Copperfield called the allegations &quot;false and entirely without foundation.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1993 at a Berlin celebrity gala Copperfield met German supermodel Claudia Schiffer when he brought her on stage to participate in a mind-reading act and his flying illusion, and in January 1994 they became engaged. During the engagement, Schiffer sometimes appeared on stage with Copperfield to act as his special guest assistant in illusions including being sawn in half. She also appeared alongside Copperfield in &quot;David Copperfield: 15 Years of Magic&quot; (1994), a documentary in which she played the role of a reporter interviewing him, and at the end of which they reprised their performance of the &quot;Flying&quot; illusion. After a nearly six-year engagement, in September 1999 they announced their separation, citing work schedules.

In 1997, Copperfield purchased a 16,000-square-foot, quadruplex penthouse in New York City, originally built for Stewart R. Mott, for $7.4 million. In 2015, a valve failed in the pump room that had machinery for the lap pool in the penthouse, and water flooded his penthouse apartment as well as multiple floors of the New York City apartment building on East 57th Street. According to a lawsuit against him, “Copperfield abandoned the unit in or about 2018,” laying off a housekeeper, a house manager and a handyman. 

In April 2006, he and two female assistants were robbed at gunpoint after a performance in West Palm Beach, Florida. His assistants handed over their money, passports, and a cell phone. According to his police statement, Copperfield did not hand over anything, claiming that he used sleight of hand to hide his possessions, although later admitting that doing so was &quot;a reflex that could have got me shot.&quot; One of the assistants wrote down most of the license plate number, and the suspects were later arrested, charged, and sentenced.

Copperfield&#x27;s girlfriend Chloé Gosselin, a French fashion model 28 years his junior, gave birth to his daughter in 2010. Copperfield has two other children, a son and a daughter.

In July 2016, Copperfield purchased a mansion at 1625 Enclave Court in Las Vegas&#x27;s affluent Summerlin community for $17.55 million.

== Earnings ==
&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine reported that Copperfield earned $55 million in 2003, making him the 10th highest paid celebrity in the world (earnings figures are pre-tax and before deductions for agents&#x27; and attorneys&#x27; fees, etc.). He earned $57 million in 2004 and 2005, and $30 million in 2009 in entertainment earnings, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;. Copperfield performs over 500 shows per year throughout the world.

== Charitable activities ==
In March 1982, Copperfield founded Project Magic, a rehabilitation program to help disabled patients regain lost or damaged dexterity skills by using sleight of hand as physical therapy. The program has been accredited by the American Occupational Therapy Association, and is in use in over 1,100 hospitals in 30 countries. Copperfield made an appearance on Oprah Radio in April 2008 to talk with host Dr. Mehmet Oz about how magic can help disabled people.

In 2007, he organized and performed at a charity show for UNICEF in Los Angeles, along with a number of celebrity guests. During the show, he used his ex-Orson Welles Buzz Saw illusion to saw British TV presenter Cat Deeley in half.

Copperfield organized relief efforts after Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in 2019, using his own plane to fly in supplies.

<text>Canadian Airlines International Ltd. (stylized as Canadi›n Airlines or Canadi‹n Airlines, or simply Canadian) was a major Canadian airline that operated from 1987 until 2001. The airline was Canada&#x27;s second largest airline after Air Canada, carrying more than 11.9 million passengers to over 160 destinations in 17 countries on five continents at its height in 1996. Canadian Airlines served 105 destinations in Canada, more than any other airline. It was a founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance.

Canadian Airlines was headquartered in Calgary, and had revenue of approximately $3 billion at the end of 1999. The airline and its aircraft were acquired by Air Canada in 2000, and the merger was officially completed on January 1, 2001.

==History==

Canadian Airlines International was the principal subsidiary of Canadian Airlines Corporation. The new airline was formed on March 27, 1987, when Pacific Western Airlines purchased Canadian Pacific Air Lines, which in turn had recently acquired Eastern Provincial Airways and Nordair.

In 1989, Canadian Airlines acquired Wardair, giving it access to new routes including long-sought-after routes to the UK and Europe. Its major hubs were at Montréal-Dorval International Airport (now known as Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport), Toronto Pearson International Airport, Vancouver International Airport and Calgary International Airport.

Canadian Airlines streamlined its operations and went through the financial restructuring of over $700 million in debt, after the 1991 airline industry slump. It was further aided by an injection of cash from the American Airlines Group.

On November 1, 1996, Kevin Benson, then president and CEO, unveiled a restructuring strategy to improve the profitability of Canadian Airlines International. The operational restructuring plan was supposed to be phased in over a four-year period, addressing the main issues of cost control, revenue growth, capitalization and fleet renewal. It was also one of the founding members of the Oneworld airline alliance, along with American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Qantas. The plan started off well but with the effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, air traffic decreased and Canadian suffered heavy losses on previously profitable trans-Pacific routes.

Canadian Plus was the largest frequent flyer program in Canada with more than 60 airline, hotel, car rental, and financial partners worldwide. The program had more than three million members.

In its last few years of operation, Canadian Airlines extended its international route network in Asia, with the most recent expansion of service to the Philippines, which gave it seven destinations in Asia. At that time Canadian Airlines had the distinction of flying to more places in Asia with more frequency than any other Canadian carrier.

Canadian Airlines&#x27; core business strategy focused on building its Vancouver hub into the leading gateway between North America and Asia. It leveraged its codesharing agreement with American Airlines in order to help capture a greater share of U.S.-Asia traffic flows.

===Onex bid and Air Canada takeover===

On August 20, 1999, Air Canada proposed a financial offer to Canadian Airlines which would see Canadian&#x27;s international routes and airport slots sold to Air Canada for an undisclosed amount. Canadian Airlines would be relegated to be a regional carrier providing a feeder network to Air Canada. This offer was rejected. This financial offer evolved from a merger proposal between Canadian Airlines and Air Canada which had been ongoing since early 1999.

The proposed merger was backed by American Airlines, who had already owned a 25% stake in Canadian Airlines, the maximum allowed under Canadian foreign ownership restrictions. Then-American CEO Donald Carty, who had formerly headed Canadian predecessor Canadian Pacific Air Lines, planned to acquire a controlling interest in the enlarged Air Canada, with the purpose of moving it from the Star Alliance to Oneworld alliance. American Airlines was unsuccessfully lobbying Canadian federal government to ease foreign ownership restrictions on Canadian airlines. Afterwards, American sold its shares in Air Canada as the company decided to change its corporate strategy regarding the Canadian aviation market.

Four days later, on August 24, 1999, Onex Corporation announced a takeover bid for Canadian Airlines, backed by American Airlines&#x27;s parent company AMR Corporation, consisting of $1.8B in cash and the assumption of $3.9B in debt. Canadian Airlines announced that it would support this and recommend acceptance from its shareholders. Air Canada rejected the offer. On August 31, 1999, Air Canada adopted a poison pill aimed at thwarting any takeover bid.

On October 19, 1999, Air Canada, backed by Star Alliance partners Lufthansa, United Airlines and CIBC announced a $930M counter bid to the Onex offer. Air Canada offered $92M for Canadian Airlines and committed to running it as a separate company. On November 2, Air Canada increased its offer to $16 per share to buy back 36.4 percent of the airline.

On November 5, 1999, a Quebec judge ruled that the Onex takeover was illegal, breaking the law that stipulates that no more than 10 percent of the company can be controlled by a single shareholder. Onex subsequently withdrew its offer and Air Canada stated it would proceed with the takeover of Canadian Airlines. 

On December 4, the board of directors at Canadian Airlines recommended the $92M merger offer from Air Canada to the shareholders. The offer from Air Canada originally expired at 5pm on December 7, 1999, but Air Canada extended their offer until December 23, 1999. Air Canada officially took control of Canadian Airlines, pending government approval, on December 8, 1999. The Federal Competition Bureau cleared the way for the takeover on December 21, 1999 and Canadian Airlines officially became a subsidiary of Air Canada on December 23, 1999.

Canadian Airlines operated as a subsidiary company through most of 2000. In October 2000, all of Canadian Airlines&#x27; systems and employees became fully integrated. With both companies fully integrated, Air Canada began massive cuts to employees starting with the announcement that there would be 3500 cuts in the workforce on December 22, 2000. September 26, 2001 saw an additional 5000 cuts primarily driven from the worldwide impact to the travel sector caused by the 9/11 attacks.

At the time of merger, Canadian Airlines carried over 40% of the domestic share of passengers in Canada. Following the completion of the acquisition, Air Canada controlled over 90% of the domestic share of passengers, and dominated international and US-Canada transborder traffic.

==Internet presence==
Canadian Airlines has the distinction of being the first airline in the world to have a website on the Internet (www.cdnair.ca). The website was launched in April 1994 and is recognized in the Canadian Internet Handbook 1994 and 1995 editions. It was given recognition for not only being the first airline website in the world but also the first with transactional capabilities such as flight arrival/departure and fare information. At the time, this fact was widely reported by Canadian media including CBC Venture and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Magazine. The website was created by and credited to Grant Fengstad who at the time was leading a strategy to demonstrate that the Internet was going to revolutionize the travel sector.

== Livery ==

Upon its founding in 1987, Canadian Airlines revealed its new livery using the colours light grey, dark grey, navy blue, and red. The paint scheme was an adaptation of the recently introduced livery from predecessor Canadian Pacific Airlines. The lower half of the aircraft&#x27;s body was navy blue, topped with light grey and red stripes, while the tail was blue, with approximately one third taken up by the carrier&#x27;s new logo. The new Canadian Airlines logo was a combination of Canadian Pacific&#x27;s five grey stripes, representing the five continents served by the carrier. Over these stripes was a thick, bright red chevron. The chevron was a simplification of the Pacific Western Airlines logo. The chevron was placed over the stripes, which then represented &quot;Wings over 5 continents&quot;. It was also an ingenious and subtle way to represent the takeover of CP by PWA. The same logo, in a square form, became a clever alternative to a true bilingual name on the fuselage replacing the French &quot;e&quot;, and the third &quot;a&quot; in English (Canadian/).

Canadian adopted a short-lived new livery in January 1999, less than a year before the airline was merged into Air Canada. The livery, known as &quot;Proud Wings&quot;, featured a large Canada goose painted at the tail of the aircraft and the airline&#x27;s name in a new Celeste font. This new font included a new chevron character, to again replace the French &quot;e&quot;, and third &quot;a&quot; in English (Canadian/). The new livery, however, came so late that most of the fleet still retained the existing chevron livery by the time of the merger. Until the merger process with Air Canada was completed in 2001, most Canadian aircraft featured a transition livery with an Air Canada maple leaf on the tail while retaining the name &quot;Canadian&quot; on the fuselage.

* Canadian Regional Airlines, which served 69 destinations in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Ontario, and the United States. Canadian Regional was 100 percent owned by Canadian Airlines. The predecessors of Canadian Regional were Time Air (which operated Canadian Partner service) and Ontario Express.
* Calm Air which served 27 destinations in Manitoba, northwestern Ontario, and the Northwest Territories. Calm Air was 45 percent owned by Canadian Regional and continues to operate under separate management. 
* Inter-Canadien served Ottawa, Toronto, Labrador, and 26 destinations throughout Quebec. Inter-Canadien was 100 percent owned by Canadian Regional.
* Air Atlantic, a regional partner of Canadian Airlines, served 16 destinations throughout the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario, and the United States.

Canadian North had a network of 10 destinations that expanded from its southern bases of Edmonton and Winnipeg. Canadian North also had a commercial agreement with Aklak Air, an Inuit-owned and operated airline in the Northwest Territories. Canadian North was sold in 1998 to Norterra and continues to operate as an independent airline.

In addition to flight providers, Canadian Airlines operated the largest tour operator in Canada called Canadian Holidays and the Canadian Getaways program. The operator flew to destinations which included destinations throughout North and South America. Their freight operation, Canadian Air Cargo, provided general air cargo services in Canada and the United States.

==Media appearances==
In 1994, the Canadian Children&#x27;s show &quot;Mighty Machines&quot; filmed one of their episodes (Mighty Machines at the Airport) at Toronto Pearson International Airport, starring a couple of Canadian Airlines jets (a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, a Boeing 737-200 and an Airbus A320) and several other of the carrier&#x27;s vehicles.

In the 1996 film &quot;Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San Francisco&quot;, the family is flying to Canada on Canadian Airlines when the pets escape. The pets then chase after the Canadian Airlines jet and sit on the runway as the Canadian 737 takes off over their heads. During this scene many other Canadian Airlines planes are visible. The scene, while supposed to be at San Francisco International Airport, was actually filmed at the Abbotsford International Airport in Abbotsford, British Columbia.

<doc id="281260" wikidata="Q64286159" url="?curid=281260" title="Protogalaxy">
<text>In physical cosmology, a protogalaxy, which could also be called a &quot;primeval galaxy&quot;, is a cloud of gas which is forming into a galaxy. It is believed that the rate of star formation during this period of galactic evolution will determine whether a galaxy is a spiral or elliptical galaxy; a slower star formation tends to produce a spiral galaxy. The smaller clumps of gas in a protogalaxy form into stars.

The term &quot;protogalaxy&quot; itself is generally accepted to mean &quot;Progenitors of the present day (normal) galaxies, in the early stages of formation.&quot; However, the &quot;early stages of formation&quot; is not a clearly defined phrase. It could be defined as: &quot;The first major burst of star formation in a progenitor of a present day elliptical galaxy&quot;; &quot;The peak merging epoch of dark halos of the fragments which assemble to produce an average galaxy today&quot;; &quot;A still gaseous body before any star formation has taken place.&quot;; or &quot; an over-dense region of dark matter in the very early universe, destined to become gravitationally bound and to collapse.&quot;

==Formation==

It is thought that the early universe began with a nearly uniform distribution (each particle an equal distance from the next) of matter and dark matter. The dark matter then began to clump together under gravitational attraction due to the initial density perturbation spectrum caused by quantum fluctuations. This derives from Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle which shows that there can be tiny temporary changes in the amount of energy in empty space. Particle/antiparticle pairs can form from this energy through mass–energy equivalence, and gravitational pull causes other nearby particles to move towards it, disturbing the even distribution and creating a centre of gravity, pulling nearby particles closer. When this happens at the universe&#x27;s present size it is negligible, but the state of these tiny fluctuations as the universe began expanding from a single point left an impression which scaled up as the universe expanded, resulting in large areas of increased density. The gravity of these denser clumps of dark matter then caused nearby matter to start falling into the denser region. This sort of process was reportedly observed and analysed by Nilsson et al. in 2006. This resulted in the formation of clouds of gas, predominantly hydrogen, and the first stars began to form within these clouds. These clouds of gas and early stars, many times smaller than our galaxy, were the first protogalaxies.
The established theory is that the groups of small protogalaxies were attracted together by gravity and collided, which resulted in the formation of the much larger &quot;adult&quot; galaxies we have today. This follows the process of hierarchical assembly, which is an ongoing process where larger bodies are continually formed from the merging of smaller ones.

==Properties==

===Composition===
Since there had been no previous star formation to create other elements, protogalaxies would have been made up almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. The hydrogen would bond to form H2 molecules, with some exceptions. This would change as star formation began and produced more elements through the process of nuclear fusion.

===Mechanics===
Once a protogalaxy begins to form, all particles bound by its gravity begin to free fall towards it. The time taken for this free-fall to conclude can be approximated using the free-fall equations. Most galaxies have completed this free-fall stage to become stable elliptical or disk galaxies, the disks taking longer to fully form. The formation of galaxy clusters takes much longer and is still in progress now. This stage is also where galaxies acquire most of their angular momentum. A protogalaxy acquires this due to gravitational influence from neighbouring dense clumps in the early universe, and the further the gas is away from the centre, the more spin it gets.

===Luminosity===
The luminosity of protogalaxies comes from two sources. First and foremost is the radiation from nuclear fusion of Hydrogen into helium in early stars. This early burst of star formation is thought to have made a protogalaxy&#x27;s luminosity comparable to a present-day starburst galaxy or a quasar. The other is the release of excess gravitational binding energy.
The primary wavelength expected from a protogalaxy is a variety of UV called Lyman-alpha, which is the wavelength emitted by Hydrogen gas when it is ionised by radiation from a star.

==Detection==
Protogalaxies can theoretically still be seen today, as the light from the farthest reaches of the universe takes a very long time to reach Earth, in some places long enough that we see them at the stage where they are populated by protogalaxies.
There have been many attempts to find protogalaxies with telescopes over the last 30 years because of the value of such a discovery in confirming how galaxies form, but the sheer distance any light would have to travel for it to be old enough to come from a protogalaxy is very large. This, coupled with the fact that the Lyman-alpha wavelength is quite readily absorbed by dust, made some astronomers think protogalaxies may be too faint to detect.

In 1996, a protogalaxy candidate was discovered by Yee et al. using the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC). The object was a disk-like galaxy at high redshift with a very high luminosity. It was later debated that the incredible luminosity was caused by the gravitational lensing of a foreground galactic cluster.

In 2006, K. Nilsson et al. reported finding a &quot;blob&quot; emitting Lyman alpha UV radiation. Analysis concluded that this was a giant cloud of hydrogen gas falling onto a clump of dark matter in the early universe, creating a protogalaxy.

In 2007, Michael Rauch et al. were using the VLT to search for a signal from intergalactic gas, when they spotted dozens of discrete objects emitting large amounts of the Lyman-alpha type UV radiation. They concluded that these 27 objects were examples of protogalaxies from 11 billion years ago.

<text>Viswanathan&quot;Vishy&quot;Anand (born 11 December 1969) is an Indian chess grandmaster. Anand is a five-time World Chess Champion, a two-time World Rapid Chess Champion and a two-time Chess World Cup Champion. He became the first grandmaster from India in 1988, and he has the eighth-highest peak FIDE rating of all time. In 2022, he was the elected Deputy President of FIDE. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential players in the history of the game and has had an important role in popularizing it in India.

Anand defeated Alexei Shirov in a six-game match to win the 2000 FIDE World Chess Championship, a title he held until 2002. He became the undisputed world champion in 2007 and defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2008, Veselin Topalov in 2010, and Boris Gelfand in 2012. In 2013, he lost the title to challenger Magnus Carlsen, and he lost a rematch to Carlsen in 2014 after winning the 2014 Candidates Tournament.

In April 2006, Anand became the fourth player in history to pass the 2800 Elo mark on the FIDE rating list, after Kramnik, Topalov, and Garry Kasparov. He occupied the number-one position for 21 months, the sixth-longest period on record.

Known for his rapid playing speed as a child, Anand earned the sobriquet &quot;Lightning Kid&quot; during his early career in the 1980s. He has since developed into a universal player, and many consider him the greatest rapid chess player of his generation. He won the FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship in 2003 and 2017, the World Blitz Cup in 2000, and numerous other top-level rapid and blitz events.

Anand was the first recipient of the Khel Ratna Award in 1991–92, India&#x27;s highest sporting honour. In 2007, he was awarded India&#x27;s second-highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, making him the first sportsperson to receive the award.

== Early life ==
Viswanathan Anand was born on 11 December 1969 in Mayiladuthurai, Tamil Nadu, India . He later moved to Chennai, where he grew up. His father Viswanathan Iyer was a general manager in the Southern Railways who had studied in Jamalpur, Bihar; and his mother, Sushila, was a housewife, chess aficionado, and an influential socialite.

Anand is the youngest of three children. He is 11 years younger than his sister, and 13 years younger than his brother. His brother, Shivakumar, is a manager at Crompton Greaves in India. His sister, Anuradha, is a professor at the University of Michigan.

Anand started learning chess from age six from his mother, but he learned the intricacies of the game in Manila, where he lived with his parents from 1978 through the 1980s while his father was contracted as a consultant by the Philippine National Railways.

Anand was educated at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chennai, and has a Bachelor of Commerce from Loyola College, Chennai.

== Personal life ==
Anand married Aruna in 1996 and has a son, born on 9 April 2011, named in the traditional patronymic way Anand Akhil.

Anand is Hindu and stated that he visits temples to enjoy the tranquility and joy they symbolize. He has credited his daily prayers with helping him achieve a &quot;heightened state of mind&quot; that helps him focus better when playing chess.

In August 2010, Anand joined the board of directors of Olympic Gold Quest, a foundation for promoting and supporting India&#x27;s elite sportspersons and potential young talent. On 24 December 2010, he was the guest of honour on the grounds of Gujarat University, where 20,486 players created a new world record of simultaneous chess play at a single venue.

His hobbies are reading, swimming, and listening to music.

Anand has been regarded as an unassuming person with a reputation for refraining from political and psychological ploys and instead focusing on his game. This has made him a well-liked figure throughout the chess world for two decades, evidenced by the fact that Kasparov, Kramnik, and Carlsen, all of whom were rivals for the world championship during Anand&#x27;s career, each aided him in his preparations for the 2010 World Chess Championship. Anand is sometimes known as the &quot;Tiger of Madras&quot;.

Anand was the only sportsperson invited to the dinner Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hosted for US President Barack Obama on 7 November 2010.

Anand was denied an honorary doctorate from University of Hyderabad because of confusion over his citizenship status; India&#x27;s Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal later apologised and said, &quot;There is no issue on the matter as Anand has agreed to accept the degree at a convenient time depending on his availability&quot;. According to &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Anand finally declined to accept the doctorate.

On 26 May 2015, Anand&#x27;s mother died at age 79. On 15 April 2021, Anand&#x27;s father died at age 92.

== Early chess career ==
Anand&#x27;s rise in the Indian chess world was meteoric. National success came early for him when he won the sub-junior championship with a score of 9/9 points in 1983, at age 14. In 1984 Anand won the Asian Junior Championship in Coimbatore, earning an International Master (IM) norm in the process. Soon afterward, he participated in the 26th Chess Olympiad, in Thessaloniki, where he made his debut on the Indian national team. There, Anand scored 7½ points in 11 games, gaining his second IM norm. In 1985 he became the youngest Indian to achieve the title of International Master, at age 15, by winning the Asian Junior Championship for the second year in a row, this time in Hong Kong. At age 16, he became the national chess champion. He won that title two more times. He played games at blitz speed. In 1987, he became the first Indian to win the World Junior Chess Championship. In 1988, at age 18, he became India&#x27;s first grandmaster by winning the Shakti Finance International chess tournament held in Coimbatore, India. One of his notable successes in this tournament was his win against Russian grandmaster Efim Geller. He was awarded Padma Shri at age 18.
In the 1993 World Chess Championship cycle, Anand qualified for his first Candidates Tournament, winning his first match but narrowly losing his quarterfinal match to 1990 runner-up Anatoly Karpov.

In 1994–95, Anand and Gata Kamsky dominated the qualifying cycles for the rival FIDE and PCA world championships. In the FIDE cycle, Anand lost his second round (Candidates semifinal) match to Kamsky after leading early. Kamsky lost the 1996 FIDE championship match to Karpov.

In the 1995 PCA cycle, Anand won matches against Oleg Romanishin and Michael Adams without a loss, then avenged his FIDE loss by defeating Kamsky in the Candidates final. In 1995, he played the PCA World Chess Championship against Kasparov at New York City&#x27;s World Trade Center. After an opening run of eight draws (a record for the opening of a world championship match until 21 November 2018), Anand won game nine with a powerful exchange sacrifice, but then lost four of the next five. He lost the match 10½–7½.

In the 1998 FIDE cycle, FIDE granted Karpov, the reigning champion, direct seeding into the final against the winner of the seven-round single-elimination Candidates tournament. The psychological and physical advantage Karpov gained from this decision caused significant controversy, leading to Kramnik&#x27;s withdrawal from the tournament. Anand won the tournament, defeating Adams in the final, and immediately faced Karpov for the championship. Despite this disadvantage for Anand, which he described as being &quot;brought in a coffin&quot; to play Karpov, the regular match ended 3–3, which led to a rapid playoff, which Karpov won 2–0. Karpov thus remained the FIDE champion.

=== Other results ===

Anand has won the Mainz Chess Classic, a Category 21 Championship, a record 11 times. In 2008, he defeated Carlsen en route to his 11th title in that event.

Anand is the first player to have won five titles of the Corus chess tournament. He is the first player to have won each of the Big Three supertournaments at the time: Corus (1989, 1998, 2003, 2004, 2006), Linares (1998, 2007, 2008), and Dortmund (1996, 2000, 2004).

Anand has a stellar record at the annual Melody Amber Tournament (2 separate and unique Blindfold and Rapid Chess supertournaments played): he has 5 overall prizes (winning in 1994, 1997, 2003, 2005, and 2006), and has the most &quot;rapidplay&quot; titles, winning 9 times. He is also the only player to win the blind and rapid sections of the tournament in the same year (twice, in 1997 and 2005).

Anand won three consecutive Advanced Chess tournaments in Leon, Spain, after Kasparov introduced this form of chess in 1998, and is widely recognised as the world&#x27;s best Advanced Chess player, where players may consult a computer to aid in their calculation of variations.

Anand&#x27;s collection &quot;My Best Games of Chess&quot; was published in 1998 and updated in 2001. His individual tournament successes include the Corus chess tournament in 2006 (tied with Topalov), Dortmund in 2004, and Linares in 2007 and 2008. In 2007 he won the Grenkeleasing Rapid championship for the tenth time, defeating Levon Aronian. Just a few days before, Aronian had defeated Anand in the Chess960 final.

In March 2007, Anand won the Linares chess tournament and it was widely believed that he would be ranked world No. 1 in the FIDE Elo rating list for April 2007. But Anand was No. 2 on the initial list released because the Linares result was not included. FIDE subsequently announced that Linares would be included, pushing Anand to number one in the April 2007 list.

== World Chess Championships ==

=== 1995 ===
In 1993, the newly formed Professional Chess Association (PCA) held a 54-player, 11-round Swiss-style qualifying tournament in Groningen on 19–30 December, an equivalent of FIDE&#x27;s Interzonal. Anand scored 7½/11 to finish tied for first and secure a berth in the 1994 Candidates&#x27; Tournament. In the single-elimination tournament, Anand handily dispatched Adams and Oleg Romanishin in the quarterfinal and semifinal matches, held in New York City and Linares. Facing Kamsky in a 12-game final match held at Las Palmas, Anand lost Game 1 on time in a winning position but recovered with wins in Game 3, 9, and 11 to secure a 6½–4½ victory and a match against reigning champion Kasparov for the world chess championship. It was the first Candidates&#x27; Tournament victory of Anand&#x27;s career.

The 20-game championship match was held from 10 September to 16 October 1995 on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center in New York City. The match started with a then-record eight consecutive draws before Anand broke open the match in Game 9, pressing and eventually breaking through Kasparov&#x27;s Sicilian Defense with a powerful exchange sacrifice. But Anand scored just half a point in the next five games, losing twice to Kasparov&#x27;s Sicilian Dragon defence, and eventually conceded a 10½–7½ loss. Afterwards, Kasparov commented on Anand&#x27;s psychological approach to the match:


=== 1998 ===
In a radical departure from previous years, the 1998 world championship was a 100-player knockout tournament, with each round consisting of two-game matches and ties resolved by rapid and blitz games. Controversially, Karpov, the defending champion, was seeded directly into the final, held just three days after the conclusion of the three-week tournament. This format gave Karpov a significant advantage in rest time and preparation; Kasparov and Kramnik both declined to participate as a result. The latter explained his absence bluntly: &quot;Is it fair to expect Sampras to only play one match and defend his Wimbledon title?&quot;

As a result of Kasparov&#x27;s withdrawal, Anand entered the tournament in Groningen, Netherlands as the #1 seed. After dispatching future FIDE champion Alexander Khalifman in the third round, he scored quick victories over Zoltán Almási, Alexei Shirov, and Boris Gelfand to advance. In the final against ninth-seeded Michael Adams, held on 30 December, both players drew their first four games. A visibly tired Anand, having played 21 games in 23 days, eventually prevailed in a sudden-death blitz game to secure a 3–2 victory.

Immediately after defeating Adams, Anand arranged a flight with his team to the International Olympic Committee museum in Lausanne, Switzerland to play Karpov in a six-game match for the FIDE world title. With just four hours of pre-match preparation, Anand lost Game 1 after Karpov surprised him with a bold queen sacrifice on the 31st move. But he won Game 2 in 42 moves from a disadvantaged position after accepting a sharp exchange sacrifice and outplaying Karpov in the resulting endgame. After losing Game 4, Anand entered the final game of the match needing a win to force the match into a playoff. Playing white, he opened with the Trompowsky Attack. Karpov defended well until 28...Qd8?, a critical mistake that lost him a piece and the game.

In the first rapid playoff game, Anand secured a significant advantage on the board before a calculation mistake (40...a4?) cost him the game. Karpov then won the second game with black to seal a 5−3 victory and retain the FIDE title. After the match, Anand reiterated his concerns with the unfairness of the tournament format.

Karpov, meanwhile, questioned Anand&#x27;s temperament and remarked that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the character&quot; to win big games. For his part, Kasparov dismissed the match as between &quot;a tired player and an old player&quot;.

=== 2000 ===
From 25 November to 27 December 2000, the FIDE World Chess Championship was a 100-player single-elimination tournament in New Delhi, India and Tehran, Iran. After winning the 2000 FIDE World Cup, Anand entered the event as the #1 overall seed and one of the favourites to win alongside Topalov, Gelfand, and Shirov. Anand decided to join the event after skipping the 1999 edition, due to ongoing negotiations for a title match with Kasparov that ultimately fell through. Kasparov and Kramnik, who defeated Kasparov in a match for the lineal world title earlier in the year, did not participate in the event. Anand&#x27;s second and preparation partner for the tournament was Spanish grandmaster Elizbar Ubilava.

Enjoying boisterous home-crowd support, Anand moved through the early rounds with relatively little difficulty, notching quick wins against Viktor Bologan, Smbat Lputian, and Bartłomiej Macieja. In the quarterfinals, he had four consecutive draws against defending champion Alexander Khalifman before winning a 15-minute tiebreak game to progress. Against Adams in the semifinals, Anand quickly drew Game 1 and took advantage of a positional blunder by Adams (20...c5?) to win Game 2 in 36 moves with white. Quick draws in games 3 and 4 then saw Anand through to the final match.

The final match played from 20 to 26 December 2000 in Tehran, pitted Anand against fourth-seeded Shirov, who was denied a chance to play Kasparov for the world title two years earlier. After a draw in Game 1, Anand entered a sharp line in the Ruy Lopez in Game 2, ultimately converting a passed pawn into a winning endgame after placing Shirov in zugzwang on move 41. Anand then seized control of the match with a 41-move win in Game 3 after neutralizing a rook sacrifice by Shirov on move 19, and sealed victory in the match with another win in Game 4.

Anand&#x27;s run to his first world championship saw him go unbeaten through the entire tournament, with eight wins and 12 draws. With the win, he became the first world champion from east Asia and the first world champion from outside the ex-Soviet Union since Bobby Fischer. In addition to the title of FIDE world champion, Anand received a $528,000 cash prize. Upon returning to India, Anand was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government in recognition of his victory. Later, he gave his thoughts on his matches against Khalifman and Shirov:


=== 2005 ===
In 2005, Anand finished in a tie for second place at the 2005 FIDE World Chess Championship, won by Topalov.

=== 2007 ===
The finish of the 2005 World Chess Championship qualified Anand for the 2007 championship, an eight-player double round-robin tournament held in Mexico City from 12 to 30 September 2007. In 2006, Kramnik took Topalov&#x27;s place in the event after his victory over the latter to reunify the world title. Anand entered the tournament as the world&#x27;s top-ranked player, and was considered a favourite to win alongside the defending champion Kramnik.

After a Round 1 draw, Anand drew first blood in the tournament, handily defeating Aronian with black in Round 2. After the fourth round, Anand and Kramnik were tied for the lead with 2½ each. But in the next three rounds, Anand separated himself from the pack with wins over Peter Svidler and Alexander Grischuk, taking the lead. He then held Kramnik to a draw in Round 10, and extended his lead to 1½ points with a 56-move win over Alexander Morozevich. In Round 13, Anand played precise defence and salvaged a lost rook endgame against Grischuk with black to retain his lead, and sealed the championship in the final round with a 20-move draw against Peter Leko. Anand&#x27;s performance in Mexico City saw him pick up four wins and 10 draws, and he finished as the only undefeated player in the tournament with a 2848 performance rating. This was his second world chess championship, and first since the reunification of the title in 2006. As a result, he gained nine rating points to break the 2800 Elo rating barrier for the second time in his career in October 2007. In the post-event press conference, Anand commented on his final game and his feelings on winning the tournament:

With the win, Anand became the first undisputed world champion to win the title in a tournament, rather than in match play, since Mikhail Botvinnik in 1948. In addition to the world title, Anand received a $390,000 cash prize.

=== 2008 ===
Anand convincingly defended the title against Kramnik in the 2008 World Chess Championship held on 14–29 October in Bonn, Germany. The winner was to be the first to score 6½ points in the 12-game match. Anand won by scoring 6½ points in 11 games, winning three of the first six games (two with black). After the tenth game, Anand led 6–4 and needed only a draw in either of the last two games to win the match. In Game 11, Kramnik played the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense. Once the players traded queens, Kramnik offered a draw after 24 moves since he had no winning chances in the endgame.

Of Anand&#x27;s win, Kasparov said, &quot;A great result for Anand and for chess. Vishy deserved the win in every way and I&#x27;m very happy for him. It will not be easy for the younger generation to push him aside... Anand out-prepared Kramnik completely. In this way, it reminded me of my match with Kramnik in London 2000. Like I was then, Kramnik may have been very well prepared for this match, but we never saw it.&quot; In 2010 Anand donated his gold medal to the charitable organisation The Foundation to be auctioned off for the benefit of underprivileged children.

=== 2010 ===

Before the 2010 World Chess Championship match with Topalov, Anand, who had been booked on the flight Frankfurt–Sofia on 16 April, was stranded due to the cancellation of all flights following the volcano ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull. He asked for a three-day postponement, which the Bulgarian organisers refused on 19 April. Anand reached Sofia on 20 April after a 40-hour road journey. Consequently, the first game was delayed by one day.

The match consisted of 12 games. In Game 1, Topalov defeated Anand in 30 moves with a very sharp attack that broke through Anand&#x27;s Grunfeld Defence. It was revealed afterwards that Topalov had found the line during his opening preparation with the help of a powerful supercomputer loaned to him by Bulgaria&#x27;s Defense Department. Anand quickly responded with a win in Game 2, employing a novelty out of the Catalan Opening that was not easily recognized by computers at the time (15. Qa3!?, followed by 16. bxa3!). Anand won with the Catalan again in Game 4, only to drop Game 8 and leave the score level once again. After 11 games the score was tied at 5½–5½. Anand won game 12 on the Black side of a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined to win the game and the match. Topalov chose to accept a pawn sacrifice by Anand, hoping to force a result and avoid a rapid chess tiebreak round. But after Topalov&#x27;s dubious 31st and 32nd moves, Anand used the sacrifice to obtain a strong attack against Topalov&#x27;s relatively exposed king. Topalov subsequently resigned, allowing Anand to retain the world championship.

=== 2012 ===
As a result of Anand&#x27;s victory in 2010, he defended his title in the 2012 World Chess Championship at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. His opponent was Boris Gelfand, the winner of the 2011 Candidates Matches. After losing Game 7 to Gelfand, Anand came back to win Game 8 in only 17 moves, the shortest decisive game in World Chess Championship history. The match was tied 6–6 after regular games with one win each. Anand won the rapid tiebreak 2½–1½ to win the match and retain his title. After the match, Russian president Vladimir Putin greeted Anand and Gelfand by calling both to his official residence.

=== 2013 ===
Anand lost his title in the 2013 World Chess Championship in Chennai. The winner was Magnus Carlsen, the winner of the 2013 Candidates Tournament. The first four games were drawn, but Carlsen won Games 5 and 6. Games 7 and 8 were drawn, and Carlsen won Game 9. On 22 November, Game 10 was drawn, making Carlsen the new world champion.

=== 2014 ===
Anand won the double round-robin FIDE Candidates tournament at Khanty-Mansiysk (13–30 March) and earned a rematch with Carlsen. He went through the tournament undefeated, winning his first-round game against Aronian, his third-round game against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, and his ninth-round game against Topalov. He drew all his other games, including his 12th-round game against Dmitry Andreikin, where Anand agreed to a draw in a complex but winning position. He faced Carlsen in the world championship match in Sochi, Russia, in November. Carlsen won the match 6½ to 4½ after 11 of 12 scheduled games.

=== FIDE World Rapid Chess Champion 2003 ===
In October 2003, the governing body of chess, FIDE, organised a rapid time control tournament in Cap d&#x27;Agde and billed it as the World Rapid Chess Championship. Each player had 25 minutes at the start of the game, with an additional ten seconds after each move. Anand won this event ahead of ten of the top 12 players in the world, beating Kramnik in the final. His main recent titles in this category are at Corsica (six years in a row from 1999 through 2005), Chess Classic (nine years in a row from 2000 through 2008), Leon 2005, Eurotel 2002, Fujitsu Giants 2002 and the Melody Amber (five times, and he won the rapid portion of Melody Amber seven times). In the Melody Amber 2007, Anand did not lose a single game in the rapid section, and scored 8½/11, two more than the runners-up, for a performance rating in the rapid section of 2939. In most tournament time control games that Anand plays, he has more time left than his opponent at the end of the game. He lost on time in one game, to Kamsky. Otherwise, he took advantage of the rule allowing players in time trouble to use dashes instead of move notation during the last four minutes only once, against Peter Svidler at the MTel Masters 2006.

=== FIDE World Rapid Chess Champion 2017 ===

Anand won the 2017 World Rapid Chess Championship, defeating Vladimir Fedoseev 2–0 in the final tiebreak after he, Fedoseev and Ian Nepomniachtchi tied for first with 10½/15 points. He won the tournament ahead of Carlsen, his first victory in a world championship since losing the classical championship to Carlsen in 2013.

== Post-2010 chess career ==

=== 2010 ===
* 2010 Sofia World Chess Championship: From 24 April – 11 May 2010, Anand participated in a World Championship match against Topalov. Topalov gained direct entry into a challengers match against Kamsky as compensation from FIDE for not gaining entry into the 2007 World Chess Championship cycle. Because Topalov defeated Kamsky, he earned the right to challenge Anand for the World Chess Championship title. The match was level after 11 games, with 2 wins apiece in Rounds 1, 2, 4, and 8. In Game 12, Anand defeated Topalov with Black and retained his title.

== Assessment ==
Lubomir Kavalek describes Anand as the most versatile world champion ever, pointing out that Anand is the only player to have won the world chess championship in tournament, match, and knockout format, as well as rapid time controls.

In an interview in 2011, Kramnik said about Anand: &quot;I always considered him to be a colossal talent, one of the greatest in the whole history of chess&quot;; and &quot;I think that in terms of play Anand is in no way weaker than Kasparov but he&#x27;s simply a little lazy, relaxed and only focuses on matches. In the last 5–6 years he&#x27;s made a qualitative leap that&#x27;s made it possible to consider him one of the great chess players.&quot; In an interview in 2020, Kramnik, while talking about his World Chess Championship match against Anand in 2008, mentioned: &quot;Vishy is such a great player and he was in a fantastic form. He was such a powerful force that I do not know who could have stopped him then. Even Kasparov could not have managed it.&quot;

FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov commented that Anand&#x27;s victory in the 2014 Candidates Tournament &quot;...proved that he is one of the strongest and greatest players of modern times&quot;.

In an interview in 2014, Alexander Grischuk said about Anand: &quot;I have to say that of all the players I&#x27;ve played against Anand has personally struck me as the strongest, of course after Kasparov.&quot;

<doc id="281418" wikidata="Q1755881" url="?curid=281418" title="Wholphin">
<text>A wholphin &quot;(portmanteau of whale and dolphin)&quot; is an extremely rare cetacean hybrid born from a mating of a female common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) with a male false killer whale (&quot;Pseudorca crassidens&quot;). The name implies a hybrid of whale and dolphin, though taxonomically, both are in the oceanic dolphin family, which is in the toothed whale clade. This type of hybrid was considered unexpected given the sometimes extreme size difference between a female common bottlenose dolphin (typically 2 meters long and 300 kilograms) and a male false killer whale (over 5 meters long and over 1,800 kg). Wholphins have been born in captivity and have also been reported in the wild.

Wholphins also exhibit physical and behavioural characteristics intermediate between those of their parent species. Since the false killer whale belongs to the family oceanic dolphin, while much larger than most dolphins, the wholphin becomes an exceptional example of hybrid vigour.

== Examples ==
The first recorded wholphin was born in a Tokyo SeaWorld in 1981; he died after 200 days.

The first wholphin in the United States and the first to survive was Kekaimalu, born at Sea Life Park in Hawaii on May 15, 1985; her name means &quot;from the peaceful ocean&quot;. Kekaimalu proved fertile when she gave birth at a very young age. John Blanchard, a trainer at Sea Life Park, has said about Kekaimalu: “The wholphin was darker than the other dolphins, and her nose looked like it was chopped off… [she] represented an unusual example of hybridization between two species of dolphin with markedly different sizes and appearances.”

In 1991, Kekaimalu gave birth, to her daughter, Pohaikealoha, with a unknown, male dolphin. For two years, she cared for the calf, but did not nurse it; it was hand-reared by trainers. Pohaikealoha died at age 9. On December 23, 2004, Kekaimalu had her third calf, daughter Kawili Kai, sired by a male bottlenose. The calf was nursed and was very playful. Only months after birth, it was the size of a one-year-old bottlenose dolphin. All three calves were three-quarters bottlenose dolphin and one-quarter false killer whale. Kekaimalu died on July 8, 2024 at the age of 39. Kawili Kai remains in captivity in Sea Life Park. 

===Family tree===



== Capabilities and behaviour ==
Wholphin behavior represents both parent species. They are intelligent, highly social, and can be trained to do complex tasks; shared traits of false killer whales and bottlenose dolphins alike. Captive wholphins have been observed to be playful and show a great deal of curiosity about their surroundings, the same as bottlenose dolphins. Despite being recorded in the wild, only a few confirmed sightings of wholphins have been seen in nature. Although natural sightings are improbable due to the differences in habitat preference and social structure between the parent species, this is not impossible.

== Exterior and physical description ==
Wholphins will also have mixed traits from their parents. They are mostly smaller in size compared to the false killer whales but larger than the bottlenose dolphins. Their coloring will be mostly a dark grey, with the body proportion and dental features falling between those of the two species. For example, wholphins do have more teeth than bottlenose dolphins but fewer than false killer whales on average, showing their hybrid nature.

<text>Daikin Park (originally Enron Field and formerly Astros Field and Minute Maid Park) is a retractable roof stadium in Houston, Texas, United States. It opened in 2000 and is the home ballpark of the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). The ballpark has a seating capacity of 41,168, which includes 5,197 club seats and 63 luxury suites with a natural grass playing field. It was built as a replacement for the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium ever built, which opened in 1965.

In 1909, during the time when West End Park was Houston&#x27;s premier residential area, the Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company commissioned the design of a new union station for the city from New York City–based architects Warren and Wetmore. The location called for the demolition of several structures of Houston prominence. Horace Baldwin Rice&#x27;s residence and Adath Yeshurun Congregation&#x27;s synagogue among other structures were removed.

With an original estimated cost of US$1 million, Union Station was constructed by the American Construction Company for an eventual total of five times that amount. Exterior walls were constructed of granite, limestone, and terracotta, while the interior used an extensive amount of marble. It was completed and opened on March 1, 1911. At the time, Houston, with 17 railways, was considered the main railroad hub of the Southern United States. This is also evident by the Seal of Houston, which prominently features a locomotive. Two more floors were added the following year.

The station served as the main inter-city passenger terminal for Houston for over seven decades thereafter. Passenger rail declined greatly after World War II, and the last regularly-scheduled train, the &quot;Lone Star&quot;, moved its service to Houston&#x27;s current Amtrak station on July 31, 1974. With this move, the building became only office space for the HB&amp;T as well as the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

On November 10, 1977, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service.

===Planning and funding===
In August 1995, Astros owner Drayton McLane, then leasing the Astrodome from Harris County, commented to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; that he was not in the market for a new ballpark. In reference to Pittsburgh&#x27;s Three Rivers Stadium and Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium, McLane noted, &quot;[...] I remember when those were built in the 1970s and those were as good a stadiums as there were. They were the most modern stadiums in the world, and now they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re all bad. That they can&#x27;t make a go of it without a new stadium. It helps, but there are other things involved.&quot;

Later that year, Houston&#x27;s NFL franchise and joint-tenant of the Astrodome, the Houston Oilers, announced they were leaving to Nashville, Tennessee in order to have a new stadium built for the team there. Citing a lack of adequate luxury boxes, in October, Astros vice-president Bob McClaren claimed that renovations to the Astrodome would help increase revenue. Drayton McLane pointed toward Astrodome renovations as necessary, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s 30 years old and not a lot of money has been spent to remodel it.&quot; According to the organization, the team was in danger of being sold to a Virginia businessman who was expected to move the Astros to the Washington D.C. area because of poor revenue.

In June 1996, University of Houston alumnus, BMC Software and San Diego Padres owner, John J. Moores, who wanted to own the next NFL franchise in Houston, met with Texas State Senator Mario Gallegos, Jr., and other local Hispanic leaders in regard to the future of a football-only Astrodome and a new baseball-only ballpark in Downtown Houston. Meanwhile, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels pieced together a plan to build a new ballpark next to the Astrodome in the Astrodomain. The Astros echoed the Astrodomain location sentiment because they believed construction time would be shorter. Eckels, who convinced then Mayor Bob Lanier of the lack of viability for the ballpark in a downtown location, was quoted as saying, &quot;They keep telling me about these miracles in other cities, but it doesn&#x27;t work in Houston [...] If we are going to put this stadium some place, let&#x27;s stick with a proven place.&quot; This plan was considered to be nearly finalized when the Astros and Harris County agreed to a US$250 million county-funded stadium whose overrun costs would be funded by the Astros.
In August 1996, Houston&#x27;s Union Station received a US$2 million grant from the Texas Transportation Commission for renovation in a separate project. Plans for the new ballpark&#x27;s location drastically changed by September mostly in response to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay&#x27;s input and pledge to substantially contribute to funding if placed downtown. It was at this time where the Union Station location was proposed by Lay. Upon an agreement among all of the leadership entities, the idea of a retractable roof stadium was confirmed for the new ballpark. A November referendum was planned for Harris County residents to approve the deal.

The Harris County referendum that took place on November 5, 1996, to help fund the ballpark passed by a narrow margin of 51% to 49%. In response to the referendum, during the 75th Texas Legislature Texas State Senator John Whitmire of Houston sponsored a bill supported by five of the six area Harris County senators that would create the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority. With companion House Bill 92 authored by Houston-born Representative Kim Brimer voted upon and adopted by both chambers, the authorization for creation of a sports authority was approved. It was signed into law by Governor George W. Bush on June 2, 1997. The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority would assist in financing for the new ballpark as well as allow for renovation of the Astrodome by allowing for special county-wide taxation of rental cars, tickets, parking, and hotel use.

In June 1997, with the ability to create a sports authority signed into law, concurrent votes of the Harris County Commissioners&#x27; Court and the Houston City Council to establish the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority on effective September 1, 1997. Its chairman and 12 other directors were jointly appointed by the Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge. The institution remains in existence today.

The ballpark was named &quot;Enron Field&quot; after a $100 million, 30-year naming rights deal was made with Enron on April 7, 1999. After the Enron scandal of 2001, the Astros and the now-bankrupt Enron came to an agreement to end the deal and rename the stadium in February 2002.

===Design and construction===
Early stadium sketches from Kansas City-based HOK Sport (now Populous) using the working title &quot;The Ballpark at Union Station&quot; were released to the public on October 11, 1996, where Astros President Tal Smith was open about his suggestions for the stadium including the location of the flagpole in center field and a traditional dirt path from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to home plate. While the dirt path was not implemented, the flagpole idea became known as &quot;Tal&#x27;s Hill&quot; and remained a signature feature of the ballpark until 2016.

The design of the new park integrated the former Union Station building&#x27;s main concourse, reutilizing the space for a clubhouse, cafe, team store, and office space. A large model train was also included within the park&#x27;s design as an homage to the station.

In late 1997, it was announced that local Brown &amp; Root would manage construction of the stadium, while Populous with Walter P. Moore would design it. The electrification of the park&#x27;s retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.

Groundbreaking for Enron Field was on October 30, 1997. Its groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, Astros owner Drayton McLane, Harris County Judge Robert Eckles, Harris County Commissioner El Franco Lee, and Harris County-Houston Sports Authority Chairman Jack Rains.

Statues of longtime Astros players Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio are located in the exterior of the ballpark in a plaza area. The two former teammates are depicted playing baseball with each other. The plaza also displays pennants for all Astros division and league championships, as well as their World Series titles. There are also several plaques to commemorate notable Astros and their achievements.

===Opening and current use===
The ballpark was first inaugurated with a preseason game against the New York Yankees on March 30, 2000, with naming rights sold to the Houston energy and financial trading company Enron in a 30-year, $100 million deal. However, Astros management faced a public relations problem when the energy corporation went bankrupt in 2001 due to a financial scandal. Quickly wanting to distance themselves from Enron, Astros ownership asked to prematurely end naming rights, but Enron refused. On February 5, 2002, Astros ownership filed a motion with the court overseeing the company&#x27;s bankruptcy to force Enron to make an immediate decision on the matter. By February 27, the two entities agreed to end the naming rights, and settled with the Astros paying $2.1 million to Enron. Without a naming rights agreement in place, the ballpark became officially known as &quot;Astros Field&quot;.

The Astros sold naming rights of the ballpark in 2002 to locally based Coca-Cola subsidiary Minute Maid for $100 million over 30 years. Its official name was then changed to &quot;Minute Maid Park&quot;.

On January 1, 2025, the stadium was renamed to Daikin Park after Japanese conglomerate Daikin, who owns Waller-based air conditioning manufacturer Goodman Global, agreed to acquire the stadium&#x27;s naming rights. The agreement is seen to run through 2039.

===Alterations===
In 2004, the Astros launched Wi-Fi throughout the ballpark, allowing fans to use the Internet while attending a game for a fee. In addition, the ballpark was the first major sports facility to use a separate video board exclusively for closed captioning for the hearing impaired of PA system and video board content, rather than appearing along the bottom of the main board.
In 2006, the Chick-fil-A cows were unveiled on the foul poles, saying EAT MOR FOWL, and the cows have Astros caps on. If an Astros player hits the pole, all fans in attendance get a coupon for a free chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A. Hunter Pence is the first and second Astros player to ever hit the left field &quot;Fowl Pole&quot; when he did it twice in the 2007 season. Ty Wigginton became the third Astro to hit the left field pole on September 16, 2007. Kazuo Matsui hit the right field foul pole on August 3, 2009, with a two-run homer in the sixth inning to beat the Giants. Carlos Lee hit the left field pole on July 28, 2010, giving the Astros an 8–1 win against the Cubs. Two days later, Jeff Keppinger hit the left field pole to help the Astros win, 5–0, against the Brewers. In the 2023 Major League Baseball postseason (October 7th, 2023), Yordan Alvarez hit a solo home run to the right field pole which made the game 6-4.

After the 2008 season, the Astros&#x27; groundskeepers began installing of a new turfgrass playing surface at Daikin Park. The Astros also became one of the first to use the new Chemgrass, later known as AstroTurf after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome in 1966.

In honor of longtime Astros broadcaster Milo Hamilton, the City of Houston officially renamed a portion of the Ballpark District to the &quot;Hall of Fame District&quot;, and the portion of Hamilton Avenue that runs within that district to &quot;Milo Hamilton Way&quot; on April 8, 2009.

For the 2011 season, the park added a large Daktronics HD screen nicknamed &quot;El Grande&quot; replacing the original one in right field. At high and wide, it is the fourth largest scoreboard in Major League Baseball, behind T-Mobile Park (home of the Seattle Mariners), Progressive Field (home of the Cleveland Guardians), and Kaufmann Stadium (home of the Kansas City Royals). The old screen was taken out and replaced by billboards. Additionally, a smaller HD screen was added on the far left field wall. The ring of advertisement screens around the park were replaced in favor of HD ribbon boards.

After the Astros reverted to their original colors and logo in 2013, much of Daikin Park was repainted to navy and orange from brick red. Signs with the previous logo and colors were also replaced. More than of paint were used and over 1,000 signs were replaced.

In June 2015 the Astros announced Tal&#x27;s Hill would be removed in a major renovation project during the 2015-2016 offseason, to be replaced with additional seating, concessions, and escalators for fans. This would result in center field dimensions of 436 feet (then the longest in MLB) being reduced to 409 feet. In addition, seating sections 256, 257, and 258 in the outfield mezzanine would be removed. However, the project had to be postponed due to the Astros&#x27; unexpected American League Wild Card championship and subsequent postseason appearance, along with the stadium&#x27;s offseason event schedule. The renovation was completed during the 2016-2017 offseason. The flagpoles became out of play.

In April 2022, Daikin Park, then Minute Maid Park, received Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Just Walk Out&quot; technology for two of its concession stands, becoming the first MLB stadium to incorporate cashierless stores.

===Major events===
* On October 9, 2005, Minute Maid Park hosted the then-longest postseason game in Major League Baseball history, both in terms of time and number of innings. The Astros defeated the Atlanta Braves 7–6 in a game lasting 18 innings, which took 5 hours and 50 minutes to play. The time record was beaten by Game 3 of the 2018 World Series, which went 18 innings and lasted 7 hours and 20 minutes. 
* On October 25, 2005, Minute Maid Park hosted the first World Series game ever played in Texas, and the longest World Series game ever played, which the Astros lost to the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox 7–5 in 14 innings; this game lasted 5 hours and 41 minutes. The following night, the White Sox won their third title—and first in 88 years—at Minute Maid Park.
* On September 30, 2007, in Craig Biggio&#x27;s last game of his career, Minute Maid Park hit the highest attendance in its 8-year history by selling 43,823 tickets, 107% of its capacity.
* On April 5, 2010, Opening Day of 2010, Minute Maid Park surpassed its highest attendance total once again by selling 43,836 tickets, 13 more tickets than its previous record.
* The Astros transferred to the American League for the 2013 season, resulting in the designated hitter rule coming into effect at Minute Maid Park. The last pitcher to bat at an MLB game in Houston was Astros pitcher Bud Norris until May 11, 2021, when Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels started on the mound and batted second in the lineup.
* In his third start as an Astro, pitcher Mike Fiers threw the stadium&#x27;s first no-hitter in a 3–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 21, 2015.
* In late October 2017 the Astros hosted three World Series games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Astros would go on to win the 2017 World Series, winning 2 of 3 games in Houston and 2 of 4 games in Los Angeles.
* In late October 2019, the Astros hosted four games of the World Series versus the Washington Nationals. While the Astros won all three away games, they lost all four games played at Minute Maid Park.
* It was one of two hosts (Globe Life Field being the other) for the 2020 NLDS. Atlanta swept Miami 3–0 to advance to the NLCS.
* Three games of the 2021 World Series were held at Minute Maid Park, with the Braves winning Games 1 and 6 (they also won Games 3 and 4 at Truist Park in Atlanta) to claim their fourth World Series championship. Houston&#x27;s only home victory came in Game 2.
* Games 1, 2 and 6 of the 2022 World Series were held at Minute Maid Park. The Astros won their second World Series championship in Game 6, marking the third time a World Series championship was hoisted at the park and the first time the Astros won on their home field. Houston also won Game 2, as well as two of three games at Citizens Bank Park against the Philadelphia Phillies.
* Pool B and the quarterfinals of the 2026 World Baseball Classic will take place at the stadium.

==Non-baseball events==

===Soccer===
While primarily a baseball venue, Daikin Park can adequately host sports such as soccer and both codes of rugby. The venue can also play host to large-scale music concerts. It is not large enough to comfortably accommodate American football. However, the opening of BBVA Compass Stadium four blocks southeast on Texas Avenue for MLS&#x27;s Houston Dynamo in 2012 has effectively made its use for future soccer games moot.

Its debut as a soccer venue happened during the 2006 edition of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The stadium hosted the first leg of the quarterfinal between Portmore United of Jamaica (the &quot;home&quot; team) and Club América of Mexico.

===Professional wrestling===
Minute Maid Park hosted the 2020 Royal Rumble on January 26, one of the promotion&#x27;s four annual flagship professional wrestling events. This was the first time it has hosted a WWE pay-per-view event.

===Concerts===
Paul McCartney, RBD, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Eagles, Madonna, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga and Red Hot Chili Peppers have all performed at Daikin Park.

===TV===
The nationally syndicated TV talk show &quot;Rachael Ray&quot; held a mass wedding at the park following Hurricane Ike for 40 couples who were unable to get married after a company they paid to hold the weddings went bankrupt. Comedian Jeffrey Ross served as best man for all 40 couples. The ceremony was aired as part of a special episode of the talk show on November 21, 2008.

===Other events===
The stadium also is the host of the Houston College Classic college baseball tournament, part of the winter fan festival held in February. The tournament features local schools the University of Houston and Rice University every year, a pair of major conference schools, alternating between Big 12 members University of Texas at Austin, Texas Tech University, Baylor University and SEC member Texas A&amp;M University, as well as two other teams from around the country.

On May 9, 2015, Canelo Alvarez fought James Kirkland in the first boxing match fought in the stadium. Alvarez defeated Kirkland via knockout in the third round.

The University of Houston–Downtown also holds their commencement ceremony in Daikin Park.

Minute Maid Park hosted a cricket match on November 11, 2015, the second in a series of three Cricket All-Stars matches played by retired greats of the game. Shane Warne&#x27;s Warne&#x27;s Warriors clinched the series 2–0. Keeping with the naming conventions from the previous match at Minute Maid Park, the ends were named after Nolan Ryan and José Cruz, two players that have their numbers retired by the Astros.

On January 30, 2017, the stadium hosted &quot;Super Bowl Opening Night&quot; for Super Bowl LI at nearby NRG Stadium.

From 2017 until 2020, the park hosted the final rounds of the Houston leg of the FIRST Championship. To avoid damaging the field while the Astros were in season, the competition fields were built on a stage over the infield dirt between first and third base.

==Features==
=== Tal&#x27;s Hill ===

Until 2016, center field featured a wide incline called Tal&#x27;s Hill, named for former team president Tal Smith. The incline was inspired by similar features that used to exist at Crosley Field and Fenway Park. There was a flagpole in play on the incline, an element inspired by Yankee Stadium before its remodeling in the mid-&#x27;70s, and Tiger Stadium as well. Milwaukee Brewers player Richie Sexson once hit a ball off the flagpole. There was a mark there until the 2011 season, when the pole was repainted. The hill and the flagpole were scheduled to be removed following the 2015 season, but remained in place due to an unexpected playoff run.

While Crosley Field&#x27;s infamous left field terrace, which was half as steep (only 15°) as Tal&#x27;s Hill (30°), was a natural feature of the site on which the park was located, Tal&#x27;s Hill was purely decorative. On June 4, 2015, the Astros announced that they would be removing Tal&#x27;s Hill as part of a $15 million renovation for the 2016 season. The center field fence was to be moved in from (which from 2000 to 2016 was the longest in baseball) to from home plate, but the center field renovations were delayed until after the 2016 season, due at least in part to the 2015 playoffs cutting into planned construction time.

=== Union Station ===

The largest entrance to the park is inside what was once Houston&#x27;s Union Station, and the left-field side of the stadium features a railway as homage to the site&#x27;s history. The train moves along an length of track on top of the length of the exterior wall beyond left field when the Astros take the field during the first inning, when an Astros player hits a home run, and when the Astros win a game. It is driven by Bobby Vásquez, who goes by the name Bobby Dynamite. The train is an upscaled replica of the &quot;General&quot; 4-4-0 and is pulled by a cable which is operated by the driver. The engine&#x27;s tender is filled with giant oranges in reference to Minute Maid&#x27;s most famous product, orange juice. Prior to Minute Maid buying the stadium&#x27;s naming rights, the tender was filled with logs.

In a challenge to home run hitters, former Astros owner Drayton McLane&#x27;s office window, located in the old Union Station and directly above the Crawford Boxes, is made of glass and a sign below the window is marked from home plate.

===Crawford Boxes===

The Crawford Boxes are a section of seating in Daikin Park running parallel to Crawford Street in downtown Houston, Texas. They are located in left field and span sections 100 through 104 (with all but the latter in fair territory).

The home-plate-to-fence measurement there is only , one of the shortest in Major League Baseball. Home runs must clear a 19-foot wall in front of the elevated boxes which houses the hand-operated out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the day&#x27;s other games.

Landry&#x27;s, a restaurant group, had bought the naming rights to the Crawford Boxes in 2003, which ran various promotions for its restaurants there.

===Other features===

Games are typically played with the roof open only in April and May before the Houston summer heat arrives. In the first twenty seasons of the park (2000-2019), the Astros played 1,614 games at home and played with the roof closed for the whole game for 1,103 of them (for the 2017-2019 postseason games alone, they played all home games with the roof closed).

There is a manually-operated out-of-town scoreboard in left, below the Crawford Boxes.

The ballpark features 19,201 seats on the lower level, 7,132 seats on the second level, 880 seats on the suite level, and 13,750 seats on the upper level.
The &quot;Phillips 66 Home Run Porch&quot; is located in left-center field over the field of play. It features a classic gasoline pump that displays the total number of Astros home runs hit since the park opened.

The stadium can be fully air-conditioned when required.

=== Ground rules ===
Under the stadium&#x27;s ground rules at the time, both Tal&#x27;s Hill and the flagpole were considered in play. If a ball hit the flagpole on the hill and stayed in the field of play, it was in play. If it went out of the field of play (over the fence), it was a home run. The Hill was criticized numerous times owing to the incline having the potential to cause injury to fielders unused to it. However, there was never an injury to any player in relation to Tal&#x27;s Hill.

==Transportation access==
Daikin Park is located in Downtown Houston in a centralized area of the city, and accessible via a short driving distance on Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway/East Freeway), Interstate 69 (Southwest Freeway/Eastex Freeway), and Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway/North Freeway). Street parking, garage parking, and private lot parking are available, with an estimated 25,000 spots within walking distance to the ballpark. Taxi cabs and pedicabs are also commonly found near the surrounding ballpark area.

Public transportation allows for accessibility via bus or light rail service. The METRORail light rail system has a station located one block south of Daikin Park, Convention District Station, served by the Green and Purple lines. The Red Line also serves the ballpark at Preston Station, six blocks to the west.

==Hurricane Harvey==
In 2017, the park and the entire city suffered from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, which flooded many parts of the city with several feet of rain over four days. The Astros reported that despite water entering into the service levels of the stadium, Minute Maid Park remained in &quot;good condition&quot; when the storm cleared out. The lingering effects of Harvey forced the Astros to move their series against the Texas Rangers to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Astros returned to Houston on Friday, September 1 to help the initial recovery efforts. Minute Maid Park hosted the city&#x27;s first post-Harvey sporting event, and the park&#x27;s first double-header the next day in an interleague game against the New York Mets.

<text>Mary Jane &quot;MJ&quot; Watson is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, making her first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25 (June 1965), and subsequently designed by John Romita Sr. in #42 (November 1966). Since then, she has gone on to become Spider-Man&#x27;s main love interest and later his wife. 

Although she made a brief first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25 with a plant obscuring her face, as part of a then-long-running recurring gag about Aunt May attempting to set Peter up with her friend&#x27;s &quot;nice girl&quot; niece, Mary Jane&#x27;s first official face reveal was a cameo appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #42. Designed and drawn by John Romita Sr., her entrance is regarded as one of the most iconic introductions in comic history, owing it to its build-up, her hyper-vibrant red hair and beauty, and her introductory line, &quot;Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!&quot;. Since then, &#x27;Tiger&#x27; has been her most recognizable nickname for Peter, spanning comics and media adaptations.

Throughout her initial appearances, Mary Jane was written as a foil to Peter&#x27;s initially intended soulmate, Gwen Stacy, with her extroverted, fun-loving personality (a mask for her troubled home life) contrasting with Gwen being more like Peter in demeanor and intellect. Nonetheless, following Gwen&#x27;s death in &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot; story arc, the heartbroken Mary Jane became more caring and empathetic, and eventually one of the few people to consistently know Peter&#x27;s secret identity. This would result in the two falling deeply in love and eventually getting married. Until their marriage being undone in the widely panned storyline &quot;One More Day&quot; due to the timeline manipulations by the villain Mephisto. Unbeknownst to them, they are further destined to have a daughter who will end Mephisto&#x27;s eventual reign over the Earth, and whom Mephisto seeks to erase from reality.

Since her debut, Mary Jane Watson has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable non-powered female characters. In film, Kirsten Dunst portrayed the character in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, while Shailene Woodley had an uncredited silent cameo appearance as the character in the 2014 film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;; Zoë Kravitz voiced Mary Jane in the 2018 animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, with Nicole Delaney and Melissa Sturm voicing other versions of the character in its 2023 sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;.

== Publication history ==

Mary Jane Watson is mentioned in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #15 (August 1964), and is initially used as a running joke of the series, as Peter Parker&#x27;s Aunt May repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her. Parker (also known as Spider-Man) consistently worms his way out of meeting Mary Jane who, aside from a brief appearance in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured, is never actually seen until &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #42 (November 1966). Peter David wrote in 2010 that artist John Romita Sr. &quot;made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers&#x27; view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment&quot;. Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he &quot;used Ann-Margret from the movie &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts&quot;.

According to co-creator Stan Lee, he and Romita had intended for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man&#x27;s one true love, and introduced Mary Jane &quot;just for fun&quot;, but that &quot;somehow, Mary Jane seemed to have all the personality, and much as we tried to make Gwen more attractive, we couldn&#x27;t! We, ourselves, felt that Mary Jane ended up being not only more beautiful but more fun and more interesting, and we finally decided to let Peter end up with her, but it was... as though the characters had taken over!&quot;. 

Mary Jane Watson&#x27;s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan for Gwen Stacy&#x27;s character, who was intended to be the true love for Peter and was characterized as a sweet Daddy&#x27;s girl in contrast to Mary Jane&#x27;s &#x27;60s counterculture, vampy and liberated personality. Fans surprisingly liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to replace Gwen&#x27;s role as Peter Parker&#x27;s main love interest as readers found Mary Jane more exciting and that &quot;no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!&quot;. Mary Jane flamboyance and &#x27;life of the party&#x27; personality (a mask in reality) were written as a contrast to Gwen, being more on Peter&#x27;s intellectual and emotional wavelength. However, following Gwen&#x27;s death in &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot; story arc, the character was reworked to be more emotionally grounded and open-hearted.

The names &quot;Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;MJ&quot; are also common slang terms for marijuana. When asked about this, Stan Lee claimed it was purely coincidental, that he knew nothing about drugs and had never tried marijuana.

Gerry Conway succeeded Stan Lee as writer of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in 1972. Conway pushed Mary Jane to the forefront of the cast, and made her a serious love interest for Peter Parker. Like Lee, Conway found Mary Jane to be more compelling than Gwen: &quot;[Mary Jane] hadn&#x27;t lost the edge that made her an interesting character. Gwen didn&#x27;t have an edge. She was just a nice person. I don&#x27;t think she had a mean bone in her body, and wasn&#x27;t likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for Peter, out of some misguided sense of self-aggrandizement, which Mary Jane was quite capable of doing—which makes her a much more interesting character&quot;.

In 1987, the character was married to Spider-Man in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #21. As a consequence, writer J. M. DeMatteis made Mary Jane and her marriage to Spider-Man one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot;, published the same year as the wedding. DeMatteis commented that &quot;&#x27;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&#x27; has a lot of darkness in it, but the story primarily is about Peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love. The reason Peter makes it out is because he has Mary Jane in his life, and that is his salvation&quot;.

Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters, making them less appealing to young readers, and lessens the dramatic, &quot;soap opera&quot; possibilities, but also stated that &quot;divorcing or widowing, or annulling the marriage... would only be worse&quot;. He has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated; Stan Lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and, even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series, it was decided to marry them in the regular Marvel Universe as well. In 2007, Quesada presided over the controversial &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline, which he also drew, in which Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s marriage is erased from history and everyone&#x27;s memories by the devil Mephisto. Quesada states he is an avid fan of the Peter and MJ relationship, and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate MC2 universe, in which Peter and Mary Jane are happily married, is a &quot;natural progression&quot; of the characters.

The erasing of Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well, but due to negative reader reaction Lee later revealed it to be a bad dream. Mary Jane remains Spider-Man&#x27;s wife in the newspaper strip continuity.

Although the marriage stayed erased, Mary Jane and Peter Parker became a couple again during Nick Spencer&#x27;s run in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. She got a spin-off comic later, &quot;The Amazing Mary Jane&quot;, by Leah Williams, Carlos Gomez and Carlos López.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Early history ===
Mary Jane is depicted as an extremely beautiful, green-eyed redhead and was the primary romantic interest of Peter Parker for the majority of the forty years between her first full appearance in 1966 and the One More Day story in 2007 (Peter and Mary Jane married in 1987). Initially, she competed with others for Peter&#x27;s affection, most prominently with Gwen Stacy and the Black Cat. Mary Jane&#x27;s relatively unknown early life was eventually explored in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #259.

Early issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; featured a running joke about Peter dodging his Aunt May&#x27;s attempts to set him up with &quot;that nice Watson girl next-door&quot;, whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type, since his aunt liked her (in the &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; graphic novel an identical scenario is shown between Mary Jane and her Aunt Anna). Mary Jane made her first actual appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25 (June 1965), although her face was obscured. However, she was seen by both Liz Allan and Betty Brant, who are both shocked by how attractive she is. It is not until &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #42 (November 1966) that her face is actually seen. In that issue, on the last page, Peter finally meets her, and he is stunned by her beauty even as she speaks the now-famous line: &quot;Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!&quot;
Peter begins to date her, much to the annoyance of Gwen Stacy. However, they eventually become irritated with each other and Peter subsequently chooses to date Gwen. Mary Jane, who becomes Harry Osborn&#x27;s former love interest and former girlfriend for about a year, remains a close friend to Peter and Gwen. Despite her enjoyment of life, her friendships, and dating, Mary Jane refuses to be tied down for too long. When her relationship with Harry Osborn comes to an end, it has significant impact on Harry, driving him to a drug overdose. This in turn creates a boomerang effect, driving his father Norman Osborn to the brink of insanity, temporarily restoring his memories as the Green Goblin.

After the Green Goblin murders Gwen in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #121, Mary Jane attempts to comfort Peter. Peter, who is distraught over the loss of Gwen Stacy, angrily confronts MJ about her seemingly flighty and carefree attitude. He questions her ability to ever care about people like him and Gwen, and states &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t be sorry if your own mother died,&quot; unaware that her mother had actually died. Mary Jane is hurt by Peter&#x27;s comments. She attempts to leave, but hesitates as she approaches the door, and ultimately chooses to stay with him. This served as a turning point in their relationship, and over the next couple of years, she and Peter become very close friends. Eventually, upon realizing the feelings that they share for one another, they decide to take their relationship to the next level, having sex in the process. Their relationship has a few initial hurdles, such as MJ&#x27;s hot temper and Peter&#x27;s always dashing off to be Spider-Man. Following the events of the original clone saga, Peter realizes that Mary Jane is the girl he has always loved, and the two begin dating again.

Despite loving Peter, MJ does not wish to be tied down. Yet, she allows the relationship to progress and is left with a difficult decision when Peter proposes to her. After taking a short time to consider, she turns him down. Following a series of traumatic experiences involving Peter&#x27;s absences and his costumed alter ego endangering his Aunt May, a spiritually exhausted MJ leaves New York for several months. Peter meanwhile dates other women, most notably Felicia Hardy.

MJ returns, her behavior showing a marked change with her abandonment of her false front. Following an attack on Peter by Puma, she breaks down and admits her knowledge of Peter&#x27;s secret identity in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #257. After learning of her own family history in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #259, Peter finds a new respect for her and begins to truly understand her. MJ makes it clear to Peter that knowing his identity changes nothing about her feelings, and that she only loves him as a friend, her best friend.

Despite the one-shot graphic novel &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives&quot; and &quot;Untold Tales of Spider-Man&quot; #16 revealing that Mary Jane discovered Peter&#x27;s secret when she noticed Spider-Man climbing out of Peter&#x27;s bedroom window after his uncle&#x27;s murder, many comics published before this revelation claimed that she had simply &quot;figured it out&quot;, with the details of how and when left ambiguous to the reader.

After yet another period of reconsidering his priorities in life, Peter contemplates letting go of the Spider-Man mantle, with Mary Jane backing the decision, but his relationship with Felicia Hardy soon resumes. Feeling lost and guilty, Peter visits Mary Jane and apologizes with an awkward kiss before heading to Berlin with Ned Leeds.

Following Ned Leeds&#x27; murder at the hands of the Foreigner, a changed and bitter Peter returns to New York, where his lack of direction in life is not helped when Ned is framed as the Hobgoblin, and Felicia elects to leave Peter behind as she is tied to the Foreigner. Mary Jane returns to Peter, presumably to patch things up, but Peter surprises her with a second proposal of marriage, which MJ again turns down. She returns to her family to settle old debts with her father, with Peter following her. After aiding her sister in having her crooked father arrested, and aiding Peter against a Spider-Slayer, Mary Jane has an epiphany on marriage, and agrees to become Peter&#x27;s wife.

=== Marriage ===
In spite of Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s mutual worry that they were marrying too early, Peter&#x27;s concern for her safety, and her unwillingness to give up her &quot;party girl&quot; lifestyle, they marry. She adds Peter&#x27;s surname to her own, making her Mary Jane Watson-Parker. They were, at that moment, really in love. Spider-Man wears his black costume around this time, but after Mary Jane is frightened by a stalking Venom, she convinces him to change back to his old costume.

Mary Jane continues to model after her marriage, but is stalked by her wealthy landlord, Jonathan Caesar. When she rejects his advances, he kidnaps her, but she manages to escape. While Caesar is briefly incarcerated, he uses his powerful business connections within the city and has her blacklisted as a model. She gets a role on the soap opera &quot;Secret Hospital&quot;, but is unhappy with her character&#x27;s air-headed and mean personality. On top of that, Caesar, who has been released from prison and is still obsessed with Mary Jane, plots to kidnap her again—this time intending to whisk her away to a private island he owns in the Caribbean. After luring Mary Jane to an abandoned studio and threatening to kill her, Caesar is confronted by Officer Goldman, a policeman assigned to Mary Jane&#x27;s original case against him. Goldman then shoots Caesar dead, saving Mary Jane&#x27;s life. Although she successfully petitions her boss to adjust her character&#x27;s personality, a deranged fan tries to kill Mary Jane out of hatred for the actions of her soap opera character. Mary Jane quits her job out of fear for her own safety and returns to modeling. This, along with Peter&#x27;s role as Spider-Man, triggers a growing divide. She briefly flirts with actor Jason Jerome, who tries to tempt her into a secret affair. She resists out of faithfulness to Peter, but her weak rebuffs fail to convince Jerome, and she realizes she is enticed by him in spite of herself. However, she eventually realizes that her craving for romance can be filled by her husband as easily as an extramarital affair, and she pointedly rejects Jerome&#x27;s advances while rebuking his behavior.

Due to this stress, and the seeming return of her husband&#x27;s parents, Mary Jane begins smoking (a habit she had quit in high school), only increasing the tension between her and Peter. Peter ultimately convinces her to stop smoking when he tricks her into visiting Nick Katzenberg suffering heavily from lung cancer. When his parents are discovered to be fakes, Peter is unable to cope with the knowledge and disappears for a time. Mary Jane visits her sister Gayle and her father for the first time in years, and finally reconciles with them. Meanwhile, Peter overcomes his problems on his own. When she and Peter reunite, both are happier than they had been in a long time.

=== Pregnancy ===
During the 1994–96 &quot;Clone Saga&quot; storyline, Peter&#x27;s clone, Ben Reilly, appears. Mary Jane discovers that she is pregnant. While she experiences some complications in her pregnancy, Reilly&#x27;s scientist friend Seward Trainer helps her. Peter and Ben are told by Trainer that Ben is the real Peter Parker, and Peter is the clone. After conducting the tests themselves (tests which Seward rigged) they confirm Seward&#x27;s story. A disbelieving Peter, while arguing with Ben, strikes Mary Jane. After this, he decides to quit as Spider-Man, because the stress of his double life is endangering his wife and unborn child. Peter, acting on hypnotic suggestion by the Jackal, attempts to kill Mary Jane, but is prevented by Ben Reilly (as the Scarlet Spider), his teammates the New Warriors, and Kaine. Later, Peter and Mary Jane leave New York and move to Portland, Oregon. They live there peacefully for several months, adapting happily to normal life after an accident causes subtle damage to Peter&#x27;s genetic structure that disrupts his ability to use his powers. However, they miss New York City and their friends, and move back, a strange illness culminating in the restoration of Peter&#x27;s powers. During the Onslaught crisis, Mary Jane is scanned by a Sentinel robot, who detects genetic abnormalities in her fetus.

Soon afterward, when Mary Jane&#x27;s baby is already past due, she is poisoned by Alison Mongrain, an agent of the Green Goblin. Mary Jane&#x27;s baby is stillborn. Combined with Ben&#x27;s death in a battle with the reborn Norman Osborn and the revelation that the tests identifying Peter as the clone were actually rigged as part of Osborn&#x27;s plan to break Peter&#x27;s spirit, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man.

=== Marital problems ===
Mary Jane returns to college to major in psychology, but the stress of the ongoing manipulations of Norman Osborn take their toll. After the Gathering of Five incident and the return of Aunt May, Mary Jane begs Peter to quit being Spider-Man.

He is happy to do so for several months, but soon feels the tug of his great power and great responsibility to be a hero. Meanwhile, Mary Jane is offered a new modeling contract and reaches new heights of success. Peter becomes Spider-Man again behind Mary Jane&#x27;s back, which puts strain on their marriage. At the same time, she begins receiving lewd and threatening phone calls from an anonymous stalker. Mary Jane is flying across America when her airplane explodes in midair in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; Vol. 2 #13 (January 2000). Peter is shocked and goes into deep denial over her death. Although he is set up with several other women, and his friends encourage him to move on, he believes she is still alive. Her mysterious stalker, an unnamed, telepathic mutant, has telepathically connected to Peter in some way, and wants to take over his life. He kidnapped Mary Jane as part of his plan and held her hostage for several months. The stalker kills himself after finally gleaning enough of Peter&#x27;s personality and morality to discover that he had done terrible things. Peter and Mary Jane are reunited in &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; #29 (June 2001).

The stress of her captivity drives Mary Jane away. She moves to Los Angeles and immerses herself in acting — starring as the doomed love interest in the film &quot;Lobster-Man&quot;. Although missing Peter after he fails to meet her on a visit back to New York, she refuses to talk to him; Aunt May gets Peter to visit her in Los Angeles, however the two remain separated. Peter&#x27;s encounter with the supernatural Spider-Wasp Shathra eventually leads to the two of them flying to New York and Los Angeles to see each other. Despite missing each other at their respective homes, they meet in an airport in Denver, Colorado where they reconcile after a brief encounter with Doctor Doom and Latverian terrorists.

=== &quot;Civil War&quot; ===
During the events of the 2006–2007 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, when Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s apartment and Aunt May&#x27;s house are burned down by Charlie Weiderman, and Spider-Man joins the New Avengers, Mary Jane and Aunt May accompany him to live in Stark Tower. Mary Jane immediately feels at home with the New Avengers and is happy to finally be a part of Spider-Man&#x27;s world.

The Civil War events forced Peter to stage a secret transfer of Mary Jane out of Stark Mansion, feeling that with the loss of his secret identity and his doubts about Tony Stark&#x27;s ideas, Mary Jane had become a hostage in a luxurious house. Now residing in a cheap motel, her whole life had been affected, from her increasing difficulties in finding a new job as an actress to her being an easy target and prey, along with Aunt May, for the superpowered foes of Spider-Man.

Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May are targeted by an assassin working for Spider-Man&#x27;s old foe, the Kingpin. When Peter returns to the Parker family&#x27;s motel hideout, the assassin takes aim at Peter and fires, but hits Aunt May instead. Peter and MJ scramble to save Aunt May&#x27;s life, rushing her from hospital to hospital while trying to maintain their fragile cover of anonymity. In trying to keep May alive and hidden from Spider-Man&#x27;s enemies, they become fugitives on the run.

=== &quot;One More Day&quot; ===
During the 2007 &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline, Peter is forced to decide whether he will accept Mephisto&#x27;s offer to save Aunt May in return for wiping the knowledge and memory of Peter and MJ&#x27;s life together as husband and wife from the face of reality, which would leave only a single, subconscious piece of their souls to remember their love and life together, allowing Mephisto to feast on the pain exhibited by those vestiges for eternity.

MJ, despite loving Peter, accepts Mephisto&#x27;s offer, but only with the caveat that Mephisto promises to restore Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity. She also asks to put his life back as it was and have a chance at happiness. Mephisto accepts these terms, and in the revised timeline, which begins at the end of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #545, and is further explained in the following issues, MJ and Peter were never married but instead &quot;dated seriously for years&quot;.

According to interviews conducted with then-Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, every story prior to this story remains canon (this would later be contradicted as the events of later stories imply MJ never fell pregnant). Quesada also stated that a gap of undefined duration occurred between pages in &quot;One More Day&quot;, during which the couple separated. By the end of that period, MJ has moved to California to become an actress, but continues to visit New York from time to time. In the epilogue to &quot;One More Day&quot;, she attends a &quot;coming home&quot; party held by ex-Harry Osborn during one such visit, with Peter catching a small glimpse of her before she left, after ignoring her.

=== New life ===
At the end of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #560, as part of the &quot;Brand New Day&quot; storyline, Mary Jane makes her return as the girlfriend of actor Bobby Carr. In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #561, Mary Jane is seen getting into bed with Carr, and is later attacked by Paperdoll. Concealing herself in the panic room, Mary Jane observes a battle between Spider-Man and Paperdoll, and communicates with Spider-Man over the intercom. Mary Jane says that she and Spider-Man made a great team &quot;in another life&quot; and longingly touches a monitor screen showing his face, hinting that she still has strong feelings and misses him.

Peter does not learn that Mary Jane is the girlfriend of Carr nor that she was the voice on the intercom. Mary Jane is seen at the conclusion of the issue contemplating a phone call to Peter, but is hesitant to do so. She is asked for an autograph by Sara Ehret, an associate of Jackpot. Mary Jane tells her she does not know when she will return to New York. She left a message on Peter&#x27;s machine but it was cut off before she could say anything.

Mary Jane has been living on the West Coast pursuing her acting career. She returns to New York after Carr is found to be taking Mutant Growth Hormone for a movie role, supplied by the White Rabbit. Carr complains that now she would tell them all about his drug use. His shallowness makes MJ walk away from him and take a TV job, which takes her back to New York City.

Mary Jane and Peter agree to meet with each other. Peter does not remember when or where as he had been drunk, and is further delayed due to his activities as Spider-Man. MJ also was drunk (while waiting for Peter to muster his courage to talk to her) and while she recalls their meeting she has overslept it. Issue 605 flashbacks to Mary Jane recalling a fight with Peter while he was dressed as Spider-Man, where she said that she did not care where he was and that he had a responsibility to their relationship. Peter begins to explain about his Uncle Ben, but Mary Jane interrupts him to say that he cannot let a single moment define his life.

In the 2010 &quot;One Moment in Time&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Mary Jane whispered to Mephisto that Peter would not agree to the deal unless Mary Jane tells him to make it, and that Mephisto will leave Peter alone forever when the deal is done. Mephisto replies &quot;Agreed, as far as I&#x27;m concerned—this never happened.&quot; MJ did that to protect Peter. In present time MJ shows up at Peter&#x27;s door. They talk about how they have been acting towards each other lately and both agree they want to be friends. They recall how Peter missed what was supposed to be their wedding day due to his activities as Spider-Man, leading MJ to demand that he retire from crimefighting. His refusal to do so convinced MJ that they must remain unmarried, since any children they might have would be endangered by his being a superhero.

Mary Jane goes to check on Anna Watson, just in time to stop a hitman, who goes after her. Spider-Man saves Mary Jane and dispatches the hitman. Spider-Man brings the wounded Mary Jane to Doctor Strange, who performs a healing spell on her. Peter insists that Doctor Strange should make people forget he is Spider-Man. Peter enters a protective shell to shield himself from the changes. At the last moment, he leaps out of the shield and pulls Mary Jane in with him so she will not forget either. Back in the present, Mary Jane explains that, although she still loves him, she is not strong enough to be at his side. She tells him he has to move on and find somebody who can be with him.

Peter soon begins a new relationship with Carlie Cooper. Though initially jealous, MJ decides to respect their relationship, and encourages Peter to reveal his secret identity to her.

=== &quot;Spider-Island&quot; and &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; ===
During the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, much of New York City becomes infected with a virus that gives its inhabitants Peter&#x27;s Spider-like abilities. MJ, who did not manifest any powers, finds herself caught in a series of riots across the city. Saved by the intervening Future Foundation, MJ later locates Peter and Carlie, the latter having also been granted spider-powers. MJ encourages Peter to use his civilian disguise when displaying his powers and rally the city against the chaos. She would later attain spider-powers herself and come to the aid of defenseless citizens, her prolonged contact with Peter during their relationship granting her a degree of immunity that protected her from Adriana Soria&#x27;s mutative side-effects of the transformation. Peter successfully cures all of New York.

Shortly after, Carlie Cooper breaks up with Peter, having deduced his secret identity. Conflicted over her lingering feelings for Peter, Carlie confides in Mary Jane, and the two begin to bond over their experiences with Peter.

In the 2012 storyline &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot;, Mary Jane purchases a nightclub.

=== &quot;Dying Wish&quot; and &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; ===
Mary Jane remains in the role of best friend and confidant to Peter until he begins to take an interest in her romantically again. They begin dating again. Unknown to MJ, Peter has had his mind swapped by Otto Octavius. The real Peter Parker, trapped in his rival&#x27;s dying body, breaks out of prison and attempts to switch back, only for his body to eventually give out on him before he can complete the procedure. As a last resort, Peter downloads all of his memories and experiences into Octavius&#x27; mind, convincing his foe to develop some sense of responsibility. Octavius, as Peter, continues to date Mary Jane after this, but she begins noticing distinctly different character traits displayed by him, such as a heavy intake of alcohol and his rude behavior towards his loved ones. Octavius intends to become more intimate with her and makes several advances, only to be rebuffed each time. In desperation and frustration, Octavius relives Peter&#x27;s memories with MJ, which infuriates Peter. After one of Octavius&#x27; Spider-Bots detect Mary Jane in trouble and saves her from the Vulture gang, Mary Jane moves to kiss him, but Octavius, who has by now developed genuine feelings for her, rebuffs her, and breaks up with her, though vowing to continue to protect her.

Peter&#x27;s mind is returned to his body, and informs Mary Jane that it was Octavius&#x27; mind in control of Peter&#x27;s body for the past several months. Mary Jane tells him that she knows Octavius&#x27; actions were not Peter&#x27;s fault, but she cannot let his dual life affect her anymore. She recognizes and admires the choices Peter has made in his life, but now she wants to build her own life, mostly thanks to the successes she has enjoyed with her nightclub and her new relationship with Ollie.

=== All-New, All-Different Marvel ===
As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Mary Jane Watson is in Chicago, Illinois hosting the opening of her newest nightclub Jackpot. Having ended her relationship with Ollie, Mary Jane had opened this nightclub after MJ&#x27;s got destroyed during a superhero battle. When a Belhilio is quickly killed by an energy blast from Madame Masque, people start to run away as Iron Man and Doctor Doom arrive to confront her. With Mary Jane&#x27;s assistance, Masque is apprehended, but during the fight the nightclub is irrevocably damaged. Three days later, Iron Man approaches Mary Jane Watson in Grant Park while she is mourning the loss of her club and offers her a job working for him. Mary Jane later waits for Tony Stark at Stark Tower, but their audition is interrupted by F.R.I.D.A.Y., who tells them that War Machine is missing. Before Tony becomes Iron Man and flies to Tokyo, Mary Jane gives Tony the emergency number for Peter Parker. It is revealed that Mary Jane declined Tony Stark&#x27;s offer due to being uncomfortable around F.R.I.D.A.Y. However, Tony sends F.R.I.D.A.Y. to plead Mary Jane to help him stop the board of directors from seizing his company while he is off on a mission. Mary Jane claims to the board of directors that she is the new executive administrator, and she and F.R.I.D.A.Y. convince the board that the company is in safe hands.

In the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series, it is revealed that she has eventually accepted Tony&#x27;s employment offer when she and Tony attend a Parker Industry event, making Peter very uncomfortable. Later, she catches up with Betty Brant and Harry Osborn, and the three discover that businessman Augustus Roman is actually the powerful being known as Regent who is imprisoning heroes and villains to add to his own strength. Spider-Man and Iron Man try to stop Regent, but are defeated due to Regent&#x27;s overwhelming power. With few options left, Mary Jane dons Peter&#x27;s Iron Spider armor and uses her experience in Iron Man&#x27;s suit and her brief spider powers in Spider-Island to assist Peter and Tony in battling Regent. During the fight, Mary Jane and Tony distract Regent long enough for Peter, Harry, and Miles Morales to release the rest of the prisoners. Mary Jane&#x27;s attitude towards Peter during her time with him reminds Peter not to let his work take priority over his loved ones. Spider-Man warns Tony not to take Mary Jane for granted as Peter did not realize he lost Mary Jane until after she moved on.

After &quot;Civil War II&quot;, Tony was put into a comatose state and his body went missing due to his own covert machinations. Mary Jane along with Riri Williams and Amanda Armstrong went on a search for him, and it was not until F.R.I.D.A.Y. made a calculated analysis that the A.I. duplicate of Tony would know exactly where to find him. However, Tony was continually complicating the search by sending them to other locations, believing he needed his privacy until he was finally ready.

After Peter&#x27;s company went belly up during the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline and he got a new career as the Daily Bugle&#x27;s science editor, Mary Jane started being more supportive of Peter getting his life back on track. After a less than stellar Alchemax demonstration, Mary Jane and Peter started being more romantically involved, but as Peter still wore his Spider-Man suit, Mary Jane was conflicted: she wanted Peter to stop being Spider-Man but people really counted on him and she did not want to be the one to do that. She has Peter exit her apartment as Spider-Man so if anyone sees they will just think she was talking with him because she knows Stark.

After Norman Osborn becomes the Red Goblin, MJ received a warning from Peter and adjusted Stark Tower&#x27;s defences against a Symbiote intruder. However, because Venom arrived before Red Goblin, the defenses only injured Venom and had no effect on the Red Goblin. Surviving with minor injuries after a short skirmish, MJ urged Peter to absorb the Venom Symbiote, which would give him the edge to stop his arch-enemy. She, along with others attacked by Red Goblin, were cured of his Carnage spikes by Flash Thompson with the Anti-Venom symbiote.

=== Fresh Start ===
As part of the Fresh Start relaunch event, Peter&#x27;s personal life took serious knocks in both his civilian and heroic life: his doctorate was determined to be based on plagiarized work (due to him having received the doctorate when Doctor Octopus was controlling his body and the scientist used his own work) which led to him being fired from the &quot;Bugle&quot;, while the Kingpin tried to separate Spider-Man from other heroes by making him the only vigilante he would accept in the new anti-vigilante New York. However, his personal life picked up when he began reconnecting with Mary Jane more regularly and they talked about recent events. Finally, Peter told Mary Jane that he needed her in his life once again, prompting Mary Jane to decide on a &quot;fresh start&quot; and resume her relationship with him one more time.

As she and Peter resume dating, Mary Jane is encouraged by a returning Carlie Cooper to join a special support unit for associates, friends and partners of superheroes run by Jarvis called The Look Ups. Hesitant at first, Mary Jane eventually shares with the group her feelings for Peter, the loss of her job at Stark Industries, and her anxieties and occasional doubts about her importance to him. Afterwards, Jarvis compliments Mary Jane and tells her she is indispensable. MJ lets Peter know this when they spend the night together shortly after Peter&#x27;s battle with the Thieves Guild. Peter admits to Mary Jane that he revealed his secret identity once more to Felicia Hardy, but Mary Jane tells him that she is not envious of this and understands.

After Peter&#x27;s return as a college student, Mary Jane joined him for a dinner visit with the Connors family, as Peter and Curt discussed Peter&#x27;s being Curt&#x27;s teacher assistant job offer. While Peter was reluctant to take the offer, Mary Jane tried to argue he take it, as the chance could help him going forward. While Peter is ill from fever, Mary Jane tries to care for him, but he goes running head long into danger as Taskmaster and Black Ant captured Curt Connors&#x27; son Billy and she worriedly awaits Peter as he departs. As she waits, she tries to alleviate her anxiety unaware that an unknown entity (Kindred) is stalking her to get to Peter; but Kindred does not hurt her, viewing her as an innocent. After waking up, she tripped on Peter&#x27;s dropped clothing and broke a window, and as she was cleaning herself up Peter returned in his black suit (courtesy of Kraven the Hunter) in a rushed panic believing some terrible had befallen her, but Mary Jane assured him that she was safe.

While attending a play with Carlie Cooper (Peter missing the planned date as he attempts to find the missing Curt Connors), Mary Jane gets unwittingly involved in an attack by the new Electro, who takes the lead actress hostage and attempts to ransom her online, only to change plans due to the low response to finding out how many people would pay to kill her. After Carlie causes a distraction, Mary Jane is able to switch places with the actress and trick Electro into a trap that knocks the villain out. The subsequent popularity of Mary Jane&#x27;s speech prompts new public interest in her former acting career, to the point that her old agent calls her about new offers.

Mary Jane accepts one of these new offers, and with Peter&#x27;s encouragement and support, heads off for a two-month stint in Hollywood filming a new movie. Peter had hoped to accompany Mary Jane to the airport, but he was forced to cancel those plans to help out his sister Teresa Parker. By the time Peter&#x27;s mission had concluded, MJ had departed. The two would have a conversation by phone later that evening where Mary Jane assured Peter she understood why he could not take her to the airport and gives him all her love. It is revealed Peter had intended to propose to Mary Jane again had he been able to see her off.

Soon after filming started, Mary Jane discovered Mysterio&#x27;s disguise as the movie&#x27;s producer, who swore to her that this project was supposed to be an authentic depiction of his life. At first grudgingly, Mary Jane cooperated with him when the Savage Six began attacking the project after the Vulture felt offended for the &quot;unauthorized&quot; usage of his person in the plot. During an appearance on a talk show, Mary Jane witnessed a sinister, oni-masked individual committing a murder, and was placed under witness protection.

During the &quot;Last Remains&quot; storyline, Mary Jane ultimately returned to New York amidst the chaos inflicted by Peter&#x27;s allies the Order of the Web, who had been possessed by Kindred. Mary Jane is caught in a head-on collision but survives and is rescued by Norman Osborn. Norman takes her back to Ravencroft where he reveals to her that he is now a changed man, cleansed of his sins, and that Kindred is his son Harry Osborn. Mary Jane agrees to help Norman reach Harry and is brought to Kindred&#x27;s lair, where she finds Peter and the Order of the Web are now captives. Harry tortures Peter, demanding that he confess to something, but MJ tells Harry Peter has no recollection of the precise sin. She tells Harry she blames herself for his downward spiral and offers to sacrifice herself. Norman suddenly attacks and seemingly cuts down Mary Jane with a pumpkin bomb, which enrages Harry. A panicked Peter checks on Mary Jane, but she assures him the bomb is a blank and that this all part of the plan. Kindred is ultimately captured by the alliance of Norman and Wilson Fisk.

Mary Jane decides to remain in New York and help Peter deal with the fall out of Kindred&#x27;s attack. She takes him to the old theatre where she got her big break and encourages him to use performance art to vent out his frustrations. Peter does so and he eventually breaks down, MJ comforts him. After Peter heads off to attend class at ESU, Mary Jane discovers Mysterio was eavesdropping. Mysterio asks Mary Jane if she will ever tell her boyfriend about their working arrangement, MJ tells him Peter has enough on his mind, and asks Mysterio about Kindred, suspecting he knows the truth, but Mysterio does not commit to an answer

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Peter and Mary Jane eventually attend the premiere of MJ&#x27;s new movie, and Peter is formerly introduced to Cage McKnight, still in the dark over his true identity. MJ tells Mysterio she will tell Peter the truth later tonight. Peter has a surprise of his own as he is planning to propose to Mary Jane when the movie is over, but the Savage Six take the opportunity to attack, eager for a taste of revenge on Mysterio. As the crowds in the movie theatre disperse, Mary Jane stops to help people who have fallen over, and stands her ground against the Tarantula. Peter switches to Spider-Man and comes to her rescue. Doctor Octopus and the four of his team then attack the theatre. Mysterio assists Mary Jane, exposing his identity to Peter and the Sinister and Savage teams. Mary Jane confesses to a concerned Peter that she knew who Mysterio was all along and vouches for him. Mysterio tries to tell Peter that he and Mary Jane&#x27;s deal with Mephisto is to blame for everything that is presently happening, but Peter is far too distracted by the warring factions. Otto offers Beck the opportunity to join the Sinister Six, as long as he helps them capture Mary Jane. Mysterio escapes, taking MJ with him, promising her that the &#x27;devil will get his due&#x27; Beck takes Mary Jane to his old studios, he reveals to her of his prior demise and descent into hell, but that he was offered a chance at renewed life by Harry Osborn. Beck did as instructed and &#x27;did his bidding&#x27;, in exchange, Kindred opened up new worlds for Beck to explore such as the Ultimate Universe. Over time, the visits from Kindred became less frequent and Beck let his guard down, believing himself to be free, until Kindred had use for him again. Beck then reveals to Mary Jane that he was instrumental in helping her come to terms with Harry&#x27;s &#x27;death&#x27; in his guise of Doctor Ludwig Rinehart, although Mary Jane can barely recall this. Despite Mary Jane&#x27;s pleas, Mysterio remains loyal to Kindred&#x27;s plan and leaves her to his master&#x27;s mercy. Kindred unmasks to reveal the features of what appears to be Gwen Stacy, but is in actuality the husk of Sarah Stacy, the alleged daughter of Gwen and Norman Osborn. Mary Jane learns Kindred is still Harry using Sarah&#x27;s body as a host, and that she nor her brother Gabriel was never truly Norman or Gwen&#x27;s child, but clones created by an A.I version of Harry. Mary Jane also discovers that Mysterio tampered with her memories disguised as her therapist, which led her to believe the cloned twins were Gwen&#x27;s children. Kindred tells Mary Jane the time has come to face her own sins and opens a doorway to Hell. Mary Jane flees into one of Kindred&#x27;s portals and arrives at Sarah and Gabriel&#x27;s home in Paris, where she tends to a stricken Peter. She and Peter briefly banter until Norman arrives to warn them that Sarah and Gabriel are preparing to ambush them. As Peter holds his own against the twin Kindred, Norman admits to Mary Jane that he made a deal with Mephisto, to which MJ reacts with shock. Norman&#x27;s son Harry, now revealed to have been a clone of the original, arrives to help tip the scales in Peter&#x27;s conflict with Kindred, but is eventually, and brutally, cut down and killed. Peter is also eventually buried under rubble. Mary Jane comes to his rescue. Their unwavering commitment to one another rids the Kindred spirits of Mephisto&#x27;s influence, and the Stacy twins are finally allowed to die. In Las Vegas, Doctor Strange is involved in a high stakes gambit with Mephisto to free the true Harry Osborn&#x27;s soul from the grasp of the devil, Upon succeeding, Strange asks Mephisto why he has attempted to claim Peter Parker. Mephisto reveals he foresees a future where Peter will defeat him and end his reign over the Earth. As Doctor Strange departs, he reminds Mephisto that the love Peter shares with those closest to him will always enhance his life and make every one of them better. The vision of Mephisto&#x27;s future changes to show it is a red-headed Spider-Woman, not Peter, who ultimately thwarts the devil&#x27;s reign. Mary Jane and Peter make their way home to heal and face the dawn of a new day together as a loving, and seemingly &#x27;unbreakable&#x27;, couple.

===Spider-Man Beyond===
In the wake of Harry&#x27;s death, Mary Jane advises a grieving Peter to perhaps devote some time to properly process the loss and take a break from being Spider-Man. Before Peter can consider these plans though, he is caught up in a battle with the perilous U-Foes that incapacitates him, leading to his hospitalization. His clone Ben Reilly contacts Mary Jane and May Parker. Mary Jane is angry with Ben, believing him to be responsible for Peter&#x27;s predicament. Peter then slips into a coma, but not before giving Ben his blessing to take the reins as Spider-Man in his absence.

Peter eventually recovers and awakens from his coma, Mary Jane continues to look after him, and at one point saves him from a serial killer stalking the wards of the hospital.

Peter&#x27;s condition eventually draws out Felicia Hardy, and she and Mary Jane unite to save Peter from the clutches of criminal The Hood, who is need of his cloak. They locate it at the headquarters of Tombstone. Mary Jane disguises herself as the Black Cat and retrieves the cloak, the two then return it to The Hood, where it ends up devouring him. Peter, asleep the entire time, awakes to find Mary Jane and Felicia present, but believes it to be a recurring dream he has of the two women and asks them to be &#x27;gentle&#x27; with him. Mary Jane and Felicia later joke about their mutual interest in Peter on the rooftops, with Felicia admitting how &#x27;perfect&#x27; MJ is for Peter.

Mary Jane returns home, where she is confronted by Ben Reilly&#x27;s girlfriend Janine Godbe, aka Elizabeth Tyne, who is in possession of a hard drive provided by Otto Octavius that details the hidden agenda of the Beyond corporation, which presently employs Ben. Mary Jane takes Janine to the Daily Bugle, but they are confronted by the Queen Goblin, aka Doctor Ashley Kafka, Ben&#x27;s psychiatrist, infected with all of the sin of Norman Osborn. Ben Reilly makes the save, but due to the Beyond corporation tampering with his mind to make him more controllable, Ben has forgotten how to be selfless and responsible, so he decides to save what is most important to him only and flees with Janine, leaving Mary Jane to the mercy of Kafka. Before Kafka can use her &#x27;goblin gaze&#x27; on Mary Jane to draw out her anxieties and innermost fears, they are interrupted by Felicia. Kafka instead uses her gaze on Felicia and its effects compel Felicia to suicide. However, Felicia is saved by Peter. Mary Jane hands over Peter&#x27;s costume to him and he suits up to confront Kakfa. After Peter defeats the Queen Goblin, Mary Jane tells him to go and find his &#x27;brother&#x27; Ben

Shortly afterwards, Peter fails to save Ben from the manipulations of the Beyond corporation, denying Ben a chance to reclaim his missing memories leads to Peter being soundly beaten by his former ally. Mary Jane helps Peter grieve the loss of Ben as well as aid in his physical recovery. Weeks pass, and after completing a session at her apartment, Mary Jane asks Peter if he&#x27;d like to stay with her, not just for today, but for good, believing the time has come once more to share their lives together. Peter readily accepts, only for the two to be interrupted by a mysterious being bathed in light. The being tells Peter a path of blood has led him to his door and that Peter must come with him.

===Six Months Later/Hellfire Gala===
Following an incident that decimates a section of Pennsylvania, Peter finds himself alienated from the superhero community and on bad terms with Mary Jane. The two have broken up and Mary Jane is now seemingly dating a man named Paul, with kids seeing Mary Jane as a mother figure, with the daughter heavily resembling her. Despite their lack of communication, Mary Jane still shows concern for Peter when Felicia Hardy pays her a visit asking about his present whereabouts.

Sometime later, Mary Jane and her Aunt Anna have become brand ambassadors for medical treatments supplied by the mutant island nation of Krakoa, with an ailing Anna now suffering from dementia. Mary Jane arranges a meeting with Norman Osborn to verify that the treatments are safe to use. At Oscorp, she meets up with Peter, who apologizes for routinely trying to call her when she did not want to be contacted. Mary Jane accepts his apology and attempts to tell him something truthful about how she is presently feeling when the two are interrupted by Paul. It is implied Paul has had a visceral encounter with Peter in the past. Mary Jane and Paul depart, with MJ telling Paul she has the assurances she needs to try out the medicines, and makes preparations to attend the annual Hellfire Gala.

MJ later finds an intruder in her Aunt&#x27;s house, the X-Men&#x27;s former ally-turned-nemesis Moira MacTaggart, who attacks her and renders her unconscious, intending to take her place at the Gala by disguising herself as her.

Using Mary Jane as a &quot;meat puppet&quot;, Moira infiltrates the Gala and interacts with several in attendance, including her son Proteus and MJ&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Peter. Eventually, the X-Men uncover the truth behind Moira&#x27;s infiltration, and Mary Jane temporarily breaks free of Moira&#x27;s control to try and warn Logan of her predicament. Eventually, Moira escapes Krakoa along with a clone of Mister Sinister called Doctor Stasis upon Moira siding with Orchis only for Peter and Wolverine to follow them. Later, Moira is seen meeting with Druig of the Eternals revealing the secrets of the Five&#x27;s resurrection protocols. Moira has abandoned Mary Jane, with the implication that she has killed the Krakoan ambassador.

However, this is not the case, and Peter and Logan are able to successfully rescue Mary Jane. Upon returning to New York, Peter offers to talk to Mary Jane, but she refuses. Peter asks if it&#x27;s because of Paul. When she confirms this is so, Peter challenges MJ on her feelings for Paul, but MJ angrily says this isn&#x27;t about him, but about something she thought he understood responsibility, and walks away.

===Dark Web===
As Peter&#x27;s friends assembled at the Coffee Bean to honor the memory of the twice dead Harry Osborn during the &quot;Dark Web&quot;, Mary Jane decided now was the appropriate time to make peace with Peter and asked if she could share a coffee with him.

Shortly after the party, Mary Jane returned home, where she and her family came under attack from demons possessing the furniture. Felicia Hardy arrived on the scene with the intent on checking in on MJ&#x27;s well being, only to find MJ defending her family with newly acquired powers. The exact nature of MJ&#x27;s abilities are determined by pure chance and she has no control over which ones will manifest. When a curious Felicia teased Mary Jane about her powers, she refused to reveal where the powers came from and that Peter, who is unaware of them, must never know. Mary Jane asks Felicia to watch out for Peter, before both are transported to Limbo where they run into Count Belsaco. Belasco reveals to Black Cat that he summoned her there for a reason and considers MJ &quot;a charming bonus&quot;. Over dinner he explains to them that he once had a Soul Sword that he made with the help of the Elder Gods, and used to rule over Limbo until the Gods confiscated it from him as a punishment and Magik overthrew him with her own Soul Sword. The Elder Gods put the sword in the Screaming Castle, a place he could never get to until Chasm and Madelyne Pryor&#x27;s demonic invasion of New York created an opportunity for him. He wanted the two of them to steal back the sword for him so he could re-conquer Limbo and agreed to send them back to Earth once they&#x27;d done so. Upon entering the castle the two are attacked by the castles cannibalistic prisoners, with Mary Jane reluctantly using her powers after explaining to Black Cat that her powers work by creating a roulette wheel and she isn&#x27;t sure what will happen if she gets three skulls. The cannibals chase them to a bottomless pit, but Mary Jane and Black Cat are saved by S&#x27;ym.

===The Secret of Paul Rabin===
A few months after the ordeal in Limbo, Mary Jane prepares for a trip to the park with her family, when suddenly a blizzard hits the city. At the centre of the blizzard is a being the children identify as the &quot;Scribble Man&quot;, MJ urges Paul to take the children to safety while she heads towards the scene of the disruption. Paul tells Mary Jane to &#x27;remember how this all works&#x27; and promises to catch up with her once the children are safe. Mary Jane frantically calls Peter on the phone, telling him that &#x27;he&#x27; has returned.

This individual is Benjamin Rabin, the emissary of the Mayan god of mischief Wayeb&#x27;. It is he who confronted Peter and MJ in their apartment at the close of the &#x27;Beyond&#x27; event one year ago. After battling Spider-Man in New York, Rabin branded both Peter and Mary Jane with the mark of sacrifice and sent them into an alternate future, it is there that Peter and MJ met Paul. Paul explains Spider-Man is crucial to completing a ceremony that will enable Wayeb&#x27; to seize control of the Earth, he develops a device with which to transport him back to Earth, Peter insists Mary Jane go back, but when Wayeb&#x27; attacks them, Mary Jane triggers the teleportation device and sends Peter back, splintering Wayeb&#x27; in half. Mary Jane is left trapped in the other realm with Paul while Peter and what remains of Wayeb&#x27; crash down to Earth, creating the crater in Pennsylvania. Due to the alternative passage of time in Paul&#x27;s dimension, Mary Jane spends four years there and she and Paul depend on one another for survival, ultimately adopting two young children, who Mary Jane names Romey Stephanie Watson and Owen Watson. Peter, with the aid of Norman Osborn, was able to return for them, only to find MJ unwilling to part with her new family. Unbeknownst to either MJ or Peter, this was due to a curse inflicted upon Mary Jane by Rabin, who prayed to his gods that MJ would, in time, come to &#x27;accept the chains&#x27; that bind her. Peter eventually deduces that Paul is really the alternate universe son of Rabin the Emissary, Mary Jane reveals Paul confessed this to her, and that Paul is trying to make up for the part he played in helping his father lay waste to the world he came from. In the present, Rabin schemes the death of the &#x27;scarlet woman&#x27; so that he may ascend to godhood. In the final battle with Rabin, Peter discovers Mary Jane has powers and Ms. Marvel dies protecting her from Rabin, who himself is killed by Wayeb&#x27;s sprit for making the wrong sacrifice. Stephanie and Owen are revealed to be magical constructs created by Rabin, the &quot;chains&quot; which he spoke of, and vanish. Now unshackled, MJ grieves along with Peter and Paul.

Unwilling to live in their apartment without the children, Mary Jane and Paul move in with MJ&#x27;s Aunt Anna. Mary Jane and Peter soon mend their friendship yet again and Peter helps MJ with Anna&#x27;s birthday celebrations. Unbeknownst to MJ, the mutant terrorist organization Orchis has laced her aunt&#x27;s supply of Krakoan medicines with a kill code which turns Anna into a feral beast with murder on her mind. Peter and MJ are able to subdue her using MJ&#x27;s sleeping pills and commit her to Ravencroft.

===Debut as Jackpot===

Coping with severe depression over the loss of Owen and Stephanie, Mary Jane is visited by Felicia Hardy, fresh off of ending her own relationship with Peter, she convinces MJ to use the technology of her special watch to help others in need. Felicia supplies Mary Jane with a costume. MJ hears a commotion outside and admits she finally understands Peter&#x27;s mantra of how &quot;with great power there must also come great responsibility&quot;. She heads out into the city as her new costumed alter ego Jackpot.

Shortly after, Mary Jane and Paul are approached by Norman Osborn who warns them that Peter Parker is on the hunt for them. Peter, having been infected with the sins of the former Green Goblin, attacks the two as they flee by car.

Mary Jane confronts Peter, who after realizing that she was the one who started the relationship with Paul, vengefully threatens to make her pay for betraying him. Peter then attempts to kill Paul who Mary Jane manages to rescue by utilizing the powers of her tech watch. When the Queen Goblin interferes and attempts to kill Peter, Mary Jane prevents the attack and protects him, which enables Norman and Kraven the Hunter to succeed in removing the sins from Peter. Upon the removal of the sins, a remorseful Peter is comforted by Mary Jane, who does not blame him for the ordeal they just went through, and the two finally begin to emotionally reconnect.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Mary Jane Watson as Jackpot helped Spider-Man and She-Hulk fight Menagerie members Armadillo and Man-Bull. Then she had a brief fight with Electro II. Jackpot was among the heroes who helped Spider-Man, Miles Morales, She-Hulk, Spider-Woman, and Elektra&#x27;s Daredevil appearance fight Madame Masque&#x27;s group where she interacted with Spider-Boy.

Peter and Mary Jane later meet up at Ravencroft to visit MJ&#x27;s Aunt Anna, where they change out of their costumes around one another. Peter is able to give Anna the cure to the Orchis virus as Spider-Man. An orderly at Ravencroft asks if Peter and MJ are a couple, to which Peter replies that they aren&#x27;t. Aunt Anna privately tells the orderly she blames her niece for their break-up as Peter takes his leave. Peter and MJ spend a few days fighting crime together as partners and discussing their difficulties in moving on from one another. MJ, realizing she&#x27;s not yet over him, tells Peter it is best not to team up together quite so regularly., her Aunt Anna then begins to set Peter up with new blind dates. This leads Peter to start dating a Ravencroft nurse, Shay, although the two decide to be &#x27;non-exclusive&#x27; because of Peter&#x27;s unreliability.

Mary Jane continued to see Peter, inviting him over to have dinner with Paul and herself, and, despite her initial hesitation to team with Peter, she eventually relaxes this stance and again partners with him. Anna and Peter then arrange a double dinner date for the pair and their respective partners. After saving the city from an attack, MJ and Peter head on over to enjoy the date, but not before MJ lets Peter know how appreciative she is of his efforts to rescue her from Rabin&#x27;s dimension. Peter indicates that things will &quot;eventually&quot; work out between them romantically, which MJ does not object to despite presently seeing someone else.

===Venom War===
Peter and MJ would again team together as their costumed alter-egos to deal with the escalating time-spanning conflict between Eddie and Dylan Brock, leading to an outbreak of symbiotes. One such force opposed by Peter and Mary Jane in the crisis is the &#x27;Arachinote&#x27;.

During the crisis, Peter finds himself bonded temporarily again with the original Venom symbiote, Venom continually critiques Mary Jane&#x27;s choice of partner in Paul and reminds Peter of the pain and loss he still feels from Mary Jane&#x27;s rejection of him. When Mary Jane is consumed by the Arachinote, Peter receives a vision from a possible future where Peter ascends to the status of the &quot;King in Black&quot;, the god of all symbiotes, and Mary Jane triumphs over the Arachninote in a test of wills, leaving Paul and becoming Peter&#x27;s queen.

The two end up having a daughter, May, who is driven away from her parents when Mary Jane is consumed by her power and dies, leaving a bitter Peter broken. Peter becomes a destructive force across the universe, and ultimately kills his and Mary Jane&#x27;s daughter. The vision of the future ends, with the symbiote telling Pete that there are no eventualities in a timeline continually in flux. Reassured that this future may not come to pass, Peter vows to rescue Mary Jane from the Arachinote, despite Paul&#x27;s warnings that Mary Jane may likely already be dead. Peter ultimately proves Paul wrong and links to the Arachinote itself to find Mary Jane alive. Meeting up within a psychic dreamscape, the two are able to work together to free themselves and defeat the creature. Peter congratulates Mary Jane for the victory and prepares to leave, to which she asks if he would stay with her to take in the previously defeated Hobgoblin. Peter suggests that she should share the victory with the person she loves instead and leaves, with Mary Jane left looking longingly at him

===All New Venom===

When Peter Parker finds his secret identity compromised and is blackmailed by a crime lord, he turns to Mary Jane for advise, MJ suggests it&#x27;s time he thought of making something of himself beyond just Spider-Man and to put the costume behind him. A stubborn Peter rejects the suggestion, and amidst the heat of an ensuing argument, reminds Mary Jane that the children she raised with Paul are not real. Mary Jane admits to Peter that her stint as Jackpot is only temporary while she deals with her grief 

Sometime later, Mary Jane and Paul take in Dylan Brock as he tries to figure out the identity of a new Venom symbiote host, while Mary Jane&#x27;s experience with the Arachinote has given Paul further cause for concern, causing he and MJ to have fights over her continued activities as Jackpot. The fights are furthered during a heated argument between Paul and Dylan at the dinner table one evening, with MJ pulling Paul aside to remind him of the traumas Dylan has gone through in recent months, Paul argues that trauma is just an excuse for Dylan&#x27;s unruly behaviour. Paul brings up that MJ has been failing to attend couples counselling, Dylan overhears them and encourages both of them to break up, before belittling Paul for his lack of intelligence and common sense in failing to detect the children he and MJ both cared for were illusions. 

==Powers and abilities==
For many decades, Mary Jane had no superpowers, and was simply a talented model, actress, and businesswoman. After her experiences in another world, Mary Jane returned with technology that allowed her to tap into special abilities, with the catch that her abilities can be random, ranging from gaining superhuman physical abilities to basically becoming living silly putty.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Critical reception===
Mike Avila of &quot;Syfy&quot; called Mary Jane &quot;incredibly popular&quot;, saying, &quot;The redheaded girl-next-door — who was teased, but not seen, throughout Spider-Man&#x27;s early years — made the greatest entrance in comic book history in the last page of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #42. The John Romita Sr.-drawn panelintroduced a vivacious redhead (based on Ann Margaret, incidentally) who would eventually become not just the most important person in Peter Parker&#x27;s world, but a comics superstar on her own. No other powerless Marvel character holds a candle to MJ. Not Nick Fury, not Jarvis, not Sharon Carter, not even Aunt May.&quot; Cole Kennedy of &quot;CBR.com&quot; wrote, &quot;In a panel that would be recreated in Spider-Man comics for decades to come, Mary Jane makes her first full appearance with the famous line: &quot;Face it, tiger, you just hit the jackpot.&quot; From that moment on, Mary Jane was entangled in the crazy web of Spider-Man&#x27;s life. She&#x27;s become one of the most popular and recognizable characters in Marvel Comics, starring in several of her own comic book series. If fans look to Marvel&#x27;s multiverse, they&#x27;ll find many fascinating versions of MJ, including some who&#x27;ve developed superpowers themselves.&quot; Darby Hart of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asserted, &quot;Mary Jane Watson has been one of the most significant characters in the world of Spider-Man since her debut and has grown far beyond the standard girlfriend or damsel in distress stock figure that was common in comics at the time of her inception in the 1960s. Her greatest comic book stories have shown her to be one of the most independent and courageous characters in the Marvel Universe.&quot;

==Literary reception==
===&quot;Amazing Mary Jane&quot; - 2019===
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Amazing Mary Jane&quot; #1 was the 6th best selling comic book in October 2019.

Mike Fugue of &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked &quot;Amazing Mary Jane&quot; #1 2nd in their &quot;Comics You Need To Read This Week&quot; list, stating, &quot;&quot;The Amazing Mary Jane&quot; #1 is a smart, topical, and often hilarious debut starring everyone&#x27;s favorite redhead, in her very first solo series. Leah Williams&#x27; script shines and balances lighthearted quips with serious social commentary masterfully. Carlos Gomez&#x27;s artwork is gorgeous and while he doesn&#x27;t get an opportunity to illustrate larger-than-life battles, there is an urgency to his visual pacing and still manages to pull off show-stopping panels. This book is a lot of fun and manages to be so without feeling too twee.&quot;

===&quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; - 2022===
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 was the 21st best selling comic book in January 2022.

Sayantan Gayen of &quot;CBR.com&quot; referred to &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 as a &quot;thrilling tale peppered with drama and intrigue,&quot; writing, &quot;It is not an exaggeration to say that &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 features one of the best Marvel crossovers in recent history.

Mary Jane and Black Cat may look at each other as romantic rivals, but the instant bonding between the two and the comfort they feel in each other&#x27;s company is heartwarmingly beautiful to see. &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 is an enthralling and charming tale.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
When the Anti-Mutant group known as the Human Coalition decided to also target the Mutates, Peter send his pregnant wife Mary Jane away to France to ensure her safety.

===&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: The Daily Comic Strip&quot;===

As a major character in the comic strip version of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, Mary Jane was a prominent character, flirting with Peter and serving as a persistent love interest. Mary Jane spent many years of the strip employed at a computer store. Peter would propose to Mary Jane several times in the strip only for her to reject these advances. Unlike her 616 variant, Mary Jane did not have existing knowledge of Peter&#x27;s duel identity, only finding out when Peter finally confessed during the 1986 run of comic strips. Peter would propose to Mary Jane once again but she feared accepting would mean they would have children that could be afflicted with side-effects from Peter&#x27;s radioactive blood, and rejected the proposal. Mary Jane briefly departed New York but eventually returned, fully prepared to leave Peter behind once and for all after becoming envious of the attention he was receiving from another woman. Peter assured Mary Jane his heart was always set on her and proposed one more time, this time Mary Jane accepted and they quickly eloped. Peter would then reveal the origin of his powers and the reason he fights crime to her, making her his total confidante.

Like her mainline comics counterpart, despite being deeply in love with Peter, Mary Jane initially found life with him stressful due to his constant activity as Spider-Man, leading her to constantly worry. Peter would often do his best to reassure her that she was the most important thing to him. At one point, Mary Jane suggested a trial separation, though nothing ultimately came to that as Peter temporarily retired to help fix the problems in their marriage, and Mary Jane, reassured, would become more accepting of Peter&#x27;s double life when he resumed his crime fighting activities.

Mary Jane&#x27;s stance on not having children with Peter ultimately also mellowed, and she would discuss the possibility of parenthood several times with her husband in the ensuing years. She would also begin to encourage Peter to spend more time vacationing with her.

In time, Mary Jane grew tired of her job selling computers and seized several opportunities to become an actress, spending time by herself in Los Angeles, with Peter eventually coming over to visit and spend the Christmas holidays with her. Upon completion of her work in Los Angeles, Mary Jane returned home with Peter and took up work in the theatre.

In years past, Mary Jane&#x27;s character constantly needed saving by Spider-Man. This resulted in a complaint by a reader that saw the strip dropped by the Toronto Star in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s. Mary Jane being in constant danger is often because she has risked her life to save Peter by joining in his battles, facing off against Doctor Doom, Morbius, Sabretooth. and Doctor Octopus. Peter and MJ remain happily married despite all of these obstacles. MJ has also covered for Peter by taking photographs of his battles. After taking a photo of Sabretooth, Peter suggested they share the credit for the photo, but MJ refused, insisting she was &quot;just an actress&quot;.

Recently, Mary Jane&#x27;s successful stint with her Broadway play, &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;, has given her and Peter financial stability, though Peter occasionally displays personal jealousy of MJ making more money, a fact MJ has teased him about whenever he contemplates quitting his regular job as a photographer, forcing him to reconsider to soothe his competitive ego. Despite these hang-ups, Peter continues to supports his wife&#x27;s job and ambitions unconditionally. The Parkers at one point discussed moving into a new house using the revenue she was earning from the play, but nothing so far has come of those plans. Mary Jane&#x27;s play was eventually forced to temporarily close due to the theatre needing much-needed maintenance. Producers of an old direct-to-video movie MJ starred in called &quot;Marvella&quot; eventually contacted her and offered her a contract to reprise her role, with a three-month filming schedule in New York. The filming brought her and Peter into conflict with Peter&#x27;s old foe Mysterio.

During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event, the pair were visited by Morlun. Despite Morlun being a match for Peter&#x27;s strength, MJ valiantly stands up to the intruder and encourages her husband. Due to the temporal instability affecting this reality, Morlun quickly realizes it will take weeks to accomplish a simple feat. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors then pulls him out of the reality, and privately elects to rebel against his masters, preserving this universe within a pocket dimension and safeguard it from any further Inheritor attacks. This action also prevents this universe from being affected by the reality-shattering events of Secret Wars, and thus it does not form a part of the patchwork planet Battleworld.

During production of &quot;Marvella II&quot;, a brainwashed Harry Osborn, in the guise of The Hobgoblin, attacked her and Peter. The Black Widow, Natasha Romanov offered to serve as MJ&#x27;s bodyguard for the duration of filming, but Mary Jane grew envious of the Black Widow spending time investigating Harry with her husband. Eventually Harry was stopped and Natasha made it clear to Mary Jane she had no interest in Peter romantically.

Following adventures in which she was pursued romantically by Sub-Mariner and Xanadu, Mary Jane learned that &quot;Marvella II&quot; had been given a theatrical release, and that she was to commence a publicity tour across the nation. She and Peter journeyed to Los Angeles by car, stopping in New Mexico along the way to team with Rocket Raccoon against the likes of Ronan the Accuser and a Kree sentry.

Peter and MJ briefly part ways when Peter decides to attend his Aunt&#x27;s wedding to the Mole Man, while MJ moves forward with the tour. After an adventure with Mole Man (who calls off the wedding to rule over his people once more), Peter reunites with MJ in Florida where they help Bruce Banner battle The Lizard. MJ resumes her tour while Peter returns to New York. During a battle with The Kingpin, Mary Jane&#x27;s theatre is destroyed by a helicopter crash. MJ catches wind of this on the news, but is not angry with Peter. She returns home and tells Peter &quot;Marvella II&quot; was not received well critically and is projected to bomb. She suggests she and Peter spend time in Australia until her play can be moved to a new theatre venue. When Peter was taken over by the Purple Man, Mary Jane teamed up with Luke Cage to free him. Afterwards, Peter and MJ headed off to Australia, at which point the newspaper strip concluded.

===&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;===

Following on from the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, where deadly incursions have laid waste to most of the multiverse, Battleworld, a planet composed of the remains of alternate realities, is created by Doctor Doom and Doctor Strange, with each reality on the world divided into different domains. In this domain called the Regency, Mary Jane is married to Peter and they have a daughter named Annie May Parker. Spider-Man is seemingly the only hero left in the domain after the powerful Regent (Augustus Roman) kills the Avengers and establishes himself as ruler of the domain, with Peter opting to retire as Spider-Man to raise Annie and live up to his vows as a father. Peter did not fight Regent initially to protect his family from Venom and ends up killing Eddie Brock in the process at Mary Jane&#x27;s request.

Eight years later, Mary Jane is still struggling as an actress, while her husband is forced to make money off of photos he cannot publish for fear of making The Regent&#x27;s forces look bad. Mary Jane takes Annie to school and instructs her not to reveal her powers in public even if the situation calls for it. However, they are forced to confront Regent eventually and stand their ground with some of the remaining heroes. After Annie gains a costume and assists her father in combat, Mary Jane obtains armor that acts similarly to Regent&#x27;s tech which drained the powers of heroes to make him stronger to assist her family. She and Peter defeat the tyrant and resume their peaceful family life with Annie.

In the follow-up series, Mary-Jane uses a modified version of the armor she used in the fight against Regent, which now replicates Spider-Man&#x27;s powers and allows her to assist her family as Spinneret. However, every time she taps into Peter&#x27;s powers, it weakens him significantly. She now operates her own clothing store in addition to being a mother and superhero.

In an attempt to spare Peter from this, Mary Jane learns of a bio-enhanced suit in the possession of old family friend Liz Allan, and acquires it from her. However, the suit is revealed to be the Venom symbiote, which briefly attempts to take control of Mary Jane and use her against Peter, attempting to gain revenge for Peter killing Eddie Brock. Peter uses the Regent tech to weaken the symbiote, allowing Mary Jane to retaliate and bring the symbiote under her control. The symbiote is eventually destroyed in their final battle with the Green Goblin and she continues raising Annie into her teenage years, designing a new costume for her older daughter in the process. Mary Jane takes the moniker Spinneret and Annie goes by Spiderling.

It is implied that the 616 Peter, Mary Jane, and Regent retain memories of their counterparts from this Battleworld.

The Parker family of this world finally meet the Peter Parker of Earth 616 in the 2018 event &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;. Peter suggests they look after the now infant and helpless Inheritors, but the Parkers stress to him that taking care of one kid is enough. The adventure also reveals their daughter Annie is part of the Spider-Scroll prophecy, the &quot;Pattern Maker&quot;.

The main threat these Avengers face is Phalanx-versions of most of their friends and millions of innocent humans. Sunfire manages to return to Mary-Jane for some time, although none of their friends know how long this will be. They resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left, which ends when dimensional energies snatch Sunfire away again during an almost shared bath.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
The 2005 &quot;House of M&quot; crossover series version of Mary Jane is a world-famous actress, and she is one of the few humans that the mutant population likes. She has co-starred in movies with Spider-Man, who has led the mutant population to believe that he is a mutant, when in fact he is not. In her latest movie, she plays Spider-Man&#x27;s real-life wife, Gwen Stacy. Mary Jane is also in a relationship with Tony Stark and also there were rumours circulating in the newspaper that they are married secretly.

===Incredible Hercules===

She reappears in an alternative reality and is later seen being eaten by a zombified Sinister Six that the original zombie Spider-Man accidentally created when he succumbed to his hunger while trying to stop his enemies.

===MC2===

In the &quot;MC2&quot; universe, which depicts an alternative future timeline for the Marvel Universe, Mary Jane remains married to Peter Parker. Peter&#x27;s original clone Kaine reunited Mary Jane with her baby daughter in this continuity. Kaine had found the child living with agents of Norman Osborn. Mary Jane&#x27;s daughter became Spider-Girl, alias May &quot;Mayday&quot; Parker. Many years later, after a complicated pregnancy, Mary Jane would give birth to a baby son, Benjamin. She is a respected fashion designer and businesswoman, secretly opening a store selling Spider-Girl related merchandise to pay for May&#x27;s and Ben&#x27;s educations. She has recently become a guidance counselor at May&#x27;s school, where she learns of the anti-mutant group &quot;Humanity First&quot;. She also becomes a mother figure to April Parker, the unstable symbiotic clone of Mayday for a time.

While caring for Baby May, Alison Mongraine became quite attached to the girl. Because of this, she returns years later to make contact with May. May and Mary Jane forgive Alison, who sincerely regrets her crime and loves the girl like her own child.

During the Spider-Verse event, the Parkers come under attack from Daemos, brother to Morlun, and a member of a powerful dimension-hopping family of parasites called Inheritors, who, like Morlun, feed on the animal totems of the living. As Daemos brings the Parker home crashing down around them, Mary Jane hands over Baby Benjamin to her daughter and instructs her to keep him safe, while she elects to stay behind and assist her husband in delaying the Inheritor. Mary Jane is heard to scream off-panel as Mayday evacuates the house with her brother. Peter is shown to have perished at Daemos&#x27; hand. Mayday is saved by other Spider-Men from alternate realities who have been trying to rescue as many Spiders as possible from the Inheritors, and she vows to kill Daemos and avenge her fallen family. It is later revealed Benjy is the &quot;scion&quot; sought after by the Inheritors who will play a major part in a prophecy that will lead to their defeat. Ultimately, Baby Benjy is rescued and Mayday instead shows mercy to the Inheritors when she is presented with an opportunity to slay that family&#x27;s own father Solus.

When Mayday returns to her home dimension, she discovers her boyfriend Wes and her mother are alive, MJ having managed to pull Wes out of the house before it collapsed. MJ confirms to Mayday that her husband is dead, but that he would be glad to know his family are safe and sound. MJ suggests Mayday wear her father&#x27;s costume in his honor. Mayday decides to retire from being Spider-Girl and temporarily adopts the name Spider-Woman.

In &quot;Spider-Verse Team-Up #3&quot;, while in hiding on a radiation-ravaged Earth inhabited by an alternate version of Peter&#x27;s Uncle Ben, a grieving Mayday confesses to this Ben that she hopes there are variants of her and her brother who are still together with their families. This was intended by the original &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; creative team as an &#x27;out&#x27; for their loyal long-term readership, implying that the Mayday featured in the Spider-Verse event was herself just one of many similar variants and not necessarily the &#x27;original&#x27; that Marvel had promoted for twelve years. &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; scribe Dan Slott would go on to strongly contest this on message forums.

In the follow-up event, &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;, Mayday reacts to a romantic kiss between the Peter and Mary Jane of the &quot;Renew Your Vows&quot; reality, mentioning that her mother&#x27;s biggest desire is to also kiss her husband one last time. It is revealed at the conclusion of the story that the mystical Spider-Totem known as The Other has resurrected her father back on her world. Upon his revival, MC2 Peter was captured by Shathra and imprisoned within her nest, as he could not be corrupted by her, but his daughter Mayday is not so fortunate. He and his fellow prisoners are later freed by the Order of the Web and they make a defiant stand against Shathra and all the other web warriors infected by her. The Spiders ultimately succeed and father and daughter are reunited. The Other asks Mayday if the true chosen one Cindy Moon can tell him how long he has left to spend in his current form.

With the aid of Arana, Mayday&#x27;s father returned to normal, reconnecting with his family and helping his daughter out in the field as Spider-Man.

During his travels across the multiverse, Bailey Briggs, aka the Spider-Boy of Earth-616, briefly found himself in the MC2 universe. The family took him in and offered him breakfast, Mary Jane offering the distraught Bailey support, before Bailey is pulled away from the family and resumes his travels. Mary Jane hoped that he would be alright.

A year later, Harry breaks up with her and leaves her with a massive fortune after he accidentally killed Peter&#x27;s wife, Gwen Stacy. After Peter and Gwen&#x27;s clones leave New York to begin a new life, she comforts Peter in his apartment.

By 1984, she is now married to Peter and gave birth to two twins named Benjamin and Claire. She grows intolerable of Peter&#x27;s absences as Spider-Man as she takes care of the twins and the elderly May around the time where Peter acquires the black suit. After Peter nearly lets the symbiote take over him while attacking Kraven, she leaves him and takes the twins with her. For the next 11 years, she raises the twins as a single mother in Portland while Peter continues to be CEO of Parker Industries and Spider-Man in New York. After he allows his clone Ben Reilly to take over his life in 1995, he returns to her and the children.

In 2006, Peter returns to New York shortly after Morlun kills Ben to draw the vampire out to him and prevent Tony Stark from taking over his company. As Iron Man forces Peter to participate in the Civil War, Morlun arrives at the Parker residence in Portland and attacks the Parker family. After Benjamin deduces that Morlun is vulnerable when feeding off life force, he allows Morlun to briefly feed of him to protect his mother and allow Claire the chance to impale the vampire on a tree. While he survived the encounter, Morlun&#x27;s attack cripples him for life. In 2019, an elderly Mary Jane and their children unknowingly say goodbye to Peter for the last time before he goes into space and save the world from Doctor Doom&#x27;s reign, which costs him his life. During his final moments, he imagines Mary Jane telling him everything will turn out fine, and he calls her his &quot;jackpot&quot;. Shortly after Peter&#x27;s funeral, Mary Jane meets with the new Spider-Man, Miles Morales, and gives him Peter&#x27;s original suit to give the hero a &quot;fresh start&quot; after Otto Octavius took control of his body.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Reign&quot;===
In the alternative future seen in &quot;Spider-Man: Reign&quot;, Mary Jane died of terminal disease due to prolonged exposure to Peter&#x27;s radioactive body fluids, her last words being &quot;Go...&quot; as he leaped out of a window to respond to sirens. It is believed that Mary Jane was trying to say &quot;Go get &#x27;em, Tiger&quot;. After her death, Peter buried his red and blue costume with her, wearing a black suit until his retirement. However, with the coming of the Sinner Six (and thanks to some encouragement from the tentacles of the now-deceased Doctor Octopus), Peter reclaims his original suit from Mary Jane&#x27;s coffin and returns to his life as Spider-Man. After the Six are defeated and the WEBB surrounding New York is destroyed, Peter visits Mary Jane&#x27;s grave, assuring her that he will be with her again some day, but, for now, he still has his responsibility.

===&quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;===
In &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;, Mary Jane is still a teenager and the book is primarily a teen drama rather than a superhero comic book, although it takes place in a superhero universe with Spider-Man playing a prominent role. In this continuity, Mary Jane is the most popular girl at Midtown High (her high school in Queens, NY) and even has the title of homecoming queen. She is briefly infatuated with Spider-Man and the two go on a date. After their date, she realizes that she would much rather be with Peter Parker. The ongoing series was preceded by two four-issue limited series, &quot;Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane: Homecoming&quot;, intended to appeal to female manga readers and the fans of the Mary Jane novels.

===Spider-Man never existed===
In a world where Peter Parker had never existed, everyone who had known him in the main universe appears more successful, with Mary Jane becoming a successful actress and starring in the blockbuster film Rescue.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
Different versions of Mary Jane have been seen during the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline:

* In Edge of Spider-Verse #4, Sarah Jane appears as is the next-door neighbor of Patton Parnell (the universe&#x27;s Peter Parker).
* In Earth-001, the Inheritors home dimension, Mary Jane Watson appears as a Great Hall Guard.

===Ultimate Marvel===

This version of Mary Jane, first appearing in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #1, attends Midtown High School with Peter Parker and Liz Allan. Originally known as &quot;Mary&quot; to her friends, she later picks up the &quot;MJ&quot; nickname. Unlike the original MJ, Ultimate Mary Jane is a brilliant student and expresses her true feelings instead of masquerading as a party girl. She has an eruptive temper and has even physically attacked some of the bullies at her school, resulting in a detention. At one time, MJ had expressed her wish to become an actress, then a &quot;teacher who cares&quot;. She now has an interest in journalism. She and Peter begin dating in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #13. In that issue she becomes the second person to learn of Peter&#x27;s secret identity and the first Peter reveals it to. She mends Peter&#x27;s spare Spider-Man costumes, once calling herself the Betsy Ross of superheroes. Although Peter and MJ love each other very much, Peter&#x27;s Spider-Man identity places a strain on their relationship. The relationship is further complicated when Gwen Stacy enters their lives.

Later, Peter began to fear for Mary Jane&#x27;s safety more than ever when the Green Goblin kidnaps her and flings her off the Queensboro Bridge in a twisted attempt to gain Peter&#x27;s allegiance. MJ survives, but the experience leaves her traumatized. She later grows angry and jealous when she believes that a new girl, Gwen Stacy, has feelings for Peter. MJ ends their relationship in issue #32, although the pair soon reconciles in issue #41. When MJ&#x27;s father reads her diary and finds her referring to something as the &quot;bridge incident&quot;, he tells MJ that she is not allowed to see Peter anymore. Furious, she runs away to an old factory but Peter finds her. MJ&#x27;s parents separate soon after.

In the &quot;Hobgoblin&quot; arc (#72-78), it was revealed that Harry and Mary Jane engaged in a brief romance around the same time Peter was bitten. Then, long after his father is gunned down as the Green Goblin, Harry tells her that Peter &quot;killed his father&quot;. After realizing his life as a superhero will always endanger MJ, Peter ends their relationship in issue #77. Shortly thereafter, Mary Jane goes out with a character named Mark Raxton. After one date, however, she changes her mind, resolving instead to prove herself to Peter and to get him back. When Raxton asks what MJ finds so special about Parker, she simply replies &quot;Everything&quot;. She has since shown difficulty in moving on from Peter and in dealing with the state of their friendship, especially after Peter has dated Kitty Pryde, but Peter has shown an interest in reconciling their differences, and becoming friends again.

As part of the &quot;Clone Saga&quot; arc, MJ is kidnapped from her bedroom by a facially disfigured clone of Peter Parker who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger from his enemies. He pumps in her bloodstream an unquantified amount of OZ. Upon learning this, she becomes very angry and transforms into a huge, red, goblin-type creature (referred to by Bendis as Ultimate Demogoblin). When the real Peter Parker and Spider-Woman show up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter to render his clone unconscious. MJ is taken to the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Baxter Building and when she wakes up, she is afraid and angry, causing another transformation. She spots the Peter clone who is in the building, calms down once again and reverts to her normal self. She is then given what is believed to be a cure for the effects of the OZ formula.

During the epilogue of the &quot;Clone Saga&quot; arc, Peter and MJ rekindle their romance, much to Kitty&#x27;s dismay. Although MJ seems physically cured, her ordeal has left her badly traumatized, and she suffers from panic attacks and is haunted by the scarred visage of Peter&#x27;s disfigured clone. Sue Storm suggests that Peter keep a close eye on MJ and seek a psychiatrist to help her. In issue #107, MJ sees Peter talking to Kitty and it angers her. Her hand starts to tremble and her fingernails briefly become claws but she calms down, indicating that her cure might not be permanent or complete, but was never explored further. In issue #112, it is seen that Mary Jane daydreams a scene where she fights against Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four in her mutated form.

Mary Jane decides to actively pursue a career in broadcast journalism, and she begins a series of on-location webcast reports in New York with Peter as her cameraman. She constantly messes up her surname, causing her to lose her temper, much to Peter&#x27;s amusement. She eventually helps Kitty Pryde track down Peter when he is captured and unmasked by The Shocker.

In &quot;Death of a Goblin&quot;, when Spider-Man asks why they cannot cure Harry and Norman, one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents tells Peter that the cure for OZ does not work. Later Mary-Jane&#x27;s hand starts to transform, though she controls it.

The third &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man Annual&quot; deals with what is described as a &quot;heavily controversial topic&quot;. Fans have speculated that this will prove to be Peter and MJ exploring a sexual relationship despite their young age; thus far, the only hints of sexual intercourse have been brief encounters interrupted by changes in circumstance (e.g., Aunt May bursting into the room before they can kiss) and an attempt by Wolverine to make some sort of advance to her when he was briefly trapped in Peter&#x27;s body. However, by the end of the story, Peter, despite knowing that he and MJ love each other, knew that they are not ready to go to the next level of their relationship, so the idea is postponed. That issue shows that Mary Jane has a knack as a detective, as she figured out that a police officer was on the take from someone, whom the NYPD has dubbed &quot;Mysterio&quot;, and has the crooked cop set up surveillance equipment at the police department after Peter informed MJ of the police chase. Mysterio later escapes, but not before vowing to get even with Spider-Man.

In the six months since the events of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Peter and Mary Jane have once again broken up and become estranged. Mary Jane especially has become withdrawn and consumed in her work for the school webcast. Although Peter was now in a relationship with Gwen Stacy, he and MJ started to repair their friendship. Gwen eventually broke up with Peter, realizing he loved MJ more. Her appearance has also drastically changed as she now has much shorter hair and wears glasses. She would gradually ditch this look as she and Peter reunited as a couple. Peter would later seemingly perish in battle with Norman Osborn and the Sinister Six while saving his Aunt May&#x27;s life. Mary Jane contemplated writing a tell-all exposé on how Fury had failed Peter after his death, but abandoned the idea when she saw Fury&#x27;s genuine remorse at how he had failed to protect Peter.

When the Peter Parker of Earth-616 briefly crossed into the Ultimate universe, Gwen called Mary Jane to inform her about his presence, but even after seeing the older Peter leave the house, MJ was unable to bring herself to talk to him, running away when Peter noticed her.

It is eventually revealed that Peter somehow survived his fateful ordeal, waking up in an abandoned lab in San Francisco. Peter made his way back to New York and reunited with Mary Jane. The two dug up his grave to find no body in the casket. After reuniting with Aunt May and Gwen, and meeting up with Miles Morales, Peter helped his successor confront Norman Osborn, who indicated his OZ formula had effectively granted any infused with it immortality, himself and Peter included. Upon defeating Osborn, Peter elects to leave New York, with Mary Jane deciding to travel with him, and the two depart the city in her family car.

During the &quot;Secret Wars (2015)&quot; event and the tie-in &quot;Ultimate End&quot;, the Ultimate Universe was destroyed by a reality-breaking Incursion and formed part of the patchwork planet Battleworld. Despite appearances from Miles, 616 Peter, Ganke, Gwen and Aunt May, both Ultimate Peter and Mary Jane are absent from the story.

At the conclusion of the 2017 event &quot;Spider-Men II&quot;, it is revealed that the Ultimate Universe had been restored to the multiverse and that Peter has returned to New York with Mary Jane and had now fully reestablished himself as Spider-Man (Miles Morales having been integrated into Earth 616 history following the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;). Mary Jane makes a brief appearance contacting Peter to let him know he is late for a party.

===Ultimate Universe===
When Maker visited Earth-6160, he remade it into his own image. In this timeline, Peter Parker ends up getting his powers much later in life, while Mary Jane is married to Peter and they have two children named Richard and May.

Mary Jane was with Peter when they dine with Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy at a restaurant. Her PR firm is among the things they talk about.

During breakfast, Mary Jane is among those who see Peter Parker with a black eye as she tends to it. Following Spider-Man and Green Goblin&#x27;s fight with Wilson Fisk in a flashback, Peter continued explaining his injury to his family. After the kids left, Mary Jane figures out that he&#x27;s Spider-Man and is shown his picotech suit as she comes up with the Spider-Man code-name as he takes her out on a webslinging around town.

Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy appear outside of &quot;The Paper&quot; and are unable to enter because Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson left a note stating that something came up.

<text>Bhang (IAST: &quot;Bhāṅg&quot;) is an edible preparation made from the leaves of the cannabis plant originating from the Indian subcontinent. It was used in food and drink as early as 1000 BC in ancient India. Bhang is traditionally distributed during the spring festival of Maha Shivaratri and Holi. Bhang is mainly used in bhang shops, which sell the cannabis-infused Indian drinks bhang lassi and bhang thandai.

==Western documentation==
Garcia de Orta, a Portuguese Jewish physician based in Goa, wrote extensively on &quot;bangue&quot; in his &quot;Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India&quot; (1563), including its recreational use by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and by many Portuguese. He explicitly rejected the notion of the Indian plant that produces &quot;bangue&quot; being the same as the European hemp plant (&quot;alcanave&quot;).

In 1596, a Dutchman, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, wrote three pages on &quot;Bangue&quot; in a work documenting his journeys in the East. He also mentioned the Egyptian hashish, the Turkish boza, Turkish bernavi and the Arabic bursj forms of consumption. Despite the other accounts, the contemporary historian Richard Davenport-Hines lists the late-17th-century and early-18th-century British adventurer Thomas Bowrey as the first Westerner to document the use of bhang.

==Preparation==
Using a mortar and pestle, the leaves of cannabis are ground into a paste which can be added to foods. For a beverage it is mixed with milk and filtered, then often flavored with kusha grass, sugar, fruit, and various spices. In Mathura it can be found in bhang &quot;thandai&quot; and bhang lassi. Bhang is also mixed with ghee and sugar to make a purple halva, and into peppery, chewy little balls called &quot;goli&quot; (which means &quot;tablet&quot; or &quot;pill&quot;) in Hindi. Another form is &quot;bhang chutney&quot;, also called &quot;bhangeera ki chutney&quot;, a dish served in Kumaoni cuisine from Uttarakhand. It is made from grinding cannabis/bhang seeds with mint, tomatoes and different spices.

==Culture==
Bhang is part of the ancient Hindu tradition and custom in the Indian subcontinent. In some parts of rural India, people attribute various medicinal properties to the cannabis plant. If taken in proper quantity, bhang is believed to cure fever, dysentery, and sunstroke, to clear phlegm, aid in digestion, increase appetite, cure speech imperfections and lisping, and give alertness to the body.

Bhang lassi is a preparation of powdered green inflorescence with curd and whey put in a village blender (a hand-blending operation is carried out until the butter rises). It is regarded as tasty and refreshing. It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh has licensed bhang shops, and in many places in India one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis. Some states such as Bihar and West Bengal also allow the production of bhang. States like Rajasthan do not allow production of bhang but do allow procurement and sale of bhang from such states where production is legal.

The tradition of consuming bhang lassi during Holi is particularly common in North India, where Holi itself is celebrated with a fervor unseen elsewhere. Bhang is heavily consumed in Mathura, an ancient town of religious importance to Hindus. Here, the practice is believed to have been introduced by the followers of Shiva and has stayed ever since. They begin the preparation by Sanskrit chants and recitation of prayers. In Mathura, some people take bhang to work up their appetite while others do it to de-stress. But the hub of bhang use is Varanasi, where the bhang is prepared on its famous ghats.

Bhang is also available as bhang goli which is just freshly ground cannabis with water. Apart from this, sweetened bhang golis are also widely available; these are not considered a drug, but a traditional sleeping aid and appetizer. Bhang goli has metabolizing effects after approximately two hours, sending a user into a dreamlike meditational state. Bhang is also part of many Ayurvedic medicinal preparations. Bhang powder is available legally at ayurvedic dispensaries.

==Legality==

The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was the first ever international treaty to have included cannabis (or marijuana) with other drugs and imposed a blanket ban on their production and supply except for medicinal and research purposes. However, the Single Convention&#x27;s definition of &#x27;cannabis&#x27; does not include the leaves of the cannabis plant, thereby preserving the legality of bhang culture in India.

Regardless, as bhang has served such an important role in India&#x27;s culture and spiritual practices, it would be impossible to criminalize cannabis completely in the country. Important festivals such as Holi and Maha Shivratri have traditionally seen people consume bhang during various local festivities. Cultivation of cannabis is government regulated.

=== India ===
According to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985:&quot;cannabis (hemp)&quot; means-

(a) charas, that is, the separated resin, in whatever form, whether crude or purified, obtained from the cannabis plant and also includes concentrated preparation and resin known as hashish oil or liquid hashish;

(b) ganja, that is, the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops), by whatever name they may be known or designated; and

(c) any mixture, with or without any neutral material, of any of the above forms of cannabis or any drink prepared therefrom.As bhang is prepared from the seeds and the leaves of the cannabis plant, it is not banned under the NDPS Act of 1985. However, some states do regulate and ban the sale and consumption of bhang. Bhang can also be used in the form of medicine if the patient has a prescription from an Ayurvedic practitioner.

In states where sale of bhang is legal, bhang &quot;golis&quot; or &quot;golas&quot; are sold openly at places like paan shops with little to no regulation at low prices.

<text>William P. Melchionni (born October 19, 1944) is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA) player. A three time All-Star, Melchionni is one of only four players to win NBA and ABA championships.

==Early life==

Melchionni was a guard from Bishop Eustace Prep (in his hometown of Pennsauken Township, New Jersey). His teams won two state championships.

Melchionni was a collegiate star in the mid-1960s at Villanova University and was the Most Valuable Player in the 1966 NIT, as Villanova finished in third place in the tournament.

Melchionni averaged 27.6 points as a senior at Villanova, as the team finished 18–11. As a junior, in 1964–1965, he averaged 19.4 points for the 23-5 Wildcats, who ended up #8 in the national rankings. In the 1966 season, the Wildcats won 9 of their last 10 games, finishing 3rd in the 1966 National Invitation Tournament, with Melchionni chosen as Tournament MVP. Melchionni scored 1,612 points during his career at Villanova.

Melchionni graduated in 1966 from Villanova with a B.S. Degree in economics.

==Professional career==
Upon graduation from Villanova, Melchionni was a 2nd-round (19th) overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1966 NBA draft. Melchionni joined the Phillips 66ers AAU Elite team before returning to his hometown to join the Philadelphia 76ers in 1966–1967.

Immediately, Melchionni was a key reserve on what is, statistically speaking, the greatest 76ers team ever, the 1967 NBA champions led by Wilt Chamberlain, Luke Jackson, Hal Greer, Chet Walker, Billy Cunningham, and fellow Villanova alum Wali Jones. The team was coached by another AAU Elite alum, Alex Hannum. Melchionni played in 71 games, averaging 4.3 points and 1.3 assists for the championship 76ers.

After another season in Philadelphia, Melchionni then played for the Trenton Colonials of the Eastern Professional Basketball League in 1968–1969.

In 1969–1970, Melchionni found a home in the upstart ABA, joining the New York Nets. With the Nets, he became a 3-time ABA All-Star, leading the league in assists multiple times and winning two more championships. In 1969–1970, he averaged 15.2 points and 5.7 assists; in 1970–1971: 17.6 points and 8.3 assists (leading the ABA); in 1971–1972: 21.0 points and 8.4 assists (leading the ABA); and in 1972–1973 12.3 points and 7.4 assists.

In 1971–1972, Melchionni suffered a broken hand.

In his Nets career, he played alongside Rick Barry and a young Julius Erving. After the Nets drafted future ABA All-Star Brian Taylor in 1972, Melchionni became a key reserve player on the 1974 and 1976 ABA championship teams. He averaged 12.4 points and 6.1 assists in seven seasons with the Nets. In his entire career, Melchionni averaged 10.6 points and 5.0 assists in 646 games.

Of his career, Melchionni said, &quot;With Julius, we won two ABA titles. To be able to say I played with and won championships with Wilt and Julius, arguably two of the top 10 players in basketball history, means something special to me.&quot;

==Post-playing career==
Melchionni became the general manager of the Nets for two years after retiring as a player. Due to financial constraints on the Nets, he was forced to sell Erving to the 76ers to fund the Nets fee for joining the NBA in the ABA-NBA merger. He resigned from the Nets on March 15, 1978. Melchionni worked at Salomon Brothers Investment Bank after leaving the Nets.

==Awards and personal life==

Melchionni played in three ABA All-Star Games, and was named to the All-ABA First Team in 1972. Melchionni led the ABA in assists per game in 1971, 1972, and 1973.

In 1995, Melchionni&#x27;s number 25 jersey was retired by Villanova.

The New Jersey Nets retired Melchionni&#x27;s number 25. His is one of only seven retired Nets jerseys, joining (#3) Dražen Petrović, (#5) Jason Kidd, (#15) Vince Carter, (#23) John Williamson, (#32) Julius Erving, and (#52) Buck Williams

Melchionni was ranked #15 on a list of All-Time Nets players.

Melchionni&#x27;s brother Gary was a two-year captain for Duke and was an All-ACC performer. Gary&#x27;s son and Bill&#x27;s nephew, Lee Melchionni, played for Duke from 2002 to 2006. Bill&#x27;s brother Bob followed Bill at Villanova and played from 1966 through 1969.

<doc id="281923" wikidata="Q390115" url="?curid=281923" title="Hurricane Mitch">
<text>Hurricane Mitch was the second-deadliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record. Mitch caused 11,374 fatalities in Central America in 1998, including approximately 7,000 in Honduras and 3,800 in Nicaragua due to cataclysmic flooding from the slow motion of the storm. It was the deadliest hurricane in Central American history, surpassing Hurricane Fifi–Orlene, which killed slightly fewer people in the same area in 1974. Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in the satellite era, and the second-deadliest on record in the Atlantic, only behind the Great Hurricane of 1780 which killed at least 22,000 people.

The thirteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season, Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on 22 October, and after responding to extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category 5 status, the highest possible rating on the Saffir–Simpson scale. After drifting southwestward and weakening, the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal Category 1 hurricane. Mitch roved through Central America, regenerated in the Bay of Campeche, and ultimately impacted Florida as a strong tropical storm. It then became extratropical and accelerated northeastward across the North Atlantic, before dissipating on 9 November. At the time, Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. In addition, Mitch is the ninth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record, tied with Hurricane Dean in 2007 in terms of pressure.

Being &quot;the deadliest Atlantic hurricane&quot; in over 200 years, Mitch caused catastrophic impacts across its path, but the most disastrous impacts came from Honduras, which suffered over half of the total deaths. The president of Honduras, Carlos Roberto Flores, estimated that Mitch set back about 50 years of economic development. The storm wrecked about 35,000 houses and damaged another 50,000, leaving up to 1.5 million people homeless, about 20 percent of the country&#x27;s population. Mitch directly caused $2.005 billion in damage, with an additional $1.8 billion in indirect costs. Most of the damage were ruined crops, and cash crop exports were cut by 9.4 percent in 1999, largely due to the storm. Over 70 percent of the transportation infrastructure was damaged, mostly damaged highways and bridges. Widespread areas experienced power outages, and about 70 percent of the country lost its water sources after the storm. In Tegucigalpa, a large landslide affected three neighborhoods and formed a temporary dam. Throughout the country, there were at least 7,000 fatalities, some reported in each department. Following the storm, officials in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8 billion over a several-year period. Despite this, the gross domestic product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9 percent in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15 days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks of various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages.

Due to the slow motion from 29 October to 3 November, Hurricane Mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, with unofficial reports of up to . Deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history after the Great Hurricane of 1780; at least 11,374 people were confirmed to have been killed with over 11,000 left missing by the end of 1998; the true death toll is unknown. Additionally, roughly 2.7 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane. Total damages caused by the hurricane were estimated to be around $6 billion (1998 USD). The name &quot;Mitch&quot; was retired, and will not be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone.

== Meteorological history ==

Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October 22 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October 10. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to extremely favorable conditions, including warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October 24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October 25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day.

At peak intensity, Mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , which at the time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south, due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October 29 with winds of .

While over land, Mitch moved slowly westward through Central America, while continuing to produce deep convection over waters. The surface circulation dissipated on November 1. The next day, the remnants of Mitch reached the Bay of Campeche. On November 3, the remnants redeveloped into a tropical storm just off the coast of the Mexican state of Campeche, and a day later the storm made another landfall just north of the city of Campeche. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucatán peninsula and re-entering the Gulf of Mexico. The storm retained winds of before it made a final landfall near Naples, Florida on November 5. Shortly after crossing the state, Mitch transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The NHC tracked this storm until November 9, when former Hurricane Mitch passed north of Scotland.
== Preparations ==
Due to the threat, the government of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category 4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of Hurricane Hattie 37 years earlier. Guatemala issued a purple alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflowing rivers. By the time hurricane Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.
== Impact ==
=== Central America ===

Hurricane Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since the Great Hurricane of 1780, displacing the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 as the second-deadliest on record. Nearly 11,000 people were confirmed dead, and almost as many reported missing. Deaths were mostly from flooding and mudslides in Central America, where the slow-moving hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly of rain. The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes, with total damage amounting to over $5 billion (1998 USD, $6 billion 2006 USD), most of which was in Honduras and Nicaragua. Prior to Mitch, the deadliest hurricane in Central America was Hurricane Fifi in 1974, which killed an estimated 8,000–10,000.

==== Honduras ====

While offshore northern Honduras, Hurricane Mitch passed over Guanaja island. High waves eroded northern coastlines and damaged lagoons. Most of the Bay Islands had damage to their water facilities. Two days of winds exceeding destroyed nearly all of the plants and trees on Guanaja, uprooting or knocking down almost the entire mangrove forest. It is estimated that the hurricane produced waves of in height.
While moving slowly for several days offshore Honduras, Hurricane Mitch drew moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, producing high amounts of rainfall of over per day. The highest official total was at Choluteca, which represented more than half of the annual precipitation average; at the same location, fell in a 24-hour period on October 31, which was more than double of the previous record set in 1985. There were unofficial rainfall totals in Central America as high as ; rain gauges in mountainous areas were washed away. The high rainfall caused many rivers in the country to overflow &quot;to an unprecedented extent this century&quot;, as described by the United Nations. The rainfall collected in rivers, causing extensive river flooding across the country. The greatest depth recorded was on the Ulúa River near Chinda, whilst the greatest width recorded was on the Río Lean near Arizona. The rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country. In the country&#x27;s interior, particularly the southern portion, the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides, many of them shallow and about 95% in the form of debris flow. However, two earthflows caused significant damage near Tegucigalpa.
Hurricane Mitch wrought significant damage to Honduras, affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated that Mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country. An estimated 70–80% of transportation network was destroyed, including most bridges and secondary roads, amounting to $236 million in damage. Hurricane Mitch left widespread power outages after damaging more than of power lines and several power plants. About 70% of Honduras lost access to fresh water after the storm, although many rural areas had already been experiencing water shortages. The combined damage to transportation, communication, utilities, including power and water, was estimated at $665 million.

High water levels along the Choluteca River affected the capital, Tegucigalpa, reaching levels above their banks. The floods damaged about one-third of buildings, including some more than 350 years old. Across Honduras, agriculture sustained serious damage, with initial estimates of 70% of crops destroyed. About 50,000 bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1 billion, which would take the country years to recover. Honduras&#x27;s Social Fund for Housing estimated that 35,000 houses nationwide were destroyed with another 50,000 damaged, leaving 1.5 million people homeless – about 20% of the total population. This was the highest number of victims from any natural disaster in Honduras&#x27;s history. Overall, Hurricane Mitch killed about 7,000 people in Honduras, and damage was estimated at L52,345,000,000 ($3.8 billion), of which $2.005 billion was from direct damages and the remainder from indirect costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras&#x27;s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

==== Nicaragua ====

Though Mitch never entered Nicaragua, its large circulation caused extensive rainfall, with estimates of over . In some places, as much as of rain fell on coastal areas. The flank of the Casita Volcano failed and turned into a lahar from excessive rain. The resulting mudslide ultimately covered an area long and wide.

Two million people in Nicaragua were directly affected by the hurricane. Across the country, Mitch&#x27;s heavy rains damaged 17,600 houses and destroyed 23,900, displacing 368,300 of the population. 340 schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed. Sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged, and, combined with property, damage totaled to $300 million (1998 USD).
Transportation was greatly affected by the hurricane, as well. The rainfall left 70% of the roads unusable or destroyed and greatly damaged 92 bridges. Over of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially in the northern part of the country and along portions of the Pan-American Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300 million (1998 USD). Agricultural losses were significant, including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185 million (1998 USD).

The situation was further compounded by a total of 75,000 live land mines—left over from the Contra insurgency of the 1980s—that were calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters.

In all, Hurricane Mitch caused at least 3,800 fatalities in Nicaragua, of which more than 2,000 were killed in the towns of El Provenir and Rolando Rodriguez from the landslide at the Casita volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at $1 billion (1998 USD).

==== Rest of Central America ====

Due to Mitch&#x27;s large circulation, it dropped heavy precipitation as far south as Panama and Colombia, especially in the Darién and Chiriquí provinces. The flooding washed away a few roads and bridges, and damaged numerous houses and schools, leaving thousands homeless. The hurricane left three casualties in Panama.

In Costa Rica, Mitch dropped heavy rains, causing flash flooding and mudslides across the country, mostly in the northeastern part of the country. The storm impacted 2,135 homes to some degree, of which 241 were destroyed, leaving 4,000 homeless. Throughout the country, the rainfall and mudslides affected 126 bridges and or roads, mostly on the Inter-American Highway which was affected by Hurricane Cesar, two years prior. Mitch affected of crop lands, causing damage to both export and domestic crops. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $92 million in damage (1998 USD) and seven deaths.

While drifting through El Salvador, the hurricane dropped immense amounts of precipitation, resulting in flash flooding and mudslides through the country. Multiple rivers, including the Río Grande de San Miguel and the Lempa River overflowed, contributing to overall damage. The flooding damaged more than 10,000 houses, leaving around 84,000 homeless and forcing 500,000 to evacuate. Crop damage was severe, with serious flooding occurring on of pasture or crop land. The flooding destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. There were heavy losses in livestock as well, including the deaths of 10,000 cattle. Total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to $154 million (1998 USD). In addition, the flooding destroyed two bridges and damaged of unpaved roads. In all, Mitch caused nearly $400 million in damage (1998 USD) and 240 deaths.

Similar to the rest of Central America, Mitch&#x27;s heavy rains caused mudslides and severe flooding over Guatemala. The flooding destroyed 6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the country. The most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged totaling to $48 million (1998 USD). Export crops such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well, with damage amounting to $325 million (1998 USD). Damage to plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country, flooding damaged or destroyed of roads, of which nearly were sections of major highways. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD) and 268 deaths in Guatemala. In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.

In Belize, the hurricane was less severe than initially predicted, though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country. Numerous rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was beneficial to trees in mountainous areas. The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people died because of the hurricane.
In Mexico, Mitch produced gusty winds and heavy rains on the Yucatán Peninsula, with Cancún on the Quintana Roo coast being the worst hit. Nine people were killed from the flooding, though damage was relatively minimal. The maximum 24-hour rainfall total from Mitch was in Campeche, while the highest rainfall total was in Ciudad del Carmen.

=== Caribbean Sea ===
Mitch was also responsible for the loss with all hands of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises&#x27; schooner &quot;Fantome&quot;. The story was recorded in the book &quot;The Ship and The Storm&quot; by Jim Carrier. The schooner, which was sailing near the center of the hurricane, experienced over waves and over winds, causing her to sink off the coast of Honduras.

On the south coast of Cuba, the hurricane caused waves of up to high and winds gusts peaking at , causing numerous tourists and workers on the Isle of Youth and Cayo Largo del Sur to leave for safer grounds.

In Jamaica, where officials declared hurricane warnings 12 hours prior to its closest approach, Mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days. Strong waves hit western Jamaica, with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly in height. The rainfall in outer rainbands, at times severe, flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris. One house in Spanish Town collapsed from the flooding, leaving four homeless. Many other homes and buildings were flooded, forcing many to evacuate. A river in northeastern Jamaica overflowed its banks, while heavy rainfall across the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides. In all, Mitch killed three people on Jamaica.

On the Cayman Islands, the hurricane caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion. Strong waves damaged or destroyed many docks on the south shore of the islands, and also sank one dive ship near Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled.

=== Florida and Europe ===

Then a tropical storm, Mitch caused a storm surge of up to in the lower Florida Keys before making landfall on the Florida west coast. Key West International Airport reported peak wind gusts of and sustained winds of , the only report of tropical storm force in the state. Offshore, the Fowey Rocks Light reported wind gusts of . In addition, Mitch caused moderate rainfall, peaking at in Jupiter, though some estimates indicate localized totals of up to . The storm spawned five tornadoes over the state, the strongest of which was rated F2.

In the Florida Keys, multiple buildings that had been damaged by Hurricane Georges were leveled by Mitch. Tornadoes from the storm damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state, in addition to injuring 65 people. Gusty winds left 100,000 without power during the storm&#x27;s passage. In all, Mitch caused $40 million in damage (1998 USD) in Florida and two deaths from drowning when two boats capsized.

As an extratropical cyclone, Mitch passed west of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In Ireland, the storm produced gusts as high as and waves. The winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving over 30,000 homes without power. One tree fell onto a car in Louth, severely injuring the driver. In Dublin, high winds knocked the roof off of a building, and several other buildings nationwide were damaged. The storm caused airports to close and ferry service to be suspended.

== Aftermath ==
As a result of the extreme damage and loss of life caused by Hurricane Mitch, the name &quot;Mitch&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization following this storm, and will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Matthew&quot; for the 2004 season.

After the disaster, countries around the world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3 billion (1998 USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.
Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structurally improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.

Following the passage of Mitch, disease outbreaks occurred throughout Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34 people. Guatemala was most affected by the bacterium, where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.

While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch&#x27;s strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm&#x27;s immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within the coral. However, the hurricane&#x27;s upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef.

Mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that Carlos Roberto Flores, the president of Honduras, claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them a few days after the storm. They also at first offered only $2 million (1998 USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70 million (1998 USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4 million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.

<doc id="281954" wikidata="Q2110774" url="?curid=281954" title="Hurricane Floyd">
<text>Hurricane Floyd was a very powerful and large tropical cyclone which struck the Bahamas and the East Coast of the United States. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. Floyd triggered the fourth largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Rita) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were ordered from their homes as it approached. The hurricane formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from September 7 to 19, becoming extratropical after September 17, and peaked in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane. It was among the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its strength ever recorded, in terms of gale-force diameter.

Floyd was once forecast to strike Florida, but turned away. Instead, Floyd struck the Bahamas at peak strength, causing heavy damage. It then moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States, causing massive evacuations and costly preparations from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm weakened significantly, however, before striking the Cape Fear region, North Carolina as a very strong Category 2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the Mid-Atlantic region and into New England.

The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in Eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area already hit by Hurricane Dennis just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 85 fatalities and $6.5 billion (1999 USD) in damage. Due to the destruction, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Floyd&quot; and replaced it with &quot;Franklin&quot;.

==Meteorological history==

Floyd originated from a tropical wave that exited the west coast of Africa on September 2. The wave moved generally westward, presenting a general curvature in its convection, or thunderstorms, but little organization at first. By September 5, a center of circulation was evident within the convective system. Over the next day, the thunderstorms increased in intensity as they organized into a curved band. Aided by favorable outflow, the system organized further into Tropical Depression Eight late on September 7, located about east of the Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge of high pressure to its north, the nascent tropical depression moved to the west-northwest, where environmental conditions favored continued strengthening, including progressively warmer water temperatures. On issuing its first advisory, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated that the depression would intensify into a hurricane within three days, a forecast that proved accurate. On its second advisory, NHC forecaster Lixion Avila stated that the depression had &quot;all the ingredients...that we know of...to become a major hurricane eventually.&quot;

Early on September 8, the depression became sufficiently well-organized for the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Floyd. The storm had a large circulation, but Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, which resulted in only slow strengthening. The first Hurricane Hunters mission occurred on September 9, which observed the developing storm. On September 10, Floyd intensified into a hurricane about 230 mi (370 km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Around that time, the track shifted more to the northwest, steered by a tropical upper tropospheric trough north of Puerto Rico. An eye developed in the center of the hurricane, signaling strengthening. On September 11, Hurricane Floyd moved through the upper-level trough, which, in conjunction with an anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean, disrupted the outflow and caused the winds to weaken briefly. The hurricane re-intensified on September 12 as its track shifted more to the west, steered by a ridge to the north. That day, the NHC upgraded Floyd to a major hurricane, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
Over a 24-hour period from September 12–13, Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified, aided by warm waters east of The Bahamas. During that time, the maximum sustained winds increased from , making Floyd a strong Category 4 hurricane. This was based a 90% reduction of an observation by the Hurricane Hunters, which recorded flight-level winds of 171 mph (276 km/h). Around the same time, the pressure dropped to , which was the fourth-lowest pressure for a hurricane not to reach Category 5 intensity in the Atlantic Ocean – only Hurricanes Iota, Gloria and Opal had lower pressures than Floyd. Around this time, tropical cyclone forecast models suggested an eventual landfall in the Southeastern United States from Palm Beach, Florida to South Carolina.

At its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of , making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded. For about 12 hours, Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category 5 status while crossing The Bahamas. Late on September 13, the eye of the hurricane passed just north of San Salvador and Cat Islands. On the next day, the hurricane made landfalls on Eleuthera and Abaco islands. During this time, Floyd underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, in which an outer eyewall developed, causing the original eye to dissipate near Eleuthera. This caused a temporary drop in sustained winds to Category 3 status, only for Floyd to restrengthen briefly to a Category 4 on September 15.

While approaching the southeastern United States, a strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, which had been steering Floyd for several days. The break in the ridge caused Floyd to turn to the northwest. After the hurricane completed its eyewall replacement cycle, Floyd had a large 57 mi (93 km) eye. The large storm gradually weakened after exiting The Bahamas, due to drier air and increasing wind shear. On September 15, Floyd paralleled the east coast of Florida about 110 mi (170 km) offshore, as it accelerated to the north and north-northeast. At around 06:30 UTC on September 16, Hurricane Floyd made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina with winds of , a Category 2. The eyewall had largely dissipated by that time. Continuing northeastward along a cold front, Floyd moved through eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, weakening to tropical storm status by late on September 16. The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics as it quickly moved through the Delmarva Peninsula, eastern New Jersey, Long Island, and New England. Late on September 17, Floyd transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near the coast of southern Maine. The storm continued to the northeast, passing through New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland on September 18. On the following day, a larger extratropical storm over the North Atlantic Ocean absorbed what was once Hurricane Floyd.
== Preparations ==
Early in Floyd&#x27;s duration, the hurricane posed a threat to the Lesser Antilles, prompting tropical storm watches for Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint Martin, and Saint Barthelemy. After the storm bypassed the region, the government of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas, as well as hurricane warnings for the central and northwestern Bahamas.

Although Floyd&#x27;s track prediction was above average while out at sea, the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years. The official forecasts did not predict Floyd&#x27;s northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall. At some point, the NHC issued a hurricane warning for nearly all of the East Coast of the United States, from Florida City, Florida, to Plymouth, Massachusetts; however, only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane-force winds. The last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during Hurricane Donna in 1960.
Initial fears were of a direct hit as a large Category 4 hurricane in Florida, potentially costlier and deadlier than Hurricane Andrew had been in 1992. In preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall, more than one million Florida residents were told to evacuate, of which 272,000 were in Miami-Dade County. U.S. President Bill Clinton declared a federal state of emergency in both Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the storm&#x27;s approach. As the storm turned to the north, more people were evacuated as a progressively larger area was threatened. The massive storm prompted what was then the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history, with around 2.6 million evacuating coastal areas in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
With the storm predicted to hit near Cape Canaveral with winds of over , all but 80 of Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s 12,500-person workforce were evacuated. The hangars that house three space shuttles can withstand winds of only , and a direct hit could have resulted in potentially billions of dollars in damage of space equipment. In the theoretical scenario, the damage would be caused by water, always a potential problem in an area only nine feet above sea level. If water entered the facility, it would damage the electronics as well as requiring a complete inspection of all hardware. When Floyd actually passed by the area, Kennedy Space Center only reported light winds with minor water intrusion. Damage was minor overall, and was repaired easily.

A hurricane warning was issued for the North Carolina coastline 27 hours prior to landfall. However, due to the size of the storm, initial forecasts predicted nearly all of the state would be affected in one form or another. School systems and businesses as far west as Asheville shut down for the day landfall was predicted. As it turned out, only the Coastal Plain sustained significant damage; much of the state west of Raleigh escaped unscathed. In New York City, public schools were closed on September 16, 1999, the day Floyd hit the area. This was a rare decision by the city, as New York City public schools close on average once every few years. Before Floyd, the last time New York City closed its schools was for the Blizzard of 1996. After Floyd, the next time its public schools would close was due to a blizzard on March 5, 2001. Walt Disney World also closed for the first time in its history due to the storm. The resort would later close during hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004, Matthew in 2016, Irma in 2017, Dorian in 2019, Ian in 2022, and Milton in 2024.

A state of emergency was declared in Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey prompting schools statewide to be shut down on September 16. In Delaware, about 300 people evacuated.

In Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued 14 warnings related to Floyd, generating significant media interest. About 100 Sable Offshore Energy Project employees were evacuated to the mainland. In southwestern Nova Scotia, 66 schools were closed, and provincial ferry service with Bar Harbor, Maine was canceled.

== Impact ==

With a death toll of 85, Hurricane Floyd was the deadliest United States hurricane since Hurricane Agnes in 1972. The storm was the third-costliest hurricane in the nation&#x27;s history at the time, with monetary damage estimated at $6.5 billion (1999 USD); it ranked the 19th costliest as of 2017. Most of the deaths and damage were from inland, freshwater flooding in eastern North Carolina.

=== Caribbean ===
Around when Floyd first became a hurricane, its outer bands moved over the Lesser Antilles.

Hurricane Floyd lashed the Bahamas with winds of and waves up to in height. A storm surge inundated many islands with over five ft (1.5 m) of water throughout. The wind and waves toppled power and communication lines, severely disrupting electricity and telephone services for days. Damage was greatest at Abaco Island, Cat Island, San Salvador Island, and Eleuthera Island, where Floyd uprooted trees and destroyed a significant number of houses. Numerous restaurants, hotels, shops, and homes were devastated, severely limiting in the recovery period tourism on which many rely for economic well-being. Damaged water systems left tens of thousands across the archipelago without water, electricity, or food. Despite the damage, however, few deaths were reported, as only one person drowned in Freeport, and there were few injuries reported.

=== Southeastern United States ===

For several days, Hurricane Floyd paralleled the east coast of Florida, spurring widespread evacuations. Ultimately, the storm left $50 million in damage, mostly in Volusia county. There, high winds and falling trees damaged 337 homes. The highest recorded wind gust in the state was in Daytona Beach. Beach erosion affected much of the state&#x27;s Atlantic coast. The most significant effects were in Brevard and Volusia counties, where waves damaged houses and piers. Rainfall in the state reached in Sanford.

Farther north in Georgia, Floyd produced wind gusts of at Savannah International Airport. The winds knocked down a few trees and power lines near the coast, but statewide damage was minimal. In Savannah, the hurricane produced tides above normal. Rainfall was light in the state, reaching in Newington.

Tropical storm force winds affected the entirety of the South Carolina coastline, with statewide damage estimated at $17 million. Sustained winds reached at the Charleston National Weather Service Office, which also recorded wind gusts of . The winds destroyed a few roofs and knocked down thousands of trees, leaving more than 200,000 people without electricity. The hurricane produced above normal tides along the coast, reaching above normal in Charleston Harbor. The waves caused minor to moderate beach erosion. At Myrtle Beach International Airport, Hurricane Floyd dropped of rainfall, the highest recorded in the state.

=== North Carolina ===
North Carolina received the brunt of the storm&#x27;s destruction. In all, Hurricane Floyd caused 51 fatalities in North Carolina, much of them from freshwater flooding, as well as billions in damage.

The storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to along the southeastern portion of the state. The hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes, most of which caused only minor damage. Damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the storm&#x27;s passage.

Just weeks prior to Floyd hitting, Hurricane Dennis brought up to of rain to southeastern North Carolina. When Hurricane Floyd moved across the state in early September, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of in Wilmington. Though it moved quickly, the extreme rainfall was due to Floyd&#x27;s interaction with an approaching cold front across the area.

Extensive flooding, especially along NC Hwy 91 and the White Oak Loop neighborhood, led to overflowing rivers; nearly every river basin in eastern North Carolina reached 500 year or greater flood levels. Most localized flooding happened overnight; Floyd dropped nearly of rain during the hours of its passage and many residents were not aware of the flooding until the water came into their homes. The U. S. Navy, National Guard and the Coast Guard performed nearly 1700 fresh water rescues of people trapped on the roofs of their homes due to the rapid rise of the water. By contrast, many of the worst affected areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm, as the water accumulated in rivers and moved downstream (see flood graphic at right).

The passage of Hurricane Irene four weeks later contributed an additional 6 in (150 mm) of rain over the still-saturated area, causing further flooding.

The Tar River suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested above flood stage. Flooding began in Rocky Mount, as much as 30% of which was underwater for several days. In Tarboro, much of the downtown was under several feet of water. Nearby, the town of Princeville was largely destroyed when the waters of the Tar poured over the town&#x27;s levee, covering the town with over of floodwater for ten days. Further downstream, Greenville suffered very heavy flooding; damages in Pitt County alone were estimated at $1.6 billion (1999 USD, $2.81 billion 2022 USD). Washington, where the peak flood level was observed, was likewise devastated. Some residents in Greenville had to swim six feet underwater to reach the front doors of their homes and apartments. Due to the heavy flooding in downtown Greenville, the East Carolina Pirates were forced to relocate their football game against #9 Miami to N.C. State&#x27;s Carter–Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where they beat the Hurricanes 27–23.

The Neuse River, Roanoke River, Waccamaw River, and New River exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the Cape Fear River basin was west of the peak rainfall areas, the city of Wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels. Of the state&#x27;s eastern rivers, only the Lumber River escaped catastrophic flooding.

Rainfall and strong winds affected many homes across the state, destroying 7,000, leaving 17,000 uninhabitable, and damaging 56,000. Ten thousand people resided in temporary shelters following the storm. The extensive flooding resulted in significant crop damage. As quoted by North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services H. David Bruton, &quot;Nothing since the Civil War has been as destructive to families here. The recovery process will be much longer than the water-going-down process.&quot; Around 31,000 jobs were lost from over 60,000 businesses through the storm, causing nearly $4 billion (1999 USD, $7.02 billion 2022 USD) in lost business revenue. In much of the affected area, officials urged people to either boil water or buy bottled water during Floyd&#x27;s aftermath.

In contrast to the problems eastern North Carolina experienced, much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought.
=== Virginia ===

Hurricane Floyd left $101 million in damage in Virginia, and contributed to four fatalities – two from fallen trees in Fairfax and Halifax County, one in a traffic accident in Hanover County, and a man in Accomack County who drowned in his submerged vehicle. As in North Carolina and elsewhere along its path, Floyd dropped torrential rainfall across eastern Virginia, reaching in Newport News. While Floyd moved through southeastern Virginia, it was still at hurricane status, producing winds strong enough to knock down hundreds of trees and power lines. The highest sustained winds in the state were at Langley Air Force Base. Wind gusts were much stronger, reaching on the James River Bridge. Floyd&#x27;s winds and rains knocked down hundreds of trees across the state, some centuries old.

The heavy rains washed out several roads, and closed regional routes including Interstate 95 between Emporia and Petersburg, U.S. Route 58 between Emporia and Franklin, and U.S. Route 460 near Wakefield. The rainfall led to overflowing rivers in the Chowan River Basin, some of which exceeded 500-year flood levels. The Blackwater River reached 100-year flood levels and flooded Franklin with of water. Extensive road damage occurred there, isolating the area from the rest of the state. Some 182 businesses and 150 houses were underwater in Franklin from the worst flooding in 60 years. In addition, two dams along the Rappahannock River burst from the extreme flooding. Throughout all of Virginia, Floyd damaged 9,250 houses. In addition to the heavy rainfall, tides in Norfolk were above normal, resulting moderate to locally severe coastal flooding. Along the Chesapeake Bay, Floyd produced a storm surge, causing up to of flooding in Accomack County homes. Floyd&#x27;s winds and rains knocked down hundreds of trees across the state, some centuries&#x27; old.

=== Mid-Atlantic ===

As Floyd moved northward from Virginia, a stalled cold front acted as a conveyor belt of tropical moisture across the Mid-Atlantic. Wind gusts in Washington, D.C. reached at the Children&#x27;s National Medical Center. The storm knocked down trees and dropped heavy rainfall, causing a shop on New York Avenue NW to close after the roof collapsed.

The hurricane&#x27;s rainbands moved across Maryland, dropping of rainfall in Chestertown, Maryland. Statewide, about 450 people required evacuated from low-lying areas. A mudslide in Anne Arundel County stranded five trains carrying about 1,000 passengers. Flooding closed 225 roads statewide, with dozens of motorists requiring rescue, and more than 90 bridges were damaged. A man in Centreville died while attempting to jump a washed out bridge on his motorcycle. High tides, above normal, affected coastal areas of St. Mary&#x27;s, Calvert, Harford, and Anne Arundel counties, with 5 houses destroyed and 23 severely damaged. Flooding inundated the only bridge to St. George Island, stranding six people. The highest statewide wind gust – 71 mph (114 km/h) – occurred in Tall Timbers, while the highest wind gust in eastern Maryland was 52 mph (83 km/h) in Ocean City. The winds knocked down hundreds of trees, including the nearly 400 year–old Liberty Tree at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis. The winds also knocked down power lines, leaving about 500,000 customers without electricity. Two people were injured, and one person killed, from Carbon monoxide poisoning related to using a generator. The Anne Arundel county fair was canceled for the first time in its history. In Baltimore, the Baltimore Orioles postponed a baseball game. Statewide damage was estimated at $7.9 million.

In Delaware, Hurricane Floyd left $8.42 million in damage. The storm dropped torrential rainfall, reaching in Greenwood, Delaware. During the storm, Greenwood recorded , breaking the record for the state&#x27;s highest 24 hour rainfall total. The rains caused record crests along rivers and streams in New Castle County. The White Clay Creek crested at , and was above flood stage for 18 hours. Statewide, Floyd damaged 171 homes, and caused 33 homes to be condemned. Flooding closed hundreds of roads and bridges, with two bridges and a few miles of track belonging to the Wilmington and Western Railroad washed out. Dozens of motorists required rescue. Winds in the state reached 64 mph (104 km/h) at Cape Henlopen along the coast. The winds knocked down hundreds of trees and power lines, leaving about 25,000 people without power.

As Floyd continued up the coast, it dropped heavy rainfall in New Jersey, reaching in Little Falls; this was the highest statewide rain from a tropical cyclone since 1950. Following the state&#x27;s fourth-worst drought in a century, the rains collected in rivers and streams, causing record flooding at 18 river gauges, and mostly affecting the Raritan, Passaic, and Delaware basins. Statewide damage totaled $250 million (1999 USD), much of it in Somerset and Bergen counties. This made Floyd the costliest natural disaster in New Jersey&#x27;s history, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Irene in 2011. Seven people died in New Jersey during Floyd&#x27;s passage – six due to drowning, and one in a traffic accident. A police lieutenant took his life after working for nearly 48 hours coordinating floodwater rescues. In Bound Brook, the Raritan crested at a record on September 16, well above the flood stage, and exceeding the previous record of set during Tropical Storm Doria in 1971. Downtown Bound Brook was flooded , causing 200 buildings to be condemned. In Manville, the Raritan crested at a record , nearly double the flood stage of . Parts of Manville were flooded to a depth of , which damaged 1,500 homes, caused 284 homes to be condemned, and forced 1,000 people to evacuate. A water treatment plant was damaged in Bridgewater Township, forcing nearly 500,000 people in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, and Somerset counties to boil water for eight days. The Rochelle Park, New Jersey hub of Electronic Data Systems was inundated by the nearby Saddle River, disrupting service to as many as 8,000 ATMs across the United States. Flooding in an adjoining Bell Atlantic switching facility cut off phone service to one million customers in the area.

In Pennsylvania, Floyd killed 13 people, largely due to drownings, fallen trees, or heart attacks, and another 40 people were severely injured. The hurricane left about $60 million in damage, mostly related to its heavy rainfall, which peaked at in Marcus Hook. The highest wind gust was occurred at the Commodore Barry Bridge. The two hardest-hit counties were Delaware and Bucks, where more than 10,000 homes were flooded, including 200 that were damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. More than 4,000 people statewide lost their homes due to the storm. Many creeks swelled to record levels, in some cases over double their estimated flood stage, which left motorists in need of rescue, including a bus with 11 students in Buckingham Township. Statewide, Floyd left over 500,000 homes and businesses without power.

Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall on western Long Island as it moved northward. The heaviest rainfall associated with the storm was concentrated in the southeastern section of the state. Several meteorological elements worked to enhance the moisture from the cyclone. Rainfall totals exceeding were common, with as much as reported locally in the Catskills. At Cairo, of rain fell. The precipitation, combined with that of Hurricane Dennis earlier in the month, helped to alleviate persistent drought conditions. Floyd also produced gusty winds, reaching at Stewart International Airport, worsened by a pressure gradient between the storm and an area of high pressure over the Ohio Valley.

Floyd&#x27;s rainfall resulted in deadly and extensive flooding that killed two people in New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.

The strong winds, combined with saturated ground from the rainfall, brought down trees in widespread areas of the Hudson Valley and Capital District. Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions. Some of the downed trees fell on structures. In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County, where wind gusts are estimated to have reached , hundreds of trees were blown down. At the storm&#x27;s worst, power outages affected over 100,000 people region-wide, and some individuals remained without power for a week. At the Albany International Airport, the storm forced the cancellation of flights, and throughout the region schools were closed. Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain. Throughout Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester counties, initial cost estimates were $14.6 million, although that figure represents only a portion of the actual monetary damage. The storm also caused about $2 million in property damage in Essex County.

=== New England ===
In Connecticut, the storm caused one casualty: a man drowned after boating in the swollen Quinnipiac River. The storm caused extensive flooding and serious damage. Wind gusts exceeding , combined with the saturated ground, brought down many trees and triggered severe power outages in the area. As Floyd tracked up the Connecticut River Valley towards Massachusetts, it dropped heavy precipitation. The heaviest rainfall occurred in a southwest–northeast orientated swath from northern New Jersey to southwestern Connecticut, including southeastern New York. At the Danbury Airport, of rain was reported. Rainfall rates of per hour occurred at Bethel and Danbury. Numerous rivers overflowed; for example, the Still River and its tributaries triggered severe flooding. The worst of the flooding—considered the worst in 40 years—took place at Danbury. Hundreds of homes, two car dealerships, several roads, and other structures were damaged there. At Greentree Motors, all 200 vehicles were declared a total loss. Parts of the city were submerged with of water. However, throughout the state, roads were closed and basements were inundated. The flooding inflicted at least $1.3 million in monetary damage within Fairfield County. Portions of the state were declared a federal disaster area.
Floyd brought intense winds and heavy rain to Rhode Island. The strongest winds were confined to Washington and Providence counties. The winds brought down numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines. Rainfall typically ranged from , with a report of at North Smithfield, Rhode Island. The Pawtuxet River reached flood stage on September 16, and crested the next day. Although it surpassed its banks, no flood damage was reported. The storm&#x27;s effects in the state were mostly minor.

In Massachusetts, the storm produced wind gusts of , reaching at the New Bedford Hurricane Barrier. The strongest winds were concentrated over two sections of the state—the western mountains terrain and Cape Cod. The winds brought down trees and power lines in these areas, particularly around Pittsfield. In terms of rainfall, the storm dropped in many locations. The heavy precipitation caused rivers to swell, and in some cases flow over their banks. Storm surge at the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier reached .

By September 17, Floyd was located over southwestern Maine, dropping heavy rains. The entire state received precipitation, with the highest totals confined to southern areas. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for two-thirds of the state. The storm was described as &quot;tame&quot;, and damage was generally minor. In much of Androscoggin County, rainfall amounted to between 7 and 8 in (180 and 200 mm); Poland reported . Several rivers approached or exceeded flood stage due to rainfall from Floyd and Hurricane Dennis less than a week earlier, causing minor flooding. Floyd helped to alleviate drought conditions in Maine. Some roads in susceptible areas were submerged, and a few basements were flooded. Wind gusts of blew down trees and snapped branches, especially in the area surrounding Baxter State Park. Around 15,000 residents were affected by power outages as a result. Following the event, five counties—Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec Oxford, and Somerset—were declared disaster areas, making federal aid available to those areas.

Rainfall in New Hampshire generally ranged from , although a few higher totals were recorded. At Mount Washington, of precipitation fell. The rainfall swelled rivers, pushing them above flood stage; the Saco River at Conway crested at , surpassing the 9-ft (2.7 m) flood stage. Along the Saco and Pemigewasset rivers, minor flooding took place, though only in low-lying terrain. Strong winds also impacted the state, with gusts often exceeding . The winds brought down several small trees in Jaffrey, and triggered power outages that affected 10,000 residents. A federal disaster area was declared in the state.

In Vermont, for the first time in years, the Tunbridge World&#x27;s Fair was canceled due to the storm. One woman sustained injuries after a tree crashed on her vehicle. Floyd produced high winds and heavy rain throughout the state, leading to widespread downed trees and powerlines. Thousands of residents in the state lost power after winds impacted the area. Rainfall totals of were common, although there were localized higher reports. The rainfall was offset by persistent drought conditions, however. Numerous tributaries overflowed their banks, and significant flooding was reported. In Weathersfield, part of U.S. Route 5 was washed away. Some schools were closed and events canceled in the region. The downed trees caused structural damage, blocked roadways, and affected hiking trails. The high winds also damaged buildings and some apple orchards, Waves of occurred on Lake Champlain, damaging numerous watercraft along the shore. The hurricane caused one death. Most of Vermont was declared a disaster area after the storm.

=== Canada ===

The remnants of Floyd produced rainfall and gusty winds from Ontario to Atlantic Canada, with occurring along the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, the strongest winds in the country. The high winds damaged corn and other crops along the river&#x27;s south shore from the l&#x27;Amiante to Bellechasse regions. The highest rainfall in Canada also occurred in eastern Quebec, reaching . Power outages affected Montreal and Quebec City, causing classes to be canceled at the Université de Montréal. Inclement weather was a potential factor in a five car accident on Autoroute 15 in Quebec City. Minor traffic accidents also occurred in the Maritimes. Heavy rainfall backed up storm drains in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The Confederation Bridge connecting Prince Edward Island to the mainland shut down during the storm due to winds. About 6,000 people lost power in Nova Scotia.

== Aftermath ==
===The Bahamas===
To help the affected citizens, the Bahamas Red Cross Society opened 41 shelters, though within one week many returned home. The Bahamas required $435,000 (1999 USD; $  USD) in aid following the storm, much of it in food parcels. The Inter-American Development Bank loaned $21 million (1999 USD; $  USD) to the archipelago to restore bridges, roads, seawalls, docks, and other building projects in the aftermath of the hurricane.

=== North Carolina ===

The Hurricane Floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, &quot;It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... [it&#x27;s] an awesome scene of tragedy. So there&#x27;s a great misery index in North Carolina.&quot; Witt responded, &quot;We&#x27;re starting to move the camper trailers in. It&#x27;s been so wet it&#x27;s been difficult to get things in there, but now it&#x27;s going to be moving very quickly. And I think you&#x27;re going to see a—I think the people there will see a big difference [within] this next weekend.&quot;
Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina&#x27;s rivers and sounds. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in Pamlico Sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bonnie, and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year&#x27;s shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from Hurricane Dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd&#x27;s ill effects. Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the Neuse River. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in Hurricane Fran, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.

When the hurricane hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.

===Retirement===

Due to the high impact, extensive damage, and loss of life from the hurricane, the name &quot;Floyd&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2000, and it will never again be used for another north Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Franklin&quot; for the 2005 season.

<doc id="281978" wikidata="Q2073334" url="?curid=281978" title="Pete Waterman">
<text>Peter Alan Waterman (born 15 January 1947) is an English record producer, songwriter, and television personality. As a member of the Stock Aitken Waterman production and songwriting team, he co-wrote and co-produced many UK hit singles. An avid railway enthusiast, Waterman is the owner of significant collections of both historic and commercial railway locomotives and rolling stock.

==Early life==
Peter Alan Waterman was born in Stoke Heath, Coventry, Warwickshire on Wednesday, 15 January 1947. He was educated at Whitley Abbey Comprehensive School until he left in 1962 to work for British Railways. He became a steam locomotive fireman based at Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) depot. In 2002 he said of his time working for British Railways, &quot;I loved every minute of it. The squalor was unreal, but the camaraderie was phenomenal.&quot; After closure of the depot in 1963, Waterman chose to follow a career in music, being inspired by The Beatles. To supplement his income as a DJ, he became a gravedigger and then an apprentice at General Electric Company, becoming a trade union official. He also worked as a coal miner.

==Musical career==
Building a record collection through rare US imports, his DJ work began to take him across the UK, entertaining bigger crowds with a blend of rhythm and blues and soul music tunes he had sourced. Given a residency with the Mecca Leisure Group, he developed new initiatives including discos for under 18s at Coventry&#x27;s Locarno club, which gave him a valuable insight into what music interested a younger audience. Waterman noticed that the younger dancers preferred records with high beats per minute and this influenced his later work. It was at the Locarno that Waterman first met Neville Staple, later to be a vocalist for The Specials – a band that Waterman would manage for a brief period. In early 2009, Waterman wrote the foreword to Staple&#x27;s biography, &quot;Original Rude Boy&quot;, which was published by Aurum Press in May 2009.

Waterman took up a job as an A&amp;R man, and worked in the Philadelphia scene, which included introducing the Three Degrees to the UK. He then moved to Jamaica working with Peter Tosh and Lee Perry, and producing Susan Cadogan’s reggae-crossover hit &quot;Hurt So Good&quot;.

In 1979, Waterman set up &quot;Loose Ends&quot; with Peter Collins, the first coming under the name 14–18 with a single inspired by World War I, &quot;Good-Bye-Ee,&quot; and hits with artists like Musical Youth and Nik Kershaw. He then set up his own company PWL (Pete Waterman Limited) in 1984, quickly signing producers Matt Aitken and Mike Stock, who produced the song &quot;Whatever I Do&quot; for Hazell Dean. Stock Aitken Waterman became one of the most successful musical production teams of the 1980s.

Waterman has been involved in at least twenty-two UK number one singles with his acts (including Dead or Alive, Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley, Bananarama, Steps, Mel and Kim, Donna Summer, Sinitta, Cliff Richard and Jason Donovan) and he claims upwards of 500 million sales worldwide (inclusive of singles, albums, compilation inclusions, downloads, etc.). Waterman also appeared in the Steps video &quot;Tragedy&quot;.

In the late-1990s, production company Celador hired Waterman to compose a song for their new quiz show, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. The company felt the song unsuitable, and instead approached Keith Strachan.

Waterman co-wrote and produced with Mike Stock &quot;That Sounds Good to Me&quot; by Josh Dubovie, the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest entry for the United Kingdom, which finished in last place with 10 points.

Waterman was worth £30 million in 2006/07, according to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List.

===Television===
Waterman co-presented &quot;The Hit Man and Her&quot; (1988–1992) with Michaela Strachan. He also presented a show on Radio City.

Waterman has appeared as a judge on both series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in the UK (2001–03), and also &quot;&quot; (2002). The latter saw him become manager of the winning boy band One True Voice, who then lost the race to Christmas number 1 to the same show&#x27;s winning girl group, Louis Walsh&#x27;s Girls Aloud.

Waterman returned as judge for the second series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, but was constantly critical of the eventual winner, Michelle McManus, and was openly disappointed when she won. Waterman has since said he will not appear on any similar programmes in future, and has on several occasions attacked more recent talent shows (specifically those devised by his former &quot;Pop Idol&quot; colleague, Simon Cowell). Waterman has stated that he turned down offers to participate in &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot;, citing fix allegations and being put off by unprofessional behaviour including that of &quot;&quot; co-judge Geri Halliwell during the show.

Whilst he has kept his promise not to appear as a talent show judge, on 12 October 2008, Waterman joined his fellow ex-&quot;Pop Idol&quot; judges Neil Fox and Nicki Chapman on Peter Kay&#x27;s spoof talent show &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice&quot;, a fully scripted fictional spoof on the talent show genre. The show parodied the emotional manipulation behind Cowell&#x27;s shows, with Waterman memorably interrupting a funeral to tell an ousted contestant that the loss of his gran (who had died of shock when learning her grandson had been dropped from the show) would provide the sob story he needed to get him on to the show.

In factual television, Waterman&#x27;s interest in trains saw him present a historic self-retrospective view in &quot;Waterman on Railways&quot; for Channel Four/the Discovery Channel. Waterman also appeared in an advert by the National Blood Service in the UK, their sixth TV advert which also features Carol Smillie and Will Carling.

Waterman was one of the contestants in the 2009 series of the BBC programme &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;, but was knocked out in the first round.

In October 2019, Waterman appeared on &quot;The X Factor: Celebrity&quot;. Waterman was part of an all star audience during the auditions stage in Malibu at Simon Cowell’s house, providing commentary critique behind the main judges, alongside Randy Jackson, Howie Mandel and songwriter Diane Warren.

===Eurovision===
Waterman wrote and produced the UK entry for the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest. This song was performed by the final three acts on &quot;Eurovision, Your Country Needs You!&quot; on 12 March 2010, Josh Dubovie was chosen to represent the UK. The song came under much criticism and William Hill&#x27;s betting odds gave the song 125-1 chance that the song would win, the longest odds for a UK entry ever. In the end the song, &quot;That Sounds Good to Me&quot;, came last at the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest receiving only 10 points in total.

==Other commercial interests==
===Railways===
Waterman&#x27;s main interest outside music is in railways, and he has been involved in several railway ventures. In 1988 he revived the name of the London &amp; North Western Railway, which as a group encompassed various ventures:
*LNWR: a rail vehicle maintenance business, based at Crewe it had depots across the country, and was by the time of its sale the largest privately owned rail maintenance business in the country. Having accrued debts of £2 million in building the business in November 2008, Waterman sold it to Arriva UK Trains.
*Waterman Railways: In 1994 during the opening stages of the privatisation of British Rail, Waterman bought the Special Trains Unit effective from April 1995, which ran tourist charters and special trains with six Class 47 locomotives and 200 Mark 1, Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages. This was the first unit sold from the LNWR Group.
*LNWR Heritage: was the steam locomotive and carriage restoration arm, based at Crewe Heritage Centre. The company undertook the restoration of Waterman&#x27;s own locomotives, as well as various complete contract locomotive renovation and boiler overhaul work. Waterman became involved from 2012 in an industry bid to create a national railway apprenticeship scheme, but the bid was rejected in autumn 2013. In March 2014, Waterman sold the business to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust.

To hold his own collection of locomotives, he founded the Waterman Railway Heritage Trust, which currently owns several steam and diesel locomotives including:
*GWR 4575 class number 5553
*GWR 5205 class number 5224
*GWR 5600 class number 6634
*British Rail Class 08 number 08830 (D3998)
*British Rail Class 25 number 25309 (D7659)
*46035 &quot;Ixion&quot;
*47402 &quot;Gateshead&quot;
*SAR NGG 16 Class number 109

Waterman also has a keen interest in model railways, and is the founder of the model railway business Just Like the Real Thing, which specialises in O Gauge kits. He works closely with model-maker Laurie Lynch on this project. He continues to retain an interest in the company and regularly accompanies its sales stand to model railway exhibitions. Waterman has an extensive private collection of railway models and railway layouts, in O scale and larger gauges. He is currently building a large model of Leamington Spa railway station, in O scale and set in the 1950s. He has written several books and many magazine articles on the subject. He has said that his ability to become absorbed in making models helped him cope with grief after the death of his son.

In 2007, Waterman became involved in a co-operative UK rail industry bid to create a national railway training scheme under the then Labour government, which after the Government seed funding was withdrawn from all such schemes, was halted in 2009. Waterman revealed in 2011 that he had since spent £900,000 of his own money on training apprentices at Crewe, and that outside Network Rail&#x27;s own scheme, only 37 apprentices had been taken into the rail industry in 2011. In January 2015, Waterman announced the sale of the bulk of his model railway collection, to fund the training of rail apprentices in restoring his steam locomotives 5224 and 5553, which in May 2015 were moved from Crewe to Peak Rail. In April 2015, the collection sold for £627,229 at the auction in Birmingham. In July 2015, in partnership with rail engineering firm OSL, Waterman launched the Railway Exchange Training Academy (RETA) at Crewe.

In June 2009, Waterman unveiled Manchester Metrolink Firema T-68 1007s new name “East Lancashire Railway” as a tribute to the Heritage Railway at Bury tram stop.

In October 2018, Waterman unveiled &quot;The Will Hay Appreciation Society&quot;&#x27;s memorial bench to Will Hay, Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt in Cliddesden, Hampshire the filming location for Buggleskelly in the railway comedy film &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot;.

In 2018, Waterman became president of the Railway Benefit Fund, a railway benevolent charity based in Crewe.

On 20 October 2021 during a High Speed 2 site visit Waterman announced the name of one of the tunnel boring machines to be Dorothy.

In 2021 and 2022, Pete Waterman produced two different OO Gauge model layouts at Chester Cathedral. Both modelled different parts of the West Coast Main Line, with each being branded as &#x27;Making Tracks&#x27; and in 2023, Pete, and his group of other enthusiasts nicknamed the &#x27;Railnuts&#x27; group, produced a model railway focusing on Milton Keynes Central railway station.

===Sport===
In addition to his passion for music and railways, Waterman is also a supporter of Walsall F.C. though he supported Coventry City for many years. He is also a rugby league fan and is president of League 1 side Coventry Bears.

==Honours==
In 2001, Waterman was made an Honorary Doctor of Business Administration by Coventry University for his services to the pop industry. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by University College Chester. In the New Year Honours List published 31 December 2004, he was made an OBE for his services to music. In December 2006, he became a patron of the newly formed charity, the City, Lambeth and Southwark Music Education Trust. In 2016, Waterman was awarded Fellowship of the Royal Northern College of Music (FRNCM), making him the first pop musician to be given the award.

In September 2024, a &quot;Freightliner&quot; Class 90 №90041 was named in honour of Pete Waterman, with a plaque placed on both sides of the locomotive

==Personal life==
Waterman has been married three times:
*Elizabeth Reynolds (m. 1970–74, divorced): one son Paul (1971–2005)
*Julie Reeves (m. 1980–84, divorced): one son Peter (born 1981)
*Denise Gyngell (m. 1991–99, divorced); two children Toni Tuesday and Charlie Ella

<text>Igloolik (Inuktitut syllabics: , &quot;Iglulik&quot;, ) is an Inuit hamlet in Foxe Basin, Qikiqtaaluk Region in Nunavut, northern Canada. Because its location on Igloolik Island is close to Melville Peninsula, it is often mistakenly thought to be on the peninsula. The name &quot;Igloolik&quot; means &quot;there is a house here&quot;. It derives from meaning house or building, and refers to the sod houses that were originally in the area, not to snow igloos. In Inuktitut the residents are called Iglulingmiut (the suffix &quot;miut&quot; means &quot;people of&quot;).

==History==

Information about the area&#x27;s earliest inhabitants comes mainly from numerous archaeological sites on the island; some dating back more than 4,000 years. First contact with Europeans came when the British Royal Navy ships HMS &quot;Fury&quot; and HMS &quot;Hecla&quot;, under the command of Captain William Edward Parry, wintered in Igloolik in 1822.

The island was visited in 1867 and 1868 by the American explorer Charles Francis Hall in his search for survivors of the lost Franklin Expedition. In 1913, Alfred Tremblay, a French-Canadian prospector with Captain Joseph-Elzéar Bernier’s expedition to Pond Inlet, extended his mineral exploration overland to Igloolik, and in 1921 a member of Knud Rasmussen’s Fifth Thule Expedition visited the island.

The first permanent presence by southerners in Igloolik came with the establishment of a Roman Catholic Mission in the 1930s. By the end of the decade, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had also set up a post on the island.

Non-indigenous establishments, such as Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) stations, day schools, and clinics, were here before they came to be in surrounding communities. The Igloolik Research Centre focuses on documenting Inuit traditional knowledge and technology, as well as climatology and seismic data research.

==Culture==
Anthropologically, &quot;Iglulik Inuit&quot; are usually considered to be the Iglulingmiut, the Aivilingmiut, and the Tununirmiut, the Inuit from northern Baffin Island, on Southampton Island, and in the Melville Peninsula.

An ancient legend from the Igloolik area was adapted by Zacharias Kunuk into the award-winning Canadian film &quot;&quot; in 2001. In 2004, Isuma produced the film &quot;The Journals of Knud Rasmussen&quot; which was released in September 2006 after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival.

Igloolik is also the home-base of the only Inuit circus, Artcirq. This collective is active in video-making, music production and live circus show performances. Early in 2008, when temperatures in Igloolik were at , eight members of Artcirq went to Essakane north of Timbuktu, Mali, where temperatures were , to perform at the Festival au Désert. In February 2010, six members of Artcirq represented Nunavut in performances at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia.

In late 2007, the Igloolik Hunters and Trappers Organization (HTO) banned all forms of tourism (sport hunting, filming, photography, watching) related to the northern Foxe Basin walrus population for a period of two years. This ban was in response to an observed decrease in walrus. The Igloolik Inuit continued to harvest walrus while the tourism ban was in place.

In 2017, documentary film maker Alan Zweig released &quot;There Is a House Here&quot;, a documentary film about his visits to the community.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Igloolik had a population of 2,049 living in 394 of its 468 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,744. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Environmental concerns==

The &quot;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; interviewed people from the region in April 2008, about their concerns over plans to ship iron ore from the nearby Steensby Inlet on Baffin Island from the Baffinland Iron Mine.
Jaypetee Palluq, an Igloolik resident who had been asked to serve on a Baffinland advisory committee, was concerned that the mine&#x27;s operation would interfere with the traditional hunts for sea mammals, like walrus. He called on Baffinland to &quot;find an alternate shipping route to the mine, regardless of the cost.&quot;

Paul Quassa, former mayor of Igloolik, also expressed concern, over the effect of freighters on the ice used by the walrus. He said the region was known for its highly prized aged, fermented walrus meat, a valuable export from the region.

On November 2, 2016, &quot;CBC News&quot; reported that residents had detected a &quot;ping&quot; via sonar, describing it as a hum or buzz emanating from the seabead of the Fury and Hecla Strait—near Steensby Inlet where Baffinland has one of its ports.

Paul Quassa, Igloolik&#x27;s representative to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, said the hum had been disturbing the sea mammals community members rely on for food. The Royal Canadian Air Force sent a Lockheed CP-140 Aurora to the area but were unable to detect the noise or the source.

==Climate==
Igloolik has a polar climate (ET) with nine months averaging below . Winters are long and cold, with October being the snowiest month. Summers range from chilly to sometimes mild, with cold nights.
== Broadband communications ==
The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

==Transportation==
The community is served by the Igloolik Airport.

<text>Hurricane Alicia was a small but powerful tropical cyclone that caused significant destruction in the Greater Houston area of Southeast Texas in August 1983. Although Alicia was a relatively small hurricane, its track over the rapidly growing metropolitan area contributed to its $3 billion damage toll, making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane at the time. Alicia spawned from a disturbance that originated from the tail-end of a cold front over the northern Gulf of Mexico in mid-August 1983. The cyclone was named on August 14 when it became a tropical storm, and the combination of weak steering currents and a conducive environment allowed Alicia to quickly intensify as it drifted slowly westward. On August 17, Alicia became a hurricane and continued to strengthen, topping out as a Category 3 major hurricane as it made landfall on the southwestern end of Galveston Island. Alicia&#x27;s eye passed just west of Downtown Houston as the system accelerated northwestwards across East Texas; Alicia eventually weakened into a remnant area of low pressure over Oklahoma on August 20 before they were last noted on August 21 over eastern Nebraska.

Alicia was the first hurricane to make landfall on the United States since Hurricane Allen struck South Texas in August 1980 over three years prior, ending the longest period of the twentieth century without a landfalling hurricane on the U.S. coast. Alicia&#x27;s approach precipitated the evacuation of 60–80 thousand people from coastal communities along the coasts of Southeast Texas and Louisiana. Along the coast, a storm tide flooded communities, with the rough surf sinking several ships and resulting in three offshore fatalities. Most of the damage attributed to the storm was caused by strong winds estimated to have peaked at 130 mph (210 km/h) in southwestern Galveston Island. Alicia was the first major hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Anita of 1977.

Widespread damage was wrought in Galveston and Houston, where thousands of homes were destroyed. In Downtown Houston, nearly all skyscrapers saw the loss of approximately half of lower-level windows, littering the urban streets with debris. Widespread power outages and flooding impacted much of Southeast Texas, with observed rainfall totals peaking at . In addition to the strong winds, rough surf, and heavy rain, Alicia also generated 22 tornadoes centered around the Houston–Galveston area; most were rated F0, but the strongest, an F2, tore through Corsicana further north.

The impacts of Alicia tapered inland past the point of landfall, though the weakening system still produced damaging winds and flooding in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and Oklahoma; light rain associated with Alicia was observed as far north as Michigan. In total, Alicia caused 21 fatalities and 7,288 injuries.

==Meteorological history==

The origin of Hurricane Alicia can be traced to a frontal boundary that extended from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. This weak front was initially stationary over the Southeastern United States but moved slowly southward into the north-central and northeastern fringes of the gulf, producing strong convective activity beginning on the night of August 13, 1983. On August 14, a small area of low pressure developed on the western end of the front and moved off the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama, intensifying as it progressed further into the open gulf waters. The thunderstorms associated with the small low-pressure area—described as a mesoscale convective complex—aided in the development of additional storms in the northern Gulf of Mexico by facilitating favorable conditions for convective initiation. By the evening of August 14, the disturbance had largely separated from the parent frontal trough and continued to organize around a surface-level circulation. A United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft investigated the precursor system and determined that it had developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC (7:00 a.m. CDT) on August 15 while south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Within six hours of developing, the disturbance intensified further into a tropical storm, attaining the name &quot;Alicia&quot; and becoming the hurricane season&#x27;s first named storm. Due to Alicia&#x27;s formation in a region with high environmental pressures, the storm remained relatively small throughout its lifetime. The presence of a ridge of high pressure to Alicia&#x27;s north steered the nascent tropical cyclone slowly westward in the early part of its development. The ridge eventually drifted eastward, resulting in Alicia slowly curving towards the northwest beginning mid-day on August 16.

The storm&#x27;s slow movement—averaging just 5 mph (8 km/h)—and lack of strong steering currents allowed Alicia to reap highly favorable conditions characterized by warm sea surface temperatures in excess of and favorable winds in the upper troposphere due to an upper-level anticyclone, resulting in unabated intensification until landfall. Radar analyses indicated that Alicia was stationary at times as it transitioned to a northwesterly heading. An eye began to emerge on satellite imagery by the afternoon of August 16. On August 17, Alicia strengthened into a hurricane with its pressure falling at a steady 1 mbar (hPa; 0.03 inHg) per hour. At 06:00 UTC (1:00 a.m. CDT) on August 18, Alicia became a major hurricane and made landfall an hour later on Galveston Island— southwest of Galveston, Texas—with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 962 mbar (hPa; 28.41 inHg) as measured by aircraft reconnaissance, making it a low-end Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Alicia was the first hurricane to strike the continental United States since Hurricane Allen moved ashore South Texas in August 1980, ending the longest break in contiguous U.S. hurricane landfalls of the 20th century. The hurricane was also the first major hurricane to impact the Greater Houston area since Hurricane Carla in 1961.
Alicia weakened as it accelerated northwest into the Texas interior, with the hurricane&#x27;s center passing just west of Downtown Houston on the morning of August 18 as a Category 1 hurricane; the storm was initially slow to weaken as it was able to rein in moist air from the warm Gulf of Mexico. Later that day, the continued inhibitory impacts of friction and dry air weakened Alicia to a tropical storm near College Station, Texas, and degenerated into a tropical depression early on August 19 near the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Despite having remained over land for 36 hours, Alicia remained well-organized while tracking into Oklahoma on August 20. The tapering system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day; these remnants persisted for another day before they were absorbed by a passing trough over eastern Nebraska on August 21.

==Preparations==

Hurricane Alicia marked the first time the National Weather Service provided local interests with landfall probabilities, beginning 60 hours before Alicia&#x27;s eventual landfall. The new information was generally well received by local officials, though a slight uptick in landfall probabilities for the New Orleans area was interpreted by a local radio station to have denoted a change in Alicia&#x27;s course, resulting in the unnecessary transition of two local hospitals to emergency operations. The first gale warnings and hurricane watches were issued for the United States Gulf Coast between Corpus Christi, Texas and Grand Isle, Louisiana at 16:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. CDT) on August 16. Coastal areas from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Morgan City, Louisiana were issued hurricane warnings shortly after Alicia intensified into a hurricane on August 17; these warnings remained until the storm weakened into a tropical storm over East Texas. The National Weather Service office in Galveston suspended operations after water began to flood the office at the height of the storm.

Between 60 and 80 thousand people were evacuated from Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, and Harris counties in advance of Alicia, as well as 1,500 persons from Sabine Pass. Twenty thousand people sought refuge at shelters within Houston. Another 6,000 evacuated from Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Offshore oil operations were postponed in preparation for Alicia with the evacuation of 1,360 workers, most of whom were from Shell platforms. Initially, however, residents did not take the warnings seriously. Galveston Mayor E. Gus Manuel, against the advice of Texas Governor Mark White, ordered the evacuation of only low-lying areas. As a result, only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when Alicia came ashore. In contrast, about 30 percent of Galveston&#x27;s population evacuated the island when Hurricane Allen threatened the eastern Texas coastline in 1980.
Throughout the day, however, as the increasing winds began to cause damage in Galveston, people grew more concerned. The mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on August 18, but by then, the bridges to the mainland were uncrossable.

==Impact==

Hurricane Alicia caused US$3 billion in damage, making it the costliest tropical cyclone in U.S. history at the time; insured losses were estimated at US$700 million by the American Insurance Association. There were 7,288 injuries, including 21 fatalities and 25 hospitalizations. Despite being a relatively small and low-end Category 3 hurricane, the impacts of Alicia were exacerbated in the Houston metropolitan area due to a rapid increase in population, resulting in a rise in potentially susceptible infrastructure that also induced as much as in land subsidence along some stretches of Galveston Bay.

===Texas===
====Houston and Galveston areas====
Alicia produced a storm tide that crested along the interior coast of Galveston Bay near Baytown, Texas. A 300-home subdivision near Baytown sustained extensive damage to most dwellings. Seabrook, Texas also documented a storm tide, with slightly lower tide heights of occurring at the Flagship Hotel in Galveston. The rough surf eroded as much as of beach in western parts of Galveston Island. A recently constructed levee system protecting Texas City mitigated potential storm surge damage to the city&#x27;s extensive industrial infrastructure. However, an oil spill resulting from a ruptured tank near Galveston Bay swept through areas near the Texas City Dike. A tug capsized south of Sabine Pass, resulting in one death and the eventual rescue of four crewmembers five days later. Another two deaths resulted from the sinking of two shrimp boats in the Clear Lake, Texas area. In total, about 400 shrimp boats sustained some form of damage or sunk, resulting in $7 million in losses. Major damage was wrought to 80 other large vessels.

A stretch of the Texas coast experienced hurricane-force winds. The strongest gust was reported in Galveston where a 102 mph (164 km/h) gust was recorded near landfall, though stronger gusts likely occurred over more sparsely populated coastal areas; no surface observations were documented along southwestern Galveston Island where Alicia made landfall. Analysis of structural damage suggested that gusts as high as 130 mph (210 km/h) were produced by Alicia over land. Nearly every structure in Galveston County, Texas sustained varying degrees of damage from torn roofing to total destruction with the most severe damage occurring in western parts of the county. Telecommunications and power on Galveston Island were downed for several days. The walls of some hotels collapsed and numerous windows facing the wind were blown out. Storm surge damaged most buildings in Jamaica Beach, Texas, with 50 homes sustaining major damage. Heavy rains nearing totals on the island caused street flooding and destroyed a mobile home community. Significant wind damage occurred on the inland portions of Galveston County, including damage to schools, apartment complexes, and mobile homes. In League City, Texas, damage was estimated at $100 million, largely stemming from roof damage.

Seven people were killed in Harris County, Texas as a result of fallen trees, drownings, or automobile crashes. Another 1,530 people were injured. At Houston&#x27;s William P. Hobby Airport, sustained winds peaked at 81 mph (130 km/h) with gusts to 99 mph (159 km/h). The airport sustained $1.5 million in damage, including damage to several small aircraft, hangars, metal structures, and airport windows. Tropical storm-force winds of gusting to at the Houston Intercontinental Airport; there, two terminal roofs experienced minor damage and one airplane broke from its ties. Fifty cars on site suffered shattered windows. Skyscrapers in Downtown Houston suffered extensive damage from wind-blown debris accelerated by the narrow spaces between buildings. The lower 40 floors of most skyscrapers were shattered by wind-blown gravel. Similar debris or water blocked over 20 major roads; flooding caused by the widespread rainfall was most severe in Baytown, Clear Lake, and Pasadena in the eastern part of Harris County, necessitating the rescue of roughly 300 people. Thirty of these rescues arose from a single subdivision in Baytown where inundation reached a depth of . In these communities, hundreds of homes were flooded. Ninety percent of homes were damaged in Crystal Beach, Texas, of which half were destroyed. Alicia also caused $4.5 million in cotton losses and $6 million in pecan crop losses in Harris County. Total damage to public property in the county was estimated at $46 million. Johnson Space Center escaped significant damage, though 200 nearby trees were toppled by the strong winds and a few facility doors and windows were damaged.

====Elsewhere in Texas====

Relatively less severe damage along the Texas coast between High Island, Texas and Sabine Pass, Texas where structures generally sustained roof and window damage but most remained intact. Coastal roads were flooded by storm surge and numerous power lines were downed. In Chambers County, Texas, Alicia caused $24 million in damage and the loss of 30–50 percent of the county&#x27;s rice and soybean crops. More than 200 homes were flooded, forcing residents into shelters. Damage was significant on the southern end of Bay City, Texas, where several homes were destroyed. Heavy rains from Alicia caused localized flooding in Southeastern Texas under a wide swath of ≥ rainfall. The highest rainfall totals were largely east of the hurricane&#x27;s center with a secondary maximum farther east along the Texas–Louisiana border near Orange, Texas. The highest measured rainfall total occurred at Greens Bayou, where of rain fell. The Pine Island Bayou in Hardin County, Texas overflowed its banks and adjacent areas remained inundated for a week after of rain fell across the county. Floodwaters blocked roads in Jefferson County where Cow Bayou and the Neches River overflowed their banks. Widespread power outages also impacted the county, affecting over 10,000 homes in the Port Arthur and Sabine Pass areas. Similar effects were felt in nearby Liberty County where crop damage from the heavy rains and winds amounted to near $10 million 

In eastern Brazoria County, Texas, strong winds caused widespread damage to roofs, mobile homes, and automobiles. Damage was also wrought to several aircraft at the Texas Gulf Coast Regional Airport in Freeport, Texas; damage in the city totaled $1 million. Sixty-five percent of structures were damaged in Danbury, Texas. Extensive power outages affected Fort Bend County, Texas. Damage in Matagorda was mostly caused by tidal flooding and winds; 4,500 residents evacuated after the storm surge flooded low-lying areas, forcing the closure of two drawbridges crossing the Intracoastal Waterway connecting the mainland to the Matagorda Peninsula. Wind-induced rice crop damage was estimated at $3.5 million. Elsewhere in East Texas, Alicia&#x27;s strong winds and heavy rains blocked power and water supplies in several cities. Two people were killed in Montgomery County due to fallen trees.

The hurricane also produced 22 tornadoes across Texas, associated primarily with a single strong outer rainband northeast of Alicia&#x27;s center; the majority were brief and weak F0 tornadoes that caused negligible damage. One F1 tornado in Harris County damage two businesses near the intersection of Interstate 45 and Texas State Highway NASA Road 1. The strongest tornado was an F2 tornado in Corsicana that was responsible for a significant proportion of the damage toll in North Texas. The tornado touched down in the morning of August 18 in the western extents of Corsicana and lasted for five minutes on a track, damaging several buildings including homes, a church, and a horse arena. In addition to the F2 tornado, the weakening Alicia produced strong winds in North Texas. In Panola County, these winds destroyed outbuildings and downed powerlines and trees in addition to damaging roofs. The weakening storm brought strong thunderstorms over the Dallas–Fort Worth area, bringing gusts estimated between and causing structural damage throughout the metropolitan area. Some condominiums under construction were destroyed by the winds and trees and powerlines were downed in Keller, Texas and Grapevine, Texas. A freeway sign was dislodged and fell upon two 18-wheeler trucks in Dallas, killing the driver of one truck and seriously injuring the driver of the other truck. Creeks swelled following heavy rains, with a local maximum of near Mexia, Texas. A ten-year-old boy died after they were swept away by a rapidly flowing current.

===Elsewhere===
Negligible impacts were felt in Louisiana from Alicia&#x27;s storm surge. Near El Reno, Oklahoma, of rain fell within a 5-hour period, resulting in significant flooding west of the town. Similar rainfall rates flooded several buildings at the University of Oklahoma.

==Aftermath==
The Red Cross provided food and shelter to 63,000 people in the hurricane&#x27;s wake, costing about $166 million (1983 USD; $  USD). FEMA gave out $32 million (1983 USD; $  USD) to Alicia&#x27;s victims and local governments; $23 million (1983 USD; $  USD) of that was for picking up debris spread after the storm. More than 16,000 people sought help from FEMA&#x27;s disaster service centers. The Small Business Administration, aided with 56 volunteers, interviewed over 16,000 victims, and it was predicted that about 7,000 loan applications would be submitted. The Federal Insurance Agency had closed over 1,318 flood insurance cases from Alicia&#x27;s aftermath, however only 782 received final payment.

On September 23 and September 24, 1983, in the wake of Alicia, two subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives held hearings in Houston. The hearing on September 23 were to examine the primary issues of the NWS during Alicia, the effectiveness of the NWS in current procedures, and the use of the NWS. The second hearing, which occurred on September 24, was to discuss the damage and recovery efforts during Alicia. During the September 23 hearing, witnesses agreed that the NWS did well before and during the emergency caused by Alicia. NWS forecasters also testified in which they said they gratified themselves that their predictions were well &quot;on target&quot; and that the local emergency plans had worked so well, which saved many lives. Mayor Gus Manuel on Galveston claimed that the NWS did an excellent job during Alicia. He was also very impressed about their landfall predictions on August 17. During the September 24 hearing, evidence was presented which demonstrated the need for improving readiness to cope with disasters, such as Alicia. Mayor Manuel mentioned that his town needed stronger building codes, which were under review.

== Retirement ==
Due to the severe damage caused by the hurricane, the name &quot;Alicia&quot; was retired in the spring of 1984 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never be used again for another Atlantic tropical system. It was replaced with &quot;Allison&quot; for the 1989 season.
