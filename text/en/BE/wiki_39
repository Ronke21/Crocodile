<text>A homeowner association (or homeowners&#x27; association HOA], sometimes referred to as a property owners&#x27; association POA], common interest development CID], or homeowner community) is a private, legally-incorporated organization that governs a housing community, collects dues, and sets rules for its residents. HOAs are found principally in the United States, Canada, the Philippines, as well as some other countries. They are formed either &quot;ipso jure&quot; (such as in a building with multiple owner-occupancies), or by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing, managing, and selling homes and lots in a residential subdivision. The developer may transfer control of an HOA after selling a predetermined number of lots.

In most cases, a person who wants to buy a residence within the area of a HOA must become a member, and therefore must obey the governing documents including articles of incorporation, CC&amp;Rs (covenants, conditions and restrictions) and by-laws—which may limit the owner&#x27;s choices, for example, exterior design modifications (e.g., paint colors). HOAs are especially active in urban planning, zoning, and land use—decisions that affect the pace of growth, the quality of life, the level of taxation, and the value of land in the community.

Most HOAs are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and HOAs. State oversight of HOAs varies from state to state; some states, such as Florida and California, have a large body of HOA law. Other states, such as Massachusetts, have limited HOA law. HOAs are commonly found in residential developments since the passage of the Davis–Stirling Common Interest Development Act in 1985. In Canada, HOAs are subject to stringent provincial regulations and are thus quite rare compared to the United States. However in recent decades, HOAs have infrequently been created in new subdivision developments in Alberta and Ontario. 

The fastest-growing form of housing in the United States today are common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned unit developments of single-family homes, condominiums, and housing cooperatives. Since 1964, HOAs have become increasingly common in the United States. The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that in 2010, HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents. Throughout the rest of the world, HOAs—though they do exist in some neighborhoods—are uncommon.

==History==
For centuries, communities have, informally or formally, combined resources to maintain common areas, like wells or roads. However, modern HOAs established covenants and deed restrictions to dictate who could buy a home in a development. These were the children of deed restrictions in a new kind of planned subdivision, and they established the national legal precedent for zoning districts exclusively for upscale, single-family residences. Private restrictions normally included provisions such as minimum required costs for home construction and the exclusion of all non-Caucasians, and sometimes non-Christians as well, from occupancy, except domestic servants.

In the early postwar period after World War II, many were defined to exclude African Americans and, in some cases, Jews, with Asians also excluded on the West Coast. Some of the first HOAs were formed early in the 20th century in Los Angeles County. The Arroyo Seco Improvement Association in Pasadena was founded around 1905 by Henry Huntington, a transit magnate who developed several whites-only housing divisions. The Los Feliz Improvement Association (still in operation today) in Los Angeles was founded in 1916. A racial covenant in a Seattle, Washington, neighborhood stated, &quot;No part of said property hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic race.&quot; In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled such covenants unenforceable in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;. However, private contracts effectively kept them alive until the Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited such discrimination. However, by requiring approval of tenants and new owners, HOAs still have the potential to permit less formalized discrimination.

In 1963, the FHA had approved federal home mortgage insurance exclusively for condominiums or for homes in subdivisions that had a qualifying HOA. The rationale was that developers wanted to get around density laws. The effect, however, was to divert investment from multi-family housing and home construction or renovation in the inner cities. This accelerated the middle-class exodus to the suburbs and into common-interest housing. The rapid expansion of federally subsidized highways under federal programs made access to new areas easy.

According to Donald R. Stabile, the explosion in the number of CIDs (many of which were based on homeowners&#x27; associations) was strongly influenced by a 1964 publication (TB 50) by the Urban Land Institute. This technical bulletin was funded by the National Association of Home Builders and by certain federal agencies: the FHA, the United States Public Health Service, the Office of Civil Defense, the Veterans Administration, and the Urban Renewal Administration.

In order to do this while still retaining a suburban look, they clustered homes around green open areas maintained by associations. These associations provided services that formerly had been provided by municipal agencies funded by property taxes. Residents of such development also had to pay their local taxes. Accordingly, local governments began promoting subdivision development as a means of improving their cash flow.

In an effort to control water pollution, the U.S. Clean Water Act of 1977 required that all new real estate developments had to detain storm water so that flow to adjoining properties was not greater than the pre-development runoff. As a result, nearly all residential developments had to construct detention or retention areas to hold excess storm water until it could be released at the pre-development flow level. Since these detention areas serve multiple residences, they are almost always designated as &quot;common&quot; areas. This requirement was a reason for developers to establish an HOA. Although these areas can be placed on an individual homeowner&#x27;s lot, eliminating the need for an association, some U.S. municipalities now require these areas to be part of a common area to ensure an entity, rather than an individual or the municipality itself, has maintenance responsibility. Real estate developers have frequently established HOAs to maintain such common areas. Having established the HOA, the developers have expanded their scope, giving them authority to regulate changes to residences, landscaping and maintenance requirements, color of houses, etc., a variety of other requirements and amenities that the developers believe will make their project more desirable to the market.

==Industry==

The Community Associations Institute (CAI) is a trade association of individuals and businesses that sell supplies or services to HOAs, and is dominated by lawyers and HOA managers. The CAI does not represent HOAs. It lobbies the legislatures of states that have HOAs in order to promote legislation beneficial to its interests.

==Operation==
Although in some cases membership in an HOA may be voluntary for a property owner, in the majority of cases membership in an HOA is mandatory. Once an owner purchases property within the subdivision, that owner becomes a mandatory member of the HOA, and must pay assessments to, and abide by the rules of, the HOA.

In return, the owner/member is permitted to participate in the HOA&#x27;s governance and use the amenities offered by the HOA, provided that they are current on assessments (or on a payment plan to become current). Once an owner sells or otherwise transfers interest in all the property owned within the HOA, the owner ceases to be a member of the HOA and loses all rights previously held.

===Governance===
Usually HOAs are structured as private corporations or private unincorporated associations (commonly as non-profit ones). HOAs are governed by federal and state statutes applicable to corporations (or unincorporated associations if so structured), as well as the HOA&#x27;s own &quot;governing documents&quot;.

The HOA&#x27;s governing documents generally &quot;run with the land&quot;, which means that all current and future owners of property within the HOA will be bound by them as a condition of property ownership. They usually include:

*The covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) of the subdivision. These are likely the most important documents affecting the subdivision and are usually created when the subdivision is initially formed, and as such are often recorded in the official property records of the county or other jurisdiction where the subdivision is located. Commonly the CC&amp;Rs specify what types of structures can be placed on a lot (e.g. an upscale community may prohibit mobile homes or travel trailers and require minimum sizes on dwellings, along with offsets from the property line where building is prohibited) and other property restrictions (e.g. no animals except for traditional household pets, no operation of commercial business).
*The HOA&#x27;s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
*In some cases the documents may include board-enacted rules as authorized (expressly or implicitly) by the CC&amp;Rs.

Generally CC&amp;Rs are enforceable as legal documents. However, there are instances where a CC&amp;R is rendered illegal by later enacted state or federal law and therefore is no longer enforceable. For example, a developer-drafted covenant giving the developer sole rights to amend the CC&amp;Rs was declared unenforceable as a matter of public policy in at least one state, where the developer attempted to amend years after he had sold all the property. That state&#x27;s legislature later codified that public policy. Other examples include CC&amp;Rs which prohibited sales of property to certain racial groups; the Fair Housing Act rendered all of these also to be unconstitutional and unenforceable.

===Board of directors===
The HOA will be governed by a board of directors.

Initially, the board is composed of developer-appointed members, in order to maintain the character of the community that the developer has for it. As the percentage of ownership shifts from the developer toward owners, the corresponding percentage changes from developer-appointed members to homeowners elected at an annual meeting, and ultimately the board will consist solely of homeowner-elected members.

Usually, the board (or parts of it) will be elected at an annual meeting of the homeowners, as specified in the Bylaws. In order to avoid an owner of multiple lots (who likely own the lots for resale or rental property) controlling the HOA&#x27;s operation (to the detriment of those owners who only own a single lot or two contiguous lots as a current or future residence or vacation home), the Bylaws may limit all owners (regardless of the number of lots owned) to one or two votes per owner.

Depending on the state, board meetings may be required to be open to the public, except in instances where a board may enter into an &quot;executive session&quot; for discussion on confidential matters (e.g. discussions with its attorney on an upcoming lawsuit).

The board of directors makes decisions regarding the HOA, including management of the HOA&#x27;s finances, protecting the HOA&#x27;s real and intangible assets (generally the amenities provided which were the basis for inducing people to purchase lots), and enforcing the governing documents. Boards of directors have a fiduciary duty to the property owners; violation of that duty may result in liability for individual directors, and as such the HOA will often adopt an ethics code for the board members to ensure they act ethically and in accordance with their responsibilities. To gain a clear understanding of the responsibilities of the HOA board, community members need to read their association&#x27;s CC&amp;Rs, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and other rules.

===Association management===
Many HOAs (especially larger ones with more upscale amenities) hire management companies to handle the governing duties of the association.

Management services are typically divided into three categories: financial only, full management, and on-site management. Financial services typically cover administration of bank accounts, bookkeeping, assessment collection, and the HOAs budget. Full management typically includes the financial services plus help with board meetings (keeping minutes, agendas, etc.), board elections, and maintenance duties (obtaining contractor bids, etc.). On-site management typically includes all of the full management services plus direct assistance to homeowners with an assigned manager to the HOA.

Education requirements for managers varies from state to state, with some requiring certification under all circumstances and others having a more lenient approach. For instance, while California does not require HOA managers to be certified, it does require that managers meet certain educational requirements to claim certification.

===Powers===
Through its board an HOA will provide some level of amenities (though differing greatly between HOAs), regulate activities within a development, levy assessments, and may (if authorized by CC&amp;Rs or a state legislature) impose fines for noncompliance.

Depending on the governing documents, HOA boards may create committees, such as an &quot;architectural control committee&quot; (this is a very common one, and frequently this committee has the ultimate authority to approve or deny a building request), a pool committee, a neighborhood watch committee, etc.

Depending on the governing documents or state law, the HOA may have the authority to place liens on a property (for non-payment of assessments and/or noncompliance with CC&amp;Rs, an example would be the costs to remove a non compliant structure such as a mobile home on a lot restricted to &quot;site built&quot; housing) and to, ultimately, foreclose on it.

Homeowners have the ability to defend against such actions, and are usually entitled to sue HOAs for contractual or statutory violations, or for a legal determination as to the enforceability of a provision in the governing documents. However, because HOAs are private associations, they are not considered &quot;state actors&quot; subject to constitutional constraints, and therefore homeowners cannot sue for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. 1983.

The major power of the HOA is the ability to compel property owners to pay a share of common expenses for the overall maintenance of the HOA and the amenities, usually proportionate to the ownership interests (either by unit or based on square footage). These expenses generally arise from the operation and maintenance of common property, which vary dramatically depending on the type of association. An HOA may have, in addition to a regular assessment, a &quot;special&quot; assessment for unexpected expenses (such as for road maintenance).

The assessment may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually; generally the more amenities provided the more frequent the assessment must be paid. Some associations operate little or no common property, and the expenses relate solely to enforcement of use restrictions or assumed services. Others are effectively private towns, with elaborate amenities including private roads, street lights, services, utilities, commonly owned buildings, pools, and even schools. Assessments paid to HOAs in the United States amount to billions of dollars a year, but are not classed as property taxes.

When determining what the assessment should be, it is important to consider what funds are required. There should always be a minimum of two funds: an operating fund and a reserve fund. The operating fund is used to pay for the operating expenses of the association. A reserve fund is used to pay for the infrequent and expensive common area assets maintenance, repair and replacement costs. The reserve fund is crucial for reducing the chances of a special assessment (mentioned in the risks below). Obtaining a reserve study is recommended to help determine and set the reserve contribution rate which is included in the regular monthly assessment.

==Effects==
According to a 2019 study in the &quot;Journal of Labor Economics&quot;, &quot;houses in HOAs have prices that are on average at least 4%, or $13,500, greater than observably similar houses outside of HOAs. The HOA premium correlates with the stringency of local land use regulation, local government spending on public goods, and measures of social attitudes toward race.&quot; The study also found that people in HOA neighborhoods &quot;are on average more affluent and racially segregated than those living in other nearby neighborhoods.&quot;

===For homeowners===
The perception of the benefits that an HOA provides to homeowners varies depending on the specific regulations and practices of the HOA. These benefits may include amenities (eg. a pool, tennis courts, clubhouse, and open areas). Individuals may also benefit more or less depending on their political standing in the association and the degree to which the community&#x27;s decisions match their preferences. In the 1994 court case &quot;Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Assn.&quot;, the California Supreme Court noted: 
&quot;...Owners associations &#x27;can be a powerful force for good or for ill&#x27; in their members&#x27; lives. Therefore, anyone who buys a unit in a common interest development with knowledge of its owners association&#x27;s discretionary power accepts &#x27;the risk that the power may be used in a way that benefits the commonality but harms the individual.&#x27;&quot;

Benefits to homeowners may include maintenance and management services, provision of recreational amenities such as pools and parks, insurance coverage, enforcement of community appearance standards which may lead to higher property values, and the opportunity for members to plan development in accordance with community values.

Disadvantages to homeowners may include the financial burden of association fees, punitive fines, and costs of maintaining appearance standards; restrictions on property use and personal autonomy; and the potential for mismanagement by the board, including the possibility of arbitrary or heavy-handed enforcement of rules.

===For the municipality===

Many municipalities have welcomed HOAs in the belief that they may reduce operational costs for the local government. Since the homeowners sometimes pay for roads, parks, and other services within the development, the local government may believe it can gain revenue from property taxes from owners in a development that costs the municipality little or nothing.

A 2009 study of California HOAs suggested that this assumption was partially true, but that the overall effect of HOAs on municipalities was mixed. While HOAs did offset the costs of city governments to a small degree, they also reduced overall tax revenues because their members, insulated from the larger community, tended to vote down taxes that the city required to fund services. This led to an overall decrease in government expenditures that disproportionately affected those citizens who did not reside in an HOA.

As the study noted, 
&quot;...critics of private governments claim that HOAs erode support for public institutions. Those who join can bypass the public system: homeowners who fear crime do not have to vote for tax dollars to attack the root of the problem; they can build a gate to keep the criminals out. Opponents maintain that the erosion of public support, reflected at the ballot box, leads to further deterioration of municipal services and reductions in local revenues. Nonmembers experience a reduction in public service levels and may be worse off. At the extreme, HOAs may contribute to sentiments of secession and withdrawal from the public sector.&quot;

===For real estate developers===
Real estate developers establish HOAs in the belief that they can contribute to the developer&#x27;s ability to build and sell units profitably. Providing common amenities may enable developers to build at a higher density, if the local government has encouraged such results. In addition, by relieving municipalities of the costs of road and utility maintenance, developers may obtain more favorable terms. Ordinarily, the developer retains some control over the HOA until a specified number of units are sold, and the covenants, conditions, and restrictions of the HOA are put in place to further this goal.

The potential disadvantage to a developer is that they may be exposed to liability to the HOA for poor construction, misleading marketing, or other problems. In these cases, the HOA may sue the developer.

===Regulations===

In &quot;The Voluntary City&quot;, published by the libertarian Independent Institute, Donald J. Boudreaux and Randall G. Holcombe note that the association&#x27;s creator (e.g. a developer) has an incentive to set up a government structured in such a way as to maximize profits and thus increase the selling price of the property. If a certain decision would increase the selling price of certain parcels and decrease the selling price of others, the developer will choose the option that yields his project the highest net income. This may result in sub-optimal outcomes for the homeowners.

==Criticisms==

=== Voting ===
HOAs established a new community as a municipal corporation. Voting in an HOA is based on property ownership, By the 1970s, only property owners were eligible to vote, while renters are prohibited from directly voting for the unit. They could, however, deal directly with their landlords under their lease contract, since that is the party who has responsibility to them. In the 1973 book &quot;Federally Assisted Communities: New Dimensions in Urban Development&quot;, author Hugh Mields, Jr. raised questions about the constitutionality of having an association that had the authority of a municipal government, despite being private in nature.

Additionally, voting representation is equal to the proportion of ownership, not to the number of people. The majority of property owners may be absentee landlords, whose values or incentives may not be aligned with the tenants&#x27;. However, some HOAs limit owners of multiple properties to one or two votes regardless of the number of lots owned, so absentee owners do not end up controlling the HOA to the detriment of residents who only own a single lot or two contiguous lots as a current or future residence or vacation home.

In some HOAs, the developer may have multiple votes for each lot it retains, but the homeowners are limited to only one vote per lot owned. This has been justified on the grounds that it allows residents to avoid decision costs until major questions about the development process already have been answered and that as the residual claimant, the developer has the incentive to maximize the value of the property.

=== Restrictions ===
HOAs have been criticized for having excessively restrictive rules and regulations on how homeowners may conduct themselves and use their property.

Some of the restrictions commonly put into place by HOAs are limiting the length of grass, number of cars on a property, what animals you can have on your property, the maximum volume for playing music at certain times of day, what signs you can display on your property, and what plants you can plant.

Homeowners have challenged political speech restrictions in associations that federal or state constitutional guarantees as rights, claiming that certain private associations are &quot;de facto&quot; municipal governments and should therefore be subject to the same legal restrictions.

Several court decisions have held that private actors may restrict individuals&#x27; exercise of their rights on private property. A 2007 decision in New Jersey held that private residential communities had the right to place reasonable limitations on political speech, and that in doing so, they were not acting as municipal governments. With few exceptions, courts have rejected claims that private actors are subject to constitutional limitations in a manner comparable to courts and police.

In 2002, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in &quot;Loren v. Sasser&quot;, declined to extend &quot;Shelley&quot; beyond racial discrimination and disallowed a challenge to an association&#x27;s prohibition of &quot;for sale&quot; signs. In &quot;Loren&quot;, the court ruled that outside the racial covenant context, it would not view judicial enforcement of a private contract as state action, but as private action, and accordingly would disallow any First Amendment relief.

In the &quot;Twin Rivers&quot; case, a group of homeowners collectively called The Committee for a Better Twin Rivers sued the association, for a mandatory injunction permitting homeowners to post political signs and strike down the political signage restrictions by the association as unconstitutional. The appeals court held the restrictions on political signs unconstitutional and void, but the appeals court was reversed when the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the appellate court&#x27;s decision in 2007 and reinstated the decision of the trial court.

===Financial risk for homeowners===
In some U.S. states (such as Texas) an HOA can foreclose a member&#x27;s house without any judicial procedure in order to collect special assessments, fees and fines, or otherwise place an enforceable lien on the property which, upon the property&#x27;s sale, allows the HOA to collect otherwise unpaid assessments. In 2008, a soldier, who was serving in Iraq, was informed that his fully paid-for, $300,000 home in Frisco, Texas had been foreclosed on and sold for $3,500 to recover unpaid HOA dues of $800. In 2010, the case was settled and the soldier regained ownership of the home. Federal laws protecting military personnel from civil action may have been his defense; however, a gag order prevents details from being known.

Other states, like Florida, require a judicial hearing. Foreclosure without a judicial hearing can occur when a &quot;power of sale clause&quot; exists in a mortgage or deed of trust.

A self-published report by a professor at the University of Washington disputes the claim that HOAs protect property values, stating, based on a survey of Harris County, Texas (which had an unusual legal regime regarding foreclosures): &quot;Although HOA foreclosures are ostensibly motivated by efforts to improve property values, neither foreclosure activity nor HOAs appear linked with the above average home price growth.&quot;

HOA boards can also collect special assessments from its members in addition to set fees, sometimes without the homeowners&#x27; direct vote on the matter, though most states place restrictions on an association&#x27;s ability to do so. Special assessments often require a homeowner-vote if the amount exceeds a prescribed limit established in the association&#x27;s by-laws.

In California, for example, a special assessment can be imposed by a board, without a membership vote, only when the total assessment is five percent or less of the association&#x27;s annual budget. Therefore, in the case of a 25-unit association with a $100,000 annual operating budget, the board could only impose a $5,000 assessment on the entire population ($5,000 divided by 25 units equals $200 per unit). A larger assessment would require a majority vote of the members.

In some exceptional cases, particularly in matters of public health or safety, the amount of special assessments may be at the board&#x27;s discretion. If, for example there is a ruptured sewer line, the Board could vote a substantial assessment immediately, arguing that the matter affects public health and safety. In practice, however, most boards prefer that owners have a chance to voice opinions and vote on assessments.

Increasingly, HOAs handle large amounts of money. Embezzlement from associations has occurred occasionally, as a result of dishonest board members or community managers, with losses up to millions of dollars. Again, California&#x27;s Davis–Stirling Act, which was designed to protect owners, requires that boards carry appropriate liability insurance to indemnify the association from any wrongdoing. The large budgets and expertise required to run such groups are a part of the arguments behind mandating manager certification (through Community Association Institute, state real estate boards, or other agencies).

In 2006, the AARP voiced concern that HOAs pose a risk to the financial welfare of their members. They have proposed that a homeowners &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; be adopted by all 50 states to protect seniors from rogue HOAs.

However, many HOAs introduce regular accounting audits to mitigate homeowners&#x27; financial risks. In the framework of such an inspection, an independent third-party CPA (Certified Public Accountant) conducts a comprehensive analysis of an association&#x27;s financial records and accounting procedures, to determine whether they are accurate, legitimate and compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or other reporting frameworks. Upon completion of the planned auditing procedures, a CPA issues an official report that states an opinion regarding the organization&#x27;s financial health.

In the US, auditing requirements vary from state to state, as well as from HOA to HOA. Some associations are obliged to audit their financial statements on an annual basis or once every few years. For others, it is enough to conduct a review, a compilation or an agreed-upon procedures engagement. The HOA&#x27;s budget, size and terms prescribed in covenants and bylaws often act as decisive factors when determining whether an audit is obligatory for a particular board. An audit at the end of each fiscal year is deemed to be a good rule of thumb. However, the need for an unscheduled examination can arise in cases of major changes, like a transition to a new board or management company, implementation of a large-scale improvement project, receipt of a significant sum of money under unusual circumstances, suspicion of fraud or embezzlement, or other misconduct.

====Auditing process====
The auditing process for HOAs can be divided into four stages:

;Planning: An HOA board makes an initial inquiry to an accounting specialist about the need to conduct an audit. A consultation is held to negotiate the objectives, time frame, report deadlines, and cost of the examination.

;Risk assessment:A CPA determines what obstacles can float up when testing the association&#x27;s accounting procedures and preparing financial statements, gauges the significance of potential problems, and finds ways to overcome them. To collect the necessary information and evaluate an HOA&#x27;s financial performance, the auditor interviews board members at their office, monitors the main day-to-day operations, tests their security, and performs analytical procedures. The auditee must provide the CPA with the most recent audit report, copies of annual tax returns, current and ensuing year&#x27;s budget, board minutes, covenants, bylaws, and other internal documents. The CPA tests internal controls for incoming and outgoing transactions, the maintenance of a reserve fund, the appropriateness of financing of major contracts and improvement projects, the proper disposal of funds acquired in legal cases and under other extraordinary circumstances, and the availability and accuracy of journal entries of receipts and disbursements. These issues are given the most attention, since they have the strongest influence on an HOA&#x27;s financial health. Also, an auditor reaches out to third-party organizations to verify the HOA&#x27;s transactions on both sides:

:* Account confirmations are requested from banks to check whether the association&#x27;s operational and reserve accounts contain the claimed sums. 
:* The same is done for loans. A CPA verifies loan balances, interest rates, repayment terms and other important details. 
:* The HOA&#x27;s attorney is contacted to check whether the association is involved in any legal cases.

;Fieldwork: The auditor conducts a profound analysis to establish relationships between the association&#x27;s income statement and balance sheet. The previous year&#x27;s results are compared with the current results. Since it is impossible to cover all of an HOA&#x27;s transactions in an audit, a CPA selects a sample of transactions and scrutinizes details. For example, they can use a sample of outgoing transactions to verify invoices and make sure all the funds were spent as intended and properly documented. Also, an auditor can verify bank statements, reconciliations, payroll records, canceled checks, loan statements, approved contracts and leases, proof of real estate and equipment ownership, records on capital assets, supplies and inventories. If the HOA&#x27;s actual financial performance deviates from the planned indicators, the auditee must provide evidence that fluctuations are not due to the board&#x27;s negligence or misconduct.

;Reporting: An audit report states the CPA&#x27;s opinion on the HOA&#x27;s financial health and its compliance with accounting documents and with generally accepted standards. There are three types of audit reports:

:* Unqualified opinion: in all respects, the HOA&#x27;s financial statements are accurate, legitimate, reflect the actual activity of the association and comply with GAAP.
:* Qualified opinion: minor misrepresentations or deviations from GAAP were found in the HOA&#x27;s accounting papers. This does not significantly influence its overall financial performance, and mistakes are easy to correct. 
:* Adverse opinion: accounting violations that point to fraud or the board&#x27;s blatant negligence were detected.

:One more option is a disclaimer of opinion, a document compiled when a CPA is unable to issue an audit report due to conflicting interests with an HOA, non-provision of the requested financial documents, or significant uncertainty in the association&#x27;s accounting operations.

:Improvement recommendations in an audit report can be used to fix the board&#x27;s past mistakes, establish internal discipline, and adopt more effective accounting practices. Also, audited financial statements serve as evidence of the board&#x27;s good faith and sound strategies when reporting to unit owners, investors, potential real estate buyers, tenants and other interested parties.

;Repeat audits: The need for a repeat audit may arise if the board has received an adverse opinion and wants to restore its good name in the eyes of shareholders and investors. After issues revealed in the initial audit are fixed, a repeat examination is conducted according to the standard scenario.

=== Other ===
Some scholars and officials of the AARP have charged that, in a variety of ways, HOAs suppress the rights of their residents. Due to court decisions, describing HOAs as a kind of private entity, HOA boards of directors are not bound by constitutional restrictions on governments—although they are &quot;de facto&quot; a level of government.

Corporation and HOA laws provide a limited role for HOA homeowners. Unless either statutory law or the corporation&#x27;s governing documents reserve a particular issue or action for approval by the members, corporation laws provide that the activities and affairs of a corporation shall be conducted and &quot;all corporate powers shall be exercised&quot; by or under the direction of the board of directors. Many boards are operated outside of their state&#x27;s non-profit corporation laws. Knowledge of corporate laws and state statutes is essential to properly managing an HOA.

Once notified by a homeowner, attorney or other government official that an HOA organization is not meeting the state&#x27;s statutes, the board has the responsibility to correct their governance. Certain states, such as Texas, permit misdemeanor charges to be filed against a non-compliant board and permit lawsuits to be filed against the board and the HOA. In some instances, a known failure to rectify the board&#x27;s governance to meet the state&#x27;s statutes can open the board&#x27;s members to personal liability as most insurance policies indemnifying the board members against legal action do not cover willful misconduct.

==Board misconduct==
The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs reported these observations of association board conduct:
&quot;It is obvious from the complaints [to DCA] that that [home]owners did not realize the extent association rules could govern their lives.&quot;
&quot;Curiously, with rare exceptions, when the State has notified boards of minimal association legal obligation to owners, they dispute compliance. In a disturbing number of instances, those owners with board positions use their influence to punish other owners with whom they disagree. The complete absence of even minimally required standards, training or even orientations for those sitting on boards and the lack of independent oversight is readily apparent in the way boards exercise control&quot;
Overwhelmingly ... the frustrations posed by the duplicative complainants or by the complainants&#x27; misunderstandings are dwarfed by the pictures they reveal of the undemocratic life faced by owners in many associations. Letters routinely express a frustration and outrage easily explainable by the inability to secure the attention of boards or property managers, to acknowledge no less address their complaints. Perhaps most alarming is the revelation that boards, or board presidents desirous of acting contrary to law, their governing documents or to fundamental democratic principles, are unstoppable without extreme owner effort and often costly litigation.

Certain states are pushing for more checks and balances in HOAs. The North Carolina Planned Community Act, for example, requires a due process hearing to be held before any homeowner may be fined for a covenant violation. It also limits the amount of the fine and sets other restrictions.

California law has strictly limited the prerogatives of boards by requiring hearings before fines can be levied and then reducing the size of such fines even if the owner-members do not appear. In California, any rule change made by the board is subject to a majority affirmation by the membership if only five percent of the membership demand a vote. This part of the civil code also ensures that any dissenting individual who seeks a director position must be fully represented to the membership and that all meetings be opened and agenda items publicized in advance. In states like Massachusetts, there are no laws to prohibit unilateral changes to the documents by the association board.

== Double taxation ==
Most homeowners are subject to property taxation, whether or not said property is located in a planned unit development governed by an HOA. Such taxes are used by local municipalities to maintain roads, street lighting, parks, etc. In addition to municipal property taxes, individuals who own private property located within planned unit developments are subject to association assessments that are used by the development to maintain the private roads, street lighting, landscaping, security, and amenities located within the planned unit development.

A non-HOA property owner pays taxes to fund street repairs performed by the city. The HOA property owners pay these same taxes, and benefit from their use of public roads, etc. without the local government (i.e. taxpayers) having to pay for the HOA&#x27;s private roads, etc. which the non-HOA property owner cannot use. 
The proliferation of planned unit developments has resulted in a cost savings to local governments in two ways. One, by requiring developers to build &#x27;public improvements&#x27; such as parks, passing the cost of maintenance of the improvements to the common-interest owners; and two, by planned-unit developments being responsible for the cost of maintaining infrastructures that would normally be maintained by the municipality.

== Limits to powers ==
In June 2012, the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled in the case &quot;Shadowood Condominium Association et al. v. Fairfax County Redevelopment and Housing Authority&quot; that an HOA&#x27;s power to fine owners for rule violations (including being in arrears) is limited to those expressly provided in the HOA&#x27;s valid governing documents (e.g. the HOA&#x27;s Bylaws).

Prior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, HOAs could limit or prohibit installation of satellite dishes. Many communities still have these rules in their CC&amp;Rs, but after October 1996, they are no longer enforceable. With a few exceptions, any homeowner may install a satellite dish of a size of one meter or smaller in diameter (larger dishes are protected in Alaska). While HOAs may encourage that dishes be placed as inconspicuously as possible, the dish must be allowed to be placed where it may receive a usable signal.

Many HOAs have restrictive covenants preventing a homeowner from installing an OTA (over-the-air) rooftop antenna. These restrictions are also no longer enforceable, except in some instances. For example: the antenna may be installed at any location unless it imposes upon common property. Also, the antenna must be of a design to receive local, not long-distance signals and must not extend any higher than twelve feet above the top roof-line of the home, unless an exception is granted by the HOA due to extenuating terrestrial interference.

In Florida, state law prohibits covenants and deed restrictions from prohibiting &quot;Florida-Friendly Landscaping,&quot; a type of xeriscaping. In spite of the law, at least one homeowner has faced harassment and threat of fines from an HOA for having insufficient grass after landscaping his yard to reduce water usage. Similar legislation was introduced and passed by the legislature in Colorado but was vetoed by governor Bill Owens. Residents in Colorado have continued to call for regulation to protect xeriscaping, citing HOAs that require the use of grasses that consume large quantities of water and threaten fines for those who do not comply with the covenants.

== Alternative to CIDs ==
An alternative to HIOs is the multiple-tenant income property (MTIP). HOAs and MTIPs have fundamentally different forms of governance. In a CID, dues are paid to a nonprofit association. In an MTIP, ground rents are paid to a landowner, who decides how to spend it.

In both cases, certain guidelines are set out by the covenant or the lease contract. In the latter scenario, the landowner has a stronger incentive to maximize the value of all the governed property in the long term (because they are the residual claimant of it all) and to keep the residents happy, since their income is dependent on their continued patronage. These factors are cited as arguments in favor of MTIPs.

<doc id="279669" wikidata="Q332426" url="?curid=279669" title="George Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney">
<text>Admiral George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, KB (bap. 13 February 1718 – 24 May 1792), was a Royal Navy officer, politician and colonial administrator. He is best known for his commands in the American War of Independence, particularly his victory over the French at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. It is often claimed that he was the commander to have pioneered the tactic of breaking the line.

Rodney came from a distinguished but poor background, and went to sea at the age of fourteen. His first major action was the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747. He made a large amount of prize money during the 1740s, allowing him to purchase a large country estate and a seat in the House of Commons of Great Britain. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Rodney was involved in a number of amphibious operations such as the raids on Rochefort and Le Havre and the Siege of Louisbourg. He became well known for his role in the capture of Martinique in 1762. Following the Peace of Paris, Rodney&#x27;s financial situation stagnated. He spent large sums of money pursuing his political ambitions. By 1774 he had run up large debts and was forced to flee Britain to avoid his creditors. He was in a French jail when war was declared in 1778. Thanks to a French benefactor, Rodney was able to secure his release and return to Britain where he was appointed to a new command.

Rodney successfully relieved Gibraltar during the Great Siege and defeated a Spanish fleet during the 1780 Battle of Cape St. Vincent, known as the &quot;Moonlight Battle&quot; because it took place at night. He then was posted to the Jamaica Station, where he became involved in the controversial 1781 capture of Sint Eustatius. Later that year he briefly returned home suffering from ill health. During his absence the British lost the crucial Battle of the Chesapeake leading to the surrender at Yorktown.

To some, Rodney was a controversial figure, accused of an obsession with prize money. This was brought to a head in the wake of his taking of Saint Eustatius, for which he was heavily criticised in Britain. Orders for his recall had been sent when Rodney won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782, ending the French threat to Jamaica.

Rodney accompanied the future King William IV on his visit (April 1783) to Cuba. There the prince conferred with Captain General Luis de Unzaga to reach the preliminaries of peace conditions that would later recognize the birth of the United States of America. On his return to Britain, Rodney was made a peer and was awarded an annual pension of £2,000. He lived in retirement until his death in 1792.

== Early life ==
George Brydges Rodney was born either in Walton-on-Thames or in London, though the family seat was Rodney Stoke, Somerset. He was most likely born sometime in January 1718. He was baptised in St Giles-in-the-Fields on 13 February 1718. He was the third of four surviving children of Henry Rodney and Mary (Newton) Rodney, daughter of Sir Henry Newton. His father had served in Spain under the Earl of Peterborough during the War of the Spanish Succession, and on leaving the army served as captain in a marine corps which was disbanded in 1713. A major investment in the South Sea Company ruined Henry Rodney and impoverished the family. In spite of their lack of money, the family was well-connected by marriage. It is sometimes claimed that Henry Rodney had served as commander of the Royal Yacht of George I and it was after him that George was named, but this had been discounted more recently.

George was educated at Harrow School, and left as one of the last King&#x27;s letter boys to join the Royal Navy, having been appointed, by warrant dated 21 June 1732, a junior officer on board .

==Early career==
After serving aboard &quot;Sunderland&quot;, Rodney switched to &quot;Dreadnought&quot; where he served from 1734 to 1737 under Captain Henry Medley who acted as a mentor to him. Around this time he spent eighteen months stationed in Lisbon, a city he would later return to several times. He then changed ships several times, taking part in the navy&#x27;s annual trip to protect the British fishing fleet off Newfoundland in 1738.

He rose swiftly through the ranks of the navy helped by a combination of his own talents and the patronage of the Duke of Chandos.
While serving on the Mediterranean station he was made lieutenant in , his promotion dating 15 February 1739. He then served on &quot;Namur&quot;, the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief Sir Thomas Mathews.

===Captain===
The War of the Austrian Succession had broken out by this point, and in August 1742, Rodney had his first taste of action when he was ordered by Matthews to take a smaller vessel and launch a raid on Ventimiglia, where the Spanish army had stockpiled supplies and stores ready for a planned invasion of Britain&#x27;s ally the Republic of Genoa, which he successfully accomplished. Shortly after this, he attained the rank of post-captain, having been appointed by Matthews to on 9 November. He picked up several British merchantmen in Lisbon to escort them home, but lost contact with them in heavy storms. Once he reached Britain his promotion was confirmed, making him one of the youngest Captains in the navy.

After serving in home waters learning about convoy protection he was appointed to the newly built &quot;Ludlow Castle&quot; which he used to blockade the Scottish coast during the Jacobite Rebellion in 1745. Two of Rodney&#x27;s midshipman aboard &quot;Ludlow Castle&quot; were Samuel Hood, later to become a distinguished sailor, and Rodney&#x27;s younger brother James Rodney. In 1746 he obtained command of the 60-gun . After some time spent blockading French-occupied Ostend and cruising around the Western Approaches, where on 24 May he took his first prize a 16-gun Spanish privateer, &quot;Eagle&quot; was sent to join the Western Squadron.

===Battle of Cape Finisterre===

The Western Squadron was a new strategy by Britain&#x27;s naval planners to operate a more effective blockade system of France by stationing the Home Fleet in the Western Approaches, where they could guard both the English Channel and the French Atlantic coast.

&quot;Eagle&quot; continued to take prizes while stationed with the Squadron being involved directly, or indirectly, in the capture of sixteen enemy ships. After taking one of the captured prizes to Kinsale in Ireland, &quot;Eagle&quot; was not present at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre when the Western Squadron commanded by Lord Anson won a significant victory over the French. While returning from Ireland, &quot;Eagle&quot; fell in with a small squadron under Commodore Thomas Fox which sighted a French merchant convoy heading for the Bay of Biscay. In total around 48 merchantmen were taken by the squadron, although Rodney ignored an order of Fox by pursuing several ships which had broken away from the rest in an attempt to escape managing to capture six of them. Afterwards &quot;Eagle&quot; rejoined the Western Squadron now under the command of Edward Hawke.

On 14 October 1747 the ship took part in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre, a victory off Ushant over the French fleet. The French were trying to escort an outgoing convoy from France to the West Indies and had eight large ships-of-the-line while the British had fourteen smaller ships. Rodney was at the rear of the British line, and &quot;Eagle&quot; was one of the last British ships to come into action engaging the French shortly after noon. Initially &quot;Eagle&quot; was engaged with two French ships, but one moved away. Rodney engaged the 70-gun &quot;Neptune&quot; for two hours until his steering wheel was struck by a lucky shot, and his ship became unmanageable. Rodney later complained that Thomas Fox in &quot;Kent&quot; had failed to support him, and testified at Fox&#x27;s court martial. The British took six of the eight French ships, but were unable to prevent most of the merchant convoy escaping, although much of it was later taken in the West Indies.

The two Battles of Cape Finisterre had proved a vindication of the Western Squadron strategy. Rodney later often referred to &quot;the good old discipline&quot; of the Western Squadron, using it as an example for his own views on discipline. For the remainder of the war Rodney took part in further cruises, and took several more prizes. Following the Congress of Breda, an agreement was signed at the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ending the war. Rodney took his ship back to Plymouth where it was decommissioned on 13 August 1748. Rodney&#x27;s total share of prize money during his time with &quot;Eagle&quot; was £15,000 giving him financial security for the first time in his life.

==Commander==
On 9 May 1749 he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Newfoundland, with the rank of Commodore, it being usual at that time to appoint a naval officer, chiefly on account of the fishery interests. He was given command of and had two smaller ships under his overall command. It was extremely difficult for naval officers to secure commands in peacetime, and Rodney&#x27;s appointment suggests that he was well regarded by his superiors. Rodney&#x27;s role as Governor was rather limited. Each summer a large British fishing fleet sailed for Newfoundland, where it took part in the valuable cod trade. The fleet then returned home during the winter. Rodney oversaw three such trips to Newfoundland between 1749 and 1751.

Around this time Rodney began to harbour political ambitions and gained the support of the powerful Duke of Bedford and Lord Sandwich. He stood unsuccessfully in a 1750 by-election in Launceston. He was elected MP for Saltash, a safe seat controlled by the Admiralty, in 1751. After his third and final trip to Newfoundland in the summer of 1751, Rodney sailed home via Spain and Portugal, escorting some merchantmen. Once home he fell ill, and was then unemployed for around ten months. During this time he oversaw the development of an estate at Old Alresford in Hampshire, which he had bought with the proceeds of his prize money.

In 1753 he married his first wife, Jane Compton (1730–1757), sister of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton. He had initially been undecided whether to marry Jane or her younger sister Kitty whom he had met in Lisbon during his various visits to the city, where their father Charles Compton was consul. The marriage proved happy, and they had three children together before she died in January 1757. From 1753 Rodney commanded a series of Portsmouth guard ships without actually having to go to sea before the onset of the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

The first fighting broke out in North America in 1754, with competing British and French forces clashing in the Ohio Country. Despite this fighting formal war wasn&#x27;t declared in Europe until 1756 and opened with a French attack on Minorca, the loss of which was blamed on Admiral John Byng who was court-martialled and executed. He was shot on the quarterdeck of , which until recently had been commanded by Rodney. Rodney excused himself from serving on the court martial by pleading illness. While Rodney disapproved of Byng&#x27;s conduct, he thought the death sentence excessive and unsuccessfully worked for it to be commuted.

===Louisbourg===

Rodney had in 1755 and 1756, taken part in preventive cruises under Hawke and Edward Boscawen. In 1757, he took part in the expedition against Rochefort, commanding the 74-gun ship of the line . After an initial success, the expedition made no serious attempt on Rochefort and sailed for home. Next year, in the same ship, he was ordered to serve under Boscawen as part of an attempt to capture the strategic French fortress of Louisbourg in North America. He was given the task of carrying Major General Jeffery Amherst, the expedition&#x27;s commander to Louisbourg. On the way Rodney captured a French East Indiamen, and took it into Vigo. This action saw the beginning of criticism of Rodney that he was obsessed with prize money ahead of strategic importance, with some claiming he spent two weeks or more in Vigo making sure of his prize money instead of carrying Amherst to Louisbourg. This appears to be untrue, as Rodney sailed within four days from Vigo.

Rodney and his ship played a minor role in the taking of Louisburg, which laid the way open for a British campaign up the St Lawrence River the following year, and the fall of Quebec. In August 1758 Rodney sailed for home in charge of six warships and ten transports carrying the captured garrison of Louisbourg who were being taken to Britain as prisoners of war.

===Le Havre===

On 19 May 1759 he became a rear admiral, and shortly afterwards he was given command of a small squadron. The admiralty had received intelligence that the French had gathered at Le Havre, at the mouth of the River Seine, a large number of flat-bottomed boats and stores which were being collected there for an invasion of the British Isles. After drawing up plans for an attack on Le Havre, Lord Anson briefed Rodney in person. The operation was intended to be a secret with it being implied that Rodney&#x27;s actual destination was Gibraltar. This soon became impossible to maintain as Rodney tried to acquire pilots who knew the Normandy coast.

Rodney received his final orders on 26 June, and by 4 July he was off Le Havre. His force included six bomb-vessels which could fire at a very high trajectory. In what become known as the Raid on Le Havre, he bombarded the town for two days and nights, and inflicted great loss of war-material on the enemy. The bomb ships fired continuously for fifty two hours, starting large fires. Rodney then withdrew to Spithead, leaving several ships to blockade the mouth of the Seine. Although the attack hadn&#x27;t significantly affected French plans, it proved a morale boost in Britain. In August Rodney was again sent to Le Havre with similar orders but through a combination of weather and improved French defences he was unable to get his bomb-vessels into position, and the Admiralty accepted his judgement that a further attack was impossible. The invasion was ultimately cancelled because of French naval defeats at the Battle of Lagos and Battle of Quiberon Bay.

From 1759 and 1761 Rodney concentrated on his blockade of the French coast, particularly around Le Havre. In July 1760, with another small squadron, he succeeded in taking many more of the enemy&#x27;s flat-bottomed boats and in blockading the coast as far as Dieppe.

===Martinique===

Rodney was elected MP for Penryn in 1761. Lord Anson then selected him to command the naval element of a planned amphibious attack on the lucrative and strategically important French colony of Martinique in the West Indies, promoting him over the heads of a number of more senior officers. A previous British attack on Martinique had failed in 1759. The land forces for the attack on Martinique were to be a combination of troops from various locations including some sent out from Europe and reinforcements from New York City, who were available following the Conquest of Canada which had been completed in 1760. During 1761 Martinique was blockaded by Sir James Douglas to prevent reinforcements or supplies from reaching it. In 1762 he was formally appointed commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station.

Within the first three months of 1762, Monckton and he had reduced the important island of Martinique, while both Saint Lucia and Grenada had surrendered to his squadron. During the siege of Fort Royal (later Fort de France) his seamen and marines rendered splendid service on shore. Afterwards Rodney&#x27;s squadron, amounting to eight ships of the line joined the British expedition to Cuba bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15 by the end of April 1762. However he was later criticised for moving his ships to protect Jamaica from attack by a large Franco-Spanish force that had gathered in the area, rather than waiting to support the expedition as he had been ordered.

Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Admiral Rodney returned home having been during his absence made Vice-Admiral of the Blue and having received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. In the peace terms Martinique was returned to France.

==Years of peace==
In 1764, Rodney was created a baronet, and the same year he married Henrietta, daughter of John Clies of Lisbon. From 1765 to 1770, he was governor of Greenwich Hospital, and on the dissolution of parliament in 1768 he successfully contested Northampton at a ruinous cost. When appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica Station in 1771, he lost his Greenwich post, but a few months later received the office of Rear-Admiral of Great Britain. Until 1774, he held the Jamaica command, and during a period of quiet, was active in improving the naval yards on his station. Sir George struck his flag with a feeling of disappointment at not obtaining the governorship of Jamaica, and was shortly after forced to settle in Paris. Election expenses and losses at play in fashionable circles had shattered his fortune, and he could not secure payment of the salary as Rear-Admiral of Great Britain. In February 1778, having just been promoted Admiral of the White, he used every possible exertion to obtain a command to free himself from his money difficulties. By May, he had, through the splendid generosity of his Parisian friend Marshal Biron, effected the latter task, and accordingly he returned to London with his children. The debt was repaid out of the arrears due to him on his return. The story that he was offered a French command is fiction.

==American War of Independence==

In London, he suggested to Lord George Germain that George Washington could &quot;certainly be bought – honours will do it&quot;.

===Moonlight Battle===
Rodney was appointed once more commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station late in 1779. His orders were to relieve Gibraltar on his way to the West Indies. He captured a Spanish convoy of 22 vessels off Cape Finisterre on 8 January 1780. Eight days later at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent he defeated the Spanish Admiral Don Juan de Lángara, taking or destroying seven ships. He then brought some relief to Gibraltar by delivering reinforcements and supplies.

===Battle of Martinique===

On 17 April he fought an action off Martinique with the French Admiral Guichen which, owing to the carelessness of some of Rodney&#x27;s captains, was indecisive.

===Capture of St Eustatius===

Following the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War between Britain and the Dutch Republic Rodney, acting under orders from London, captured the valuable Dutch island of St Eustatius on 3 February 1781. Rodney had already identified several individuals on the island who were aiding the Americans, such as &quot;... Mr Smith at the House of Jones – they (the Jews of St. Eustatius, Caribbean Antilles) cannot be too soon taken care of – they are notorious in the cause of America and France...&quot; The island was also home to a Jewish community who were mainly merchants with significant international trading and maritime commercial ties. The Jews were estimated to have been at least 10% of the permanent population of St. Eustatius.

Rodney immediately arrested and imprisoned 101 Jews in the warehouses of the lower city. He summarily deported 31 adult Jews to the island of Saint Kitts. Rodney looted Jewish personal possessions and even tore out the linings of the clothes of his captives in search of hidden valuables; this alone yielded him 8,000 pounds. When Rodney realised that the Jews might be hiding additional treasure, he dug up their local cemetery.
Even large quantities of non-military trading goods belonging to British merchants on the island were arbitrarily confiscated. This resulted in Rodney being entangled in a series of costly lawsuits for the rest of his life. Still, the wealth Rodney acquired on St. Eustatius exceeded his expectations.

===Controversy and Yorktown===
Rodney wrote to his family with promises of a new London home; to his daughter &quot;the best harpsichord money can purchase&quot;. He confidently wrote of a marriage settlement for one of his sons and a soon-to-be purchased commission in the Foot Guards for another son. Rodney also wrote of a dowry for his daughter to marry the Earl of Oxford and noted he would have enough to pay off the young prospective bridegroom&#x27;s debts.

Other Royal Navy officers scathingly criticised Rodney for his actions. In particular, Viscount Samuel Hood suggested that Rodney should have sailed to intercept a French fleet under Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul de Grasse, travelling to Martinique. The French fleet instead turned north and headed for the Chesapeake Bay of Virginia and Maryland.

Rodney&#x27;s delay at St. Eustatius was not the first time he had taken the opportunity to capture prizes over the immediate and expeditious fulfillment of his military duties. During the Seven Years&#x27; War Rodney had been ordered to Barbados to link up with Admiral Sir George Pocock and the Earl of Albemarle for an attack on Cuba. Instead, Rodney sent valuable ships off in search of prizes. In 1762, Rodney, after the fall of Martinique, quarreled with the army over prize money. During Rodney&#x27;s command in Jamaica, 1771–1774, the Earl of Sandwich feared that Rodney might provoke a war with Spain to obtain prize money.

Plundering the wealth of St. Eustatius and capturing many prizes over a number of months, Rodney further weakened his fleet by sending two ships-of-the-line to escort his treasure ships to England, though both were in need of major repair. Nevertheless, he is both blamed and defended for the subsequent disaster at Yorktown. His orders as naval commander in chief in the eastern Caribbean were not only to watch de Grasse but also to protect the valuable sugar trade. Rodney had received intelligence earlier that de Grasse would send part of his fleet before the start of the hurricane season to relieve the French squadron at Newport and to co-operate with Washington, returning in the fall to the Caribbean. The other half of de Grasse&#x27;s fleet, as usual, would escort the French merchantmen back across the Atlantic. Rodney accordingly made his dispositions in the light of this intelligence. Sixteen of his remaining twenty-one warships would go with Hood to reinforce the squadron at New York under Sir Thomas Graves, while Rodney, who was in ill health, returned to England with three other warships as merchant escorts, leaving two others in dock for repair. Hood was well satisfied with these arrangements, informing a colleague that his fleet was &quot;fully equal to defeat any designs of the enemy.&quot; What Rodney and Hood could not know was that at the last moment de Grasse decided to take his entire fleet to North America, leaving the French merchantmen to the protection of the Spanish. The result was a decisive French superiority in warships during the subsequent naval campaign, when the combined fleets of Hood and Graves were unable to relieve the British army of Charles Cornwallis, who was then establishing a base on the York River. This left Cornwallis no option but to surrender, resulting a year later in British recognition of American Independence. Although Rodney&#x27;s actions at St. Eustatius and afterwards contributed to the British naval inferiority in the Battle of the Chesapeake, the real reason for the disaster at Yorktown was the inability of Britain to match the resources of the other naval powers of Europe.

===Battle of the Saintes===
After a few months in England, restoring his health and defending himself in Parliament, Sir George returned to his command in February 1782, and a running engagement with the French fleet on 9 April led up to his crowning victory at the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica, when on 12 April with thirty-five sail of the line he defeated the Comte de Grasse, who had thirty-three sail. The French inferiority in numbers was more than counterbalanced by the greater size and superior sailing qualities of their ships, yet four French ships of the line were captured (including the flagship) as well as one destroyed after eleven hours&#x27; fighting.

This important battle saved Jamaica and ruined French naval prestige, while it enabled Rodney to write: &quot;Within two little years I have taken two Spanish, one French and one Dutch admirals.&quot; A long and wearisome controversy exists as to the originator of the manoeuvre of &quot;breaking the line&quot; in this battle, but the merits of the victory have never seriously been affected by any difference of opinion on the question. A shift of wind broke the French line of battle, and the British ships took advantage of this by crossing in two places; many were taken prisoner including the Comte de Grasse.

From 29 April to 10 July he sat with his fleet at Port Royal, Jamaica while his fleet was repaired after the battle.

===Recall===
In a 15 April letter to Lord George Germain, who unknown to Rodney had recently lost his position, he wrote &quot;Permit me most sincerely to congratulate you on the most important victory I believe ever gained against our perfidious enemies, the French&quot;. The news of Rodney&#x27;s victories reached England on 18 May 1782 via HMS &quot;Andromache&quot; and boosted national morale in Britain and strengthened the pro-war party, who wished to carry on the fight. George III observed to the new Prime Minister Lord Shelburne that he &quot;must see that the great success of Lord Rodney&#x27;s engagement has so far roused the nation, that the peace which would have been acquiesced in three months ago would now be a matter for complaint&quot;.

Rodney was preparing to sail to meet the enemy off Cape Haitien when arrived from England, not only relieving him of duty, but also bringing his replacement: Admiral Hugh Pigot. This bizarre exchange was largely the result of changing politics in Britain: Rodney was a Tory placed in charge of the fleet by a Tory government... but the Whigs were now in power. That said, at 64 years of age, he was perhaps due for retirement. However, Pigot and the command to retire was dispatched on 15 May, three days before the news of the victory at the Battle of the Saintes reached the Admiralty. A cutter sent by the Admiralty on 19 May failed to catch the &quot;Jupiter&quot; so Rodney&#x27;s fate was sealed.

Rodney quietly quit his quarters on the &quot;Formidable&quot; and returned to England in more modest quarters on .

== Later life ==
===Nepotism and self-interest===
Rodney was unquestionably a most able officer, but he was also vain, selfish and unscrupulous, both in seeking prize money, and in using his position to push the fortunes of his family, although such nepotism was common (not to say normal) at the time. He made his son a post-captain at fifteen, and his assiduous self-interest alienated his fellow officers and the Board of Admiralty alike. Naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger describes Rodney as possessing weaknesses with respect to patronage &quot;which destroyed the basis of trust upon which alone an officer can command.&quot; It must be remembered that he was then prematurely old and racked by disease.

===Retirement and death===
Rodney arrived home in August to receive unbounded honour from his country. He had already been created Baron Rodney of Rodney Stoke, Somerset, by patent of 19 June 1782, and the House of Commons had voted him a pension of £2000 a year. From this time he led a quiet country life until his death in London. He was succeeded as 2nd Baron by his son, George (1753–1802).

In 1782 Rodney was presented with the Freedom of the City of Cork, Ireland. The National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, holds the gold presentation box that the City of Cork gave him on 16 September 1782.

Rodney died in 1792, and was buried in the church of St Mary the Virgin, Old Alresford, in Hampshire, which adjoins his family seat. There is a memorial to him within St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Legacy==
In February 1783, the government of Jamaica commissioned John Bacon, a renowned British sculptor, to create a statue of Admiral Lord Rodney, as an expression of their appreciation. The Assembly spent $5,200 on the statue alone and a reputed $31,000 on the entire project. Bacon sourced the finest marble from Italy to create the Neo-classical sculpture of the Admiral, dressed in a Roman robe and breastplate. On its completion, the statue was fronted with cannons taken from the French flagship, Ville de Paris, in the battle. The truly huge monument, known as the Rodney Temple stands in Spanish Town, Jamaica, next to the Governor&#x27;s House.

In late 1782 and early 1783 a large number of existing taverns renamed themselves &quot;The Admiral Rodney&quot; in admiration of the victory.
Admiral Rodney&#x27;s Pillar was constructed on the peak of Breidden Hill to commemorate his victories.

In St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral crypt, there is a memorial to Rodney designed by Charles Rossi.

At least four serving warships of the Royal Navy have been named in his honour.

Two British public schools, Churcher&#x27;s College and Emanuel School, have houses named after him.

Due to his popularity with citizens of Newfoundland as governor, small round-bottomed wooden boats, propelled by oars and/or sails, are often referred to as a &quot;Rodney&quot; up to the present day in Newfoundland.

In 1793, following Rodney&#x27;s death, Scotland&#x27;s Bard, the poet Robert Burns (1759–1796), published a poem &quot;Lines On The Commemoration Of Rodney&#x27;s Victory&quot; commemorating the Battle of the Saintes. The poem opens with the lines:
:&quot;Instead of a Song, boy&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll give you a Toast;
:&quot;Here&#x27;s to the memory of those on the twelfth that we lost!-
:&quot;That we lost, did I say?-nay, by Heav&#x27;n, that we found;
:&quot;For their fame it will last while the world goes round. “

<text>François Joseph Paul, Comte de Grasse, Marquis of Grasse-Tilly, KM (13 September 1722 – 11 January 1788) was a French Navy officer. He is best known for his crucial victory over the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 during the American Revolutionary War. The battle directly led to the Franco-American victory at the siege of Yorktown and helped secure the independence of the United States.

After the battle, de Grasse returned with his fleet to the Caribbean. In 1782, a British fleet under Admiral George Rodney defeated and captured de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes. De Grasse was widely criticised for his defeat in the battle. On his return to France in 1784, he blamed his captains for the defeat. A court-martial exonerated all of his captains, effectively ending his naval career.

==Early life==
François-Joseph de Grasse was born and raised at Bar-sur-Loup in south-eastern France, the last child of Francois de Grasse Rouville, Marquis de Grasse. He earned his title and supported his Provençal family.

==Marriage and family==
De Grasse married Antoinette Rosalie Accaron in 1764, and they had six children who survived to adulthood, among them his eldest son Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse. Auguste had a career in the French army and inherited his father&#x27;s title as count in 1788. His younger brother Maxime died young in 1773. They had four sisters: Amélie Rosalie Maxime, Adélaide, Melanie Veronique Maxime, and Silvie de Grasse. Silvie married M. Francis de Pau in Charleston, South Carolina, and raised a family with him in New York City.

After his wife Antoinette died young, de Grasse married again, to Catherine Pien, widow of M. de Villeneuve. She also died before him. Thirdly, he married Marie Delphine Lazare de Cibon.

In addition, while in service in India during and after the Seven Years&#x27; War, de Grasse is believed to have fathered a mixed-race, French-Indian boy with an Indian woman in Calcutta. The boy, born about 1780, was known as Azar Le Guen. De Grasse brought the boy back to Paris with him for his education and formally adopted him, naming him George de Grasse. After his father&#x27;s death, the young man went to the United States by 1799, where he settled in New York City. He worked for a time for Aaron Burr, likely meeting him through a connection of his father&#x27;s. Burr gave him two lots of land in Manhattan, and George de Grasse became a naturalized citizen in 1804.

George de Grasse married well and educated his three children: his son John van Salee de Grasse was the first African American to graduate from medical school and became a respected physician in Boston; he served as a surgeon in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The eldest son, Isaiah George DeGrasse, became a Protestant Episcopal minister, and daughter Serena married George Downing, who became a renowned restaurant entrepreneur and civil rights activist.

==Naval career==
At the age of eleven (1734), de Grasse entered the Order of Saint John as a page of the Grand Master. He served as an ensign on the galleys in battles against the Turks and the Moors. In 1740 at the age of 17, he formally entered the French Navy.

He participated in French naval action in India during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was intermittently stationed in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, from the 1760s to 1781.

Following Britain&#x27;s victory over the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War, de Grasse helped rebuild the French navy in the years after the Treaty of Paris (1763).

==American War of Independence==

In 1775, the American War of Independence broke out when American colonists rebelled against British rule. France supplied the colonists with covert aid, but remained officially neutral until 1778. The Treaty of Alliance established the Franco-American alliance, and France entered the war on behalf of the rebels and against Great Britain.

As a commander of a division, Comte de Grasse served under Louis Guillouet, comte d&#x27;Orvilliers at the First Battle of Ushant from July 23 to 27, 1778. The battle, fought off Brittany, was indecisive.

In 1779, he joined the fleet of Charles Henri Hector d&#x27;Estaing in the West Indies as commander of a squadron; they were operating to counter the Royal Navy of Britain. He contributed to the capture of Grenada that year, and took part in the three actions fought by Luc Urbain de Bouexic, comte de Guichen against Admiral George Rodney in the Battle of Martinique. De Grasse was promoted to lieutenant-general of the Navy (equivalent to vice-admiral) in March 1781, and was successful in defeating Admiral Samuel Hood and taking Tobago.

===Battle of the Chesapeake and Yorktown campaign===
De Grasse responded to George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau&#x27;s &quot;Expédition Particulière&quot; when they appealed for his aid in 1781, setting sail with 3,000 troops from Saint-Domingue, where the French Caribbean fleet was based. De Grasse landed the French reinforcements in Virginia. Immediately afterward he decisively defeated the British fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake in September 1781. He drew away the British forces and blockaded the coast until Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, ensuring the independence of the new United States of America.

===Battle of the Saintes===

De Grasse returned his fleet to the Caribbean. He was less fortunate in 1782 and was defeated at the Battle of St. Kitts by Admiral Samuel Hood. Shortly afterward, in April 1782, de Grasse was again defeated, and taken prisoner by Rodney at the Battle of the Saintes. He initially sailed with the British fleet to Port Royal, Jamaica but after a period of only around one week was permitted to leave on the first convoy to England. Here he was landed on Southsea beach, allegedly to much applause. In August he was granted an audience with King George III and was re-presented with his own sword, surrendered to Rodney at The Saintes.

He was taken to London for a time. While there, he briefly took part in the negotiations that laid the foundations for the Peace of Paris (1783), which brought the American Revolutionary War to an end. It also realigned control of some of the Caribbean islands.

De Grasse was released to return to France, where he was strongly criticized for his defeat in the Caribbean. He published a &quot;Mémoire justificatif&quot; and demanded a court-martial. An inquiry into the events of the battle started in 1783, ending in 1784 in acquittal for most of the officers involved, including de Grasse.

==Later life==
De Grasse was a Commander of the Order of St. Louis and a Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He was also a member of the American Society of the Cincinnati. De Grasse died at Tilly (Yvelines) in 1788; his tomb is in the church of Saint-Roch in Paris.

==Family trials==
His grown children from his marriages all emigrated to Saint-Domingue. His eldest son, Auguste de Grasse, inherited the title of Comte de Grasse-Tilly. He was stationed in Saint-Domingue in 1789 as a naval officer, and acquired a large plantation and 200 slaves. He was joined by his stepmother and sisters.
After the Royal Navy defeated the French fleet there in 1793, during the Haitian Revolution, Auguste de Grasse was among the officers who surrendered and were allowed to leave. He migrated with his family (including his four sisters, who had joined him) and settled for several years in Charleston, South Carolina. Two sisters died there of yellow fever in 1799. Silvie, the youngest, married and moved with her husband to New York City.

After returning to France in the early 1800s after Napoleon came to power, Auguste de Grasse resumed his military career, this time in the army.

In his later years, he wrote a memoir about his father and his own travels in the New World, published in 1840 as &quot;Notice biographique sur l&#x27;amiral comte de Grasse d&#x27;après les documents inédits&quot;.

==Memorials and honors==

*A monument was installed to commemorate de Grasse and his sailors at the Cape Henry Memorial, Joint Expeditionary Base East, Virginia Beach, Virginia. It is maintained by the Colonial National Historical Park of the National Park Service.
*A statue of de Grasse was installed at the riverwalk landing in Yorktown, Virginia.
*A statue of de Grasse is in the Place de la Tour of Le Bar-sur-Loup, the French village where he was born and grew up.
*Sometime between 1829 and 1839, Heman Allen, a former U.S. Representative and Ambassador to Chile, named the Grasse Mount estate in Burlington, Vermont after de Grasse.

<text>Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood (12 December 1724 – 27 January 1816) was an English admiral in the Royal Navy. As a junior officer he saw action during the War of the Austrian Succession. While in temporary command of , he drove a French ship ashore in Audierne Bay, and captured two privateers in 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He held senior command as Commander-in-Chief, North American Station and then as Commander-in-Chief, Leeward Islands Station, leading the British fleet to victory at Battle of the Mona Passage in April 1782 during the American Revolutionary War. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, then First Naval Lord and, after briefly returning to the Portsmouth command, became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet during the French Revolutionary Wars. His younger brother was Admiral Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport (1726–1814), and his first cousin once-removed was Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762–1814).

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Hood was the eldest son of Rev. Samuel Hood, vicar of Butleigh in Somerset and prebendary of Wells, and Mary Hoskins, daughter of Richard Hoskins, Esq., of Beaminster, Dorset. In 1740, Captain (later Admiral) Thomas Smith was stranded in Butleigh when his carriage broke down on the way to Plymouth. The Rev. Samuel Hood rescued him and gave him hospitality for the night. Samuel and his younger brother Alexander were inspired by his stories of the sea and he offered to help them in the Navy. While granting permission for Samuel and Alexander to join the Navy, the Rev. Samuel Hood and his wife decided to prohibit similar service by his other sons as &quot;they might be drowned&quot;. Their third son, Arthur William, became Vicar of Butleigh but died of fever in his 30s. Another son drowned in the local River Brue as a boy.

===Early career===
Samuel entered the Royal Navy in 1741. He served part of his time as midshipman with George Brydges Rodney in the and became a lieutenant in 1746. He had opportunities to see service in the North Sea during the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1754, he was made commander of the sloop and served in her at the North American station. In July 1756, while still on the North American station, Hood was promoted post captain, and assigned command of the sloop , which was then under construction in England; however as Hood remained in North America he was unable to assume command of Lively. Still in North America, Hood became flag captain to Commodore Holmes in the .

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

At the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, the navy was rapidly expanded which benefited Hood. In 1757, while in temporary command of (50 guns), he drove a French ship ashore in Audierne Bay, and captured two privateers. His zeal attracted the favourable notice of the Admiralty and he was appointed to a ship of his own, . In 1759, when captain of the (32 guns), he captured the French (32 guns) after a sharp action. During the war, his services were wholly in the Channel, and he was engaged under Rodney in 1759 in the Raid on Le Havre, destroying the vessels collected by the French to serve as transports in the proposed invasion of Britain.

He was appointed in Commander-in-Chief, North American Station in July 1767. He returned to England in October 1770 and commissioned the building of Catherington House in the village of Catherington in Hampshire in 1771. In 1778, he accepted a command which in the ordinary course would have terminated his active career, becoming Commissioner of the dockyard at Portsmouth and governor of the Naval Academy.

==American Revolutionary War==

In 1778, on the occasion of the King&#x27;s visit to Portsmouth, Hood was made a baronet. The war was deeply unpopular with much of the British public and navy. Many admirals had declined to serve under Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Rodney, who then commanded in the West Indies, had complained of a lack of proper support from his subordinates, whom he accused of disaffection. The Admiralty, anxious to secure the services of trustworthy flag officers, promoted Hood to rear-admiral on 26 September 1780, and sent him to the West Indies to act as second in command under Rodney, who knew him personally. He joined Rodney in January 1781 in his flagship , and remained in the West Indies or on the coast of North America until the close of the American Revolutionary War.

The expectation that he would work harmoniously with Rodney was not entirely justified. Their correspondence shows that they were not on friendly terms; but Hood always did his duty, and he was so able that no question of removing him from the station ever arose. The unfortunate turn for the British taken by the campaign of 1781 was largely due to Rodney&#x27;s neglect of Hood&#x27;s advice.

===Battle of the Chesapeake===
When Rodney decided to return to Britain for the sake of his health in the autumn of 1781, Hood was ordered to take the bulk of the fleet to the North American coast during the hurricane months. Hood joined Admiral Thomas Graves in the unsuccessful effort to relieve the army at Yorktown, when the British fleet was driven off by the French Admiral, the Comte de Grasse, at the Battle of the Chesapeake.

When he returned to the West Indies, he was for a time in independent command, as commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station, owing to Rodney&#x27;s absence in England. De Grasse attacked the British islands of St Kitts and Nevis with a force much superior to Hood&#x27;s squadron. Hood made an unsuccessful attempt in January 1782 to save them from capture, with 22 ships to 29, and the series of bold movements by which he first turned the French out of their anchorage at Basseterre of St Kitts and then beat off their attacks, were one of the best accomplishments of any British admiral during the war.

===Battle of the Saintes===

On 12 April 1782 Hood took part in a British fleet under Rodney, which defeated a combined French and Spanish fleet that was planning an invasion of Jamaica. The French commander De Grasse, who had been responsible for the victory at Chesapeake, was captured and taken back to Britain as a prisoner.

===Battle of the Mona Passage===

Eventually Hood was ordered to chase, and with his division of 12 ships he captured 4 ships at the Mona Passage on 19 April 1782, thus completing the defeat. While serving in the Caribbean, Hood became acquainted with, and later became a mentor to, Horatio Nelson, who was a young frigate captain. Hood had been a friend of Nelson&#x27;s uncle Maurice Suckling. In 1782 Hood introduced Nelson to the Duke of Clarence, the future King William IV, who was then a serving naval officer in New York.

===Peace===

Hood was made an Irish peer as Baron Hood of Catherington in September 1782. During the peace, he entered the British Parliament as Member for Westminster in the election of 1784 where he was a supporter of the government of William Pitt the Younger. He became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in 1786, after being promoted to vice-admiral on 24 September 1787, retired from the Portsmouth Command in 1789. He was appointed to the Board of Admiralty under John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, brother of the Prime Minister, in July 1788 and became First Naval Lord in August 1789. He became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth again in June 1792.

Hood presided at the court-martial of some of surviving instigators of the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, beginning on 12 September 1792. Among those on trial were crew members who were loyal to &quot;Bounty&quot;″s commanding officer, William Bligh, but were forced to remain on the ship after Bligh was cast away in an open boat. Of the ten defendants, four were acquitted and the remaining six were found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to death. Three were recommended for mercy and were pardoned. The other men found guilty were hanged from the yardarm of on 29 October 1794.

==French Revolution==

===Defence of Toulon===

Following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, Hood became Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet in February 1793. In August 1793 French royalists and other opponents of the revolution took over the city of Toulon and invited Hood, whose fleet was blockading offshore, to occupy the town. Hood, without time to request instructions from the Admiralty in London, moved swiftly to take command of the port.

Hood occupied Toulon on the invitation of the French royalists, and in co-operation with the Spaniards and Sardinians. In December of the same year, the allies, who did not work harmoniously together, were driven out, mainly by the generalship of Napoleon. Hood ordered the French fleet burned to prevent it falling back into the hands of the revolutionary government in Paris.

===Corsica===

Hood then turned to the occupation of Corsica, which he had been invited to take in the name of the King of Britain by Pasquale Paoli, who had been leader of the Corsican Republic before it was subjugated by the French a quarter of a century previously. The island was for a short time added to the dominions of George III, chiefly by the exertions of the fleet and the co-operation of Paoli. While the occupation of Corsica was being effected, the French at Toulon had so far recovered that they were able to send a fleet to sea. Nelson was recorded as saying that Hood was &quot;the best Officer, take him altogether, that England has to boast of&quot;.

In October, he was recalled to England in consequence of some misunderstanding with the admiralty or the ministry, which has never been explained. Richard Freeman, in his book, &quot;The Great Edwardian Naval Feud&quot;, explains his relief from command in a quote from Lord Esher&#x27;s journal. According to this journal, &quot;... [Hood] wrote &#x27;a very temperate letter&#x27; to the Admiralty in which he complained that he did not have enough ships to defend the Mediterranean.&quot; As a result, Hood was then recalled from the Mediterranean. He was promoted to full admiral on 12 April 1794.

===Later career===

Samuel Hood was created Viscount Hood of Whitley, Warwickshire in 1796 with a pension of £2000 per year for life (about £ a year in terms). In 1796, he was also appointed Governour of the Greenwich Hospital, a position which he held until his death in 1816. He served as Tory Member of Parliament for Westminster from 1784 to 1788 and from 1790 to 1796, and was Member for Reigate between 1789 and 1790. He died in Greenwich on 27 January 1816 and is buried in Greenwich Hospital Cemetery. A peerage of Great Britain was conferred on his wife, Susannah, as Baroness Hood of Catherington in 1795. Samuel Hood&#x27;s titles descended to his youngest son, Henry (1753–1836).

There are several portraits of Lord Hood by Lemuel Francis Abbott in the Guildhall and in the National Portrait Gallery. He was also painted by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1749 he married Susannah Linzee (1726–1806) (whose monument survives at Davenport House, Greenwich (Former Hospital Cemetery)), a daughter of Edward Linzee, Master Ropemaker at Portsmouth Dockyard, and Mayor of Portsmouth. By his wife he had issue including:
*Henry Hood, 2nd Viscount Hood (1753–1836), son and heir.

==Legacy==
A biographical notice of Hood by McArthur, his secretary during the Mediterranean command, appeared in the &quot;Naval Chronicle&quot;, vol. ii. His correspondence during his command in America was published by the Navy Records Society.

In 1792, Lieutenant William Broughton, sailing with the expedition of George Vancouver to the Northwest Coast of North America, named Mount Hood in present-day Oregon, and Hood&#x27;s Canal in present-day Washington, after Hood. Port Hood, Nova Scotia, is also named after him.

Two of the three ships of the Royal Navy named HMS &quot;Hood&quot; were named after him as well. One of these, the battlecruiser , was sunk by the in 1941 during the Second World War.

==Portrayal==
Hood was portrayed by David Torrence in the 1935 film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;.

<text>Luc Urbain du Bouëxic, comte de Guichen (June 21, 1712, Fougères, Ille-et-Vilaine – January 13, 1790, Morlaix) was a French admiral who commanded the French fleets that fought the British at the First Battle of Ushant (1778) and the Battle of Martinique (1780) during the American War of Independence.

==Biography==
Guichen joined the Navy in 1730 as a Garde-Marine. He was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau in 1746.

In 1748, Guichen fought five battles against superior British forces, while a convoy escorting from the Caribbean back to France. He was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis that same year.

In 1755, he participated in the abortive relief expedition to Louisbourg under Dubois de La Motte, on the 70-gun &quot;Héros&quot;. In 1775 he was appointed to the frigate &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, attached to the Escadre d&#x27;évolution. He was promoted to Captain in May 1756.

The year after, he was promoted to Chef d&#x27;Escadre.

===First Battle of Ushant===
After France entered the War of American Independence, Guichen was appointed to the command of the Channel fleet, which he led in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. His flagship, the 104-gun &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, was next in line to the fleet flagship &quot;Bretagne&quot;. In March 1779, he was promoted Lieutenant Général des Armées navales, As such he commanded the French van in the Combined fleet of Orvillers and Córdoba from June to September.

===Battle of Martinique===

In January 1780, Guichen was sent to the West Indies with a strong squadron. On 17 April to the leeward of Martinique, Guichen&#x27;s fleet met a force under Rodney, leading to the Battle of Martinique. During the engagement, both Rodney&#x27;s &quot;Sandwich&quot; and Guichen&#x27;s &quot;Couronne&quot; were temporarily cut off from their respective fleets and had to bear the brunt of the battle.
Two inconclusive actions followed on 15 May and 19 May 1780.

With the hurricane season approaching in July, Guichen left the West Indies and returned home, reaching Cadiz in September with a convoy of 95 merchantmen. Guichen&#x27;s second-in-command, Sade de Vaudronne, died at sea as the fleet arrived.

===1781 action in the Bay of Biscay===
In December 1781, Guichen was tasked to carry stores and reinforcements to the West Indies. On 12 December, British Admiral Kempenfelt intercepted Guichen&#x27;s squadron in the Bay of Biscay through a temporary clearance in a fog, at a moment when Guichen&#x27;s warships were to leeward of the convoy, and attacked the transports at once, yielding the Second Battle of Ushant. Kempenfelt captured twenty of the transports and forced the others to retreat to port. Having failed his mission, Guichen then also returned to port. He had no opportunity to gain any counterbalancing success during the short remainder of the war, but he was present at the final relief of Gibraltar by Lord Howe.

==Legacy==
Guichen Bay in South Australia and the French ship &quot;Guichen&quot; of the First World War were named after him.

In 1785, Guichen was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

<text>&quot;The Patriotic Song&quot; was the national anthem of Russia from 1991 to 2000. It was previously the regional anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1990 until 1991 (until 1990 it used the State Anthem of the Soviet Union), when it transformed into the Russian Federation after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Unlike most national anthems, it had no official lyrics. Although unofficial ones were written for it, they were never adopted.

==Etymology==
&quot;The Patriotic Song&quot; was originally a piano composition without lyrics, composed by Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857), and it was originally titled &quot;National Song Motif&quot; (). The song has been known under its current title of &quot;The Patriotic Song&quot; since 1944, after Glinka&#x27;s composition was arranged for orchestra by composer under that name, popularizing it and leading it to become synonymous with Glinka&#x27;s original work itself.

==History==


&quot; originally was not a song but a composition for piano without lyrics, written by Mikhail Glinka in 1833 and titled (in French) . It was often claimed that it was written by Glinka as part of a national anthem contest or with the intent of becoming a national anthem, though evidence for either claim is scant. In 1885, Glinka&#x27;s manuscript was re-discovered after languishing in obscurity at the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. In 1944 it was arranged for orchestra by composer under the title &quot; and a few years later, poet Alexei Mashistov set lyrics to Bagrinovsky&#x27;s arrangement of Glinka&#x27;s composition for a song dedicated to the Soviet capital of Moscow, both of which helped popularize Glinka&#x27;s work among the Soviet public and gave it its common contemporary moniker.

The Russian TV news program used it as its theme tune from 1984 to 1986.

In the 1990s, Boris Yeltsin chose the tune as the new state anthem of the Russian SFSR and it was officially adopted as such on 23 November 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia. It remained in &quot;de facto&quot; usage through inertia by the new Russian Federation from 1991 until its official confirmation as the state&#x27;s national anthem in 1993 when the Russian constitution was enacted. Also favored by the Russian Orthodox Church, the music went without lyrics for several years. In 1999, Viktor Radugin won a contest to provide suitable words for it with his poem &quot;Glory to Russia!&quot; (). However, no lyrics and none of the entries were ever adopted.

It reportedly proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions.

It was replaced soon after Yeltsin&#x27;s successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000. Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the semi-reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem, although some opinion polls showed that many Russians favored this decision.

Today, the song is used by some elements of the Russian opposition as a political anthem. It is also sometimes erroneously played during sporting events involving Russia.

==Proposed lyrics==
===&quot;Glory to Russia!&quot;===
These are the unofficial lyrics to &quot;The Patriotic Song&quot; by Viktor Radugin, titled &quot;Glory to Russia!&quot; (). It has been confused with the closing chorus of Glinka&#x27;s opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;, possibly due to both beginning with the same word &quot;glory&quot; (), but the two works are unrelated with the latter being derived from an old Polish folk song (though the operatic music, too, has been suggested as a candidate for a Russian national anthem).
===&quot;Majestically Above the Fatherland&quot;===
&quot;Majestically Above the Fatherland&quot; () written by Vladimir Kalinkin in 1998, was another proposed set of lyrics. Performed by Russian artist Vladimir Detayov, the Duma was made aware of this piece&#x27;s existence in April 1999. At the initiative of the Ministry of Ethnic Policy of Russia, this record was first publicly presented at the First Congress of the Assembly of Peoples of Russia. During the summer of that year, it was performed on the radio station &quot;Radio of Russia&quot; and the TV channel &quot;Moskoviya&quot;, devoted to writing a text for the national anthem.

In January 2000, it was carried out in a new orchestral arrangement performed by the N.P. Osipov National Academic Orchestra of Folk Instruments and the A.V. Sveshnikov Academic Choir. Overall the song received positive reviews, although like &quot;Glory to Russia!&quot;, never attained official status.

===“Red Star” (Russian Army Choir)===
In 1992, a version of &quot;The Patriotic Song&quot; with lyrics specifically about Moscow was sung by the “Red Star&quot; Russian Army Choir and Dance Ensemble of RVSN at the Tchaikovsky Hall.

=== &quot;In our century of Russia - glory!&quot; ===
Words of the 103rd Russian anthem out of 140 prepared by poster poet Nina Benson.

Performed by the Big Choir of Radio and Orchestra of the Ministry of Defense conducted by Viktor Afanasiev (recorded in 1998; the draft words and this recording were presented at a presentation in the Duma on February 3, 1998).
=== &quot;Slav&#x27;sya, Rus&quot; ===
In May 1991, the artistic director of the ensemble named after Alexandrova, Igor Agafonnikov recorded the anthem with the following words.

<doc id="279684" wikidata="Q3499072" url="?curid=279684" title="Chef">
<text>Achef is a professional cook and tradesperson who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. The word &quot;chef&quot; is derived from the term (), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.

Different terms use the word &quot;chef&quot; in their titles and deal with specific areas of food preparation. Examples include the &quot;sous-chef&quot;, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the &quot;chef de partie&quot;, who handles a specific area of production. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word &quot;chef&quot; in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the &quot;kitchen assistants&quot;. A chef&#x27;s standard uniform includes a hat (called a &quot;toque&quot;), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chef&quot; is derived (and shortened) from the term &quot;chef de cuisine&quot; (), the director or head of a kitchen. (The French word comes from Latin &quot;caput&quot; (head) and is cognate with English &quot;chief&quot;). In English, the title &quot;chef&quot; in the culinary arts originated in the &quot;haute cuisine&quot; of the 19th century. The culinary arts, among other aspects of the French language, introduced French loan words into the English language. The word is often used by itself as an honorific to address chefs by each other, apprentices, and waiting staff.

==Titles==

Various titles, detailed below, are given to those working in a professional kitchen and each can be considered a title for a type of chef. Many of the titles are based on the &quot;brigade de cuisine&quot; (or brigade system) documented by Auguste Escoffier, while others have a more general meaning depending on the individual kitchen.

===&quot;Chef de cuisine&quot;===
Other names include executive chef, chef manager, head chef, and master chef. This person is in charge of all activities related to the kitchen, which usually includes menu creation, management of kitchen staff, ordering and purchasing of inventory, controlling raw material costs and plating design. &quot;Chef de cuisine&quot; is the traditional French term from which the English word chef is derived. &quot;Head chef&quot; is often used to designate someone with the same duties as an executive chef, but there is usually someone in charge of a head chef, possibly making the larger executive decisions such as the direction of menu, the final authority in staff management decisions, and so on. This is often the case for executive chefs with multiple restaurants. Involved in checking the sensory evaluation of dishes after preparation and they are well aware of each sensory property of those specific dishes.

In the UK, the title executive chef normally applies to hotels with multiple outlets in the same hotel. Other establishments in the UK tend to use the title head chef.

=== &quot;Sous-chef&quot; ===
The &quot;sous-chef de cuisine&quot; (under-chef of the kitchen) is the second-in-command and direct assistant of the chef de cuisine or head chef. This person may be responsible for scheduling the kitchen staff or substituting when the head chef is absent. Also, the &quot;sous-chef&quot; will fill in for or assist a &quot;chef de partie&quot; (line cook) when needed. This person is accountable for the kitchen&#x27;s inventory, cleanliness, organization, and the continuing training of its entire staff. A sous-chef&#x27;s duties can also include carrying out the head chef&#x27;s directives, conducting line checks, and overseeing the timely rotation of all food products. Smaller operations may not have a sous-chef, while larger operations may have more than one.

===&quot;Chef de partie&quot;===
A &quot;chef de partie&quot;, also known as a &quot;station chef&quot; or &quot;line cook&quot;, is in charge of a particular area of production. In large kitchens, each chef de partie might have several cooks or assistants. In most kitchens, however, the chef de partie is the only worker in that department. Line cooks are often divided into a hierarchy of their own, starting with &quot;first cook&quot;, then &quot;second cook&quot;, and so on as needed.

=== &quot;Commis&quot; (chef)/Range chef===

A commis is a basic or junior chef in larger kitchens who works under a &quot;chef de partie&quot; to learn the station&#x27;s or range&#x27;s responsibilities and operation. This may be a chef who has recently completed formal culinary training or is still undergoing training.

===Brigade system titles===
Station-chef titles which are part of the brigade system include:

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Kitchen assistant==
Kitchen assistants are of two types, kitchen-hands and stewards/kitchen porters. Kitchen-hands assist with basic food preparation tasks under the chef&#x27;s direction. They carry out relatively unskilled tasks such as peeling potatoes and washing salad. Stewards/kitchen porters are involved in the scullery, washing up and general cleaning duties. In a smaller kitchen, these duties may be incorporated.

A &quot;communard&quot; is in charge of preparing the meal for the staff during a shift. This meal is often referred to as the staff or family meal.

The &quot;escuelerie&quot; (from 15th century French and a cognate of the English &quot;scullery&quot;), or the more modern plongeur or dishwasher, is the keeper of dishes, having charge of dishes and keeping the kitchen clean. A common humorous title for this role in some modern kitchens is &quot;chef de plonge&quot; or &quot;head dishwasher&quot;.

==Culinary education==
Education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma, associate, and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in culinary arts. Depending on the level of education, this can take one to four years. An internship is often part of the curriculum. Regardless of the education received, most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system, and most new cooks will start at a lower-level 2nd or 1st cook position and work their way up. 

Like many skilled trades, chefs usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes many years of on-the-job training. Culinary schools and restaurants offer these apprenticeships. Apprenticeships usually take 3 to 4 years to complete and combine classroom instruction with on-the-job training. The training period for a chef is generally four years as an apprentice. A newly qualified chef is advanced or more commonly a toquecommis-chef, consisting of first-year &quot;commis&quot;, second-year &quot;commis&quot;, and so on. The rate of pay is usually in accordance with the chefs. Like all other chefs except the executive-chef, trainees are placed in sections of the kitchen (e.g., the starter (appetizer) or entrée sections) under the guidance of a &quot;demi-chef de partie&quot; and are given relatively basic tasks. Ideally, over time, a &quot;commis&quot; will spend a certain period in each section of the kitchen to learn the basics. Unaided, a &quot;commis&quot; may work on the vegetable station of a kitchen.

The usual formal training period for a chef is two to four years in catering college. They often spend the summer in work placements. In some cases this is modified to &#x27;day-release&#x27; courses; a chef will work full-time in a kitchen as an apprentice and then would have allocated days off to attend catering college. These courses can last between one and three years. In the UK, most chefs are trained in the workplace, with most doing a formal NVQ level 2 or 3 in the workplace.

<doc id="279688" wikidata="Q1503724" url="?curid=279688" title="Pattern matching">
<text>In computer science, pattern matching is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact: &quot;either it will or will not be a match.&quot; The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures. Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations (if any) of a pattern within a token sequence, to output some component of the matched pattern, and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence (i.e., search and replace).

Sequence patterns (e.g., a text string) are often described using regular expressions and matched using techniques such as backtracking.

Tree patterns are used in some programming languages as a general tool to process data based on its structure, e.g. C#, F#, Haskell, Java, ML, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift and the symbolic mathematics language Mathematica have special syntax for expressing tree patterns and a language construct for conditional execution and value retrieval based on it.

Often it is possible to give alternative patterns that are tried one by one, which yields a powerful conditional programming construct. Pattern matching sometimes includes support for guards.

==History==
Early programming languages with pattern matching constructs include COMIT (1957), SNOBOL (1962), Refal (1968) with tree-based pattern matching, Prolog (1972), St Andrews Static Language (SASL) (1976), NPL (1977), and Kent Recursive Calculator (KRC) (1981).

The pattern matching feature of function arguments in the ML programming language (1973) and its dialect Standard ML (1983) has been carried over to some other functional programming languages that were influenced by them, such as Haskell (1990), Scala (2004) and F# (2005). The pattern matching construct with the codice_1 keyword that was introduced in the ML dialect Caml (1985) was followed by programming languages such as OCaml (1996), F# (2005), F* (2011) and Rust (2015).

Many text editors support pattern matching of various kinds: the QED editor supports regular expression search, and some versions of TECO support the OR operator in searches.

Computer algebra systems generally support pattern matching on algebraic expressions.

==Primitive patterns==
The simplest pattern in pattern matching is an explicit value or a variable. For an example, consider a simple function definition in Haskell syntax (function parameters are not in parentheses but are separated by spaces, = is not assignment but definition):
f 0 = 1
Here, 0 is a single value pattern. Now, whenever f is given 0 as argument the pattern matches and the function returns 1. With any other argument, the matching and thus the function fail. As the syntax supports alternative patterns in function definitions, we can continue the definition extending it to take more generic arguments:
f n = n * f (n-1)
Here, the first codice_2 is a single variable pattern, which will match absolutely any argument and bind it to name n to be used in the rest of the definition. In Haskell (unlike at least Hope), patterns are tried in order so the first definition still applies in the very specific case of the input being 0, while for any other argument the function returns codice_3 with n being the argument.

The wildcard pattern (often written as codice_4) is also simple: like a variable name, it matches any value, but does not bind the value to any name. Algorithms for matching wildcards in simple string-matching situations have been developed in a number of recursive and non-recursive varieties.

==Tree patterns==
More complex patterns can be built from the primitive ones of the previous section, usually in the same way as values are built by combining other values. The difference then is that with variable and wildcard parts, a pattern does not build into a single value, but matches a group of values that are the combination of the concrete elements and the elements that are allowed to vary within the structure of the pattern.

A tree pattern describes a part of a tree by starting with a node and specifying some branches and nodes and leaving some unspecified with a variable or wildcard pattern. It may help to think of the abstract syntax tree of a programming language and algebraic data types.

In Haskell, the following line defines an algebraic data type codice_5 that has a single data constructor codice_6 that wraps an integer and a string.
data Color = ColorConstructor Integer String
The constructor is a node in a tree and the integer and string are leaves in branches.

When we want to write functions to make codice_5 an abstract data type, we wish to write functions to interface with the data type, and thus we want to extract some data from the data type, for example, just the string or just the integer part of codice_5.

If we pass a variable that is of type Color, how can we get the data out of this variable? For example, for a function to get the integer part of codice_5, we can use a simple tree pattern and write:
integerPart (ColorConstructor theInteger _) = theInteger
As well:

stringPart (ColorConstructor _ theString) = theString
The creations of these functions can be automated by Haskell&#x27;s data record syntax.

This OCaml example which defines a red–black tree and a function to re-balance it after element insertion shows how to match on a more complex structure generated by a recursive data type. The compiler verifies at compile-time that the list of cases is exhaustive and none are redundant.
type color = Red | Black
type &#x27;a tree = Empty | Tree of color * &#x27;a tree * &#x27;a * &#x27;a tree

let rebalance t = match t with
 | Tree (Black, Tree (Red, Tree (Red, a, x, b), y, c), z, d)
 | Tree (Black, Tree (Red, a, x, Tree (Red, b, y, c)), z, d) 
 | Tree (Black, a, x, Tree (Red, Tree (Red, b, y, c), z, d))
 | Tree (Black, a, x, Tree (Red, b, y, Tree (Red, c, z, d)))
 -&gt; Tree (Red, Tree (Black, a, x, b), y, Tree (Black, c, z, d))
 | _ -&gt; t (* the &#x27;catch-all&#x27; case if no previous pattern matches *)
==Filtering data with patterns==
Pattern matching can be used to filter data of a certain structure. For instance, in Haskell a list comprehension could be used for this kind of filtering:
[A x|A x &lt;- [A 1, B 1, A 2, B 2]]
evaluates to
 [A 1, A 2]

==Pattern matching in Mathematica==
In Mathematica, the only structure that exists is the tree, which is populated by symbols. In the Haskell syntax used thus far, this could be defined as

data SymbolTree = Symbol String [SymbolTree]

An example tree could then look like

Symbol &quot;a&quot; [Symbol &quot;b&quot; [], Symbol &quot;c&quot; []]

In the traditional, more suitable syntax, the symbols are written as they are and the levels of the tree are represented using codice_10, so that for instance codice_11 is a tree with a as the parent, and b and c as the children.

A pattern in Mathematica involves putting &quot;_&quot; at positions in that tree. For instance, the pattern

 A[_]

will match elements such as A[1], A[2], or more generally A[&quot;x&quot;] where &quot;x&quot; is any entity. In this case, codice_12 is the concrete element, while codice_4 denotes the piece of tree that can be varied. A symbol prepended to codice_4 binds the match to that variable name while a symbol appended to codice_4 restricts the matches to nodes of that symbol. Note that even blanks themselves are internally represented as codice_16 for codice_4 and codice_18 for codice_19.

The Mathematica function codice_20 filters elements of the first argument that match the pattern in the second argument:

Cases[{a[1], b[1], a[2], b[2]}, a[_] ]

evaluates to

{a[1], a[2]}

Pattern matching applies to the &quot;structure&quot; of expressions. In the example below,

Cases[ {a[b], a[b, c], a[b[c], d], a[b[c], d[e]], a[b[c], d, e]}, a[b[_], _] ]

returns

{a[b[c],d], a[b[c],d[e]]}

because only these elements will match the pattern codice_21 above.

In Mathematica, it is also possible to extract structures as they are created in the course of computation, regardless of how or where they appear. The function codice_22 can be used to monitor a computation, and return the elements that arise which match a pattern. For example, we can define the Fibonacci sequence as

fib[0|1]:=1
fib[n_]:= fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]

Then, we can ask the question: Given fib[3], what is the sequence of recursive Fibonacci calls?

Trace[fib[3], fib[_]]

returns a structure that represents the occurrences of the pattern codice_23 in the computational structure:

{fib[3],{fib[2],{fib[1]},{fib[0]}},{fib[1]}}
===Declarative programming===
In symbolic programming languages, it is easy to have patterns as arguments to functions or as elements of data structures. A consequence of this is the ability to use patterns to declaratively make statements about pieces of data and to flexibly instruct functions how to operate.

For instance, the Mathematica function codice_24 can be used to make more efficient versions of the code. In the following example the details do not particularly matter; what matters is that the subexpression codice_25 instructs codice_24 that expressions of the form codice_27 can be assumed to be integers for the purposes of compilation:
com[i_] := Binomial[2i, i]
Compile[{x, {i, _Integer}}, x^com[i], ]
Mailboxes in Erlang also work this way.

The Curry–Howard correspondence between proofs and programs relates ML-style pattern matching to case analysis and proof by exhaustion.

==Pattern matching and strings==
By far the most common form of pattern matching involves strings of characters. In many programming languages, a particular syntax of strings is used to represent regular expressions, which are patterns describing string characters.

However, it is possible to perform some string pattern matching within the same framework that has been discussed throughout this article.

===Tree patterns for strings===
In Mathematica, strings are represented as trees of root StringExpression and all the characters in order as children of the root. Thus, to match &quot;any amount of trailing characters&quot;, a new wildcard ___ is needed in contrast to _ that would match only a single character.

In Haskell and functional programming languages in general, strings are represented as functional lists of characters. A functional list is defined as an empty list, or an element constructed on an existing list. In Haskell syntax:
[] -- an empty list
x:xs -- an element x constructed on a list xs
The structure for a list with some elements is thus codice_28. When pattern matching, we assert that a certain piece of data is equal to a certain pattern. For example, in the function:
head (element:list) = element
We assert that the first element of codice_29&#x27;s argument is called element, and the function returns this. We know that this is the first element because of the way lists are defined, a single element constructed onto a list. This single element must be the first. The empty list would not match the pattern at all, as an empty list does not have a head (the first element that is constructed).

In the example, we have no use for codice_30, so we can disregard it, and thus write the function:
head (element:_) = element
The equivalent Mathematica transformation is expressed as

 head[element, ]:=element

===Example string patterns===
In Mathematica, for instance,

StringExpression[&quot;a&quot;,_]

will match a string that has two characters and begins with &quot;a&quot;.

The same pattern in Haskell:
[&#x27;a&#x27;, _]
Symbolic entities can be introduced to represent many different classes of relevant features of a string. For instance,

 StringExpression[LetterCharacter, DigitCharacter]

will match a string that consists of a letter first, and then a number.

In Haskell, guards could be used to achieve the same matches:
[letter, digit] | isAlpha letter &amp;&amp; isDigit digit
The main advantage of symbolic string manipulation is that it can be completely integrated with the rest of the programming language, rather than being a separate, special purpose subunit. The entire power of the language can be leveraged to build up the patterns themselves or analyze and transform the programs that contain them.

===SNOBOL===

SNOBOL (&quot;StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language&quot;) is a computer programming language developed between 1962 and 1967 at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories by David J. Farber, Ralph E. Griswold and Ivan P. Polonsky.

SNOBOL4 stands apart from most programming languages by having patterns as a first-class data type (&quot;i.e.&quot; a data type whose values can be manipulated in all ways permitted to any other data type in the programming language) and by providing operators for pattern concatenation and alternation. Strings generated during execution can be treated as programs and executed.

SNOBOL was quite widely taught in larger US universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s as a text manipulation language in the humanities.

Since SNOBOL&#x27;s creation, newer languages such as Awk and Perl have made string manipulation by means of regular expressions fashionable. SNOBOL4 patterns, however, subsume BNF grammars, which are equivalent to context-free grammars and more powerful than regular expressions.

<text>Puerto Galera, officially the Municipality of Puerto Galera (), is a municipality in the province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 41,961 people.

It is mainly accessible from the Southern Luzon gateway port of Batangas by bamboo boats (&quot;bangka&quot;) operated by local regular operators. Seaplane Operator Air Juan Aviation, Inc. flies two daily flights from Manila to Puerto Galera on their Cessna Grand Caravan Seaplanes.

== History ==

Chinese traders possibly knew the place before the arrival of the Spaniards but there is no evidence of Chinese settlement. The place was likely also known by other Southeast Asian merchants, who would have found it convenient to load and unload trading goods. The bay was a convenient place to shelter ships against bad weather, and a warehouse was built to store supplies and trade black rice from Muelle.

In April 1570, the Spaniards arrived in Bombon (now known as Batangas), and later sailed through the Isla Verde Passage, landed and called the place Puerto Galera (the port of Galleons). Miguel López de Legazpi became the first Spanish governor-general of the island. A garrison for soldiers was built in Muelle, and watch towers were erected in Dampalitan Point to monitor naval activity in the bay. Spaniards came to conquer for their king and chased the Muslim Moro pirates who were disrupting their trade with the Chinese and natives. The latter proved to be not only skilled warriors but also good negotiators even in the face of defeat.

In 1663, a change in the form of administration occurred in the island, the &quot;corregidor&quot; was replaced by the &quot;alcalde-mayor&quot; or provincial governor, and the capital was moved from Puerto Galera to Baco. In the seventeenth century, the relative prosperity of the city underwent a serious setback with the rise of Muslim piracy. Both pirates attacks and the mismanagement of the Spaniards resulted in driving the native population either into exile in safer places or sending them inland to comparative safety.

==Geography==
Puerto Galera is located at the north-westernmost part of Oriental Mindoro, and at the south-western end of the Isla Verde Passage, about south of Manila and from Calapan, the provincial capital.

===Barangays===
Puerto Galera is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Aninuan
* Baclayan
* Balatero
* Dulangan
* Palangan
* Poblacion
* Sabang
* San Antonio
* San Isidro
* Santo Niño
* Sinandigan
* Tabinay
* Villaflor
===Climate===
==Demographics==
The Philippine Statistics Authority characterizes the municipality of Puerto Galera as first class based on household income. The municipality had a population of 32,521 in the 2010 national census. The population in 2012 was estimated to be 35,188.

==Economy==
The traditional economy of the city used to be fishing and subsistence agriculture, but with the boom of tourism at the end of the 1970s, the service sector became more and more important and led to population and economic growth. Of the 13 villages (&quot;barangays&quot;) in Puerto Galera, half now rely on tourism-based activities for sustenance.

In addition, Mindoro is quickly becoming one of the key places in the development of renewable energy in the Philippines. With several large wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal projects under construction, the island hoped in 2012 to be a net exporter of electricity by 2016.

===Tourism===

Tourism now represents the core activity of the economy of Puerto Galera, which is well known for its beaches, scuba diving and entertainment activities, including &quot;go-go bars&quot;. The city and its beaches have also become one of the many sites of the Philippines sex tourism industry.

This coastal town has a number of pocket beaches and snorkeling and scuba diving spots. The area was designated a Man and Biosphere reserve of UNESCO in 1973 and has some of the most diverse coral reef diving in Asia. Since 2001, the marine environment has benefited from a huge reduction in the number of fishermen in the area, as they gain higher revenue from tourism activities.

Puerto Galera is included in the list of the &quot;Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World&quot;, and is the only bay in the Philippines to be found on this list.

Among the beaches in Puerto Galera are Sabang Beach and White Beach, which have an active nightlife with numerous bars and restaurants. Both places are directly accessible from Batangas by &quot;bangka&quot; regular lines. On the west, where is only a local boat connection to Abra de Ilog, the planned road between the two cities has not been completed yet. On the east, the city connects by road to Calapan through the Mindoro circular road.

==Tourism==

=== Diving and snorkeling ===

Puerto Galera, especially the Sabang area, is among the top diving destinations in the Philippines and in Asia. Diving sites are found less than five minutes from Sabang Beach. Diving activities generally focus around the areas either side of Escarceo Point. Marine life is diverse. There are over 180+ species of nudibranchs found in the area, and many species of fish can be seen. A variety of wrecks over the years can be found in addition to the one wreck of an engine of a WWII Japanese patrol boat. The major diving federations PADI, CMAS, NAUI and Technical Diving International (TDI) are represented in the area, offering courses from beginners&#x27; open water to advanced and technical diving (rebreather, trimix). Diving trips in the Verde Island Passage, at the heart of the Coral Triangle are organized from Puerto Galera. Many threatened species such as a variety of sea turtles including hawksbills, olive ridleys, and green turtles, humphead wrasses, giant groupers and giant clams are present in the Verde Island Passage.

== Environment ==
The accelerated development of tourism jeopardizes the preservation of its delicate ecological system consumed by &quot;overdevelopment due to a thriving but runaway free-market tourism&quot;. Currently, this appears to be the &quot;biggest problem&quot; of Puerto Galera. Accelerated tourist oriented development poses degradation to the environment, among which, seawater pollution brought about by improper sewage and wastewater discharges. Unless serious action is taken, with regular seawater monitoring, this situation poses a serious threat to the sustainability of various tourist activities at the beaches.

In the summer of 1998, extensive coral bleaching occurred around Medio Island, and a large section of a shallow coral reef system (referred to as the &quot;Coral Gardens&quot;) died. Since then, the coral has regrown with a larger diversity of coral species replacing the prolific table corals. Corals in Puerto Galera were largely unaffected by the 2010 El Niño event. The local government declared the 4,828 ha of municipal waters (12,690 ha) as protected waters, giving special protection to the corals and reef fishes.

In 2006, two super typhoons damaged the shallow reefs around Escarceo Point. A major section of the faster-growing coral species growing up to a depth of was destroyed. This represented about 5% of the coral reef in the area. Extensive signs of new coral recruitment were noted in mid-2008. &quot;Acropora&quot; species (staghorn and table coral) rapidly recolonized the area so that most of the damaged coral has been replaced with new growth.

<text>Type inference, sometimes called type reconstruction, refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression in a formal language. These include programming languages and mathematical type systems, but also natural languages in some branches of computer science and linguistics.

==Nontechnical explanation==
In a typed language, a term&#x27;s type determines the ways it can and cannot be used in that language. For example, consider the English language and terms that could fill in the blank in the phrase &quot;sing _.&quot; The term &quot;a song&quot; is of singable type, so it could be placed in the blank to form a meaningful phrase: &quot;sing a song.&quot; On the other hand, the term &quot;a friend&quot; does not have the singable type, so &quot;sing a friend&quot; is nonsense. At best it might be metaphor; bending type rules is a feature of poetic language.

A term&#x27;s type can also affect the interpretation of operations involving that term. For instance, &quot;a song&quot; is of composable type, so we interpret it as the thing created in the phrase &quot;write a song&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;a friend&quot; is of recipient type, so we interpret it as the addressee in the phrase &quot;write a friend&quot;. In normal language, we would be surprised if &quot;write a song&quot; meant addressing a letter to a song or &quot;write a friend&quot; meant drafting a friend on paper.

Terms with different types can even refer to materially the same thing. For example, we would interpret &quot;to hang up the clothes line&quot; as putting it into use, but &quot;to hang up the leash&quot; as putting it away, even though, in context, both &quot;clothes line&quot; and &quot;leash&quot; might refer the same rope, just at different times.

Typings are often used to prevent an object from being considered too generally. For instance, if the type system treats all numbers as the same, then a programmer who accidentally writes code where codice_1 is supposed to mean &quot;4 seconds&quot; but is interpreted as &quot;4 meters&quot; would have no warning of their mistake until it caused problems at runtime. By incorporating units into the type system, these mistakes can be detected much earlier. As another example, Russell&#x27;s paradox arises when anything can be a set element and any predicate can define a set, but more careful typing gives several ways to resolve the paradox. In fact, Russell&#x27;s paradox sparked early versions of type theory.

There are several ways that a term can get its type:

* The type might be provided from somewhere outside the passage. For instance, if a speaker refers to &quot;a song&quot; in English, they generally do not have to tell the listener that &quot;a song&quot; is singable and composable; that information is part of their shared background knowledge.
* The type can be declared explicitly. For example, a programmer might write a statement like codice_2 in their code, where the colon is the conventional mathematical symbol to mark a term with its type. That is, this statement is not only setting codice_3 to the value codice_1, but the codice_5 part also indicates that codice_3&#x27;s type is an amount of time in seconds.
* The type can be inferred from context. For example, in the phrase &quot;I bought it for a song&quot;, we can observe that trying to give the term &quot;a song&quot; types like &quot;singable&quot; and &quot;composable&quot; would lead to nonsense, whereas the type &quot;amount of currency&quot; works out. Therefore, without having to be told, we conclude that &quot;song&quot; here must mean &quot;little to nothing&quot;, as in the English idiom &quot;&quot;, not &quot;a piece of music, usually with lyrics&quot;.

Especially in programming languages, there may not be much shared background knowledge available to the computer. In manifestly typed languages, this means that most types have to be declared explicitly. Type inference aims to alleviate this burden, freeing the author from declaring types that the computer should be able to deduce from context.

==Type-checking vs. type-inference==

In a typing, an expression E is opposed to a type T, formally written as E : T. Usually a typing only makes sense within some context, which is omitted here.

In this setting, the following questions are of particular interest:

# E : T? In this case, both an expression E and a type T are given. Now, is E really a T? This scenario is known as type-checking.
# E : _? Here, only the expression is known. If there is a way to derive a type for E, then we have accomplished &quot;type inference&quot;.
# _ : T? The other way round. Given only a type, is there any expression for it or does the type have no values? Is there any example of a T? This is known as type inhabitation.

For the simply typed lambda calculus, all three questions are decidable. The situation is not as comfortable when more expressive types are allowed.

==Types in programming languages==
Types are a feature present in some strongly statically typed languages. It is often characteristic of functional programming languages in general. Some languages that include type inference include C23, C++11, C# (starting with version 3.0), Chapel, Clean, Crystal, D, F#, FreeBASIC, Go, Haskell, Java (starting with version 10), Julia, Kotlin, ML, Nim, OCaml, Opa, Q#, RPython, Rust, Scala, Swift, TypeScript, Vala, Dart, and Visual Basic (starting with version 9.0). 
The majority of them use a simple form of type inference; the Hindley–Milner type system can provide more complete type inference. The ability to infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier, leaving the programmer free to omit type annotations while still permitting type checking.

In some programming languages, all values have a data type explicitly declared at compile time, limiting the values a particular expression can take on at run-time. Increasingly, just-in-time compilation blurs the distinction between run time and compile time. However, historically, if the type of a value is known only at run-time, these languages are dynamically typed. In other languages, the type of an expression is known only at compile time; these languages are statically typed. In most statically typed languages, the input and output types of functions and local variables ordinarily must be explicitly provided by type annotations. For example, in ANSI C:

int add_one(int x) {
 int result; /* declare integer result */

 result = x + 1;
 return result;

The signature of this function definition, codice_7, declares that codice_8 is a function that takes one argument, an integer, and returns an integer. codice_9 declares that the local variable codice_10 is an integer. In a hypothetical language supporting type inference, the code might be written like this instead:

add_one(x) {
 var result; /* inferred-type variable result */
 var result2; /* inferred-type variable result #2 */

 result = x + 1;
 result2 = x + 1.0; /* this line won&#x27;t work (in the proposed language) */
 return result;
This is identical to how code is written in the language Dart, except that it is subject to some added constraints as described below. It would be possible to &quot;infer&quot; the types of all the variables at compile time. In the example above, the compiler would infer that codice_10 and codice_12 have type integer since the constant codice_13 is type integer, and hence that codice_8 is a function codice_15. The variable codice_16 isn&#x27;t used in a legal manner, so it wouldn&#x27;t have a type.

In the imaginary language in which the last example is written, the compiler would assume that, in the absence of information to the contrary, codice_17 takes two integers and returns one integer. (This is how it works in, for example, OCaml.) From this, the type inferencer can infer that the type of codice_18 is an integer, which means codice_10 is an integer and thus the return value of codice_8 is an integer. Similarly, since codice_17 requires both of its arguments be of the same type, codice_12 must be an integer, and thus, codice_8 accepts one integer as an argument.

However, in the subsequent line, &quot;result2&quot; is calculated by adding a decimal codice_24 with floating-point arithmetic, causing a conflict in the use of codice_12 for both integer and floating-point expressions. The correct type-inference algorithm for such a situation has been known since 1958 and has been known to be correct since 1982. It revisits the prior inferences and uses the most general type from the outset: in this case floating-point. This can however have detrimental implications, for instance using a floating-point from the outset can introduce precision issues that would have not been there with an integer type.

Frequently, however, degenerate type-inference algorithms are used that cannot backtrack and instead generate an error message in such a situation. This behavior may be preferable as type inference may not always be neutral algorithmically, as illustrated by the prior floating-point precision issue.

An algorithm of intermediate generality implicitly declares &quot;result2&quot; as a floating-point variable, and the addition implicitly converts codice_12 to a floating point. This can be correct if the calling contexts never supply a floating point argument. Such a situation shows the difference between &quot;type inference&quot;, which does not involve type conversion, and implicit type conversion, which forces data to a different data type, often without restrictions.

Finally, a significant downside of complex type-inference algorithm is that the resulting type inference resolution is not going to be obvious to humans (notably because of the backtracking), which can be detrimental as code is primarily intended to be comprehensible to humans.

The recent emergence of just-in-time compilation allows for hybrid approaches where the type of arguments supplied by the various calling context is known at compile time, and can generate a large number of compiled versions of the same function. Each compiled version can then be optimized for a different set of types. For instance, JIT compilation allows there to be at least two compiled versions of &quot;add_one&quot;:

:A version that accepts an integer input and uses implicit type conversion.
:A version that accepts a floating-point number as input and uses floating point instructions throughout.

==Technical description==
Type inference is the ability to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. The compiler is often able to infer the type of a variable or the type signature of a function, without explicit type annotations having been given. In many cases, it is possible to omit type annotations from a program completely if the type inference system is robust enough, or the program or language is simple enough.

To obtain the information required to infer the type of an expression, the compiler either gathers this information as an aggregate and subsequent reduction of the type annotations given for its subexpressions, or through an implicit understanding of the type of various atomic values (e.g. true : Bool; 42 : Integer; 3.14159 : Real; etc.). It is through recognition of the eventual reduction of expressions to implicitly typed atomic values that the compiler for a type inferring language is able to compile a program completely without type annotations.

In complex forms of higher-order programming and polymorphism, it is not always possible for the compiler to infer as much, and type annotations are occasionally necessary for disambiguation. For instance, type inference with polymorphic recursion is known to be undecidable. Furthermore, explicit type annotations can be used to optimize code by forcing the compiler to use a more specific (faster/smaller) type than it had inferred.

Some methods for type inference are based on constraint satisfaction or satisfiability modulo theories.

==High-Level Example==
As an example, the Haskell function map applies a function to each element of a list, and may be defined as:

map f [] = []
map f (first:rest) = f first : map f rest

(Recall that : in Haskell denotes cons, structuring a head element and a list tail into a bigger list or destructuring a nonempty list into its head element and its tail. It does not denote &quot;of type&quot; as in mathematics and elsewhere in this article; in Haskell that &quot;of type&quot; operator is written :: instead.)

Type inference on the map function proceeds as follows. map is a function of two arguments, so its type is constrained to be of the form a -&gt; b -&gt; c. In Haskell, the patterns [] and (first:rest) always match lists, so the second argument must be a list type: b = [d] for some type d. Its first argument f is applied to the argument first, which must have type d, corresponding with the type in the list argument, so f :: d -&gt; e (:: means &quot;is of type&quot;) for some type e. The return value of map f, finally, is a list of whatever f produces, so [e].

Putting the parts together leads to map :: (d -&gt; e) -&gt; [d] -&gt; [e]. Nothing is special about the type variables, so it can be relabeled as

map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
It turns out that this is also the most general type, since no further constraints apply. As the inferred type of map is parametrically polymorphic, the type of the arguments and results of f are not inferred, but left as type variables, and so map can be applied to functions and lists of various types, as long as the actual types match in each invocation.

==Detailed Example==
The algorithms used by programs like compilers are equivalent to the informally structured reasoning above, but a bit more verbose and methodical. The exact details depend on the inference algorithm chosen (see the following section for the best-known algorithm), but the example below gives the general idea. We again begin with the definition of map:

map f [] = []
map f (first:rest) = f first : map f rest

(Again, remember that the : here is the Haskell list constructor, not the &quot;of type&quot; operator, which Haskell instead spells ::.)

First, we make fresh type variables for each individual term:
* codice_27 shall denote the type of map that we want to infer.
* codice_28 shall denote the type of f in the first equation.
* codice_29 shall denote the type of [] on the left side of the first equation.
* codice_30 shall denote the type of [] on the right side of the first equation.
* codice_31 shall denote the type of f in the second equation.
* codice_32 shall denote the type of : on the left side of the first equation. (This pattern is known from its definition.)
* codice_33 shall denote the type of first.
* codice_34 shall denote the type of rest.
* codice_35 shall denote the type of : on the right side of the first equation.

Then we make fresh type variables for subexpressions built from these terms, constraining the type of the function being invoked accordingly:
* codice_36 shall denote the type of map f []. We conclude that codice_37 where the &quot;similar&quot; symbol codice_38 means &quot;unifies with&quot;; we are saying that codice_27, the type of map, must be compatible with the type of a function taking a codice_28 and a list of codice_41s and returning a codice_36.
* codice_43 shall denote the type of (first:rest). We conclude that codice_44.
* codice_45 shall denote the type of map f (first:rest). We conclude that codice_46.
* codice_47 shall denote the type of f first. We conclude that codice_48.
* codice_49 shall denote the type of map f rest. We conclude that codice_50.
* codice_51 shall denote the type of f first : map f rest. We conclude that codice_52.

We also constrain the left and right sides of each equation to unify with each other: codice_53 and codice_54. Altogether the system of unifications to solve is:
Then we substitute until no further variables can be eliminated. The exact order is immaterial; if the code type-checks, any order will lead to the same final form. Let us begin by substituting codice_51 for codice_45 and codice_30 for codice_36:
Substituting codice_59 for codice_33, codice_61 for codice_34 and codice_43, codice_64 for codice_47, and codice_66 for codice_49 and codice_51, all possible because a type constructor like · -&gt; · is invertible in its arguments:
Substituting codice_69 for codice_31 and codice_71 for codice_27, keeping the second constraint around so that we can recover codice_27 at the end:
And, finally, substituting codice_74 for codice_28 as well as codice_59 for codice_41 and codice_64 for codice_79 because a type constructor like [·] is invertible eliminates all the variables specific to the second constraint:
No more substitutions are possible, and relabeling gives us map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b], the same as we found without going into these details.

==Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm==

The algorithm first used to perform type inference is now informally termed the Hindley–Milner algorithm, although the algorithm should properly be attributed to Damas and Milner.
It is also traditionally called &quot;type reconstruction&quot;. If a term is well-typed in accordance with Hindley–Milner typing rules, then the rules generate a principal typing for the term. The process of discovering this principal typing is the process of &quot;reconstruction&quot;.

The origin of this algorithm is the type inference algorithm for the simply typed lambda calculus that was devised by Haskell Curry and Robert Feys in 1958.
In 1969 J. Roger Hindley extended this work and proved that their algorithm always inferred the most general type.
In 1978 Robin Milner, independently of Hindley&#x27;s work, provided an equivalent algorithm, Algorithm W.
In 1982 Luis Damas finally proved that Milner&#x27;s algorithm is complete and extended it to support systems with polymorphic references.

==Side-effects of using the most general type==
By design, type inference will infer the most general type appropriate. However, many languages, especially older programming languages, have slightly unsound type systems, where using a more general types may not always be algorithmically neutral. Typical cases include:
* Floating-point types being considered as generalizations of integer types. Actually, floating-point arithmetic has different precision and wrapping issues than integers do.
* Variant/dynamic types being considered as generalizations of other types in cases where this affects the selection of operator overloads. For example, the codice_17 operator may add integers but may concatenate variants as strings, even if those variants hold integers.

==Type inference for natural languages==
Type inference algorithms have been used to analyze natural languages as well as programming languages. Type inference algorithms are also used in some grammar induction and constraint-based grammar systems for natural languages.

<text>Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt (1718 – 29 August 1782) was a Royal Navy officer best known for his victory at the Battle of Ushant in 1781 and dying when accidentally sank at Portsmouth the following year.

==Background==

Richard Kempenfelt was born in Westminster, London in 1718. He was the son of Magnus Kempenfelt and his wife Ann Hunt. Magnus, a Swede, was a British Army officer.

==Naval career==

Richard Kempenfelt was commissioned a lieutenant in January 1741. He saw service in the West Indies, taking part in the capture of Portobelo during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. In 1746 he returned to Britain, and from then until 1780, when he was made rear admiral, he saw active service in the East Indies with Sir George Pocock and in various quarters of the world.

In 1779 he was made Chief of Staff or Captain of the Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Hardy on which was to lead a hastily assembled fleet to oppose an invasion of England set to begin with the destruction of the Portsmouth naval base by the French and Spanish Armada of 1779.

In 1781 he won the Battle of Ushant, with a vastly inferior force, defeating the French fleet under Guichen and capturing 20 ships.

==&quot;Royal George&quot;==
In 1782 he hoisted his flag on , which formed part of the fleet under Lord Howe. In August this fleet was ordered to proceed to the relief of Gibraltar, and underwent a refit at top speed at Portsmouth.

On 29 August 1782, &quot;Royal George&quot; was being heeled off Portsmouth to allow repairs to be made to the water intake for the deck wash pump, which was three feet below water level. The larboard guns had been run out and the starboard guns moved into the centre of the deck to heel over the ship until her lowest gun ports were close to the surface of the water. A supply vessel, &quot;Lark&quot;, approached &quot;Royal George&quot; on her low side to transfer a cargo of rum. According to an Admiralty report – not made public until early the next century – the larboard cannons&#x27; weight on the ship&#x27;s central frame caused excessively decayed timbers to break. This caused the ship to heel to such a degree that the sea washed in at her gunports, and she soon began to ship water in her hold. A sudden breeze on the raised side of the ship forced her further over and the water rushed in. The crew were ordered to right the ship but the fallen cannon could not be moved. Within a couple of minutes she rolled on to her side and sank before any distress signal could be given.

Nine hundred people were estimated to have lost their lives, for besides the crew there were a large number of tradesmen and women and children on board. About 230 people were saved, some by running up the rigging, while others were picked up by boats from other vessels. The usual assumption is that Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; the cabin doors had jammed due to the ship heeling, and he perished with the rest. However, rival scenarios were reported at the time, as described in historian Hilary L. Rubinstein&#x27;s book on the sinking, published in 2021. William Cowper&#x27;s poem the &quot;Loss of the Royal George&quot; was based on the report that the admiral was trapped writing in his cabin, so that is the scenario which prevailed to the exclusion of other reports circulating at the time. Kempenfelt had effected radical alterations and improvements in the signalling system then existing in the British Navy. A painting of the loss of &quot;Royal George&quot; is in the Royal United Service Institution, London.

Kempenfelt took a great interest in evangelism. His hymns were published in &quot;Original Hymns and Poems&quot; by &quot;Philotheorus&quot; (Exeter, England: B. Thorn, 1777), dedicated to the Methodist John William Fletcher. It was reprinted in 1861 with a preface by Daniel Sedgwick.

==Memorials==

A memorial to Kempenfelt, by the sculptor John Bacon, was placed in the Chapel of St Michael Westminster Abbey in 1808.

Kempenfelt Bay on Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada, is named for him, and a number of warships have been named . LMS Jubilee Class locomotive 5662 (later numbered 45662 under British Railways) was named after Kempenfelt. 

A 1768 painting of Kempenfelt, along with his fellow mariners Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet and Thomas Parry went on permanent display at Queen&#x27;s House in Greenwich in Autumn 2022. The painting is by the artist Tilly Kettle and was purchased by the National Maritime Museum, with assistance from the Society for Nautical Research.

<text>In computer science, a type signature or type annotation defines the inputs and outputs of a function, subroutine or method. A type signature includes the number, types, and order of the function&#x27;s arguments. One important use of a type signature is for function overload resolution, where one particular definition of a function to be called is selected among many overloaded forms.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In C and C++, the type signature is declared by what is commonly known as a function prototype. In C/C++, a function declaration reflects its use; for example, a function pointer with the signature would be called as:
char c;
double d;
int retVal = (*fPtr)(c, d);
===Erlang===
In Erlang, type signatures may be optionally declared, as:
-spec function_name(type1(), type2(), ...) -&gt; out_type().
For example:

-spec is_even(number()) -&gt; boolean().
===Haskell===
A type signature in Haskell generally takes the following form:
functionName :: arg1Type -&gt; arg2Type -&gt; ... -&gt; argNType
Notice that the type of the result can be regarded as everything past the first supplied argument. This is a consequence of currying, which is made possible by Haskell&#x27;s support for first-class functions; this function requires two inputs where one argument is supplied and the function is &quot;curried&quot; to produce a function for the argument not supplied. Thus, calling , where , yields a new function that can be called to produce .

The actual type specifications can consist of an actual type, such as , or a general type variable that is used in parametric polymorphic functions, such as , or , or . So we can write something like:
Since Haskell supports higher-order functions, functions can be passed as arguments. This is written as:
This function takes in a function with type signature and returns data of type out.

===Java===
In the Java virtual machine, &quot;internal type signatures&quot; are used to identify methods and classes at the level of the virtual machine code.

Example: The method is represented in bytecode as .

The signature of the method looks like this:
public static void main(String[] args);
And in the disassembled bytecode, it takes the form of 

The method signature for the method contains three modifiers:
* indicates that the method can be called by any object.
* indicates that the method is a class method.
* indicates that the method has no return value.

==Signature==

A function signature consists of the function prototype. It specifies the general information about a function like the name, scope and parameters. Many programming languages use name mangling in order to pass along more semantic information from the compilers to the linkers. In addition to mangling, there is an excess of information in a function signature (stored internally to most compilers) which is not readily available, but may be accessed.

Understanding the notion of a function signature is an important concept for all computer science studies.
* Modern object orientation techniques make use of interfaces, which are essentially templates made from function signatures.
* C++ uses function overloading with various signatures.

The practice of multiple inheritance requires consideration of the function signatures to avoid unpredictable results. Computer science theory, and the concept of polymorphism in particular, make much use of the concept of function signature.

In the C programming language, a signature is roughly equivalent to its prototype definition.

In the ML family of programming languages, &quot;signature&quot; is used as a keyword referring to a construct of the module system that plays the role of an interface.

==Method signature==
In computer programming, especially object-oriented programming, a method is commonly identified by its unique method signature, which usually includes the method name and the number, types, and order of its parameters. A method signature is the smallest type of a method.

===Examples===
====C/C++====
In C/C++, the method signature is the method name and the number and type of its parameters, but it is possible to have a last parameter that consists of an array of values:
int printf(const char*, ... );
Manipulation of these parameters can be done by using the routines in the standard library header .

In C++, the return type can also follow the parameter list, which is referred to as a trailing return type. The difference is only syntactic; in either case, the resulting signature is identical:
auto printf(const char*... ) -&gt; int;
====C#====
Similar to the syntax of C, method signatures in C# are composed of a name and the number and type of its parameters, where the last parameter may be an array of values:
void Add(out int sum, params int[] value);
Add(out sum, 3, 5, 7, 11, -1); // sum == 25
====Java====
In Java, a method signature is composed of a name and the number, type, and order of its parameters. Return types and thrown exceptions are not considered to be a part of the method signature, nor are the names of parameters; they are ignored by the compiler for checking method uniqueness.

The method signatures help distinguish overloaded methods (methods with the same name) in a class. Return types are not included in overloading. Only method signatures should be used to distinguish overloaded methods.

For example, the following two methods have different signatures:
void doSomething(String[] x); // doSomething(String[])
void doSomething(String x); // doSomething(String)
The following two methods both have the same signature:
int doSomething(int x); // doSomething(int)
void doSomething(int y) throws Exception; // doSomething(int)
====Julia====
In Julia, function signatures take the following form:
commission(sale::Int, rate::Float64)::Float64
The types in the arguments are used for the multiple dispatch. The return type is validated when the function returns a value, and a runtime exception is raised if the type of the value does not agree with the specified type.

Abstract types are allowed and are encouraged for implementing general behavior that is common to all subtypes. The above function can therefore be rewritten as follows. In this case, the function can accept any Integer and Real subtypes accordingly.
commission(sale::Integer, rate::Real)::Real
Types are completely optional in function arguments. When unspecified, it is equivalent to using the type Any, which is the super-type of all types. It is idiomatic to specify argument types but not return type.

====Objective-C====
In the Objective-C programming language, method signatures for an object are declared in the interface header file. For example,
- (id)initWithInt:(int)value;
defines a method that returns a general object (an ) and takes one integer argument. Objective-C only requires a type in a signature to be explicit when the type is not ; this signature is equivalent:
- initWithInt:(int)value;
====Rust====
In Rust, function signatures take the following form:
fn commission(sale: u32, rate: f64) -&gt; f64;

<text>Ludwig Bölkow (30 June 1912 – 25 July 2003) was one of the aeronautical pioneers of Germany.

==Background==
Born in Schwerin, in then north-central Germany, in 1912, Bölkow was the son of a foreman employed by Fokker, one of the leading aircraft constructors of that time.

==Early career==
Bölkow&#x27;s first job was with Heinkel, the aircraft company, before studying aero-engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). On graduation, in 1939, he joined the project office of Messerschmitt AG in Augsburg, where he served initially as a clerk, later as a group leader for high-speed aerodynamics, especially for the Messerschmitt Me 262 and its successors. In January 1943, he was appointed head of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 development office in Vienna. A year later, Bölkow returned to the Messerschmitt project office, which had meanwhile moved to Oberammergau. There he set up a program for the development of the Messerschmitt P.1101 jet fighter.

==Later career==
After the war he created the Bölkow GmbH in Ottobrunn, which with time grew to the biggest aeronautics and spaceflight company, MBB (Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm). In the early 1990s it was bought by DASA.

He carried out the construction of the first German satellite, Azur, launched in 1969.

Bölkow was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for &quot;outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering&quot; in 1972. He was awarded a Gold Medal by the British Royal Aeronautical Society in 1978.

<doc id="279696" wikidata="Q311637" url="?curid=279696" title="Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans">
<text>Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans (Louis Philippe Joseph; 13 April 17476 November 1793), was a French Prince of the Blood who supported the French Revolution.

Louis Philippe II was born at the to Louis Philippe I, Duke of Chartres, and his wife, Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti. He was titled Duke of Montpensier at birth. When his grandfather Louis, Duke of Orléans, died in 1752, his father became the new Duke of Orléans and Louis Philippe II became Duke of Chartres. When his father died in 1785, he became Duke of Orléans and First Prince of the Blood. He was styled as Serene Highness ().

In 1792, during the Revolution, Louis Philippe changed his name to . He was a cousin of King Louis XVI and one of the wealthiest men in France. He actively supported the Revolution of 1789, and was a strong advocate for the elimination of the present absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy. Égalité voted for the death of Louis XVI; however, he was himself guillotined in 1793 during the Reign of Terror. His son, also named Louis Philippe, became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830. After Louis Philippe II, the term Orléanist came to be attached to the movement in France that favored a constitutional monarchy.

==Early life==

Louis Philippe Joseph d&#x27;Orléans was the son of Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Chartres, and his wife, Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti. Philippe was a member of the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. His mother came from the House of Bourbon-Conti, a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon-Condé.

Philippe was born at the Château de Saint-Cloud, one of the residences of the Duke of Orléans, five kilometers west of Paris. His older sister, born in 1745, died when she was six months old. His younger sister, Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, was born in 1750.

On March 12, 1756, Philippe and his sister were amongst the first people in France to be inoculated against smallpox, a decision made by their father against the advice of both their mother and King Louis XV. The procedure was performed by physician Théodore Tronchin, and a few days later, &quot;the Duchess of Orelans, having appeared at the Opera with her two children, was greeted by endless applause and cheers, as if the two princes had miraculously escaped death.&quot;

=== Succession ===
Philippe&#x27;s first title, given to him at birth, was that of the Duke of Montpensier. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1752, Philippe inherited the title of Duke of Chartres. After his father&#x27;s death in 1785, Philippe became the Duke of Orléans, head of the House of Orléans, one of the wealthiest noble families in France. At his father&#x27;s death, Philippe became the &quot;Premier Prince du Sang&quot;, First Prince of the Blood, which put him in line for the succession to the throne immediately after the &quot;comte d&#x27;Artois&quot;, the youngest brother of Louis XVI.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
On 6 June 1769, Louis Philippe married Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon at the chapel of the Palace of Versailles. She was the daughter of his cousin, Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre, one of the richest men in France. Since it was certain that his wife would become the richest woman in France upon the death of her father, Louis Philippe was able to play a political role in court equal to that of his great-grandfather Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, who had been the Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. Louise Marie Adélaïde brought to the already wealthy House of Orléans a considerable dowry of six million livres, an annual income of 240,000 livres (later increased to 400,000 livres), as well as lands, titles, residences and furniture.
Unlike her husband, the Duchess of Orléans did not support the Revolution. She was a devout Catholic who supported keeping the monarchy in France, as well as following the orders of Pope Pius VI. This was the causes of one of the rifts of the couple, as their first son, the future &quot;King of the French&quot;, followed his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the Jacobin faction.

=== Scandals ===

During the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the Duke went back to the life of &quot;libertinage&quot; he had led before his marriage. The Duke was a well-known womanizer and, like several of his ancestors, such as Louis XIV and Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, had several illegitimate children.

During the summer of 1772, the Duke began his secret liaison with one of his wife&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis, the niece of Madame de Montesson, the morganatic wife of Philippe&#x27;s father. Passionate at first, the liaison cooled within a few months and, by the spring of 1773, was reported to be &quot;dead&quot;. After the romantic affair was over, Madame de Genlis remained in the service of Marie-Adélaïde at the Palais-Royal, a trusted friend to both the Duke and the Duchess. They both appreciated her intelligence and, in July 1779, she became the governess of the couple&#x27;s twin daughters (born in 1777). One of his best known lovers was Grace Elliott.

It was alleged that Lady Edward FitzGerald, born Stephanie Caroline Anne Syms, also known as &quot;Pamela&quot;, was a natural daughter of the Duke and the Countess of Genlis. He recognized a son he had with Marguerite Françoise Bouvier de la Mothe de Cépoy, &quot;comtesse de Buffon&quot;, Victor Leclerc de Buffon (6 September 179220 April 1812), known as the &quot;chevalier de Saint-Paul&quot; and &quot;chevalier d&#x27;Orléans&quot;.

==Military career==
In 18th-century France, it was very common for royal princes to receive high positions in the military. From a young age, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans displayed his interest in naval matters, and he received three years of training in the navy.

In 1776, he held the rank of Chef d&#x27;Escadre, and commanded one of the three divisions of the Escadre d&#x27;évolution, with his flag on the 64-gun &quot;Solitaire&quot;.

When the Anglo-French War broke out in 1778, Orléans was Lieutenant général des Armées navales, in charge of an entire squadron. He commanded the Blue squadron that formed the rear of the French fleet under Louis Guillouet, comte d&#x27;Orvilliers, with his flag on the 80-gun &quot;Saint-Esprit&quot;. At the Battle of Ushant, on 27 July 1778, the French fleet fought in inverted order, putting the Blue squadron at the vanguard of the French line of battle. During the battle, Orléans&#x27; squadron failed to exploit a gap in the British line, allowing the rear of Keppel&#x27;s fleet to escape.

Orléans returned to Paris claiming the battle had been a resounding victory, and received a hero&#x27;s welcome. When it transpired that these claims were overstated, that the battle had been more of a draw, Orléans&#x27; credibility suffered an unrecoverable blow. He withdrew from the navy and asked the army if they could give him a position, but it was denied.

==Role in the French Revolution==
=== Liberal ideology ===
In August 1787 the Duke of Orléans and his secretary Charles-Louis Ducrest, the brother of Madame de Genlis, came up with proposals to improve the financial situation of France. Philippe d&#x27;Orléans became a member of the Society of the Friends of the Constitution, and strongly adhered to the principles of Denis Diderot, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He was interested in creating a more moral and democratic form of government in France. As he grew more and more interested in Rousseau&#x27;s ideas, he began to promote Enlightenment ideas, such as the separation of church and state and limited monarchy. He also advocated and voted against feudalism and slavery.

In addition to being a Jacobin, Philippe was also the Grand Master of the Masonic &quot;Grand Orient de France&quot;, the most powerful Masonic Obedience in worldwide Continental Freemasonry (which now stands opposed to the &quot;Regular&quot; Freemasonry of the United Grand Lodge of England and the majority of lodges in the United States of America), from 1771 to 1793, even though he did not attend a meeting until 1777. He later distanced himself from Freemasonry in a letter dated January 1793, and the Grand Orient vacated his position on 13 December 1793 (however, Philippe had already been executed weeks before).

Philippe was also a strong admirer of the British constitutional monarchy. He strongly advocated for France&#x27;s adoption of a constitutional monarchy rather than the absolute monarchy that was present in France at the time.

=== Palais-Royal ===
As the new Duke of Orléans, one of the many estates Philippe inherited from his father was the Palais-Royal, which became known as the Palais-Égalité in 1792, because he opened up its doors to all people of France, regardless of their estate (class). He employed Swiss guards to refuse entry only to &quot;drunkards, women in excessively indecent dress, and those in tatters.&quot; He built shops and cafés where people could interact, and soon it became a hub for social life in Paris. As the Parisian police had no authority to enter the Duke&#x27;s private property, it became a hub for illegal activity, such as trade in stolen goods, suspicious deals, and the spread of revolutionary ideas. In fact, it was a common place for Jacobins to meet and discuss their plans and ideas. Many members of the National Assembly claimed that the Palais-Royal was the &quot;birthplace of the Revolution.&quot; Philippe&#x27;s goal was to create a place where people could meet, which he argued was a crucial part of democracy and a &quot;physical need for civil life.&quot;

During the months leading up to the outbreak of revolutionary violence in July 1789, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans undertook several personal actions having the effect of increasing his personal standing amongst the population at large. These included his endorsement of a pamphlet outlining the process to be followed in the setting up of local assemblies, the sale of artwork to provide funds for poor relief and an incident during the Reveillon riots where he scattered coins amongst a cheering crowd.

===Leadership in the Estates-General===
Philippe d&#x27;Orléans was elected to the Estates General of 1789 by three districts: by the nobility of Paris, Villers-Cotterêts, and Crépy-en-Valois. As a noble in the Second Estate, he was the head of the liberal minority under the guidance of Adrien Duport. Although he was a member of the Second Estate, he felt a strong connection to the Third Estate, as they comprised the majority of the members in the Estates-General, yet were the most underrepresented. When the Third Estate decided to take the Tennis Court Oath and break away from the Estates General to form the National Assembly, Philippe was one of the first to join them and was a very important figure in the unification of the nobility and the Third Estate. In fact, he led his minority group of 47 nobles to secede from their estate and join the National Assembly.

=== Women&#x27;s March on Versailles and exile ===
One of the main accusations thrown at Philippe d&#x27;Orléans was the initiation of the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles on 5 October 1789, which people believed was done in order to overthrow the King and gain popularity amongst the people. He was accused of funding the riots, as well as calling the rioters his &quot;friends&quot;, who were chanting: &quot;Vive Orléans&quot; or &quot;Long live our father, long live King d&#x27;Orléans!&quot; The High Court of the Grand Châtelet also accused him of acting as an accomplice to Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, in an attempt to murder Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, during this period. Early in the morning on 6 October a group of protesters entered the palace through an unguarded gate, searching for the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, they were quickly followed by many and fighting with royal guards flared in the halls and outside the queen&#x27;s apartments. Marie Antoinette and her ladies barely escaped to the king&#x27;s bedchamber in front of the violent intruders; the queen was suspicious that d&#x27;Orléans had arranged the attempted attack on her. Marie Antoinette&#x27;s daughter Marie-Thérèse shared the same suspicion later writing that, &quot;[t]he principal project was to assassinate my mother&quot;.

The Marquis de Lafayette, who was very influential in France at the time and a supposed &quot;friend&quot; of d&#x27;Orléans, suggested to him to go to the British Isles with the promise that he could potentially become the head of state of Brabant. However, it is likely that Lafayette viewed d&#x27;Orléans as a threat to his control of the revolutionary politics and that he intended to get Philippe out of the country.

At first, it was difficult to convince d&#x27;Orléans to leave France during these troubling times, but after strong pressure and enticement from Lafayette, he ended up leaving. Throughout his weeks in exile, he wrote several letters expressing his strong desire to return to France. After spending months in the British Isles d&#x27;Orléans returned to France for the Fête de la Fédération; but he never regained the same influence that he enjoyed in 1789 prior to his departure. Those who did not support him, as well as people overseas, labeled him as a coward for fleeing to England as a result of accusations against him, calling it a period of &quot;exile.&quot; However, he was able to keep his position in the National Assembly until it disbanded on 30 September 1791.

===Citoyen Égalité===
Due to the liberal ideology that separated Philippe d&#x27;Orléans from the rest of his royal family, he always felt uncomfortable with his name. He felt that the political connotations associated with his name did not match his democratic and Enlightenment philosophies, thus he requested that the Paris Commune allow his name to be changed, which was granted. Shortly after the September Massacres in 1792, he changed his surname to &quot;Égalité&quot;, (&quot;equality&quot; in English). As one of the three words in the motto of the French Revolution (&quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité&quot;), he felt that this name better represented him as a symbol of the French people and what they were fighting for.

Égalité also attributed his new surname to the reputation of generosity that he had among the people of France, especially the poor. He was well known for distributing food and money to the poor, as well as providing shelter for homeless during the severe winter of 1788–1789.

=== Relationship with King Louis XVI ===
Although a relative of King Louis XVI, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans never maintained a positive relationship with his cousin. Upon inheriting the title of Duke of Orléans, Philippe also became the &quot;Premier Prince du sang&quot; – the most important personage of the kingdom after the king&#x27;s immediate family. Therefore, he would be next in line to the throne should the main Bourbon line die out. For this reason, many supposed that Philippe&#x27;s goal was to take his cousin&#x27;s throne. Philippe and the King&#x27;s wife, Marie Antoinette, also detested each other. Marie Antoinette hated him for what she viewed as treachery, hypocrisy and selfishness, and he, in turn, scorned her for her frivolous and spendthrift lifestyle. The King&#x27;s reluctance to grant Philippe a position in the army after the indecisive result at the Battle of Ushant is said to be another reason for Philippe&#x27;s discontent with the King.

One of the most astounding events occurred when Philippe took a vote in favor of Louis XVI&#x27;s execution. He had agreed among close friends that he would vote against his execution, but surrounded by the &quot;Montagnards&quot;, a radical faction in the National Convention, he turned on his word, to the surprise of many. A majority (75 votes) was necessary to indict the King, and an overwhelming number of 394 votes were collected in favor of his death. The King was especially shocked by the news, stating:

&quot;It really pains me to see that Monsieur d&#x27;Orléans, my kinsman, voted for my death.&quot;

== Death ==

On 1 April 1793, a decree was voted for within the National Convention, including Égalité&#x27;s vote, that condemned anyone with &quot;strong presumptions of complicity with the enemies of Liberty.&quot; At the time, Égalité&#x27;s son, Louis Philippe, who was a general in the French Revolutionary Army, joined General Charles François Dumouriez in a plot to visit the Austrians, who were an enemy of France. Although there was no evidence that convicted Égalité himself of treason, the simple relationship that his son had with Dumouriez, a traitor in the eyes of the Convention, was enough to get him and Louis Charles, Count of Beaujolais arrested on 4 April 1793, and the other members of the Bourbon family still in France on the days after. He spent several months incarcerated at Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille until he was sent back to Paris. On 2 November 1793, he was imprisoned at the Conciergerie. Tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on 6 November, he was sentenced to death, and guillotined the same day.

<text>Adrien Duport (; 6 February 17596 July 1798) was a French politician, and lawyer. He was an influential advocate in the parlement, and was prominent in opposition to the ministers Calonne and Loménie de Brienne.

==Life==
Adrien Jean-François Duport was born in Paris.

Elected in 1789, to the states-general by the Paris nobility, he displayed remarkable eloquence. As a jurist, he contributed during the Constituent Assembly to the organization of the judiciary of France. In his report of March 29, 1790, he advocated trial by jury; but failed to introduce the jury system in civil cases.

Duport formed with Barnave and Alexandre de Lameth a group known as the &quot;triumvirate,&quot; which was popular at first. But after the flight of King Louis XVI to Varennes, Duport tried to defend him; as member of the commission charged to question the king, he found excuses, and on July 14, 1791, he opposed the formal accusation. Having separated himself from the Jacobins, he joined the Feuillant party. After the Constituent Assembly, he became president of the criminal tribunal of Paris, but was arrested by Danton during the insurrection of 10 August 1792. He escaped, thanks to evidence provided by Jean-Paul Marat, and fled to Switzerland. He returned to France after the 9th of Thermidor of the year II (27 July 1794), and left it in exile again after the republican &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor of the year V (4 September 1797).

In 1798, Duport died from tuberculosis in Appenzell, Switzerland.

<text>In type theory and programming languages, a type variable is a mathematical variable ranging over types. Even in programming languages that allow mutable variables, a type variable remains an abstraction, in the sense that it does not correspond to some memory locations.

Programming languages that support parametric polymorphism make use of universally quantified type variables. Languages that support existential types make use of existentially quantified type variables. For example, the following OCaml code defines a polymorphic identity function that has a universally quantified type, which is printed by the interpreter on the second line:
# let id x = x;;
val id : &#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;a = &lt;fun&gt;
In mathematical notation, the type of the function codice_1 is formula_1, where formula_2 is a type variable.

<doc id="279703" wikidata="Q289522" url="?curid=279703" title="Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne">
<text>Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne (; 9 October 172719 February 1794) was a French clergyman, bishop, cardinal, politician and finance minister of King Louis XVI.

==Life==
=== Early career ===
He was born in Paris, in the Loménie family from Flavignac, some twenty kilometres from the city of Limoges, in the Limousin region of France, currently part of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Their origins have been traced back there to the 15th century.

The Loménie de Brienne were the junior branch of the Loménie family and had succeeded in implanting themselves into the world of the French royal court over several centuries. They had been ennobled in 1552 when Martial de Loménie became secretary to King Henry II of France, and later acquired the lordship of Versailles (1561–1571). By an advantageous marriage in 1623 the Loménie became counts of Brienne. They continued in high ranking positions in the state, occupying important government posts in foreign affairs under Louis XIV and towards the end of the Ancien régime at the ministry of war. Charles-François de Loménie de Brienne was Bishop of Coutances (1668–1720) and their adopted cousin Pierre-François de Loménie was briefly to be Coadjutor Archbishop of Sens (1789–1794).

A capable student, Étienne-Charles entered the clergy, seeing this as the path to attaining a distinguished position. In 1751 he became a doctor of theology, though there were doubts as to the orthodoxy of his thesis. The same year he was appointed vicar general &quot;(grand vicaire)&quot; to the Cardinal Archbishop of Rouen, Nicolas de Saulx-Tavannes. After visiting Rome, he was made Bishop of Condom on 19 December 1760, and on 21 March 1763 was translated to become Archbishop of Toulouse. In the years 1766 to 1769, he was commendatory Abbot of Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey, and from 1788 commendatory Abbot of Corbie. In 1772, he chaired the &quot;Commission des Réguliers&quot;, set up to suppress religious houses that were in terminal decline.

His many famous friends included A.R.J. Turgot, André Morellet and Voltaire, and in 1770 he was elected to the Académie française. He was three times head of the &quot;bureau de jurisdiction&quot; at the general assembly of the clergy. He also took a lively interest in political and social questions of the day, and addressed to Turgot a number of &quot;memoires&quot; on these subjects, including one on pauperism .

Though some contest the suggestion, Loménie de Brienne has not rarely been regarded as an unbeliever from the outset. In 1781, at the death of the Archbishop of Paris, Christophe de Beaumont, there was a lobby to make Loménie de Brienne his successor, but Louis XVI refused, allegedly exclaiming: ‘The Archbishop of Paris should at least believe in God!&#x27;.

=== Politics ===
In 1787, in the Assembly of Notables, Loménie de Brienne led the opposition to the fiscal policy of Calonne. Close to Queen Marie-Antoinette, Loménie de Brienne was then appointed to succeed him during deliberations by nobles held on 25 May 1787. Once in power, he succeeded in making the &quot;parlement&quot; register edicts dealing with internal free trade, the establishment of provincial assemblies and the redemption of the corvée. In May 1788 the process of tax collection was faulting and the loyalty of the army was slipping. As a result, Louis XVI suspended parlements in May 1788 and created 47 courts. When the &quot;parlement&quot; refused to register edicts on the stamp duty and the proposed new general land-tax, Loménie de Brienne persuaded Louis XVI to hold a &quot;lit de justice&quot; to enforce their registration. The king also agreed to exile the &quot;parlement&quot; to Troyes (18 August 1787) as a further measure to crush opposition. When the &quot;parlement&quot; agreed to prolong the direct tax on all kinds of income, the councillors were recalled to Paris. A further attempt to force the &quot;parlement&quot; to register an edict for raising a loan of 120 million livres met with determined opposition. The struggle of the &quot;parlement&quot; against Loménie de Brienne ended on 8 May in its consenting to an edict for its own abolition, with the proviso that the Estates General should be summoned to remedy the disorders of the state. Loménie de Brienne resigned as finance minister on 25 August 1788.

Loménie de Brienne, who had in the meantime been made Archbishop of Sens (confirmed by Rome on 10 March 1788), now faced almost universal political opposition. He was forced to suspend the &quot;Cour plenière&quot; which had been set up to take the place of the &quot;parlement&quot;, and to promise that the States General should be summoned. Even these concessions were not enough to keep him in power, and on 29 August he had to retire, leaving the treasury empty.

On 14 September 1788 the publicly-hated Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes was finally recalled, and this led to renewed energy on the part of revolutionaries, who began rioting in Paris. Rioters tried to burn down the homes of both Lamoignon and Brienne.

=== Rise and fall ===
On 15 December following, he was made a cardinal, and went to Italy, where he spent two years.

An adopted nephew, Pierre-François de Loménie, was appointed at his request Coadjutor of the diocese in his absence. Étienne-Charles consecrated him. He was to follow his uncle in swearing the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, but along with other members of the family the coadjutor was guillotined on 10 May 1794, having in the meantime repented of his submission.

After the outbreak of the French Revolution Étienne-Charles returned to France, and took the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790, one of the few bishops of the Ancien regime to do so, and he encouraged many of his priests to do the same. Subsequently, he had himself elected constitutional Bishop of the Yonne department. He was repudiated by Pope Pius VI, and in 1791 at the Pope&#x27;s insistence resigned in pique as a cardinal, just in time to avoid being stripped of the dignity.

He bought the former Abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif in the city centre of Sens and had the majestic church, burial place of his predecessors as Archbishop of Sens, demolished, installing himself in the abbot&#x27;s house with members of his family. He had a gift for winning popularity and a section of the local population were his ardent supporters. Nevertheless, the days even of the Constitutional Church were soon done. Though he had refused to ordain constitutional bishops, at the height of the Revolution, on 15 November 1793, he renounced the priesthood, but his past and present conduct made him an object of suspicion to the then prominent revolutionaries. He was arrested at Sens on 18 February 1794, and that same night died in prison, whether from a stroke or by poison, some said by suicide, though the shock of the failure of his bravado and all his frantic efforts at survival would perhaps have been enough to kill him.

== Works ==
The chief works published by Loménie de Brienne are:
* &quot;Oraison funébre du Dauphin&quot; (Paris, 1766)
* &quot;Compte-rendu au roi&quot; (Paris, 1788)
* &quot;Le Conciliateur&quot;, in collaboration with Turgot (Rome, Paris, 1754)

<text>Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (Alexandra Helen Elizabeth Olga Christabel; born 25 December 1936) is a member of the British royal family. The only daughter of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, she is a granddaughter of George V, niece of Edward VIII and George VI, and first cousin of Elizabeth II. Alexandra&#x27;s mother was also a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Elizabeth II, making her both a second cousin and first cousin once removed to Charles III.

Princess Alexandra was married to businessman Sir Angus Ogilvy from 1963 until his death in 2004. At the time of her birth, she was sixth in the line of succession to the British throne; , she is 58th.

==Early life==

Princess Alexandra was born on 25 December 1936 at 3 Belgrave Square, London. Her parents were Prince George, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. She was named after her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Alexandra; her grandmother, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia; and both of her maternal aunts, Countess Elizabeth of Törring-Jettenbach and Princess Olga of Yugoslavia. She received the name Christabel because she was born on Christmas Day, like her aunt Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. Her birth was the last to have the tradition of having the Home Secretary present to verify the birth of potential heirs to the throne. John Simon was present and was the last one to do so.

As a male-line granddaughter of the British monarch, she was styled as a British princess with the prefix &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;. At the time of her birth she was sixth in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her cousins Elizabeth and Margaret, her uncle the Duke of Gloucester, her father the Duke of Kent, and her elder brother Prince Edward. She was born two weeks after the abdication of her uncle King Edward VIII.

Alexandra was baptised in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on 9 February 1937, and her godparents were King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (her paternal uncle and aunt); the Queen of Norway (her great-aunt); Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark (her maternal grandmother); Princess Olga of Yugoslavia (her maternal aunt); the Princess Beatrice (her paternal great-great-aunt); the Earl of Athlone (her paternal great-uncle); and Count Karl Theodor of Törring-Jettenbach (her maternal uncle by marriage). Of her godparents, only the King and Queen and Lord Athlone were present.

Alexandra spent most of her childhood at her family&#x27;s country house, Coppins, in Buckinghamshire. During the Second World War she also lived at Badminton with her widowed grandmother Queen Mary. Her father was killed in an aeroplane crash in Caithness, Scotland, on 25 August 1942, whilst serving in the Royal Air Force. Alexandra has the distinction of being the first British princess to have attended a boarding school, Heathfield School near Ascot. She then studied in Paris. She was also trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

==Marriage and personal life==
On 24 April 1963, she married The Hon. Angus James Bruce Ogilvy (1928–2004), second son of David Ogilvy, 12th Earl of Airlie, and Lady Alexandra Coke, at Westminster Abbey. Ogilvy presented Alexandra with an engagement ring made of a cabochon sapphire set in gold and surrounded by diamonds on both sides. The wedding ceremony was attended by the royal family and was broadcast worldwide on television, watched by an estimated 200 million people.

The bride wore a wedding gown of Valenciennes lace, with matching veil and train, designed by John Cavanagh. She made her way with her brother, the Duke of Kent, from Kensington Palace to the church. The bridesmaids included Princess Anne and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, and the best man was Peregrine Fairfax. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, conducted the service. Angus Ogilvy declined the Queen&#x27;s offer to be created an earl upon marriage, so their children carry no titles.

Angus Ogilvy was knighted in 1988 (when Princess Alexandra assumed the style of The Hon. Lady Ogilvy), later being sworn of the Privy Council in 1997. Princess Alexandra and Angus Ogilvy had two children, James and Marina, and four grandchildren:
* James Robert Bruce Ogilvy (born 29 February 1964 in Thatched House Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey). He married Julia Caroline Rawlinson on 30 July 1988 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Saffron Walden, Essex. The couple have issue:
** Flora Alexandra Vesterberg (born 15 December 1994 in Edinburgh, Scotland). She married Timothy Vesterberg at Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace, on 26 September 2020.
** Alexander Charles Ogilvy (born 12 November 1996 in Edinburgh, Scotland). 
* Marina Victoria Alexandra Ogilvy (born 31 July 1966 in Thatched House Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey). She married Paul Julian Mowatt (Hendon, 28 November 1962) on 2 February 1990; they divorced on 15 October 1997. They have two children:
** Zenouska May Mowatt (born 26 May 1990 in Roehampton, England). Currently works as Head of Marketing for Halcyon Days Ltd.
** Christian Alexander Mowatt (born 4 June 1993 in London, England)

Marina&#x27;s first pregnancy, which was announced in late 1989, caused a controversy as the couple were not married. This resulted in a feud with her parents who suggested she either marry her companion in a shotgun wedding or have an abortion. In an interview with a tabloid at the time, Marina had claimed that her parents had cut off her trust fund and monthly allowance due to their disapproval of her conduct. She also said that she wrote a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, addressing her &quot;Dear Cousin Lilibet&quot;, asking her to intervene in the family dispute. Marina&#x27;s parents denied her allegations and said that they loved her, had not cut her off and that she was welcome at home any time.

==Activities==
Beginning in the late 1950s, Princess Alexandra carried out an extensive programme of engagements in support of the Queen, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Taking part in roughly 120 engagements each year, Princess Alexandra was one of the most active members of the royal family. She made 110 engagements in 2012. However, in late June 2013, she cancelled her engagements due to arthritis. As of 2022, she is still listed as a working member of the royal family, attending numerous ceremonial and charitable engagements.

In 1959, she carried out an extensive tour of Australia, and attended the Queensland Centenary Celebrations. The Alexandra Waltz was composed for this visit by radio announcer Russ Tyson, and television musical director, Clyde Collins. It was sung for the princess by teen-aged Gay Kahler, who later changed her name to Gay Kayler. In 1961, Princess Alexandra visited Hong Kong and made a visit to Aberdeen Fish Market, Lok Ma Chau police station and So Uk Estate, a public housing complex. Princess Alexandra returned to Australia in 1967 for a private holiday, but also carried out engagements in Canberra and Melbourne. The Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane is named in her honour.

Princess Alexandra represented the Queen when Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960, and opened the first Parliament on 3 October. Later overseas tours included visits to Canada, Italy, Oman, Hungary, Norway, Japan, Thailand, Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. Princess Alexandra launched the New Zealand &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate HMNZS &quot;Waikato&quot; at Harland and Wolff, Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1965. Princess Alexandra opened the Victoria-to-Brixton section of London Underground&#x27;s Victoria line on 23 July 1971.

Princess Alexandra opened the new hospital in Harlow, Essex, named in her honour on 27 April 1965. The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust was announced by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, in September 2019 to be part of the government&#x27;s new health infrastructure programme to build a new hospital.

Princess Alexandra served as chancellor of Lancaster University from its foundation in 1964 until she relinquished the post in 2004 (when she also accepted an honorary degree in Music). She also served as the first chancellor of the University of Mauritius. She is also an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, Faculty of Anæsthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Royal College of Physicians. She is also the president of Alexandra Rose Day, which was founded in honour of her great-grandmother, Queen Alexandra. She was also patron of The Royal School, Hampstead. The Princess was president of WWF-UK until 2011.

Until it was abolished in 2013, Princess Alexandra received £225,000 per year from the Civil List to cover the cost of official expenses, although as with the other members of the royal family (except the Duke of Edinburgh) the Queen repaid this amount to HM Treasury. Alexandra lives at Thatched House Lodge in Richmond, London, a Crown property purchased on a 150-year lease from the Crown Estate Commissioners by Angus Ogilvy after their wedding in 1963. She also has use of a grace-and-favour apartment at St James&#x27;s Palace in London.

The Princess is the patron of the Blackie Foundation Trust, a charity dedicated to the promotion of research and education in homoeopathy. She is also a patron of the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals; the English National Opera; the London Philharmonic Choir; the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra; Wigmore Hall; the Florence Nightingale Foundation; the not-for-profit housing association Anchor; the charity Independent Age; St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice in Sydenham, England; Core, a National charity in London dedicated to funding research into digestive diseases and which also publishes information leaflets on the most common diseases of the gut and liver; the Nature in Art Trust; and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), the oldest drama school in the English-speaking world. She has been the patron of the Royal Alexandra Children&#x27;s Hospital in Brighton since 1954 and of Alzheimer&#x27;s Society since 1990. She is also the royal patron of Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB), a charity dedicated to reuniting children who have been separated from their families. She is patron of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, which received its royal style in 2012 during the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. In her role as president of Sightsavers UK, the Princess visited Washington D.C. in October 2016 to attend the Neglected Tropical Diseases NGDO Network conference partnership reception. In November 2016, one month ahead of Alexandra&#x27;s 80th birthday, the Queen held a reception at Buckingham Palace in honour of the work of Alexandra&#x27;s charities.

In May 2023, Alexandra appeared alongside other working members of the royal family in photos in the Throne Room and on Buckingham Palace balcony following the coronation of King Charles III, which she had attended earlier that day. In February 2024, she was seen using a wheelchair at the thanksgiving service for Constantine II of Greece.

<doc id="279707" wikidata="Q348183" url="?curid=279707" title="Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans">
<text>Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (12 May 1725 – 18 November 1785), known as &quot;le Gros&quot; (the Fat), was a French royal of a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. The First Prince of the Blood after 1752, he was the most senior male at the French court after the immediate royal family. He was the father of &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;. He greatly augmented the already huge wealth of the House of Orléans.

==Biography==
Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans was born at the Palace of Versailles on 12 May 1725. As the only son of Louis, Duke of Orléans, and his wife Johanna of Baden-Baden, he was titled Duke of Chartres at birth. He was one of two children; his younger sister Louise Marie d&#x27;Orléans died at Saint-Cloud in 1728 aged a year and eight months. Louis Philippe&#x27;s father, who had been devoted to his wife, became a recluse and pious as he grew older.

Louise Marie was known as &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; in her short lifetime.

Louis Philippe was hardly fifteen when he and his young cousin Princess Henriette of France (1727–1752), the second daughter of King Louis XV and Queen Marie Leszczyńska, fell in love.

After considering the possibility of such a marriage, Louis XV and his chief minister, Cardinal Fleury, decided against it because this union would have brought the House of Orléans too close to the throne.

===First marriage===

In 1743, his paternal grandmother, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon the formidable Dowager Duchess of Orléans, and Louise Élisabeth, Dowager Princess of Conti arranged his marriage to his seventeen-year-old cousin, Louise Henriette de Bourbon (1726–1759), a member of the House of Bourbon-Conti, another cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. It was hoped this marriage would close a fifty-year-old family rift.

Louis Philippe&#x27;s father, &quot;Louis le Pieux&quot;, gave his consent to the union in the belief that because the young bride had been brought up in a convent, she would be a paragon of virtue and as such be an ideal wife for his son. Louise Henriette was the only daughter of Louis Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti and the earlier mentioned Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon. Louise Henriette was a Princess of the Blood (&quot;princesse du sang&quot;) and was known at court as &quot;Mademoiselle de Conti&quot;.

The couple was married on 17 December 1743 in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles.

After a few months of a passion that surprised everyone at court, the couple started to drift apart as the young Duchess of Chartres began to lead a scandalous life. This caused her father-in-law to refuse to recognise the legitimacy of his grandchildren.

The couple had three children:

*A daughter (Château de Saint-Cloud, 12 or 13 July 1745 – 14 December 1745, Château de Saint-Cloud);
*Louis &quot;Philippe&quot; Joseph d&#x27;Orléans (Château de Saint-Cloud, 13 April 1747, – 6 November 1793, &quot;Place de la Révolution&quot;, Paris (executed)), who succeeded his father as Duke of Orléans in 1785,
**Duke of Montpensier at birth,
**Duke of Chartres at the death of his grandfather in 1752,
**Duke of Orléans at the death of his father in 1785,
**known as &quot;Philippe-Égalité&quot; during the French Revolution;
**possible husband for Princess Maria Kunigunde of Saxony (1740–1826), youngest daughter of Augustus III of Poland;
**married Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, &quot;Mademoiselle de Penthièvre&quot;, and was the father of Louis-Philippe King of the French;
*Louise Marie Thérèse &quot;Bathilde&quot; d&#x27;Orléans (Château de Saint-Cloud, 9 July 1750 – 10 January 1822, Paris), the last &quot;princesse de Condé&quot;,
**possible bride for Ferdinand, Duke of Parma,
**married Louis Henry II, Prince of Condé,
**known as &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; at court prior to her marriage,
**known as &quot;Citoyenne Vérité&quot; during the French Revolution.

Because he knew that Louise Henriette was having affairs during her marriage and felt that Louis Philippe was physically incapable of having children, Louise Henriette&#x27;s father-in-law refused to acknowledge any of her children as legitimate.

In 1756, the Swiss physician and advocate for inoculation against smallpox Théodore Tronchin was invited to the court of Louis XV at the request of Louis Philippe, who was in favour of inoculation. Louis Philippe wanted to have both his children inoculated in order to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the methods, but his wife Louise Henriette was against it. However, after Louis Philippe promised not to have the children inoculated without her consent, she agreed to the procedure, and Philippe and Bathilde were inoculated on March 12, 1756. 

===Military achievements and succession as Duke of Orléans===

Serving with the French armies in the War of the Austrian Succession, he distinguished himself in the campaigns of 1742, 1743 and 1744, and at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. After the death of his first wife, he retired to his château at Bagnolet, where he occupied his time with theatrical performances and the society of intellectuals. Louise Henriette accompanied her husband to the field despite being pregnant.

Upon the death of his father in Paris on 4 August 1752, Louis Philippe became Duke of Orléans and head of the House of Orléans. He also became First Prince of the Blood, Duke of Valois, Nemours and Montpensier. His father was buried at the Abbaye-Sainte-Geneviève where he had lived since 1740.

===Étiennette Le Marquis===

After the death of Louise Henriette on 9 February 1759 at the Palais-Royal, the Orléans residence in Paris, Louis Philippe took as his mistress Étiennette Le Marquis, a former dancer who liked to act in comedy plays, and who introduced him into the world of the theater. At that time, the &quot;château de Bagnolet&quot;, which he had inherited from his father, became his favorite residence. Louis Philippe had three children with Étiennette; they were raised under the care of the Orléans family:

*Louis Étienne d&#x27;Orléans, (21 January 1759 – 24 July 1825), Count-abbé of Saint-Phar
*Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, (7 July 1761 – 13 June 1829), Count-abbé of Saint-Albin,
*Marie Étiennette Perrine d&#x27;Auvilliers, (7 July 1761 -), who married François-Constantin, Count of Brossard, a dragoon regiment officer.

In 1769, Louis Philippe sold Bagnolet and bought the Château du Raincy, located less than ten miles east from the center of Paris. The same year, his son Louis Philippe, married Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, heiress to the fortune of her father, the Duke of Penthièvre. Louis Philippe had wanted his son to have a prestigious marriage with the Polish princess Maria Kunigunde, the youngest daughter of Augustus III of Poland and Maria Josepha, Archduchess of Austria. Princess Maria Kunigunde was the sister of the deceased Dauphine of France (1731–1767), mother of Louis XVI.

It was King Louis XV who opposed this marriage on the pretence that the princess was too old for the young Duke of Chartres. This caused the Duke of Penthièvre to ask if the Duke of Orléans if he would allow a union with the Orléans family. Louis Philippe is said to have rejected the idea of his son marrying Mademoiselle de Penthièvre due to her &quot;bastard race&quot;; this is an irony in itself due to Louis Philippe and the Duke of Penthièvre were both descended from two daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

===Second marriage===

In spite of his liaison with Étiennette, Louis Philippe had several other mistresses until he met, in July 1766, Charlotte Jeanne Béraud de La Haye de Riou, &quot;Madame de Montesson&quot;, a witty but married twenty-eight-year-old. After the death of the Marquis of Montesson in 1769, Louis Philippe tried to obtain Louis XV&#x27;s authorisation to marry the young widow. Finally, in December 1772, the King gave his consent on the condition that the Marquise of Montesson would never become Duchess of Orléans or succeed to any other Orléans titles. In addition, the couple was to live a quiet life away from the court. The morganatic marriage took place on 23 April 1773 &quot;dans la plus stricte intimité&quot;. As a wedding gift, the Duke of Orléans gave his new wife the &quot;château de Sainte-Assise&quot; at Seine-Port, in today&#x27;s Seine-et-Marne department of France.

===Later life===

Louis XV had added to the appanage of the House of Orléans the &quot;hôtel de Grand-Ferrare&quot; in Fontainebleau (1740), the county of Soissons (1751), the seigneuries of La Fère, Marle, Ham, Saint-Gobain, the &quot;Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq&quot; and the &quot;hôtel Duplessis-Châtillon&quot; in Paris (1766).

In 1773, Orléans added to his residences a magnificent hôtel built at Chaussée d&#x27;Antin, the new elegant quarter of Paris.

In 1780, Louis Philippe gave his son the Palais-Royal, a gift that was to mark their reconciliation after the rift provoked by the Duke&#x27;s second marriage.

In Sainte-Assise, du Raincy and Paris, the couple received nobles, intellectuals, playwrights, scientists, such as the Duchess of Lauzun, the Countess of Egmont, the Marquis of Lusignan, the Marquis of Osmond, the mathematician d&#x27;Alembert, the German writer Melchior Grimm, the mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon de Laplace, the chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, the composers Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, André Grétry, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and playwright Louis Carrogis Carmontelle. The couple also gave theatrical presentations, some of which were written by the Marquise of Montesson.

In February 1785, upon the insistence of Louis XVI, and with some help from Madame du Barry, the Duke of Orléans sold the magnificent Château de Saint-Cloud, which had been in the Orléans family&#x27;s possession since 1658, to Queen Marie Antoinette, for six million livres, a much reduced price than the original cost. The beautiful château had been ignored after the death of his wife Louise Henriette.

Surrounded by all the members of his immediate family, even his three children by Etiennette Le Marquis, Louis-Philippe died on 18 November 1785, at Sainte-Assise at the age of sixty.

He was buried at the Val-de-Grâce convent in Paris, built by his ancestor Anne of Austria to celebrate the birth of Louis XIV of France, Louis Philippe&#x27;s great grandfather.

<text>Royston is a town and civil parish in the District of North Hertfordshire and county of Hertfordshire in England.

It is situated on the Greenwich Meridian, which brushes the town&#x27;s eastern boundary, and at the northernmost apex of the county on the same latitude as towns such as Milton Keynes and Ipswich. It is about north of central London in a rural area.

Before the boundary changes of the 1890s, the boundary between Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire ran east–west through the centre of town along the middle of Melbourn Street. The town has a population of 17,448 as of 2021.

==History==

The town grew at the crossing of two ancient thoroughfares, Ermine Street and the Icknield Way (cum Ashwell Street); the former was created after the Roman conquest, while the Icknield Way has long been accepted as a prehistoric routeway. The roads are sometimes called military roads as they were prepared or improved by Roman soldiers to facilitate access to the hinterland of Roman Britain. The path of Icknield Way is occupied by the present day A505, which bypasses the town to the north. The A10 follows the alignment of Ermine Street south of the town but diverts before it reaches the crossroads. The A1198, known as the Old North Road follows the alignment of Ermine Street northwards. Barrows on Goffers Knoll and Therfield Heath are evidence of prehistoric settlement.

A cross, variously known as Royse&#x27;s, Rohesia&#x27;s, or Roisia&#x27;s Cross, was erected by the crossroads at an unknown date. It gave the settlement its earliest name of &quot;Crux Roesia&quot; or Roisia&#x27;s Cross. By the 14th century this had become &quot;Roisia&#x27;s Town&quot;, &quot;Roiston&quot; or Royston. A large boulder of red millstone grit, bearing a square socket, supposed to be the base of the cross, has been placed by the cross roads at the northern end of High Street.

Until 1540 Royston was divided between five parishes: Barkway, Reed and Therfield in Hertfordshire and Melbourn and Kneesworth in Cambridgeshire. In that year it became a separate ecclesiastical parish, partly in each county.

Ralph de Rochester founded the Augustinian priory which originated as a chapel for three canons and was later expanded to seven or more regular canons. Royston had two hospitals or free chapels, as well as the monastery.

The hospital of St John and St Thomas was founded for lepers in 1224 by Richard Argentine, Sheriff of Cambridgeshire on the south side of Baldock Street.

The hospital of St Nicholas was situated in the Cambridgeshire side of Royston. It was founded in about 1200 probably by Amphelise, a daughter of Richard the Chamberlain. In 1213 King John granted a fair to celebrate the feast of St Nicholas (8–9 May). The patronage of the hospital descended to Sir Giles Argentine, lord of the manor of Melbourn, who also held the patronage of the other hospital. In the 14th century, St Nicholas&#x27; Hospital was put under the same jurisdiction as that of St John and St Thomas, which were subsequently suppressed in 1547.

The town having lost its monastic charter, the priory site was obtained by Robert Chester, a gentleman of the bedchamber to Henry VIII, who set up a market. Much of the town was given over to inns catering for travellers mainly travelling between London and York. After a visit in 1603, James VI and I decided to build a palace or hunting lodge in the town.

William Cobbett mentions the town (somewhat gloomily) in his &quot;Rural Rides&quot;:

After you quit Ware...the land grows by degrees poorer; the chalk lies nearer and nearer to the surface, till you come to the open common-fields within a few miles of Royston [which] is at the foot of this high poor land; or, rather in a dell, the open side of which looks towards the North. It is a common market town. Not mean, but having nothing of beauty about it... 

Royston had a local bank, called the Royston Bank, from about 1806 to 1896, when it merged into the grouping that became Barclays. It was founded by Edward King Fordham and others, and the business was run by the influential local Fordham family.

A covered Corn Exchange was established on Market Hill 1829.

The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist was severely damaged by a fire that broke out in the early morning of 9 December 2018, with the blaze destroying part of the roof and bell tower. Initially thought to be arson, a police investigation later concluded this not to be the case. The church was reopened in November 2022, almost four years after the fire, with an open day held on 26 November.

=== Royston Palace ===

On 29 April 1603 James VI and I, travelling to Westminster to be crowned as King of England, stayed overnight at the Chester residence. His grandmother Mary of Guise had stayed there in 1551. Attracted by the suitability of the area for hunting, James hired the house for a year. In 1604 he decided to create a royal hunting lodge in the town by demolishing the &quot;Cock&quot; and &quot;Greyhound&quot; inns. The king&#x27;s lodgings were completed in 1607 and were described in 1652 as &quot;all of brick well-tiled double-built, in length 78 ft., breadth 43 ft., height from eaves to ground 24 ft., thickness of walls 24 inches.&quot; The buildings were never big enough to cater for a full court, but provided a suitable spot for hunting, near enough to London for convenience and far enough away to deter intrusion. King James ordered a strict prohibition on anyone taking game from within of Royston, and an elaborate infrastructure was established to support him in the pursuit of his sport. He returned almost every year to hunt and shoot.

Queen Anne and Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, visited the town once, in 1611–1612. The next year, the queen opposed the marriage of her daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, but the king came to Royston with the Earl of Rochester to negotiate the dowry, and a marriage contract was signed there. Following the marriage, celebrated on St Valentine&#x27;s Day 1613, the king, Prince Charles, and Frederick came to stay at Royston.

James&#x27;s successor, King Charles I, visited Royston less often than his father. In June 1647, during the English Civil Wars, Charles was brought through the town as a prisoner of the Parliamentary army. After Charles&#x27;s execution, the royal buildings fell into disrepair. The Crown sold its last interests in the town in 1866.

==Governance==
Royston has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district and county level.

===Town council===
Royston Town Council was formed in 1974 as the successor parish to Royston Urban District Council. The council consists of fifteen councillors headed by a town mayor. The councillors are elected for three wards named Heath, Meridian and Palace. Among the town council&#x27;s responsibilities are allotments, Royston Cave, Royston Museum, local festivals, public halls and the town&#x27;s war memorial. 
In December 2007 Royston Town Council was awarded the nationally recognised status of Quality Town Council. This Award confirms that Royston Town Council is run in accordance with the high standards required by the National Association of Local Councils and other government bodies.

The town council uses the coat of arms granted to the urban district council in 1952. The blazon of the arms is:&quot;Argent a fesse gules thereon another chequy of the first and sable in chief two Tudor roses barbed and seeded and in the base a stag trippant the whole surmounting an archiepiscopal staff, all proper. And for a crest on a wreath of the colours, perched upon a representation of the Royse Stone, a hooded crow proper.&quot;

The symbols on the shield briefly illustrate the history of the town. The staff is for Royston Priory, the roses for Tudor connections, while James I is represented by the checky fesse of the Stewarts. The hart represents Hertfordshire. The crest depicts a hooded crow, known within the region as a &quot;Royston crow&quot;. He stands on the &quot;Royce Stone&quot; in the town centre.

Since 2009, the town has had a Business Improvement District (BID), branded Royston First.

===District council===
Since 1974 Royston has formed part of the non-metropolitan district of North Hertfordshire. The council is based at Letchworth, and also includes the towns of Baldock and Hitchin. There are 49 district councillors elected for 24 wards. The three wards of Royston Heath, Royston Meridian and Royston Palace return two councillors each. As of 2023, three councillors are members of the Liberal Democrats, two are members of the Labour Party and one is a member of the Conservative Party.

===County council===
Hertfordshire County Council has 78 councillors, of which two are elected for Royston and the surrounding area. One of the current councillors (as of 2023) is a member of the majority Conservative group whilst the other is a member of the Liberal Democrat group.

===Administrative history===
The parish of Royston was created in 1540 from parts of the parishes of Barkway, Reed and Therfield in Hertfordshire and Melbourn and Kneesworth in Cambridgeshire. The county boundary was not changed at that time, so the new parish straddled Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire.

In 1835 the Royston Poor Law Union was created, covering a number of parishes in Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Essex. A workhouse was built on Baldock Road in Royston, opening in 1836. Under the Public Health Acts of 1872 and 1875 the board of guardians of the poor law union was given public health and local government responsibilities for the area, which was thereafter also called the Royston Rural Sanitary District. In 1878 they applied for powers to create a special drainage district for the town of Royston. By this time the urban area of the town extended beyond the Tudor parish boundaries, and so the special drainage district was drawn to also include parts of the neighbouring parishes of Bassingbourn, Kneesworth, and Melbourn in Cambridgeshire and Therfield in Hertfordshire. The special drainage district came into operation on 16 June 1879.

====Royston Urban District (18971974)====
Under the Local Government Act 1894 rural sanitary districts became rural districts from 28 December 1894. Where rural sanitary districts straddled county boundaries, as Royston Rural Sanitary District did, they were to be split into separate rural districts in each county, unless boundaries were otherwise adjusted. A joint committee of Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire County Councils held inquiries during 1894 trying to reach agreement as to how best to deal with Royston. No solution that would keep the town together could be found that was acceptable to the two county councils. Therefore, when the Local Government Act came into force at the end of the year, Royston parish was split along the county boundary through the middle of the town into a Royston (Hertfordshire) parish and a Royston (Cambridgeshire) parish. 

The Hertfordshire parts of the Royston Rural Sanitary District, including the Royston (Hertfordshire) parish, became the Ashwell Rural District, whilst the Cambridgeshire and Essex parts of the rural sanitary district, including the Royston (Cambridgeshire) parish, became the Melbourn Rural District. The Royston Special Drainage District was likewise split into a North Royston Special Drainage District and a South Royston Special Drainage District, with the two areas being administered by the new rural district councils.

The question of how the town of Royston should be governed took another couple of years to resolve. Competing proposals were put forward from the two county councils, with both Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire wanting the whole town. Eventually, the Local Government Board directed that town should all be placed in Hertfordshire, and on 30 September 1896 the parish of Royston (Cambridgeshire) and the parts of the Cambridgeshire parishes of Bassingbourn, Kneesworth, and Melbourn that were within the North Royston Special Drainage District were transferred to Hertfordshire. As a temporary measure, these areas became the parishes of North Royston, South Bassingbourn, South Kneesworth, and South Melbourn, and were all included within the Ashwell Rural District pending such time as Hertfordshire County Council was able to establish an urban district for the town. 

On 1 October 1897, a year and a day after the county boundary change, an urban district was established for Royston, at which point Royston ceased to be part of the Ashwell Rural District. The new urban district of Royston covered the parishes of Royston, North Royston, South Bassingbourn, South Kneesworth, South Melbourn, and the part of Therfield parish in the South Royston Special Drainage District, in effect giving the new council the same boundaries as the original special drainage district of 1879. The area also became a single parish called Royston, governed by the urban district council.

Royston Urban District Council held its first meeting on 1 October 1897 at the Institute on Melbourn Street. The first chairman of the council was Joseph Phillips, a Conservative, who was also the chairman of the Royston Board of Guardians and the Ashwell Rural District Council. Royston Urban District Council purchased the Institute in 1900, renaming it Royston Town Hall.

A coat of arms was granted to Royston Urban District Council on 19 May 1952.

Royston Urban District Council was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of North Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. Royston Town Council was created on the same day as a successor parish to the former urban district council. The Town Council continues to be based at Royston Town Hall.

==Geography==
The town lies on the northern slopes of the Hertfordshire Chalk Downs. The Greenwich Meridian, which passes through the town, is identified by a signpost on the north side of Newmarket Road.

==Transport==
Royston sits at the junction of the A10 and A505 roads, both of which are important road links through Hertfordshire and beyond. The town is also convenient for fast links to London and the north, as it is only a short distance from both the A1(M) and M11 motorways.

Nearby air transport links include Luton Airport and Stansted Airport, both of which are major air hubs in the South of England.

Royston railway station provides direct commuter links to both London Kings Cross and Cambridge railway station. It is on the Cambridge Line and is a stopping point for regular services operated by Govia Thameslink Railway.

A new rail crossing for pedestrians and cyclists was opened in 2012. The £3.25 million subway links the northern part of the town with the leisure centre and the main complex of schools at the &#x27;Coombes Hole&#x27; allotment gardens area. In 2007 the scheme became one of 79 Sustrans Connect2 projects to receive Big Lottery funding.

==Landmarks==

The public open space and nature reserve of Therfield Heath (also known as Royston Heath) overlooks the town from a hill to the south-west. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its journey of from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk.

In 1742 a strange cave carved out of the chalk was discovered in the centre of Royston. Royston Cave is located underneath the central crossroads of the town. The carvings in the cave have led to much speculation about the origin and function of the cave.

==Popular culture==
Royston Arts Festival was revived in 2007 and now runs annually around the last week of September or the first week of October. Royston Town Band is a brass band that was founded in the mid-19th century as the Royston Volunteer Band. The band celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014.

The &quot;Battle of Royston&quot; was a fictional battle in William Le Queux&#x27; &quot;The Invasion of 1910&quot;. The book describes how a German Army invades England through East Anglia and marches on London. Royston is where a battle takes place which fails to halt their advance.

In the 1965 fictional children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, one eccentric puppet character who was involved in a rescue mission was called Deborah the Duchess of Royston. The episode was called &quot;The Duchess Assignment&quot;.

Royston was the home town of writer Geoff McQueen who devised the 1980s TV series The Bill. The fictional home station Sun Hill was named after the Royston street of the same name. 

Royston is a named location toward the end of the novel About a Boy, but is not named in the film adaptation.

Royston is the hometown of Dr. Sharon on Ted Lasso.

<text>Mechanical ventilation or assisted ventilation is the medical term for using a ventilator machine to fully or partially provide artificial ventilation. Mechanical ventilation helps move air into and out of the lungs, with the main goal of helping the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. Mechanical ventilation is used for many reasons, including to protect the airway due to mechanical or neurologic cause, to ensure adequate oxygenation, or to remove excess carbon dioxide from the lungs. Various healthcare providers are involved with the use of mechanical ventilation and people who require ventilators are typically monitored in an intensive care unit.

Mechanical ventilation is termed invasive if it involves an instrument to create an airway that is placed inside the trachea. This is done through an endotracheal tube or nasotracheal tube. For non-invasive ventilation in people who are conscious, face or nasal masks are used. The two main types of mechanical ventilation include positive pressure ventilation where air is pushed into the lungs through the airways, and negative pressure ventilation where air is pulled into the lungs. There are many specific modes of mechanical ventilation, and their nomenclature has been revised over the decades as the technology has continually developed.

== History ==

The Greek physician Galen may have been the first to describe mechanical ventilation: &quot;If you take a dead animal and blow air through its larynx [through a reed], you will fill its bronchi and watch its lungs attain the greatest distention.&quot; In the 1600s, Robert Hooke conducted experiments on dogs to demonstrate this concept. Vesalius too describes ventilation by inserting a reed or cane into the trachea of animals. These experiments predate the discovery of oxygen and its role in respiration. In 1908, George Poe demonstrated his mechanical respirator by asphyxiating dogs and seemingly bringing them back to life. These experiments all demonstrate positive pressure ventilation.

To achieve negative pressure ventilation, there must be a sub-atmospheric pressure to draw air into the lungs. This was first achieved in the late 19th century when John Dalziel and Alfred Jones independently developed tank ventilators, in which ventilation was achieved by placing a patient inside a box that enclosed the body in a box with sub-atmospheric pressures. This machine came to be known colloquially as the Iron lung, which went through many iterations of development. The use of the iron lung became widespread during the polio epidemic of the 1900s.

Early ventilators were control style with no support breaths integrated into them and were limited to an inspiration to expiration ratio of 1:1. In the 1970s, intermittent mandatory ventilation was introduced as well as synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. These styles of ventilation had control breaths that patients could breathe between.

==Uses==
Mechanical ventilation is indicated when a patient&#x27;s spontaneous breathing is inadequate to maintain life. It may be indicated in anticipation of imminent respiratory failure, acute respiratory failure, acute hypoxemia, or prophylactically. Because mechanical ventilation serves only to provide assistance for breathing and does not cure a disease, the patient&#x27;s underlying condition should be identified and treated in order to liberate them from the ventilator.

Common specific medical indications for mechanical ventilation include:

* Surgical procedures
* Acute lung injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), trauma, or COVID-19
* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary hemorrhage
* Apnea with respiratory arrest
* Hypoxemia
* Acute severe asthma requiring intubation
* Obstruction, such as a tumor
* Acid/base derangements such as respiratory acidosis
* Neurological diseases such as muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Guillain–Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis including transient neonatal myasthenia gravis, etc.
* Newborn premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
* Respiratory failure due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles caused by botulism

Mechanical ventilation is typically used as a short-term measure. It may, however, be used at home or in a nursing or rehabilitation institution for patients that have chronic illnesses that require long-term ventilatory assistance.

==Risks and complications==
Mechanical ventilation is often a life-saving intervention, but carries potential complications. A common complication of positive pressure ventilation stemming directly from the ventilator settings include volutrauma and barotrauma. Others include pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoperitoneum. Another well-documented complication is ventilator-associated lung injury which presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other complications include diaphragm atrophy, decreased cardiac output, and oxygen toxicity. One of the primary complications that presents in patients mechanically ventilated is acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS are recognized as significant contributors to patient morbidity and mortality.

In many healthcare systems, prolonged ventilation as part of intensive care is a limited resource. For this reason, decisions to commence and remove ventilation may raise ethical debate and often involve legal orders such as do-not-resuscitate orders.

Mechanical ventilation is often associated with many painful procedures and the ventilation itself can be uncomfortable. For infants who require opioids for pain, the potential side effects of opioids include problems with feeding, gastric and intestinal mobility problems, the potential for opioid dependence, and opioid tolerance.

=== Withdrawal from mechanical ventilation ===
Timing of withdrawal from mechanical ventilation—also known as weaning—is an important consideration. People who require mechanical ventilation should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal if they are able to support their own ventilation and oxygenation, and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.

The Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI, the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT), previously referred to as the &quot;Yang Tobin Index&quot; or &quot;Tobin Index&quot; after Dr. Karl Yang and Prof. Martin J. Tobin of Loyola University Medical Center) is one of the best studied and most commonly used weaning predictors, with no other predictor having been shown to be superior. It was described in a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients which found that a RSBI &gt; 105 breaths/min/L was associated with weaning failure, while a RSBI &lt; 105 breaths/min/L.

Spontaneous breathing trials are conducted to assess the likelihood of a patient being able to maintain stability and breath on their own without the ventilator. This is done by changing the mode to one where they have to trigger breaths and ventilatory support is only given to compensate for the added resistance of the endotracheal tube.

A cuff leak test is done to detect if there is airway edema to show the chances of post-extubation stridor. This is done by deflating to the cuff to check if air begins leaking around the endotracheal tube.

== Physiology ==
The function of the lungs is to provide gas exchange via oxygenation and ventilation. This phenomenon of respiration involves the physiologic concepts of air flow, tidal volume, compliance, resistance, and dead space. Other relevant concepts include alveolar ventilation, arterial PaCO2, alveolar volume, and FiO2. Alveolar ventilation is the amount of gas per unit of time that reaches the alveoli and becomes involved in gas exchange. PaCO2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide of arterial blood, which determines how well carbon dioxide is able to move out of the body. Alveolar volume is the volume of air entering and leaving the alveoli per minute. Mechanical dead space is another important parameter in ventilator design and function, and is defined as the volume of gas breathed again as the result of use in a mechanical device.

Due to the anatomy of the human pharynx, larynx, and esophagus and the circumstances for which ventilation is needed, additional measures are required to secure the airway during positive-pressure ventilation in order to allow unimpeded passage of air into the trachea and avoid air passing into the esophagus and stomach. The common method is by insertion of a tube into the trachea. Intubation, which provides a clear route for the air can be either an endotracheal tube, inserted through the natural openings of mouth or nose, or a tracheostomy inserted through an artificial opening in the neck. In other circumstances simple airway maneuvers, an oropharyngeal airway or laryngeal mask airway may be employed. If non-invasive ventilation or negative-pressure ventilation is used, then an airway adjunct is not needed.

Pain medicine such as opioids are sometimes used in adults and infants who require mechanical ventilation. For preterm or full term infants who require mechanical ventilation, there is no strong evidence to prescribe opioids or sedation routinely for these procedures, however, some select infants requiring mechanical ventilation may require pain medicine such as opioids. It is not clear if clonidine is safe or effective to be used as a sedative for preterm and full term infants who require mechanical ventilation.

When 100% oxygen (1.00 Fi) is used initially for an adult, it is easy to calculate the next Fi to be used, and easy to estimate the shunt fraction. The estimated shunt fraction refers to the amount of oxygen not being absorbed into the circulation. In normal physiology, gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs at the level of the alveoli in the lungs. The existence of a shunt refers to any process that hinders this gas exchange, leading to wasted oxygen inspired and the flow of un-oxygenated blood back to the left heart, which ultimately supplies the rest of the body with de-oxygenated blood. When using 100% oxygen, the degree of shunting is estimated as 700 mmHg - measured Pa. For each difference of 100 mmHg, the shunt is 5%. A shunt of more than 25% should prompt a search for the cause of this hypoxemia, such as mainstem intubation or pneumothorax, and should be treated accordingly. If such complications are not present, other causes must be sought after, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be used to treat this intrapulmonary shunt. Other such causes of a shunt include:

* alveolar collapse from major atelectasis
* alveolar collection of material other than gas, such as pus from pneumonia, water and protein from acute respiratory distress syndrome, water from congestive heart failure, or blood from hemorrhage

== Technique ==
=== Modes ===
Mechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation, referred to as the mode. Modes come in many different delivery concepts, but all conventional positive pressure ventilators modes fall into one of two categories:volume-cycled or pressure-cycled. A relatively new ventilation mode is flow-controlled ventilation (FCV). FCV is a fully dynamic mode without significant periods of &#x27;no flow&#x27;. It is based on creating a stable gas flow into or out of the patient&#x27;s lungs to generate an inspiration or expiration, respectively. This results in linear increases and decreases in intratracheal pressure. In contrast the conventional modes of ventilation, there are no abrupt drop intrathoracic pressure drops, because of the controlled expiration. Further, this mode allows to use thin endotracheal tubes (~2 – 10 mm inner diameter) to ventilate a patient as expiration is actively supported. In general, the selection of which mode of mechanical ventilation to use for a given patient is based on the familiarity of clinicians with modes and the equipment availability at a particular institution.
== Types of Ventilation ==

=== Positive pressure ===
The design of the modern positive-pressure ventilators were based mainly on technical developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such ventilators replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure ventilators rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and was the beginning of modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a tracheostomy tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure ventilators became increasingly popular.

Positive-pressure ventilators work by increasing the patient&#x27;s airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator breath is terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the tidal volume — the breath-out through passive exhalation.

=== Negative pressure ===
Negative pressure mechanical ventilators are produced in small, field-type and larger formats. The prominent design of the smaller devices is known as the cuirass, a shell-like unit used to create negative pressure only to the chest using a combination of a fitting shell and a soft bladder. In recent years this device has been manufactured using various-sized polycarbonate shells with multiple seals, and a high-pressure oscillation pump in order to carry out biphasic cuirass ventilation. Its main use has been in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. The latter, larger formats are in use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in England such as St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London and the John Radcliffe in Oxford.

The larger units have their origin in the iron lung, also known as the Drinker and Shaw tank, which was developed in 1928 by J.H Emerson Company and was one of the first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber gasket so that the patient&#x27;s face (and airway) are exposed to the room air. While the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by diffusion and requires no external work, air must be moved into and out of the lungs to make it available to the gas exchange process. In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the pleural cavity by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the thorax generates a flow of air. In the iron lung by means of a pump, the air is withdrawn mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure. This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs. As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic recoil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation. However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.

Some of the problems with the full body design were such as being unable to control the inspiratory to expiratory ratio and the flow rate. This design also caused blood pooling in the legs.

=== Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator ===
Another type is the &quot;intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator&quot; that applies pressure externally via an inflated bladder, forcing exhalation, sometimes termed exsufflation. The first such apparatus was the Bragg-Paul Pulsator. The name of one such device, the Pneumobelt made by Puritan Bennett has to a degree become a generic name for the type.

=== Oscillator ===

The most commonly used high frequency ventilator and only one approved in the United States is the 3100A from Vyaire Medical. It works by using very small tidal volumes by setting amplitude and a high rate set in hertz. This type of ventilation is primarily used in neonates and pediatric patients who are failing conventional ventilation.

=== High Frequency Jet Ventilation ===
The first type of high frequency ventilator made for neonates and the only jet type is made by Bunnell Incorporated. It works in conjunction with a separate CMV ventilator to add pulses of air to the control breaths and PEEP.

== Monitoring ==
One of the main reasons why a patient is admitted to an ICU is for delivery of mechanical ventilation. Monitoring a patient in mechanical ventilation has many clinical applications: Enhance understanding of pathophysiology, aid with diagnosis, guide patient management, avoid complications, and assess trends.

In ventilated patients, pulse oximetry is commonly used when titrating FIO2. A reliable target of Spo2 is greater than 95%.

The total PEEP in the patient can be determined by doing an expiratory hold on the ventilator. If this is higher than the set PEEP, this indicates air trapping.

The plateau pressure can be found by doing an inspiratory hold. This shows the actual pressure the patient&#x27;s lungs are experiencing.

Loops can be used to see what is occurring in the patient&#x27;s lungs. These include flow-volume and pressure-volume loops. They can show changes in compliance and resistance.

Functional Residual Capacity can be determined when using the GE Carestation.

Modern ventilators have advanced monitoring tools. There are also monitors that work independently of the ventilator which allow for measuring patients after the ventilator has been removed, such as a Tracheal tube test.

== Types of ventilators ==

Ventilators come in many different styles and method of giving a breath to sustain life. There are manual ventilators such as bag valve masks and anesthesia bags that require the users to hold the ventilator to the face or to an artificial airway and maintain breaths with their hands. Mechanical ventilators are ventilators not requiring operator effort and are typically computer-controlled or pneumatic-controlled. Mechanical ventilators typically require power by a battery or a wall outlet (DC or AC) though some ventilators work on a pneumatic system not requiring power. There are a variety of technologies available for ventilation, falling into two main (and then lesser categories), the two being the older technology of negative-pressure mechanisms, and the more common positive-pressure types.

Common positive-pressure mechanical ventilators include:
#Transport ventilators—These ventilators are small and more rugged, and can be powered pneumatically or via AC or DC power sources.
#Intensive-care ventilators—These ventilators are larger and usually run on AC power (though virtually all contain a battery to facilitate intra-facility transport and as a back-up in the event of a power failure). This style of ventilator often provides greater control of a wide variety of ventilation parameters (such as inspiratory rise time). Many ICU ventilators also incorporate graphics to provide visual feedback of each breath.
#Neonatal ventilators (bubble CPAP, HFJV, HFOV)—Designed with the preterm neonate in mind, these are a specialized subset of ICU ventilators that are designed to deliver smaller volumes and pressures to these patients. These may be conventional or high frequency types.
#Positive airway pressure ventilators (PAP) — These ventilators are specifically designed for non-invasive ventilation. This includes ventilators for use at home for treatment of chronic conditions such as sleep apnea or COPD and in the ICU setting.

== Breath delivery mechanisms ==

=== Trigger ===
The trigger, either flow or pressure, is what causes a breath to be delivered by a mechanical ventilator. Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or based on the set respiratory rate.

=== Cycle ===
The cycle is what causes the breath to transition from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase. Breaths may be cycled by a mechanical ventilator when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached.

=== Limit ===
Limit is how the breath is controlled. Breaths may be limited to a set maximum pressure or volume.

=== Breath exhalation ===
Exhalation in mechanical ventilation is almost always completely passive. The ventilator&#x27;s expiratory valve is opened, and expiratory flow is allowed until the baseline pressure (PEEP) is reached. Expiratory flow is determined by patient factors such as compliance and resistance.

==Artificial airways as a connection to the ventilator==
There are various procedures and mechanical devices that provide protection against airway collapse, air leakage, and aspiration:
* Face mask — In resuscitation and for minor procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient to achieve a seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or by the use of &quot;nasopharyngeal&quot; or &quot;oropharyngeal airway&quot;. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the pharynx through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients. A full-face mask does not, however, provide protection against aspiration. Non-invasive ventilation can be considered for epidemics of COVID-19 where sufficient invasive ventilation capacity is not available (or in some milder cases), but pressurized protection suits for caregivers are recommended due to the risks of poorly fitting masks emitting contaminating aerosols.
* Tracheal intubation is often performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the trachea. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.
* Supraglottic airway — a supraglottic airway (SGA) is any airway device that is seated above and outside the trachea, as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. Most devices work via masks or cuffs that inflate to isolate the trachea for oxygen delivery. Newer devices feature esophageal ports for suctioning or ports for tube exchange to allow intubation. Supraglottic airways differ primarily from tracheal intubation in that they do not prevent aspiration. After the introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in 1998, supraglottic airway devices have become mainstream in both elective and emergency anesthesia. There are many types of SGAs available including the esophageal-tracheal combitube (ETC), laryngeal tube (LT), and the obsolete esophageal obturator airway (EOA).
*Cricothyrotomy — Patients requiring emergency airway management, in whom tracheal intubation has been unsuccessful, may require an airway inserted through a surgical opening in the cricothyroid membrane. This is similar to a tracheostomy but a cricothyrotomy is reserved for emergency access.
* Tracheostomy — When patients require mechanical ventilation for several weeks, a tracheostomy may provide the most suitable access to the trachea. A tracheostomy is a surgically created passage into the trachea. Tracheostomy tubes are well tolerated and often do not necessitate any use of sedative drugs. Tracheostomy tubes may be inserted early during treatment in patients with pre-existing severe respiratory disease, or in any patient expected to be difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, i.e., patients with little muscular reserve.
* &quot;Mouthpiece&quot; — Less common interface, does not provide protection against aspiration. There are lipseal mouthpieces with flanges to help hold them in place if patient is unable.

<doc id="279712" wikidata="Q180344" url="?curid=279712" title="Oceania Football Confederation">
<text>The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) is one of the six continental confederations of international association football. The OFC has 13 members, 11 of which are full members and two which are associate members not affiliated with FIFA. It promotes the game in Oceania and allows the member nations to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.

OFC is predominantly made up of island nations where association football is not the most popular sport, with low GDP and low population meaning very little money is generated by the OFC nations. The OFC has little influence in the wider football world, either in terms of international competition or as a source of players for high-profile club competitions. OFC is the only confederation to have not had at least one international title, the best result being Australia making the final of the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup.

In 2006, the OFC&#x27;s then largest and most successful nation, Australia, left for a second time to join the Asian Football Confederation, leaving New Zealand as the largest federation within the OFC.

The President of OFC is Lambert Maltock since April 2018. The Vice Presidents are Thierry Ariiotima, Kapi Natto John and Lord Ve&#x27;ehala while Franck Castillo is the General Secretary. The confederation is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand.

==History==
The confederation formed in 1966 with the purpose of representing countries in the Pacific, following Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s failed attempts to join the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The idea of forming a Pacific confederation was first raised in 1964. This proposal was pushed by Sid Guppy of the New Zealand Football Association (NZFA), Jim Bayutti of the Australian Soccer Federation and then-FIFA president Stanley Rous, with Guppy and Bayutti both being spurred on by the AFC&#x27;s rejections. After initial discussions were held in Tokyo in 1964, Scottish-born Charles Dempsey was approached by the NZFA to work with Bayutti in putting together the bid to create the Oceania Football Confederation. The two garnered enough support for their bid to be approved by FIFA&#x27;s congress in 1966. The founding OFC members were the following:
* the Australian Soccer Federation (subsequently rebranded Football Australia in 2005)
* New Zealand Football Association (also known as New Zealand Soccer: subsequently rebranded New Zealand Football)
* the Fiji Football Association
* the Papua New Guinea Football Association

Representatives from New Caledonia were also involved in the 1966 OFC founding, but New Caledonia could only be a provisional member, as the territory did not have sporting autonomy from France at that time.

Australia resigned as an OFC member in 1972 to again pursue membership with the AFC, but rejoined the OFC in 1978, and were never official members of the AFC during the 1970s. After the 1972 departure from the OFC, Lou Gautier of Australian publication &quot;Soccer World&quot; said, &quot;[we] have contended from the very start that the conception of an Oceania Confederation was a pipe dream, with no tangible advantages for Australian soccer.&quot; Bayutti resigned from the OFC in 1970, in preparation for Australia&#x27;s planned move to the AFC, with Charles Dempsey being appointed OFC acting secretary as a result. Dempsey also served as the head of the New Zealand national body. Dempsey remained the OFC acting secretary for the next ten years, and he was eventually elected president in 1982. Previous presidents included New Zealanders William Walkley and Jack Cowie, and Australians Vic Tuting and Arthur George. Dempsey served as president until 2000, and he convinced smaller Pacific states to join the confederation, including Samoa (in 1986), Vanuatu (in 1988), Tahiti (in 1990), Tonga and the Cook Islands (both in 1994) and American Samoa (in 1998). Dempsey is currently the last OFC president to have been based in either New Zealand or Australia, with all subsequent presidents having emerged from other countries in the Pacific.

Australia&#x27;s men&#x27;s national team (nicknamed the Socceroos) became the first representatives from the area to play at a FIFA World Cup in 1974, being drawn in the same group as Chile, East Germany and West Germany. They failed to score a goal, but were still competitive in all three of their matches. New Zealand&#x27;s national team the All Whites played in their first World Cup eight years later. At the 1982 tournament they suffered heavier defeats than Australia previously had.

From the 1960s to the early 1980s, OFC countries competed alongside AFC nations in various different mixed World Cup qualifying tournaments. It was not until the 1986 qualifiers that the OFC had their own distinct qualifying tournament. Chinese Taipei was an OFC member from 1975 to 1989. The island state is geographically situated in the north Pacific, off the coast of China, but was a member for political reasons, later joining the AFC. Israel (who were never a member) competed in the 1986 and 1990 OFC World Cup qualifiers for similar political reasons, despite not being located in the Pacific Basin. Australia lost several inter-confederation World Cup playoffs throughout the 1980s and 1990s; first to Scotland in 1985, then Argentina in 1993 and then Iran in 1997. The only time Australia didn&#x27;t reach the inter-confederation playoff during this period was in 1989, when Israel qualified ahead of Australia in the second round of OFC qualifiers, eventually losing to Colombia. The closest of the Australian defeats in the inter-confederation playoffs came against Iran in 1997. Australia were leading 3-1 on aggregate late during the second leg in Melbourne, but their momentum was interrupted when serial pitch invader Peter Hore entered the ground. They went on to concede two goals in quick succession, failing to qualify on the away goals rule. FIFA confirmed OFC as a full confederation in 1996, and granted it a seat on the FIFA executive. In 1998 the OFC unveiled a new logo and an official magazine, entitled &quot;The Wave&quot;.

Australia&#x27;s national team were long considered the biggest challenge in the confederation. There were many highly uncompetitive matches involving them, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s. Their June 1997 second round qualification games for the 1998 FIFA World Cup included a 13–0 defeat of the Solomon Islands. The following year they defeated the Cook Islands 16–0 at the 1998 OFC Nations Cup, while at the 2000 OFC Nations Cup they defeated them 17–0. Australia&#x27;s dominance extended to women&#x27;s competitions as well. For example, at the 1998 OFC Women&#x27;s Championship, their women&#x27;s team The Matildas defeated Fiji 17-0 and American Samoa 21-0. The uncompetitive results escalated in April 2001, during the first round of OFC qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Australia beat Tonga 22–0, following this result up with a 31–0 win over American Samoa and an 11–0 win over Samoa. The American Samoa game became the largest international victory in the history of the sport (breaking the previous record set in the Tonga game), while Archie Thompson also broke the record for most goals in an international match, scoring 13.

Australia&#x27;s record-breaking form in the early stages of qualifying ultimately couldn&#x27;t be replicated in their inter-confederation playoff against Uruguay later that year. For the first leg, the Socceroos managed to defeat the South Americans 1–0 in front of a Melbourne crowd of 84,656, but they were overwhelmed 3–0 in the away leg. The away leg was marred by an incident at Montevideo&#x27;s airport prior to the game itself, where the Australian players were spat on, punched and abused by a mob of Uruguayan fans. On 24 May 2004, New Caledonia became the 12th member of the OFC.

Australia reached another inter-confederation playoff against Uruguay in late 2005. As well as in 2001, both sides won a game each over the two legs, which led to Australia finally ending their World Cup drought through a dramatic penalty shootout in Sydney. The Socceroos were granted increased security for the first away leg, as a response to the 2001 airport incident, and in the second leg the Uruguayan team were heavily booed while their national anthem played. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Australia were eliminated by eventual champions Italy during the Round of 16. Their 3–1 group stage victory against Japan remains the only time a team representing OFC has won at the tournament. Australia left the OFC again that same year and joined the Asian Football Confederation. The AFC deal had been struck in June 2005, before Australia beat Uruguay to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. The deal came into effect on January 1st, 2006, although Australia were still officially representing the OFC at that year&#x27;s World Cup. Once Australia joined the AFC in 2006, they began an unsuccessful bid for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and the fact that the south Pacific area had never hosted the World Cup was one of the bid&#x27;s selling points. Australian football chief John O&#x27;Neill said in July 2006, &quot;the one part of the world that&#x27;s never hosted the World Cup, after South Africa has hosted in 2010, is the Pacific Basin. We belong to Asia now but we&#x27;re also part of the Pacific, and I think the equity issue about the Pacific region not having hosted should be in our favor.&quot; Australia and New Zealand would later co-host the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup together, despite being members of two separate confederations at the time.

In 2008, an associate member, the Northern Mariana Islands Football Association, also left the OFC and in 2009 joined the AFC as an associate member. In late 2009, the Palau Football Association, geographically a part of Oceania but with no official ties to the OFC, also applied for the same status with the AFC as the Northern Mariana Islands association but was not successful. New Zealand ended their own World Cup drought in 2009 when they defeated Bahrain to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The tournament coincidentally also featured Australia, who were now representing the AFC. New Zealand were the only unbeaten team at the tournament, despite failing to advance past the group stage. With Australia&#x27;s absence, New Zealand began having a regular presence in World Cup inter-confederation playoffs. They were convincingly defeated by Mexico over two legs in 2013, and narrowly missed out to Peru in 2017 and Costa Rica in 2022.

==Criticism==
Throughout its history, there have been numerous calls to either merge the OFC and AFC, or dissolve the OFC and have its members join the AFC, in order to form an Asia-Pacific Football Confederation.

The calls grew louder in 2003 when FIFA reversed a decision to grant Oceania an automatic spot at the World Cup. Australia&#x27;s lack of World Cup participation prior to 2006 has been blamed by many on the OFC qualification process, with football writer Matthew Hall stating in 2003, &quot;For World Cup qualification, the Socceroos will win games by cricket scores and then face a sudden-death play-off against a desperate, battle-hardened opponent given a second, or even third, life.&quot; A major reason for Australia&#x27;s 2006 switch to the AFC was the unpredictable nature of the mandatory inter-confederation playoffs. Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s 1974 and 1982 qualifications both came in qualifying tournaments where OFC teams were competing alongside AFC teams, and didn&#x27;t have a playoff with a team from outside these two confederations. When the OFC was given a separate qualification process for the 1986 World Cup, their teams lost five consecutive inter-confederation playoffs (usually against South American nations), with Australia being involved in four of the five losses. Another reason cited for Australia&#x27;s move was their dominance against the smaller OFC teams, which was causing political tension within the confederation. When announcing Australia&#x27;s move in June 2005, then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter remarked, &quot;the Oceania delegates have thought for many years that Australia was too powerful and blocked the way of the other 11 countries. Now New Zealand, and the Pacific islands at least have a chance. They can go it alone, I am sure it will be a success.&quot;

In 2005, shortly before Australia left the OFC, there was an unsuccessful proposal to merge the AFC and the OFC. The plan was to divide Asia into two distinct confederations. A new Asia-Pacific confederation would have encompassed the OFC nations (including Australia) and AFC nations to the east of India and Bangladesh, or alternatively, to the east of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The Japanese Football Association was said to be keen on the idea of splitting the AFC, but there was resistance from the Middle Eastern countries.

The mandatory inter-confederation playoff for the best performed OFC team was finally abolished with the 2026 World Cup and beyond. Beginning with the qualification for the expanded 2026 tournament, the best performed OFC team is granted an automatic World Cup spot, with the second best being given an inter-confederation playoff spot.

==Member nations==
===Current members===
OFC is made up of 11 full member associations and 2 associate members. Those two are associate members of the OFC, but are not FIFA members.

====Notes====
=== Possible future members ===
*: The Autonomous Region of Bougainville is set to gain full independence from Papua New Guinea by 2027. The president of the Bougainville Football Federation, Justin Helele, expressed the association&#x27;s desire to join FIFA and, presumably, the OFC. FIFA has already begun funding projects in the territory. The Melanesian region has also participated in OFC projects and has received funding from the confederation since at least 2012. That year the OFC began youth football programs. The next year, the OFC helped fund the creation of a football academy in Bougainville.
*: The Federated States of Micronesia were announced as new associate members of the OFC following the 2006 Extraordinary Congress. It is unclear when they were removed from the association. In 2010 the Federated States of Micronesia Football Association submitted an application to the East Asian Football Federation in hopes of taking the steps to join FIFA. However, the application was not successful. In 2017 Englishman Paul Watson who was connected to the association said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s starting to look like Micronesia is best off looking to Oceania rather than Asia. I don&#x27;t see any reason why they shouldn&#x27;t get into OFC within the next year or two, but it&#x27;ll all depend on the people inside the organization.&quot; The FSMFA reformed in 2023 and identified gaining membership in the AFC or OFC and FIFA as a main priority. In a July 2023 interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror,&quot; association President Brian Southwick stated that the goal was to join the OFC because of the level of competition and proximity to other members.
*: The Marshall Islands Soccer Association was created in 2020. The organization&#x27;s goal is to join the regional and world governing bodies &quot;in the coming years.&quot; The association has indicated that the nation may field a first-ever Marshall Islands national soccer team at the 2023 Micronesian Games hosted by the country.
*: Nauru is one of the few fully-sovereign nations that is not a member of FIFA or a regional confederation. The Nauru Soccer Federation has reportedly applied for membership in both the OFC and FIFA but was denied. In 2009 the Nauruan Minister of Sport Rayong Itsimaera indicated that there were challenges preventing them from joining both bodies, presumably the lack of a league system and a preference for Australian rules football by the population. Nauru has been participating in some OFC initiatives since at least 2020. In 2023 the federation was relaunched under the auspices of the Nauru Olympic Committee with the stated purpose of fielding a national team and joining the OFC and FIFA.
*: Niue is a former associate member of the OFC. Following the Niue Island Soccer Association&#x27;s removal from the OFC and its subsequent disbandment in 2021, an OFC official indicated that they were aware of the formation of the new Niue Football Association and encourages its application for associate membership.
*: The Palau Football Association has been a member of the OFC in the past, being announced as a new member at the organization&#x27;s 2006 Extraordinary Congress, alongside the Federated States of Micronesia. In 2009 the association asked to join the East Asian Football Federation, a sub-regional body under the Asian Football Confederation.

Several other sovereign states, associated states, dependencies, and territories in Oceania, including members of the United Nations, have no affiliations to confederations. Some play infrequently while others have been inactive for several years. There are also some which do not have a national team at all.

* (external territory of Australia)
* (overseas territory of the United Kingdom)
* (dependent territory of New Zealand)
* (overseas collectivity of France)
* (external territory of Australia)
* (external territory of Australia)
France&#x27;s eastern Pacific territory of Clipperton Island does not currently have a human population or any infrastructure. The Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific are designated as a special province of Ecuador, and have a small human population, however, they are not represented in Ecuador&#x27;s national leagues. The sport is not known to be played on the U.S. outlying islands in the central Pacific, such as Midway Island and Wake Island, which have primarily served as military bases throughout their history. It has occasionally been played on some of Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands in the far north Pacific, but there has never been an outdoor league, due to the cold weather.

===Former members===

====Note====
* had its men&#x27;s national team enter the OFC qualifying tournaments for the FIFA World Cup in 1986 and 1990 due to political reasons, though it was never an OFC member.

===Non-members===
==== AFC Members ====
Three associations are geographically in Oceania but not affiliated with the OFC but are instead members of the Asian Football Confederation:
* 

Most of the island states off the Pacific coast of Asia (including Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines) had already joined the AFC prior to the formation of the OFC. The island state of Chinese Taipei (also known as Taiwan) was in the OFC throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of Chinese political tensions. It had been affiliated with the AFC prior to the OFC move, and eventually rejoined it.

==== CONIFA Members ====
Three CONIFA members are geographically in Oceania but not affiliated with the OFC nor FIFA as they do not meet membership requirements:
* 
* (unconfirmed membership at CONIFA)

The Juan Fernández Islands in the eastern Pacific are a special territory of Chile and members of Conselho Sul-Americano de Novas Federações de Futebol, which is for teams that are not recognized by CONMEBOL. They also have played games against Chile&#x27;s other special territory of Easter Island, since they are their nearest island group.

===FIFA World Cup===
Oceania has sent representatives to the FIFA World Cup four times: Australia in 1974 and 2006, and New Zealand in 1982 and 2010. Of these, only Australia in 2006 progressed beyond the first round.

The OFC was previously the only FIFA confederation that did not have a guaranteed spot in the World Cup finals. Between 1966 and 1982, OFC teams joined the Asian zone qualification tournament, while from 1986 onwards, the winners of the Oceanian zone qualification tournament had to enter the intercontinental play-offs against teams from other confederations in order to gain a spot in the FIFA World Cup.

Beginning in 2026, the OFC will have a guaranteed spot in the FIFA World Cup for the first time in history, result of the competition&#x27;s expansion from 32 to 48 teams.

<text>Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth (20 October 176018 March 1829) was a French soldier and politician.

==Life==
Alexandre Lameth was born in Paris on 20 October 1760 and was the youngest child of Marie Thérèse de Broglie. His mother was the sister of the Maréchal de Broglie and a favourite of Marie Antoinette. His other two brothers were, Théodore Lameth (1756–1854), who served in the American war, sat in the Legislative Assembly as deputy from the department of Jura, and became maréchal-de-camp; and Charles Malo François Lameth, who was a popular politician and a hero of the American War of Independence. He served in the American War of Independence as a colonel in the Royal Lorraine Regiment under Rochambeau. He was also a Knight of the Order of Malta like his brother Charles Lameth. Like many other veterans from the American War of Independence, and those among the French Patriot Party, Lameth became friends with Thomas Jefferson. His commitment to moderate constitutional and social reform gathered him respect in the eyes of Jefferson, given his idea for a unicameral, influential legislature. Several American newspapers would publish his speeches of what took place during the National Assembly, and his stances on private property, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, etc. Alexandre-Théodore-Victor was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati from France.

Alexandre Lameth, Adrien Duport, and Barnave were brought together in September 1789 for the first time during the first struggles of the Patriot Party. Despite the odds against them, their political ties strengthened and became a profound friendship that lasted through the turmoil. In the Constituent Assembly they formed a &quot;Triumvirate&quot;, which controlled a group of about forty deputies forming the advanced left of the Assembly. He presented a famous report in the Constituent Assembly on the organization of the army, but is better known by his eloquent speech on 28 February 1791, at the Jacobin Club, against Honoré Mirabeau, whose relations with the court were beginning to be suspected, and who was a personal enemy of Lameth. During the next months, as leaders of the Feuillant club, they established their belief that the flight of the King to Varennes was all because of the faulty revolutionary process that prohibited any manner of compromise. They intended to rule out both the Republicans and Democrats, so there would be as much compromise as possible. Their main intention was to end the war as soon as possible while still maintaining the gains of the revolution by passing the Constitution. Their hopes for moderate reform were sullied by the radical turn of the Revolution.
He served in the army as &quot;maréchal-de-camp&quot; under Nicolas Luckner and the Marquis de la Fayette, but was accused of treason on 12 August 1792 for protesting against the Attack on the Tuileries. Once he fled the country, Lameth as well as Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, Bureaux de Pusy, and Latour-Maubourg, former members of the Constituent Assembly, were captured by Austrians. They were held in dungeons for seven years.

After his release, he went into business at Hamburg with his brother Charles and the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, and did not return to France until the Consulate. Under the Empire, he was made prefect successively in several departments, and in 1810 was declared a Baron of the Empire. In 1814, he attached himself to the Bourbons, and under the Restoration was appointed prefect of Somme, deputy for Seine-Inférieure and finally deputy for Seine-et-Oise, in which capacity he was a leader of the Liberal opposition.

He wrote various novels and articles, his two most prominent being: Histoire de l&#x27;Assemblée constituante and Mémoires
publiés avec introduction et notes par Eugène Welvert. In Histoire de l&#x27;Assemblée constituante, he introduced this work by displaying how he did not wish to write a book of biased anecdotes, nor provide a side of the revolution that states he was a main player, even though he was in a position to recall the most prominent events. He wanted to present an accurate, detailed description of the work of the Constituent Assembly.

<text>The cokernel of a linear mapping of vector spaces is the quotient space of the codomain of by the image of . The dimension of the cokernel is called the &quot;corank&quot; of .

Cokernels are dual to the kernels of category theory, hence the name: the kernel is a subobject of the domain (it maps to the domain), while the cokernel is a quotient object of the codomain (it maps from the codomain).

Intuitively, given an equation that one is seeking to solve, the cokernel measures the &quot;constraints&quot; that must satisfy for this equation to have a solution – the obstructions to a solution – while the kernel measures the &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in a solution, if one exists. This is elaborated in intuition, below.

More generally, the cokernel of a morphism in some category (e.g. a homomorphism between groups or a bounded linear operator between Hilbert spaces) is an object and a morphism such that the composition is the zero morphism of the category, and furthermore is universal with respect to this property. Often the map is understood, and itself is called the cokernel of .

In many situations in abstract algebra, such as for abelian groups, vector spaces or modules, the cokernel of the homomorphism is the quotient of by the image of . In topological settings, such as with bounded linear operators between Hilbert spaces, one typically has to take the closure of the image before passing to the quotient.

== Formal definition ==
One can define the cokernel in the general framework of category theory. In order for the definition to make sense the category in question must have zero morphisms. The cokernel of a morphism is defined as the coequalizer of and the zero morphism .

Explicitly, this means the following. The cokernel of is an object together with a morphism such that the diagram

commutes. Moreover, the morphism must be universal for this diagram, i.e. any other such can be obtained by composing with a unique morphism :

As with all universal constructions the cokernel, if it exists, is unique up to a unique isomorphism, or more precisely: if and are two cokernels of , then there exists a unique isomorphism with .

Like all coequalizers, the cokernel is necessarily an epimorphism. Conversely an epimorphism is called &quot;normal&quot; (or &quot;conormal&quot;) if it is the cokernel of some morphism. A category is called &quot;conormal&quot; if every epimorphism is normal (e.g. the category of groups is conormal).

=== Examples ===
In the category of groups, the cokernel of a group homomorphism is the quotient of by the normal closure of the image of . In the case of abelian groups, since every subgroup is normal, the cokernel is just modulo the image of :
:formula_1

=== Special cases ===
In a preadditive category, it makes sense to add and subtract morphisms. In such a category, the coequalizer of two morphisms and (if it exists) is just the cokernel of their difference:

: formula_2

In an abelian category (a special kind of preadditive category) the image and coimage of a morphism are given by
:formula_3

In particular, every abelian category is normal (and conormal as well). That is, every monomorphism can be written as the kernel of some morphism. Specifically, is the kernel of its own cokernel:
:formula_4

==Intuition==
The cokernel can be thought of as the space of &quot;constraints&quot; that an equation must satisfy, as the space of &quot;obstructions&quot;, just as the kernel is the space of &quot;solutions.&quot;

Formally, one may connect the kernel and the cokernel of a map by the exact sequence

:formula_5

These can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation to solve,
* the kernel is the space of &quot;solutions&quot; to the &quot;homogeneous&quot; equation , and its dimension is the number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in solutions to , if they exist;
* the cokernel is the space of &quot;constraints&quot; on &quot;w&quot; that must be satisfied if the equation is to have a solution, and its dimension is the number of independent constraints that must be satisfied for the equation to have a solution.

The dimension of the cokernel plus the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space, as the dimension of the quotient space is simply the dimension of the space &quot;minus&quot; the dimension of the image.

As a simple example, consider the map , given by . Then for an equation to have a solution, we must have (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is , or equivalently, , (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace : the value of is the freedom in a solution. The cokernel may be expressed via the real valued map : given a vector , the value of is the &quot;obstruction&quot; to there being a solution.

Additionally, the cokernel can be thought of as something that &quot;detects&quot; surjections in the same way that the kernel &quot;detects&quot; injections. A map is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial, and a map is surjective if and only if its cokernel is trivial, or in other words, if .

<doc id="279716" wikidata="Q1649757" url="?curid=279716" title="Eileen Blair">
<text>Eileen Maud Blair (née O&#x27;Shaughnessy, 25 September 1905 – 29 March 1945) was a British poet and psychologist, involved in the Spanish Civil War. She was the first wife of George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair). During World War II, she worked for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in London and the Ministry of Food.

She was born in South Shields in the northeast of England. Her mother was Marie O&#x27;Shaughnessy and her father was Lawrence O&#x27;Shaughnessy, a customs collector. She died at the age of 39 during a hysterectomy.

==Education and early life==

O&#x27;Shaughnessy attended Sunderland Church High School. In the autumn of 1924, she entered St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she studied English. In 1927, she received a higher second-class degree. By choice there followed a succession of jobs &#x27;of no special consequence and with no connection from one to the next&#x27;, which she held briefly, and which began with work as an assistant mistress at Silchester House, a girls&#x27; boarding school in Taplow in the Thames valley, and included being a secretary; a reader for the elderly Dame Elizabeth Cadbury; and the proprietor of an office in Victoria Street, London, for typing and secretarial work. When she closed the office, she took up freelance journalism and sold an occasional feature piece to the &quot;Evening News&quot;. She helped her brother, Laurence, a thoracic surgeon, by typing, proofreading, and editing his scientific papers and books.

In the autumn of 1934, Eileen enrolled at University College London for a two-year graduate course in educational psychology, leading to a Master of Arts. Eileen was particularly interested in testing intelligence in children &quot;and quite early decided upon that as the subject for the thesis she would be writing&quot;. Elizaveta Fen (pen name of Lydia Jackson Jiburtovich), a fellow student who became one of O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s closest friends, met her for the first time at University College: &quot;She was twenty-eight years old and looked several years younger. She was tall and slender, her shoulders rather broad and high. She had blue eyes and dark brown, naturally wavy hair. George once said that she had &#x27;a cat&#x27;s face&#x27; – and one could see that this was true in a most attractive sense...&quot;

She was very close to her elder brother Laurence O&#x27;Shaughnessy, a thoracic surgeon, but even so, in a letter she described her brother as &quot;one of nature&#x27;s Fascists&quot;.

==Marriage==

Eileen met Eric Blair in the spring of 1935. At the time Blair was living at 77 Parliament Hill in Hampstead, occupying a spare room in the first floor flat of Rosalind Henschel Obermeyer, a niece of the conductor and composer Sir George Henschel and a friend of Mabel Fierz.

Rosalind Obermeyer was taking an advanced course in psychology at University College London; one evening she invited some of her friends and acquaintances to a party. One &quot;was an attractive young woman whom Rosalind did not know especially well, although they often sat next to each other at lectures: her name was Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy.&quot; In her memoirs, Elizaveta Fen recalled Orwell and his friend and mentor Richard Rees &quot;draped&quot; at the fireplace, looking, she thought, &quot;moth-eaten and prematurely aged.&quot;

Blair and O&#x27;Shaughnessy married the next year, on 9 June 1936, at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wallington, Hertfordshire (as Eric Arthur Blair and Eileen Maud O&#x27;Shaughnessy. At this time he was Orwell only in his writing, his friends knew him as Eric or Blair, and he &quot;never quite got around to changing it&quot;). Blair, though a non-practising member of the Church of England, &quot;was sufficiently a traditionalist to wish to be married in it&quot;. They tried to have children, but Eileen did not become pregnant, and they learned later that Orwell was sterile, as he told Rayner Heppenstall, and as Eileen confided to Elizaveta Fen.

== Spanish Civil War ==
Eileen joined Orwell in Spain in early 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Eileen volunteered for a post in the office of John McNair, the leader of the Independent Labour Party who coordinated the arrival of British volunteers, and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him English tea, chocolate, and cigars.

The small unit of up to 35 volunteers from the British Independent Labour Party or ILP was attached to the very large Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification or POUM. Orwell was soon posted to the front, while Eileen worked in Barcelona as a &quot;French-English shorthand typist&quot;. However, Anna Funder claims in her 2023 book &quot;Wifedom&quot; that Orwell&#x27;s biographers have underrated Eileen&#x27;s achievements. Funder believes that Eileen also organised all logistics for the ILP men at the front, running, Funder says, &quot;the supply, communications and banking operation for the entire contingent.&quot; Eileen also worked in the propaganda department, producing the ILP&#x27;s newspaper and radio show with Charles Orr.

After a different Marxist faction began to control the police department in Barcelona, the political situation deteriorated. The POUM was accused of collaborating with the enemy, and by mid-June 1937 was made illegal. Orwell (on his return from the front) and Eileen were now in danger.

Much of the evidence for the pair&#x27;s time in Spain comes from &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; (1938), the book in which Orwell revealed his first-hand experience of how Stalin&#x27;s agents in Spain sabotaged the socialist cause and set out to eliminate their non-Moscow-aligned Marxist allies, notably POUM. He describes how Stalin&#x27;s agents, once they gained control of the police, imprisoned or murdered several of his and Eileen&#x27;s friends or colleagues.

In this book Orwell disguised Eileen&#x27;s involvement in the ILP office. He does describe how, after most of POUM&#x27;s staff in Barcelona were arrested in early June, Eileen was left free. He says that she believed she was being watched as (in his words) a &quot;decoy duck&quot;, to catch her husband. Yet she eluded the vigilance of the watchers, and managed to intercept and warn Orwell when he returned to Barcelona.

Realizing that their cause had been sabotaged, Orwell, together with McNair and another ex soldier from POUM&#x27;s ILP contingent, Stafford Cottman slept &quot;rough&quot; to avoid arrest, while scrambling to get their passports and exit documents in order. Then on 15 June 1937 the whole party, including Eileen, escaped from Barcelona by train to the French border, disguising themselves on the train as a tourist party. In France, the Orwells diverted to Banyuls-sur-Mer for a short stay, and returned to England.

They were lucky. Orwell&#x27;s colleague Bob Smillie was stopped at the border with France, and died in prison. A Stalinist verdict of treason against Orwell and his wife was issued soon after their escape.

== Eileen O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s role in Spain, and Orwell&#x27;s account of it ==
There is debate over Orwell&#x27;s somewhat cryptic account of Eileen&#x27;s time in Barcelona. Anna Funder believes that this is a particularly revealing example of an attempt, both by Orwell and by his biographers, to erase or minimise the importance of Eileen in his life and work:
Eileen got them both out of Spain by fronting up to the same police prefecture those men [&quot;who raided her hotel room&quot;] had probably been sent from, to get the visas they needed to leave. One biographer eliminates her with the passive voice, writing: &#x27;By now, thanks to the British consulate, their passports were in order.&#x27; In &quot;Homage&quot;, Orwell mentions &#x27;my wife&#x27; 37 times but never once names her. No character can come to life without a name. But from a wife, which is a job description, all can be stolen. I wondered what she felt as she typed those pages.
However, the American feminist Rebecca Solnit (author of &quot;Orwell&#x27;s Roses&quot; 2021), criticizes this claim as part of a pattern of opinionated claims by Funder, tending to diminish Orwell and &quot;make him out to be a bad person, and his wife a sad one.&quot; She sees Eileen rather as a blithely witty, valiant figure&quot;.

The biographer Jeffrey Meyers, and the Orwell researcher Martin Tyrrell also reject most of Funder&#x27;s claims. They argue that it was not Eileen but the British consulate, using diplomatic immunity, that obtained from the dangerous police department the necessary visa-signatures that enabled the party to leave Spain: &quot;The reason none of them comments on Eileen&#x27;s visit to the chief of police is because Eileen had not visited the chief of police.&quot;

Myers and Tyrell recognise that in &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;, Orwell disguised Eileen&#x27;s role in the ILP, and suppressed her name, implying that she was there simply as a supportive spouse. But they suggest that his motive was to protect her from reprisals, especially after the publication of his anti-Stalinist book. Similarly, Quentin Kropp of the Orwell Society contends that Orwell did not mention Eileen&#x27;s name &quot;partly to protect her in a dangerous situation&quot;. Myers writes after being convicted of treason and condemned to death, he feared he could be murdered by Soviet agents whom he knew were operating in England, and wanted to protect Eileen from dangerous reprisals by hiding her connection to POUM. Funder repeatedly calls his very real fear &quot;paranoia&quot;. 

Funder recognises that Eileen retyped drafts of Orwell&#x27;s book, and knew how she was described in it; but suggests that she was powerless to oppose his &quot;patriarchal&quot; reluctance to record her achievements. Funder concedes that George and Eileen were named in 1937 on a Stalinist verdict, which alleged they were both &quot;ILP liaison agents of POUM&quot;; that they believed by 1940 that there was also a Nazi arrest-list of British leftwing intellectuals in the event of a Nazi or fascist government being installed in Britain; and that Orwell remained very nervous of Stalinist assassination attempts even after reaching Britain. Yet she cites Eileen&#x27;s other biographer Sylvia Topp in her 2020 book &quot;Eileen: The Making of George Orwell&quot;. as supporting her own view that Eileen bravely obtained the group&#x27;s visas, and as remarking: &quot;There is no doubt that Eileen was responsible for saving all of their lives.&quot;

However, Tyrell, reviewing Funder&#x27;s &quot;Wifedom&quot; in the &quot;Dublin Review of Books&quot;, says that Funder has mis-remembered the context of this quotation. Topp was talking of Eileen&#x27;s courage in assisting Orwell and his comrades to avoid probable arrest on the train from Barcelona. She did this by travelling with them, and helping them to seem not a group of soldiers escaping the war but a mixed party of rich British tourists. Topp says ‘Having a British woman with them on the train added to their chances of avoiding suspicion. As they escaped safely from Catalonia that day, there is no doubt that Eileen was responsible for saving all their lives.&#x27; 
Orwell, publishing so soon after the event, was probably constrained in what he could safely say about those who had helped in the party&#x27;s escape from Spain. It is possible, but not proved, that Eileen (among others) played a more heroic role than Orwell describes. Any lack of crediting was at the time of less importance, in that &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; received little attention during her (or his) lifetime. However, after the success of his 1949 book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, it was rediscovered, praised, and widely read, making it regrettable that within &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; Eileen does not emerge more vividly.

== Return to England and Second World War ==
At the start of World War II, Eileen began working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in London, and stayed during the week with her family in Greenwich. She was the main breadwinner for the Orwells at this time.

Eileen&#x27;s brother, Laurence, was killed by a bomb during the evacuation from Dunkirk, after which, according to Elizaveta Fen, &quot;her grip on life, which had never been very firm, loosened considerably&quot;. She was increasingly unwell from uterine bleeding and left her job at the Ministry of Information in 1941. In December 1941 women were conscripted to work, and she began working at the Ministry of Food.

In June 1944 she and Eric adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio. In one of her last letters to Eric, Eileen wrote of arrangements for renting and decorating Barnhill, Jura, the house where Orwell wrote most of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, but she died without seeing Barnhill.

==Death==
Eileen&#x27;s brother, Laurence O&#x27;Shaughnessy, had married Gwen Hunton; Gwen had a property, &quot;Greystone&quot; near Carlton, County Durham, which had been left empty on the death of her maiden aunt. The Blairs stayed there on occasion during 1944 and 1945. Gwen evacuated her children to the location when the &quot;flying-bomb&quot; raids began, and Richard went there when the Blairs had been bombed out of their flat in Maida Vale in June 1944.

In early 1945, Eileen was in very poor health and went to stay there. Joyce Pritchard, the O&#x27;Shaughnessys&#x27; nanny, said that Eileen had visited Greystone frequently between July 1944 and March 1945.

Eileen had been living with uterine bleeding for many years. In 1945 she booked herself for a hysterectomy with Dr Harvey Evers, against the advice of London doctors, who, because Eileen was anaemic, would operate only after a month of blood transfusions. Eileen worried about the cost of staying in a hospital that long.

Eileen died on 29 March 1945 in Newcastle upon Tyne under anesthetic. She was thirty-nine. In the words of the inquest: &quot;Cardiac failure whilst under anaesthetic of ether and chloroform skilfully and properly administered for operation for removal of uterus.&quot; At the bottom of the report was a handwritten note, &quot;The deceased was in a very anaemic condition.&quot; Harvey Evers did not attend the inquest. No one was charged. Eileen and Richard had been living at Greystone at the time, with Orwell working in Paris as a war correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot;. He reached Greystone on Saturday, 31 March.

Eileen is buried in Saint Andrew&#x27;s and Jesmond Cemetery, West Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne.

==Influence on Orwell&#x27;s writing==
Some scholars believe that Eileen had a large influence on Orwell&#x27;s writing. It is suggested that Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; may have been influenced by one of Eileen&#x27;s poems, &quot;End of the Century, 1984&quot;. The poem was written in 1934, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the school she went to, Sunderland Church High School, and to look ahead 50 years to the school&#x27;s centenary in 1984.

Although the poem was written a year before she met Blair, there are some similarities between the futuristic vision of Eileen&#x27;s poem and that in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, including the use of mind control, and the eradication of personal freedom by a police state.

Anna Funder argues that Eileen collaborated with Orwell &quot;in a subtle, indirect way&quot; on &quot;Animal Farm.&quot; Orwell originally planned to write an essay, but Eileen suggested a fable. They worked on it together in the evenings, and the Orwells&#x27; friends can see Eileen&#x27;s style and humor in the novel.

<doc id="279720" wikidata="Q142702" url="?curid=279720" title="Malays (ethnic group)">
<text>Malays ( ; , Jawi: ) are an Austronesian ethnoreligious group native to eastern Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and coastal Borneo, as well as the smaller islands that lie between these locations. These locations are today part of the countries of Malaysia, Indonesia (eastern and southern Sumatra, Bangka Belitung Islands, West Kalimantan and Riau Islands), the southern part of Thailand (Pattani, Satun, Songkhla, Yala and Narathiwat), Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.

There is considerable linguistic, cultural, artistic and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within Maritime Southeast Asia. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier Malayic-speaking Austronesians and Austroasiatic tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably Brunei, Kedah, Langkasuka, Gangga Negara, Chi Tu, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Pahang, Melayu and Srivijaya.

The advent of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of Malayness—the religion of Islam, the Malay language and traditions—are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the ethnogenesis of the Malay as a major ethnoreligious group in the region. In literature, architecture, culinary traditions, traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak, Dayak, Orang Asli and the Orang Laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation. In the course of history, the term &quot;Malay&quot; has been extended to other ethnic groups within the &quot;Malay world&quot;; this usage is nowadays largely confined to Malaysia and Singapore, where descendants of immigrants from these ethnic group are termed as &quot;anak dagang&quot; (&quot;traders&quot;) and who are predominantly from the Indonesian archipelago such as the Acehnese, Banjarese, Bugis, Mandailing, Minangkabau and Javanese.

Throughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics. They absorbed, shared and transmitted numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang and Acehnese.

==Etymology==
The epic literature, the &quot;Malay Annals&quot;, associates the etymological origin of &quot;Melayu&quot; to a small river named () in Sumatra, Indonesia. The epic incorrectly stated that the river flowed to the Musi River in Palembang, while in reality it flowed to the Batang Hari River in Jambi. The term is thought to be derived from the Malay word &quot;melaju&quot;, a combination of the verbal prefix &#x27;me&#x27; and the root word &#x27;laju&#x27;, meaning &quot;to accelerate&quot;, used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river.

=== As a place name (toponym) ===
Prior to the 15th century, the term &quot;Melayu&quot; and its similar-sounding variants appear to apply as an old toponym to the Strait of Malacca region in general.
* Malaya Dwipa, &quot;Malaya Dvipa&quot;, is described in chapter 48, Vayu Purana as one of the provinces in the eastern sea that was full of gold and silver. Some scholars equate the term with Sumatra, but several Indian scholars believe the term should refer to the mountainous Malay Peninsula, while Sumatra is more correctly associated with Suvarnadvipa.
* Maleu-kolon – a location in the Golden Chersonese, from Ptolemy&#x27;s work, Geographia.
* Mo-lo-yu – mentioned by Yijing, a Tang dynasty Chinese Buddhist monk who visited the Southeast Asia in 688–695. According to Yijing, the &quot;Mo-Lo-Yu&quot; kingdom was located at a distance of 15 days sailing from Bogha (Palembang), the capital of Sribhoga (Srivijaya). It took a 15-day sail as well to reach Ka-Cha (Kedah) from Mo-lo-yu; therefore, it can be reasoned that Mo-Lo-Yu would lie halfway between the two places. A popular theory relates &quot;Mo-Lo-Yu&quot; with the Jambi in Sumatra, however the geographical location of Jambi contradicts with Yi Jing&#x27;s description of a &quot;half way sail between &quot;Ka-Cha&quot; (Kedah) and &quot;Bogha&quot; (Palembang)&quot;. In the later Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) and Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the word &quot;Ma-La-Yu&quot; was mentioned often in Chinese historical texts — with changes in spelling due to the time span between the dynasties — to refer to a nation near the southern sea. Among the terms used was &quot;Bôk-lá-yù&quot;, &quot;Mók-là-yū&quot; (木剌由), Má-lì-yù-er (麻里予兒), Oō-laì-yu (巫来由) — traced from the written source of monk Xuanzang) and Wú-laī-yû (無来由).
* Malaiyur – mentioned in the Tanjore inscription. It was described as a kingdom that had &quot;a strong mountain for its rampart&quot; that fell to the Chola invaders during Rajendra Chola I&#x27;s campaign in the 11th century. It may have been situated in Sumatra, between Pannai and Srivijaya (Palembang), possibly in the Muaro Jambi archaeological site.
* Bhūmi Mālayu – (literally &quot;Land of Malayu&quot;), a transcription from Padang Roco Inscription dated 1286 CE by Slamet Muljana. The term is associated with Dharmasraya kingdom.
* Ma-li-yu-er – mentioned in the chronicle of Yuan dynasty, referring to a nation of the Malay Peninsula that faced the southward expansion of Sukhothai Kingdom, during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng. The chronicle stated: &quot;..Animosity occurred between Siam and Ma-li-yu-er with both killing each other ...&quot;. In response to the Sukhothai&#x27;s action, a Chinese envoy went to the Ram Khamhaeng&#x27;s court in 1295 bearing an imperial decree: &quot;Keep your promise and do no evil to Ma-li-yu-er&quot;.
* Malauir – mentioned in Marco Polo&#x27;s account as a kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula, possibly similar to the one mentioned in Yuan chronicle.
* Malayapura – (literally &quot;city of Malaya&quot; or &quot;fortress of Malaya&quot;), inscribed on the Amoghapasa inscription dated 1347 CE. The term was used by Adityawarman to refer to Dharmasraya.

Other suggestions include the Javanese word &quot;mlayu&quot; (as a verb: to run, participle: fugitive), or the Malay term &quot;melaju&quot; (to steadily accelerate), referring to the high mobility and migratory nature of its people. De Barros (1552) mentioned that Iskandar Shah named the &quot;Malaios&quot; (Malays) so because of the banishment of his father from his country. Albuquerque explained that Parameswara fled (&quot;malayo&quot;) from the kingdom of Palembang to Malacca.

=== As an ethnic name (ethnonym) ===
The word &quot;Melayu&quot; as an ethnonym, to allude to a clearly different ethnological cluster, is assumed to have been made fashionable throughout the integration of the Malacca Sultanate as a regional power in the 15th century. It was applied to report the social partialities of the Malaccans as opposed to foreigners as of the similar area, especially the Javanese and Thais. This is evidenced from the early 16th century Malay word-list by Antonio Pigafetta who joined the Magellan&#x27;s circumnavigation, that made a reference to how the phrase &quot;chiara Malaiu&quot; (&#x27;Malay ways&#x27;) was used in the maritime Southeast Asia, to refer to the &quot;al parlare de Malaea&quot; (Italian for &quot;to speak of Malacca&quot;).

Classical Malay literature described the Malays in a narrower sense than the modern interpretation. &quot;Hikayat Hang Tuah&quot; (ca. 1700, manuscript ca. 1849) only identifies the Malay people as the subject of Malacca Sultanate; Brunei, at that time, is not considered Malay. &quot;Hikayat Patani&quot; (manuscript: 1876) for example, does not call Patani and Brunei as Malay, that term is only used for Johor. Kedah is not included as Malay in the Kedah chronicle/Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa (ca. 1821). &quot;Hikayat Aceh&quot; (ca. 1625, manuscript ca. 1675) linked Malay ethnicity with Johor, but certainly not Aceh or Deli.

==Origins==
===Proto-Malay models===

Also known as &quot;Melayu asli&quot; (aboriginal Malays) or &quot;Melayu purba&quot; (ancient Malays), the Proto-Malays are of Austronesian origin and thought to have migrated to the Malay Archipelago in a long series of migrations between 2500 and 1500 BCE. Notable Proto-Malays of today are Moken, Jakun, Orang Kuala, Temuan and Orang Kanaq. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Early History&quot;, has pointed out a total of three theories of the origin of Malays:
* The Yunnan theory (published in 1889) – The theory of Proto-Malays originating from Yunnan approximately 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. The theory is supported by R.H Geldern and his team who theorized that their migration occurred from the Mekong River to the Malay Peninsula. Other evidence that supports this theory includes stone tools found in the Malay Archipelago being analogous to Central Asian tools, which shows the similarity of Malay and Assamese customs.
* The New Guinea/Seafarers theory (published in 1965) – The migration of seafarers with strong oceanographic skills who travelled from island to island between New Zealand and Madagascar. The theory claims the Malay&#x27;s morphology at the time were similar to that of Negroids.
* The Taiwan theory (published in 1997) – The migration of a group of people from Southern China occurred 6,000 years ago, some moved to Taiwan (today&#x27;s Taiwanese aborigines are their descendants), then to the Philippines and later to Borneo (roughly 4,500 years ago) (today&#x27;s Dayak and other groups). These ancient people also split with some heading to Sulawesi and others progressing into Java, and Sumatra, all of which now speak languages that belong to the Austronesian Language family. The final migration was to the Malay Peninsula roughly 3,000 years ago. A sub-group from Borneo moved to Champa in modern-day Central and South Vietnam roughly 4,500 years ago. There are also traces of the Dong Son and Hoabinhian migration from Vietnam and Cambodia. All these groups share DNA and linguistic origins traceable to the island that is today Taiwan, and the ancestors of these ancient people are traceable to southern China.

====Deutero-Malays====

The Deutero-Malays are an Iron Age people descended partly from the subsequent Austronesian peoples who came equipped with more advanced farming techniques and new knowledge of metals. The Deutero-Malay settlers were not nomadic like their predecessors: instead they settled and established kampungs which serve as the main units in society. These kampungs were normally situated on the riverbanks or coastal areas and generally self-sufficient in food and other necessities. By the end of the 1st century BCE, these kampungs were beginning to engage in some trade with the outside world. The Deutero-Malays are considered the direct ancestors of the present-day Malay people.

====Expansion from Sundaland model====
A more recent theory holds that rather than being populated by expansion from the mainland, the Ice Age populations of the Malay Peninsula, neighbouring Indonesian Archipelago, and the then-exposed continental shelf (Sundaland) instead developed locally from the first human settlers and expanded to the mainland. Proponents of this theory hold that this expansion gives a far more parsimonious explanation of the linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence than earlier models, particularly the Taiwan model. This theory also draws support from recent genetic evidence by Human Genome Organisation suggesting that the primary peopling of Asia occurred in a single migration through Southeast Asia; this route is held to be the modern Malay area and that the diversity in the area developed mainly in-place without requiring major migrations from the mainland. The expansion itself may have been driven by rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age.

Proponent Stephen Oppenheimer has further theorised that the expansion of peoples occurred in three rapid surges due to rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age, and that this diaspora spread the peoples and their associated cultures, myths, and technologies not just to mainland Southeast Asia, but as far as India, the Near East, and the Mediterranean. Reviewers have found his proposals for the original settlement and dispersal worthy of further study, but have been sceptical of his more diffusionist claims.

=== Genetic evidence ===
Malays are an Austronesian-speaking ethnic group of Insular Southeast Asia, and the Malay Peninsula. According to a 2015 study, Malays from Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Sri Lanka have 4 major ancestral components, including Austronesian (17%–62%), Proto-Malay (15%–31%), East Asian (4%–16%) and South Asian (3%–34%). But the Austronesian and Southeast Asian aboriginal components were more significant for Malays from Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia than East Asian and South Asian. In contrast, Malays from Sri Lanka possessed about 34% South Asian ancestry in their genetic makeup, making them relatively distinct.

A study in 2021 concluded that a distinctive Basal-East Asian lineage (sometimes termed as &quot;&#x27;East- and Southeast Asian lineage&quot;&#x27; (ESEA)), which is ancestral to modern East and Southeast Asians, Polynesians, and Siberians, originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000 BCE, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively. Basal-East Asian ancestry, as well as later Austroasiatic-associated ancestry, spread into Maritime Southeast Asia prior to the Austronesian expansion. Austronesian-speakers themselves are suggested to have arrived on Taiwan and the northern Philippines between 10,000 to 7,000 BCE from coastal southern China, and spread from there throughout Insular Southeast Asia. The authors concluded that the Austronesian expansion into Insular Southeast Asia and Polynesia was outgoing from the Philippines rather than Taiwan, and that modern Austronesian-speaking peoples, such as the Malays, have largely ancestry from the earliest Basal-East Asians, Austroasiatic migrants from Mainland Southeast Asia, and Austronesian-speaking seafarers from the Philippines, without much admixture from previous groups.

==History==
===Indian influence===

There is no definite evidence which dates the first Indian voyages across the Bay of Bengal but conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals on Malay shores at least 2,000 years ago. The discovery of jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to 110 CE in the Bujang Valley, shows that a maritime trading route with South Indian Tamil kingdoms was already established since the second century.

The growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of maritime Southeast Asia into contact with the major religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Throughout this area a most profound in influence has been exerted by India which seems to have introduced into it architecture, sculpture, writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton and a host of elements of higher culture. Indian religions, cultural traditions and Sanskrit began to spread across the land. Hindu temples were built in the Indian style, local kings began referring to themselves as &quot;raja&quot; and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.

The beginning of the Common Era saw the rise of Malay states in the coastal areas of the Sumatra and Malay Peninsula; Srivijaya, Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom, Gangga Negara, Langkasuka, Kedah, Pahang, the Melayu Kingdom and Chi Tu. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsula and Sumatran maritime trading states, became part of the mandala of Srivijaya, a great confederation of city-states centred in Sumatra. Early during this period, the earliest known mention of the word &quot;Malayu&quot; was used in Chinese sources in 644 CE. Later in the mid-14th century, the word Malay was already recognized as a collective people sharing similar heritage, customs and language.

Srivijaya&#x27;s influence spread over all the coastal areas of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, western Java and western Borneo, as well as the rest of the Malay Archipelago. Enjoying both Indian and Chinese patronage, its wealth was gained mostly through trade. At its height, the Old Malay language was used as its official language and became the lingua franca of the region, replacing Sanskrit, the language of Hinduism. The Srivijayan era is considered the golden age of Malay culture.

The glory of Srivijaya however began to wane after the series of raids by the Tamil Chola dynasty in the 11th century. After the fall of Srivijaya in 1025 CE, the Malayu kingdom of Jambi, Sumatra, became the most dominant Malay state of the region. By the end of the 13th century, the remnants of the Malay empire in Sumatra was finally destroyed by the Javanese invaders during the Pamalayu expedition (&quot;Pamalayu&quot; means &quot;war against the Malays&quot;).

In 1299, through the support of the loyal servants of the empire, the Orang laut, a Malay prince of Palembang origin, Sang Nila Utama established the Kingdom of Singapura in Temasek. His dynasty ruled the island kingdom until the end of the 14th century, when the Malay polity once again faced the wrath of Javanese invaders. In 1400, his great-great-grandson, Parameswara, headed north and established the Malacca Sultanate. The new kingdom succeeded Srivijaya and inherited much of the royal and cultural traditions, including a large part of the territories of its predecessor.
In the north of the peninsula, the power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the kingdom of Tambralinga in the 12th century. Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja (1230–1263) managed to capture Jaffna kingdom in Sri Lanka between 1247 and 1258. He was eventually defeated by the forces of the Pandyan dynasty from Tamil Nadu in 1263 and was killed by the brother of Emperor Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I. The invasion marked an unrivaled feature in the history of Southeast Asia, it was the only time there was an armed maritime expedition beyond the borders of the region.

The cultivation of Malay polity system also diffused beyond the proper Sumatran-Peninsular border during this era. The age avowed by exploration and migration of the Malays to establish kingdoms beyond the traditional Srivijayan realm. Several exemplification are the enthronement of a Tambralingan prince to reign the Lavo Kingdom in present-day Central Thailand, the foundation of Rajahnate of Cebu in the Visayas and the establishment of the Tanjungpura Kingdom in what is now West Kalimantan, Borneo. The expansion is also eminent as it shaped the ethnogenesis development of the related Acehnese and Banjar people and further spreading the Indian-influenced Malay ethos within the regional sphere.

===Islamisation===


The period of the 12th and 15th centuries saw the arrival of Islam and the rise of the great port-city of Malacca on the southwestern coast of the Malay Peninsula — two major developments that altered the course of Malay history.

The Islamic faith arrived on the shores of what are now the states of Kedah, Perak, Kelantan and Terengganu, from around the 12th century. The earliest archaeological evidence of Islam from the Malay Peninsula is the Terengganu Inscription Stone dating from the 14th century found in Terengganu state, Malaysia.

By the 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony reached over much of the western Malay Archipelago, had become the centre of Islamisation in the east. As a Malaccan state religion, Islam brought many great transformation into the Malaccan society and culture, and It became the primary instrument in the evolution of a common Malay identity. The Malaccan era witnessed the close association of Islam with Malay society and how it developed into a definitive marker of Malay identity. Over time, this common Malay cultural idiom came to characterise much of the Malay Archipelago through the Malayisation process. The expansion of Malaccan influence through trade and Dawah brought with it together the Classical Malay language, the Islamic faith, and the Malay Muslim culture; the three core values of &quot;Kemelayuan&quot; (&quot;Malayness&quot;).

In 1511, the Malaccan capital fell into the hands of Portuguese conquistadors. However, Malacca remained an institutional prototype: a paradigm of statecraft and a point of cultural reference for successor states such as Johor Sultanate (1528–present), Perak Sultanate (1528–present), Pahang Sultanate (1470–present), Siak Sri Indrapura Sultanate (1725–1946), Pelalawan Sultanate (1725–1946) and Riau-Lingga Sultanate (1824–1911).
Across the South China Sea in the 14th century, another Malay realm, the Bruneian Empire was on the rise to become the most powerful polity in Borneo. By the middle of the 15th century, Brunei entered into a close relationship with the Malacca Sultanate. The sultan married a Malaccan princess, adopted Islam as the court religion, and introduced an efficient administration modelled on Malacca. Brunei profited from trade with Malacca but gained even greater prosperity after the great Malay port was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511. It reached its golden age in the mid-16th century when it controlled land as far south as present day Kuching in Sarawak, north towards the Philippine Archipelago. The empire broadened its influence in Luzon by defeating Datu Gambang of the Kingdom of Tondo and by founding a satellite state, Kota Seludong in present-day Manila, setting up the Muslim Rajah, Rajah Sulaiman I as a vassal to the Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, Philippines when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the Sultan of Sulu. However, states like the kingdom of Pangasinan, Rajahnate of Cebu and Kedatuan of Madja-as tried to resist Brunei&#x27;s and Islam&#x27;s spread into the Philippines. Brunei&#x27;s fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of Malayisation.

Other significant Malay sultanates were the Kedah Sultanate (1136–present), Kelantan Sultanate (1411–present), Patani Sultanate (1516–1771), Reman Kingdom (1785–1909) and Legeh Kingdom (1755–1902) that dominated the northern part of the Malay Peninsula. Jambi Sultanate (1460–1907), Palembang Sultanate (1550–1823) and Indragiri Sultanate (1298–1945) controlled much of the southeastern shores of Sumatra. Deli Sultanate (1632–1946), Serdang Sultanate (1728–1948), Langkat Sultanate (1568–1948) and Asahan Sultanate (1630–1948) governed eastern Sumatra. While West Borneo observed the rise of Pontianak Sultanate (1771–1950), Mempawah Sultanate (1740–1950) and Matan Sultanate (1590–1948), Sanggau Sultanate, Sintang Sultanate, and Sekadau Sultanate.

===Colonisation by foreign powers===
Between 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct colonisation or became the protectorates of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like Portuguese, Dutch and British, to regional powers like Aceh, Siam and Japan.
In 1511, the Portuguese Empire captured the capital city of the Malacca Sultanate. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the fort of Malacca. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the Johor Sultanate in 1528 to succeed Malacca. Portuguese Malacca faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the Dutch Empire, ousted the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.
Historically, Malay states of the peninsula had hostile relations with the Siamese. The Malacca Sultanate Itself fought two wars with the Siamese while the northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the Kingdom of Siam under the new Chakri dynasty abolished the Patani Sultanate and later annexed a large part of Kedah Sultanate. Earlier, the Siamese under Ayutthaya Kingdom have had already absorbed Tambralinga and overrun the Singgora Sultanate in the 17th century. Between 1808 and 1813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the semi-independent Malay kingdoms of Patani, Saiburi, Nongchik, Yaring, Yala, Reman and Rangae from Greater Patani and similarly obtained Rundung, Kupa, Tongkah, Terang while carving Setul, Langu, Perlis, Kubang Pasu from the Kedah Kingdom in 1839. In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Patani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government. The coup de grâce was cultivated by 1906, when the Siamese redraw the border of the Patani territories and installed a new governance and administrative system.

In 1786, the island of Penang was leased to East India Company by Kedah Sultanate in exchange of military assistance against the Siamese. In 1819, the company also acquired Singapore from Johor Empire, later in 1824, Dutch Malacca from the Dutch, followed by Dindings from Perak by 1874 and finally Labuan from Brunei in 1886. All these trading posts officially known as Straits Settlements in 1826 and became the crown colony of British Empire in 1867. Additionally, the Straits Settlements would also encompass the Indian Ocean islands of Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands in 1886. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when Malay rulers accepted British Residents in administration, and the Federated Malay States was formed. In 1909, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis were handed over by Siam to the British. These states along with Johor, later became known as Unfederated Malay States. During the World War II, all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as British Malaya were occupied by the Empire of Japan.
The twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the Castille War against the Spanish conquistadors who arrived in the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire&#x27;s dominance in the present-day Philippine Archipelago. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in Borneo to the White Rajahs of Sarawak, North Borneo Chartered Company and its lower Borneo vassals to Dutch East India Company. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.

Following the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 which divided the Malay Archipelago into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in Sumatra and Southern Borneo became part of the Dutch East Indies. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control, some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and Riau Sultanate in 1911.

In the late 19th century, Germany sought to establish a naval base in Langkawi, requesting its lease from Siam, influenced by Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz&#x27;s vision of using the island as a hub for a global submarine cable network. With its deep natural harbor, Langkawi was strategically positioned between German territories in China and the Pacific, facilitating warship restocking and enhancing commercial interests for German investors. In October 1899, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co approached Kedah&#x27;s Crown Prince to lease the island for 50 years, but the plan faltered due to Siam&#x27;s refusal, as dictated by the Secret Siamese Treaty of 1897, which required British consent for territorial concessions. A subsequent attempt in 1900 to acquire Pulau Lontar was similarly dismissed, prompting British concerns over potential German expansion in the region and its implications for their economic and political dominance.

The prospect of a German annexation of the northern peninsula and the potential of its involvement for a commercial canal or railway network across the Isthmus of Kra, posed a serious threat to the British economic interest and political dominance in the region. Severely alarmed, the British and the Siamese entered the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, partitioning the peninsula between the British and the Siamese jurisdiction. 

The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the upper portion of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the British dominance. The British originally planned for the inclusion of Reman, Legeh and Setul under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with Tarutao, Butang islands groups, Sendawa, Langgu and the principality of Setul were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the Tabal district, including Sungai Golok and Sungai Padi; while Perlis lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled Federated Malay State of Perak however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with southern territories of Reman being transferred into the state and additionally Kelantan received Jeli from Legeh (which had been under Siamese jurisdiction since 1902). The Siamese then abdicated Tunku Baharuddin, the King of Setul, the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to seal the fate of the Malay states of Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the British colonial government, a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.

Later during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya and Borneo, the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as Pontianak incidents, the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the West Kalimantan Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and coup d&#x27;etat against the Japanese. It was believed that West Kalimantan took two generations to recover from the near-total collapse of the Malay ruling class in the territory.

===Malay nationalism===

Despite the widespread distribution of the Malay population throughout the Malay Archipelago, modern Malay nationalism was only significantly mobilised in the early twentieth century British Malaya i. e. the Malay Peninsula. In the Netherlands Indies, the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called &quot;Indonesian National Awakening&quot; united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as &quot;Indonesians&quot;. In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, Pattani separatism against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsular Malay nationalism. A similar secession movement can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of Riau and Riau Islands sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the Federation of Malaya, later reconstituted as Malaysia.

The earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the periodicals which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in Malaya between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were &quot;Al-Imam&quot; (1906), &quot;Pengasuh&quot; (1920), &quot;Majlis&quot; (1935) and &quot;Utusan Melayu&quot; (1939). The rise of Malay nationalism was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions — the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.
The Malay leftists were represented by Kesatuan Melayu Muda, formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in Sultan Idris Training College, with an ideal of &quot;Greater Indonesia&quot;. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The Islamists were originally represented by &quot;Kaum Muda&quot; consisted of Middle east — educated scholars with Pan-Islamic sentiment. The first Islamic political party was &quot;Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya&quot; (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by Pan-Malayan Islamic Party in 1951. The third group was the conservatives consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive Malay College Kuala Kangsar. They formed voluntary organisations known as &quot;Persatuan Melayu&quot; (&#x27;Malay Associations&#x27;) in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to assert Malay dominance over Malaya.

The Malay and Malayness has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a &quot;Bangsa Melayu&quot; (&#x27;Malay Nation&#x27;) and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported Malay language, Islam and Malay monarchy as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the secular state but wanted to end feudalism, whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of Islam.

Since the foundation of the Republic of Indonesia as a unitary state in 1950, all traditional Malay monarchies in Indonesia were abolished, and the Sultans positions reduced to titular heads or pretenders. The violent demise of the sultanates of Deli, Langkat, Serdang, Asahan and other Malay principalities in East Sumatra during the &quot;Social revolution&quot; of 1946 orchestrated by the Communist Party of Indonesia, drastically influenced their Malayan counterparts and politically motivating them against the PKMM&#x27;s ideal of Greater Indonesia and the Islamists&#x27; vision of Islamic Republic.

In March 1946, UMNO emerged with the full support of the Malay sultans from the Conference of Rulers. The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain&#x27;s abandonment of the radical Malayan Union plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans&#x27; representatives and UMNO and the other.

Two years later the semi independent Federation of Malaya was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional Malay rulers thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the Federation of Malaya, the West&#x27;s last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power. The federation was reconstituted as Malaysia with the addition in 1963 of Singapore (separated in 1965), Sabah and Sarawak.

==Culture==
===Language===
The Malay language is one of the most prominent languages of the world, especially of the Austronesian family. Variants and dialects of Malay are used as an official language in Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The language is also spoken in southern Thailand, Cocos Islands, Christmas Island, Sri Lanka. It is spoken natively by approximately 33 million people throughout the Malay Archipelago and is used as a second language by an estimated 220 million.

The oldest form of Malay is descended from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by the earliest Austronesian settlers in Southeast Asia. This form would later evolve into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region. Old Malay contained some terms last until today, but remained unintelligible to modern speakers, while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay, which the oldest form dating back to 1303 CE. Malay evolved into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary when Islam made its way to the region, changing significantly in the process. Initially, Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia. One of these dialects, that was developed in the literary tradition of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, eventually became predominant.

The Malaccan era was marked with the transformation of the Malay language into an Islamic language, in similar fashion to Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Swahili. An adapted Arabic script called Jawi was used replacing the Kawi script, Islamic religious and cultural terminologies were abundantly assimilated, discarding many Hindu-Buddhist words, and Malay became the language of Islamic medium of instruction and dissemination throughout Southeast Asian region. At the height of Malacca&#x27;s power in the 15th century, the Classical Malay spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world and resulted in a &quot;lingua franca&quot; that was called &quot;Bahasa Melayu pasar&quot; (&quot;Bazaar Malay&quot;) or &quot;Bahasa Melayu rendah&quot; (&quot;Low Malay&quot;) as opposed to the &quot;Bahasa Melayu tinggi&quot; (&quot;High Malay&quot;) of Malacca. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin and the most important development, however, has been that pidgin creolised, creating several new languages such as the Ambonese Malay, Manado Malay and Betawi language.

European writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Tavernier, Thomassin and Werndly describe Malay as &quot;language of the learned in all the Indies, like Latin in Europe&quot;. It is also the most widely used during British and Dutch colonial era in the Malay Archipelago. The reversed was seen in the Spanish East Indies, where mass latinisation of the archipelago during the colonial years resulted the historical coup de grâce of the Malay language in the Philippines.

The dialect of Johor Sultanate, the direct successor of Malacca, became the standard speech among Malays in Singapore and Malaysia, and it formed the original basis for the standardised Indonesian language.

Apart from the standard Malay, developed within the Malacca-Johor sphere, various local Malay dialects exist. For example, the Bangkanese, the Bruneian, the Jambian, the Kelantanese, the Kedahan, the Negeri Sembilanese, the Palembangnese, the Pattanese, the Sarawakian, the Terengganuan, and many others.

The Malay language was historically written in Pallawa, Kawi and Rencong. After the arrival of Islam, Arabic-based Jawi script was adopted and is still in use today as one of the two official scripts in Brunei and as an alternative script in Malaysia. Beginning from the 17th century, as a result of British and Dutch colonisation, Jawi was gradually replaced by the Latin-based Rumi script which eventually became the official modern script for Malay language in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, and co-official script in Brunei.

===Literature===
The rich oral literature and classical literature of the Malays contain a great number of portraits of the people, from the servant to the minister, from the judge to the Rajas, from the ancient to the very contemporary periods, which together form the amorphous identity of the Malays.

Considering the softness and mellifluence of the Malay language, which lends itself easily to the requirements of rhyme and rhythm, the originality and beauty in Malay literature can be assessed in its poetical elements. Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are — the Pantun, Syair and Gurindam.

The earliest form of Malay literature was the oral literature and its central subjects are traditional folklore relating to nature, animals and people. The classical Malay folklore is composed of traditional songs and music, heroic poems, animal fables, ghost stories, past events, fairy tales, symbolic lore, myths and bardic tales. Each of the stories possessed its own energy in terms of character, spirit, backdrop and storytelling and was largely crafted with the intend of happiness, guidance, educating, reminiscing, explaining, among few. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by &quot;penglipur lara&quot; (storytellers) for example: &quot;Hikayat Malim Dewa&quot;, &quot;Hikayat Malim Deman&quot;, &quot;Hikayat Raja Donan&quot;, &quot;Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal&quot;, and &quot;Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda&quot;.

When Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of Sanskrit literature and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to Hindu mythology. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as &quot;Hikayat Seri Rama&quot; (a free translation of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;), &quot;Hikayat Bayan Budiman&quot; (an adaptation of Śukasaptati) and &quot;Hikayat Panca Tanderan&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;Hitopadesha&quot;).

The era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of Jawi script (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The Terengganu Inscription Stone, which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and romance in Jawi script. At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature. During this era, notable Middle Eastern literary works were translated and religious books were written in Malay language. Among famous translated works are &quot;Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah&quot; and &quot;Hikayat Amir Hamzah&quot;.

The rise of Malay literature during the period was also penned by other homegrown literary composition coloured by mystical Sufism of the middle-east, the notable works of Hamzah Fansuri such as &quot;Asrar al-Arifin&quot; (&quot;Rahsia Orang yang Bijaksana;&quot; The Secret of the Wise), &quot;Sharab al-Asyikin&quot; (&quot;Minuman Segala Orang yang Berahi;&quot; The Drink of All the Passionate) and &quot;Zinat al-Muwahidin&quot; (&quot;Perhiasan Sekalian Orang yang Mengesakan;&quot; The Ornament of All the Devoted) can be seen as the magna opera of the era.
The most important piece of Malay literary works is perhaps the famed Malay Annals or Sulalatus Salatin. It was called &quot;the most famous, distinctive and best of all Malay literary works&quot; by one of the most prominent scholars in Malay studies, Sir Richard O. Winstedt. The exact date of its composition and the identity of its original author are uncertain, but under the order of Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah III of Johor in 1612, Tun Sri Lanang oversaw the editorial and compilation process of the Malay Annals.

In the 19th century, the Malay literature received some notable additions, including &quot;Kitab Ilmu Bedil&quot; (Book of Traditional Weaponry) that provides valuable details of traditional Malay ammunition and weaponry. The era also witnessed the wider usage of Malay medical journals, known as &quot;Kitab Tib&quot;. These works are indeed important as it serve as references to the Malay knowledge and technology during the classical era. Other 19th century Malay texts were written in Sumatra, these include the &quot;Kitab Pengetahuan Bahasa&quot; (Book of Linguistic Knowledge) by Raja Ali Haji and &quot;Perhimpunan Gunawan bagi Laki-Laki dan Perempuan&quot; (A Compendium of Charms for Men and Women) by Khatijah Terung, a wife of Raja Haji Abdullah bin Raja Hassan.

The same century also witnessed a monumental shift in the Malay literature through writings of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, a famous Malacca-born munshi of Singapore. Abdullah is regarded as the most cultured Malay who ever wrote, one of the greatest innovators in Malay letters and the father of modern Malay literature. His most important works are the &quot;Hikayat Abdullah&quot; (an autobiography), &quot;Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan&quot; (an account of his trip for the government to Kelantan), and &quot;Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah&quot; (a narrative of his pilgrimage to Mecca 1854). His work was an inspiration to future generations of writers and marks an early stage in the transition from classical Malay literature to modern Malay literature.

===Religion===
The early Malay communities were largely animists, believing in the existence of &quot;semangat&quot; (spirits) in everything. Around the opening of the common era, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced by South Asian traders to the Malay Archipelago, where they flourished until the 13th century, just before the arrival of Islam brought by Arab, South Asian and Chinese Muslim traders.

In the 15th century, Islam of the orthodox Sunni sect flourished in the Malay world under the Malacca Sultanate. In contrast with Hinduism, which superficially transformed early Malay society, Islam can be said to have been fully integrated into the daily life of the population. Since this era, the Malays are considered as ethnoreligious group and traditionally had a close identification with Islam and they have not changed their religion since. This identity is so strong that it is said to become Muslim was to &quot;masuk Melayu&quot; (to enter Malayness).

Nevertheless, the earlier beliefs having deeper roots, they have maintained themselves against the anathemas of Islam — and indeed Sufism mysticism have become intertwined among the Malays, with the spirits of the earlier animistic world and some elements of Hinduism. Following the 1970s, Islamic revival (also referred as re-Islamisation) throughout the Muslim world, many traditions that are regarded as contravene the teachings of Islam and contain elements of shirk were abandoned by the Malays in Malaysia, whereas in among Malays in Indonesia, these traditions are not considered as superstitious and containing elements of shirk. Among these traditions was the &quot;mandi safar&quot; festival (Safar bath), a bathing festival to achieve spiritual purity, which can be discerned features similar to some of those of the Durga Puja of India.

A vast majority of modern ethnic Malays are the adherents of Sunni Islam and the most important Malay festivals are those of Islamic origin — &quot;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&quot;, &quot;Hari Raya Aidiladha&quot;, &quot;Awal Muharram&quot;, and &quot;Maulidur Rasul&quot;. It is considered apostasy for Malays to convert out of Islam in Malaysia and Brunei. However, there are a number of ethnic Malays living outside of these countries have also embraced other religions legally under the law.

===Architecture===
Various cultural influences, notably Chinese, Indian and Europeans, played a major role in forming Malay architecture. Until recent time, wood was the principal material used for all Malay traditional buildings. However, numerous stone structures were also discovered particularly the religious complexes from the time of Srivijaya and ancient isthmian Malay kingdoms.

Candi Muara Takus and Candi Muaro Jambi in Sumatra are among the examples that associated with the architectural elements of Srivijaya Empire. However, Srivijayan architecture was mostly represented at Chaiya (now a province in Thailand) in the Malay Peninsula, which was an important centre during the Srivijaya period. The type of structure consists of a cell-chamber to house the Buddha image and the summit of structure was erected in the form of &quot;stupa&quot; with successive, superimposed terraces which is the best example at &quot;Wat Pra Borom That&quot; of Chaiya.

There is also evidence of Hindu shrines or &quot;Candi&quot; around south Kedah between the mount Jerai and the Muda River valley, an area known as Bujang Valley. Within an area of about 350 square kilometres, 87 early historic religious sites have been reported and there are 12 &quot;candis&quot; located on mountain tops, a feature which suggests may derive from pre-historic Malay beliefs regarding sanctity of high places.
Early reference on Malay architecture in the Malay Peninsula can be found in several Chinese records. A 7th-century Chinese account tells of Buddhist pilgrims calling at Langkasuka and mentioned the city as being surrounded by a wall on which towers had been built and was approached through double gates. Another 7th-century account of a special Chinese envoy to Red Earth Kingdom in the Malay Peninsula, recorded that the capital city had three gates more than a hundred paces apart, which were decorated with paintings of Buddhist themes and female spirits.

The first detailed description of Malay architecture was on the great wooden &quot;&quot; of Mansur Shah of Malacca (reigned 1458–1477). According to Sejarah Melayu, the building had a raised seven bay structures on wooden pillars with a seven tiered roof in cooper shingles and decorated with gilded spires and Chinese glass mirrors.

The traditional Malay houses are built using simple timber-frame structure. They have pitched roofs, porches in the front, high ceilings, many openings on the walls for ventilation, and are often embellished with elaborate wood carvings. The beauty and quality of Malay wood carvings were meant to serve as visual indicators of the social rank and status of the owners themselves.

Throughout many decades, the traditional Malay architecture has been influenced by Bugis and Java from the south, Siamese, British, Arab and Indian from the north, Portuguese, Dutch, Aceh and Minangkabau from the west and Southern Chinese from the east.
===Visual art===

Wood carving is a part of classical Malay visual arts. The Malays had traditionally adorned their monuments, boats, weapons, tombs, musical instrument, and utensils by motives of flora, calligraphy, geometry and cosmic features. The art is done by partially removing the wood using sharp tools and following specific patterns, composition and orders. The art form, known as &quot;ukir&quot;, is hailed as an act of devotion of the craftsmen to the creator and a gift to his fellowmen.

The art form is mainly attributed to the abundance of timber on the Malay Archipelago and also by the skillfulness of the woodcarvers that have allowed the Malays to practice woodcarving as a craft. The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna are abundant has inspired the motives to be depicted in abstract or stylised form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and Islamic calligraphy form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.

A typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight illuminate the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor. Thus, the carved components perform both functional and aesthetic purposes.

===Pottery===

Under the Malay culture, pottery is not solely witnessed as a mere household utensil. It is perceived as a work of art, a paradigm of talent, embroidered with aesthetic, legacy, perseverance and religious devotion. The Malay earthen is usually unglazed, with the ornamental designs were carved when the pottery is semi-dried during its construction process.

According to several studies, the native Malay pottery industry has developed indigenously from the period of great antiquity and has since encapsulates a high-level of culture sophistication. It also has been noted that the design features of the Malay pottery suggested the absence of the foreign influence prior to the 19th century, a paradox considering the vast cultural contact between the Malays and the outside world.

Among the renowned traditional Malay pottery includes &quot;Mambong&quot; of Kelantan, molded from clay and identified with the colour of terracotta. It is usually assumed the form as cooking utensils. In the west coast, the raven-coloured &quot;Labu Sayung&quot; of Kuala Kangsar is honoured for gourd-formed jars. There are also several variants of &quot;Labu&quot;, including &quot;Labu Tela, Labu Kepala, Labu Gelugor Tela&quot; and &quot;Labu Gelugor Kepala&quot;.

Other forms of Malay traditional pottery are: The &quot;Belanga&quot;, commonly in a wide rim and a round base, the pot usually mobilised to cook curries. It is held that the structure of the earthen would aid the heat to be evenly distributed, correlating to its round base.

Different Malay regions are all known for their unique or signature dishes—Pattani, Terengganu and Kelantan for their &quot;nasi dagang&quot;, &quot;nasi kerabu&quot; and &quot;keropok lekor&quot;; Pahang and Perak for its durian-based cuisine, &quot;gulai tempoyak&quot;; Kedah and Penang for their northern-style &quot;asam laksa&quot; and &quot;rojak&quot;; Satun and Perlis for its &quot;bunga kuda&quot; dessert; Negeri Sembilan for its &quot;lemak&quot;-based dishes; Malacca for their spicy &quot;cincalok&quot;; Singapore for their &quot;rojak bandung&quot; and &quot;roti prata&quot;; Riau for its &quot;ikan patin&quot; (&quot;Pangasius&quot; fish) dishes, &quot;gulai ikan patin&quot; and &quot;asam pedas ikan patin&quot;; Riau Islands for their &quot;sup ikan&quot;; Deli Malays of North Sumatra for their &quot;nasi goreng teri medan&quot; and &quot;gulai ketam&quot;; Jambi for its &quot;ikan mas panggang&quot; and &quot;tempoyak&quot;; Palembangese Malays of South Sumatra for their &quot;pempek&quot;, &quot;mi celor&quot; and &quot;nasi minyak&quot;; Bangka Belitung for its &quot;siput gonggong&quot; and &quot;terang bulan&quot;; West Kalimantan and Sarawak for its &quot;bubur pedas&quot; and &quot;ayam pansuh&quot;; Brunei for their Nasi katok and unique &quot;ambuyat&quot; dish; and Cape Malays of South Africa for its &quot;bobotie&quot;, &quot;boeber&quot; and &quot;koe&#x27;sister&quot;.

The main characteristic in traditional Malay cuisine is undoubtedly the generous use of spices. The coconut milk is also important in giving the Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is &quot;belacan&quot; (shrimp paste), which is used as a base for &quot;sambal&quot;, a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, chillies, onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of lemongrass and galangal.

Nearly every Malay meal is served with rice, the staple food in many other East Asian cultures. Although there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils. Because most of Malay people are Muslims, Malay cuisine follows Islamic halal dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb meat, and also includes poultry and fishes. Pork and any non-halal meats, also alcohol is prohibited and absent from Malay daily diet.

Nasi lemak, rice cooked in rich coconut milk probably is the most popular dish ubiquitous in Malay town and villages. Nasi lemak is considered as Malaysia&#x27;s national dish. While &quot;Nasi Minyak&quot; and &quot;Nasi Hujan Panas&quot;, rice broiled with ghee and spices is hailed as a ceremonial dish for special occasions, especially during the traditional Malay weddings.

Another example is Ketupat or &quot;nasi himpit&quot;, glutinous compressed rice cooked in palm leaves, is popular especially during &quot;Idul Fitri&quot; or &quot;Hari Raya&quot; or Eid ul-Fitr. Various meats and vegetables could be made into Gulai or Kari, a type of curry dish with variations of spices mixtures that clearly display Indian influence already adopted by Malay people since ancient times. Laksa, a hybrid of Malay and Peranakan Chinese cuisine is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine also adopted and received visible influence from some of their closest neighbours&#x27; cuisine traditions, such as rendang adopted from the Minangkabaus in Pagaruyung, and satay from Java, however Malay people has developed their own distinctive taste and recipes.

===Performing arts===

The Malays have diverse kinds of music and dance which are fusions of different cultural influences. Typical genres range from traditional Malay folk dances dramas like Mak Yong to the Arab-influenced Zapin dances. Choreographed movements also vary from simple steps and tunes in Dikir barat to the complicated moves in Joget Gamelan.

Traditional Malay music is basically percussive. Various kinds of gongs provide the beat for many dances. There are also drums of various sizes, ranging from the large &quot;rebana ubi&quot; used to punctuate important events to the small &quot;jingled-rebana&quot; (frame drum) used as an accompaniment to vocal recitations in religious ceremonies.

Nobat music became part of the Royal Regalia of Malay courts since the arrival of Islam in the 12th century and only performed in important court ceremonies. Its orchestra includes the sacred and highly revered instruments of &quot;nehara&quot; (kettledrums), &quot;gendang&quot; (double-headed drums), &quot;nafiri&quot; (trumpet), &quot;serunai&quot; (oboe), and sometimes a knobbed gong and a pair of cymbals.

Indian influences are strong in a traditional shadow play known as Wayang Kulit where stories from Hindu epics; Ramayana &amp; Mahabharata form the main repertoire. There are four distinctive types of shadow puppet theatre that can be found in Malay Peninsula; &quot;Wayang Gedek&quot;, &quot;Wayang Purwa&quot;, &quot;Wayang Melayu&quot; and &quot;Wayang Siam&quot;. Nonetheless, the art and the storytelling of &quot;Wayang Purwa&quot; and &quot;Wayang Siam&quot; denote a regional influence in fused with the Javanese and Siamese respectively, while &quot;Wayang Melayu&quot; and &quot;Wayang Gedek&quot; narrated a more autochthonously Malay form and fashion.

Other well-known Malay performing arts are; &quot;Bangsawan&quot; theatre, &quot;Dondang Sayang&quot; love ballad and &quot;Mak Inang&quot; dance from Malacca Sultanate, &quot;Jikey&quot; and &quot;Mek Mulung&quot; theatre from Kedah, &quot;Asyik&quot; dance and &quot;Menora&quot; dance drama from Patani and Kelantan, &quot;Ulek mayang&quot; and &quot;Rodat&quot; dance from Terengganu, &quot;Boria&quot; theatre from Penang, &quot;Canggung&quot; dance from Perlis, &quot;Mukun&quot; narrative songs from Brunei and Sarawak, Gending Sriwijaya from Palembang, &quot;Serampang Dua Belas&quot; dance from Serdang.Zapin Api firedance from Riau and Dikir barat Singapura from Singapore.

===Traditional dress===
The traditional Malay apparel and textile has been continuously morphed since the time of antiquity. Historically, the ancient Malays were chronicled to incorporate various natural materials as a vital source for fabrics, clothing and attire. The common era however, witnessing the early arrivals the merchants from east and west to the harbours of Malay Archipelago, together they bought new luxurious items, including fine cotton and silks. The garments subsequently become a source of high Malay fashion and acquired a cultural role as the binding identity in the archipelago, especially in the peninsula, Sumatra and the coastal areas of Borneo.

In Malay culture, clothes and textiles are revered as symbols of beauty, power and status. Numerous accounts in Malay hikayats stressed the special place occupied by textiles. The Malay handloom industry can be traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under Song dynasty. Mentions of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in the Malay Peninsula were made in various Chinese and Arab accounts. Among well-known Malay textiles are Songket, Batik, &quot;Telepok&quot;, &quot;Limar&quot;, &quot;Tenun&quot;, &quot;Kelingkam&quot;, &quot;Cindai&quot;, &quot;Pelangi&quot; and &quot;Tekad&quot;.

Classical Malay dress varies between different regions, but the most profound traditional dress in modern-day are Baju Kurung (for women) and Baju Melayu (for men), which both recognised as the national dress for Malaysia and Brunei, and also worn by Malay communities in Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Myanmar and Thailand.

The word &quot;Baju Kurung&quot;, literary defined as &quot;encase the body&quot; of the wearer is tailored based on the Islamic principles of modesty, decency and humility. The practice is parallel to the Judaeo-Christian religious doctrine, as flaunting the intimate body parts is considered as forbidden in Islam. The interpretation was then absorbed to the Malay way of dressing and cultural perspective, this can be strongly witnessed upon the rule of Mansur Shah of Malacca in the 15th century, the sultan prohibited his female Muslim subjects in the public from wearing only a sarong from the bust downwards. Throughout the ages, The Malay Baju Kurung went into several reincarnation before assuming its current form. Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the archipelago, local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang.

The corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as &quot;Baju Melayu&quot;. The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person&#x27;s marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.

Other common classical Malay attire for men consists of a &quot;baju&quot; (shirt) or &quot;tekua&quot; (a type of a long sleeve shirt), &quot;baju rompi&quot; (vest), &quot;kancing&quot; (button), a small leg &quot;celana&quot; (trousers), a sarong worn around the waist, &quot;capal&quot; (sandal), and a &quot;tanjak&quot; or &quot;tengkolok&quot; (headgear); for the aristocrats, the &quot;baju sikap&quot; or &quot;baju layang&quot; (a type of coat) and &quot;pending&quot; (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a &quot;pendekar&quot; (Malay warrior) to have a Kris tucked into the front fold of sarong.

In contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.

===Festivals and celebrations===

The rise of Islam managed to redefine the Malay identity by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the Islamic calendar, albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of Malay character. The biannual Hari Raya (lit &quot;the Great Day&quot;) observance of Aildifitri and Aidiladha are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of fasting and patience in Ramadan, while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by Ibrahim (Abraham) under the name of Allah.

The &quot;Raya&quot; holidays usually commenced during the event known as Balik Kampung or &quot;Balik Raya&quot; which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by performing the Eid prayers, holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.
Other major liturgical and religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include Ramadhan, a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; Maulidur Rasul, a special grand procession to honour the birth of Muhammad; Ashura, remembrance of Muharram where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as &quot;Bubur Ashura&quot;; Nisfu Syaaban, the Mid-Sha&#x27;ban observance, a special day of fasting for forgiveness; Nuzul Quran, the first revelation of the Quran; Israk dan Mikraj, the ascension of Muhammad to the heavens and Awal Muharram, the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special &quot;sunat&quot; prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the mosque.

There are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals and social events within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the &quot;Mandi Safar&quot; or &quot;Puja Pantai&quot; ceremony, a purifying bath during the Islamic month of Safar, originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals, akin to the Belimau tradition before Ramadan; and &quot;Pesta Menuai&quot;, a harvest festival celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, Joget and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.

The Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual rite of passage as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised &quot;kenduri&quot;, a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from &quot;Doa Selamat&quot; (asking for divine favour and protection), &quot;Kesyukuran&quot; (for thanksgiving and gratitude), &quot;Melenggang Perut&quot; (ceremonial massage for a mother who is pregnant with her first child), &quot;Aqiqah&quot; and &quot;Cukur Jambul&quot; (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), &quot;Bertindik&quot; (the first piercing ceremony for a female child), &quot;Khatam&quot; (a graduation ceremony, after a child&#x27;s first full-reading of the Quran), &quot;Khatan&quot; (circumcision), &quot;Kahwin&quot; (wedding), &quot;Arwah&quot; or &quot;Tahlil&quot; (prayers for a deceased person), among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as &quot;Rewang&quot; or &quot;Gotong-royong&quot;. During this ceremony, the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of urbanism in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of &quot;Rewang/Gotong-Royong&quot; is gradually superseded by hired-caterer services by the family.

===Martial arts===

Silat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the Malay Peninsula (including Singapore), the Riau Islands, Sumatra and coastal areas of Borneo. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of Langkasuka (2nd century) and Srivijaya (7th century).

The influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, Johor, Pattani and Brunei has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary Laksamana Hang Tuah of Malacca is one of the most renowned &quot;pesilat&quot; (Silat practitioners) in history and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat. Since the classical era, Silat Melayu underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian Pencak Silat and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.

Apart from Silat, Tomoi is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay Peninsula. It is a variant of Indo-Chinese forms of kickboxing which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of Funan Empire (68 CE).

===Metal working===

Upon the turn of the 17th century, gold, silver, iron and brass have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A multitude of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as Keris made of iron, down to the elaborate fine jewellery made from gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental Belt buckle embellished with precious stones), &quot;keronsang&quot; (brooch) and &quot;cucuk sanggul&quot; (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, &quot;Tepak sirih&quot; (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of working gold was predominantly done by repoussé and granulation techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed today. In the contemporary era, Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.

For the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted by repousse, filigree and niello techniques. The common traditional Malay items usually made of silver include pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The &quot;Awan Larat&quot; (cloud patterns) and &quot;Kerawang&quot; (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.

The usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for decorative purposes. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in religious and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for Tepak Sireh, a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as Gongs for the classical Malay Gamelan orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.

===Weaponry===
The Keris is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the Javanese down south, the spread of the kris to other nations such as Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, was credited to the growing influence of the Majapahit Empire in Java around the year 1492. By the time of Malacca in the 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as in integral part of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.

During the classical era, a Malay man was not seen without a Keris outside of his house. The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: &quot;Keris Pusaka&quot; (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), &quot;Keris Pangkat&quot; (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and &quot;Keris Perjuangan Dirinya&quot; (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris. The blade of a Kris is usually coated with poisonous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey. Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a spirit, known as &quot;semangat&quot;. Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guard the &quot;soul&quot; of the weapon. The spiritual approach is usually held every &quot;Malam Jumaat&quot; (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with lime and smoked with incense, dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to complement the mystic ritual.
The Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical values pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by carrying their weapon that position, it would confuse the enemy.

Paradoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the hilt of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a reconciliation.

There are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: &quot;Tuju&quot; (&quot;Direct&quot;, the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay cannons of &quot;Meriam&quot;, &quot;Ekor Lotong&quot;, &quot;Lela&quot; and &quot;Rentaka&quot;), &quot;Bidik&quot; (&quot;Gun&quot;, a weapon with metal tube propelled by an ammunition, with the Malay forms of &quot;Terakor&quot; and &quot;Istingar&quot;), &quot;Setubuh&quot; (&quot;A body&quot;, weapon in the similar dimension of a human body, referred to the Malay spears of &quot;Tongkat Panjang&quot; and &quot;Lembing&quot;), &quot;Selengan&quot; (&quot;An arm&quot;, a large saber from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of &quot;Pedang&quot; and &quot;Sundang&quot;), &quot;Setangan&quot; (&quot;A hand&quot;, a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including &quot;Badik Panjang&quot; and &quot;Tekpi&quot;), &quot;Sepegang&quot; (&quot;A hold&quot;, smaller than the &quot;Setangan&quot;, a dagger with &quot;Keris&quot; and &quot;Badik&quot; in the category) and &quot;Segenggam&quot; (&quot;A grab&quot;, the smallest in the category, the hand-sized blade, including &quot;Lawi Ayam&quot;, &quot;Kerambit&quot;, &quot;Kuku Macan&quot; and &quot;Kapak Binjai&quot;). Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes &quot;sumpit&quot; (Blowpipe) and &quot;Busur dan Panah&quot; (Bow and Arrow), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy &quot;Zirah&quot;, a type of &quot;Baju Besi&quot; (armour) and &quot;Perisai&quot; (shield) as defense mechanisms during the armed conflict.

===Traditional games===

Traditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. &quot;Sepak Raga&quot; and kite flying are among traditional games that were mentioned in the Malay Annals being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.

&quot;Sepak Raga&quot; is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as Malaysia&#x27;s national sport and played in the international sporting events such as Asian Games and Southeast Asian Games.

Other popular game is &quot;Gasing&quot; spinning which usually played after the harvest season. A great skill of craftsmanship is required to produce the most competitive &quot;Gasing&quot; (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.

Possibly the most popular Malay games is the &quot;Wau&quot; (a unique kind of kite from the east coast of the Malay Peninsula) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (&quot;Wau&quot; are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all Malay kites are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.

The Malays also have a variant of Mancala board game known as Congkak. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since Ancient Egypt.
As the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.

===Names and titles===

Malay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. Naming has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected to over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of their indigenous Malay and Sanskrit influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured Arabic names as marks of their religion.

Malay names are patronymic and can consiste of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual&#x27;s male parentage. Some given names and father&#x27;s names can be composed of double names and even triple names, thereby generating a longer name. For example, one Malaysian national footballer has the full name Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak, where &#x27;Mohd Zaquan Adha&#x27; is his triple given name and &#x27;Abdul Radzak&#x27; is his father&#x27;s double given name.

In addition to naming system, the Malay language also has an elaborate system of titles and honorifics, which are still extensively used in Malaysia and Brunei. By applying these Malay titles to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former Prime Minister of Malaysia has the full name Dato&#x27; Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, where &#x27;Dato&#x27; Seri&#x27; is a Malay title of honour, &#x27;Mohd Najib&#x27; is his personal name, &#x27;bin&#x27; is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning &quot;son of&quot; if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word &quot;bintun&quot; meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;, introduces his father&#x27;s titles and names, &#x27;Tun&#x27; is a higher honour, &#x27;Haji&#x27; denotes his father&#x27;s Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and &#x27;Abdul Razak&#x27; is his father&#x27;s personal name.
The more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalty. The former Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia has the full regnal name Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri&#x27;ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta&#x27;in Billah, while the reigning Sultan of Brunei officially known as Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu&#x27;izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar &#x27;Ali Saifuddien Sa&#x27;adul Khairi Waddien.

==Sub-ethnic groups==
Although only constituting 3.4% of the total population, ethnic Malays are one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. As shown on the map, outside the Indonesian Archipelago, the Malay people inhabit the Malay Peninsula, forming the dominant ethnic group in Peninsular Malaysia and a significant minority in Singapore, Thailand and southern Myanmar. The corridor of Bornean Malay territories begins north from southwestern Sabah, continues with the country of Brunei Darussalam, coastal Sarawak and continues down to Kalimantan.

<doc id="279722" wikidata="Q573631" url="?curid=279722" title="Fredholm operator">
<text>In mathematics, Fredholm operators are certain operators that arise in the Fredholm theory of integral equations. They are named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm. By definition, a Fredholm operator is a bounded linear operator &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; between two Banach spaces with finite-dimensional kernel formula_1 and finite-dimensional (algebraic) cokernel formula_2, and with closed range formula_3. The last condition is actually redundant.

The &quot;index&quot; of a Fredholm operator is the integer

:formula_4

or in other words,

:formula_5

==Properties==
Intuitively, Fredholm operators are those operators that are invertible &quot;if finite-dimensional effects are ignored.&quot; The formally correct statement follows. A bounded operator &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; between Banach spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is Fredholm if and only if it is invertible modulo compact operators, i.e., if there exists a bounded linear operator

:formula_6

such that

:formula_7

are compact operators on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; respectively.

If a Fredholm operator is modified slightly, it stays Fredholm and its index remains the same. Formally: The set of Fredholm operators from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is open in the Banach space L(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) of bounded linear operators, equipped with the operator norm, and the index is locally constant. More precisely, if &quot;T&quot;0 is Fredholm from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;, there exists &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 such that every &quot;T&quot; in L(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) with ||&quot;T&quot; − &quot;T&quot;0|| &lt; &quot;ε&quot; is Fredholm, with the same index as that of &quot;T&quot;0.

When &quot;T&quot; is Fredholm from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;U&quot; Fredholm from &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;, then the composition formula_8 is Fredholm from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; and

:formula_9

When &quot;T&quot; is Fredholm, the transpose (or adjoint) operator is Fredholm from to , and . When &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Hilbert spaces, the same conclusion holds for the Hermitian adjoint &quot;T&quot;∗.

When &quot;T&quot; is Fredholm and &quot;K&quot; a compact operator, then &quot;T&quot; + &quot;K&quot; is Fredholm. The index of &quot;T&quot; remains unchanged under such a compact perturbations of &quot;T&quot;. This follows from the fact that the index &quot;i&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) of is an integer defined for every &quot;s&quot; in [0, 1], and &quot;i&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is locally constant, hence &quot;i&quot;(1) = &quot;i&quot;(0).

Invariance by perturbation is true for larger classes than the class of compact operators. For example, when &quot;U&quot; is Fredholm and &quot;T&quot; a strictly singular operator, then &quot;T&quot; + &quot;U&quot; is Fredholm with the same index. The class of inessential operators, which properly contains the class of strictly singular operators, is the &quot;perturbation class&quot; for Fredholm operators. This means an operator formula_10 is inessential if and only if &quot;T+U&quot; is Fredholm for every Fredholm operator formula_11.

==Examples==
Let formula_12 be a Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis formula_13 indexed by the non negative integers. The (right) shift operator &quot;S&quot; on &quot;H&quot; is defined by

:formula_14

This operator &quot;S&quot; is injective (actually, isometric) and has a closed range of codimension 1, hence &quot;S&quot; is Fredholm with formula_15. The powers formula_16, formula_17, are Fredholm with index formula_18. The adjoint &quot;S*&quot; is the left shift,

:formula_19

The left shift &quot;S*&quot; is Fredholm with index 1.

If &quot;H&quot; is the classical Hardy space formula_20 on the unit circle T in the complex plane, then the shift operator with respect to the orthonormal basis of complex exponentials

:formula_21

is the multiplication operator &quot;M&quot;&quot;φ&quot; with the function formula_22. More generally, let &quot;φ&quot; be a complex continuous function on T that does not vanish on formula_23, and let &quot;T&quot;&quot;φ&quot; denote the Toeplitz operator with symbol &quot;φ&quot;, equal to multiplication by &quot;φ&quot; followed by the orthogonal projection formula_24:

:formula_25

Then &quot;T&quot;&quot;φ&quot; is a Fredholm operator on formula_20, with index related to the winding number around 0 of the closed path formula_27: the index of &quot;T&quot;&quot;φ&quot;, as defined in this article, is the opposite of this winding number.

==Applications==
Any elliptic operator can be extended to a Fredholm operator. The use of Fredholm operators in partial differential equations is an abstract form of the parametrix method.

The Atiyah-Singer index theorem gives a topological characterization of the index of certain operators on manifolds.

The Atiyah-Jänich theorem identifies the K-theory &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of a compact topological space &quot;X&quot; with the set of homotopy classes of continuous maps from &quot;X&quot; to the space of Fredholm operators &quot;H&quot;→&quot;H&quot;, where &quot;H&quot; is the separable Hilbert space and the set of these operators carries the operator norm.

== Generalizations ==

=== Semi-Fredholm operators ===
A bounded linear operator &quot;T&quot; is called semi-Fredholm if its range is closed and at least one of formula_1, formula_29 is finite-dimensional. For a semi-Fredholm operator, the index is defined by

:formula_30

===Unbounded operators===
One may also define unbounded Fredholm operators. Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be two Banach spaces.

# The closed linear operator formula_31 is called &quot;Fredholm&quot; if its domain formula_32 is dense in formula_33, its range is closed, and both kernel and cokernel of &quot;T&quot; are finite-dimensional.
#formula_31 is called &quot;semi-Fredholm&quot; if its domain formula_32 is dense in formula_33, its range is closed, and either kernel or cokernel of &quot;T&quot; (or both) is finite-dimensional.

As it was noted above, the range of a closed operator is closed as long as the cokernel is finite-dimensional (Edmunds and Evans, Theorem I.3.2).

<text>Antoine de Rivarol (26 June 175311 April 1801) was a French royalist writer and translator who lived during the Revolutionary era. He was briefly married to the translator Louisa Henrietta de Rivarol.

==Biography==
Rivarol was born in Bagnols, Languedoc. It appears that his father, an innkeeper, was a cultivated man. The son assumed the title of comte de Rivarol, asserting a connection with the noble Italian family Riveroli, although his enemies said his name was really &quot;Riverot&quot; and that he was not of noble stock. He went to Paris in 1777 and won several academic prizes.

In 1780 he married Louisa Henrietta de Rivarol, a translator of Scottish descent. She had translated some works by Samuel Johnson and Johnson had become a friend of her family. Antoine Rivarol abandoned his wife after a short relationship which resulted in the birth of a son. To Rivarol&#x27;s embarrassment, a nurse who supported his abandoned wife was awarded the Montyon Prize for her humanity. He was divorced in 1784.

In 1784, his &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;Universalité de la Langue Française&quot; and his translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; were favourably noted. The year before the French Revolution broke out, he and Champcenetz published a lampoon, titled &quot;Petit Almanach de nos grands hommes pour 1788&quot;, that ridiculed without pity a number of writers of proven or future talent, along with a great many nobodies.

Rivarol was the foremost journalist, commentator and epigrammatist among that faction of aristocrats which was most stalwartly conservative: he heaped scorn upon republicanism and defended the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;.

Rivarol&#x27;s writing was published in the &quot;Journal Politique&quot; of Antoine Sabatier de Castres and the &quot;Actes des Apotres&quot; of Jean Gabriel Peltier. He left France in 1792, first settling in Brussels, then moving successively to London, Hamburg, and Berlin, where he died. Rivarol&#x27;s rivals in France – in sharp conversational sayings – included Alexis Piron and Nicolas Chamfort.

His brother, Claude François Rivarol (1762–1848), was also an author. His works include a novel, &quot;Isman, ou le Fatalisme&quot; (1795); a comedy, &quot;Le Véridique&quot; (1827); and the history &quot;Essai sur les Causes de la Révolution Française&quot; (1827).

He died as exile in Berlin and was interred in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery, but the site of his grave was soon forgotten.

<text>United Torah Judaism (, &quot;Yahadut HaTora&quot;) is a Haredi, religious conservative political alliance in Israel. The alliance, consisting of Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah, was first formed in 1992, in order to maximize Ashkenazi Haredi representation in the Knesset. Despite the alliance splitting in 2004 over rabbinical differences, the parties reconciled in 2006, in order to prevent vote-wasting. In April 2019, the party achieved its highest number of seats ever, receiving eight seats.

Unlike similar religiously-oriented parties like Shas, Mafdal and Noam, UTJ is non-Zionist. Unlike some other Haredim, the party is notable for its usage of technology and electronic communication.

== History ==

Before the establishment of Degel HaTorah and the formation of United Torah Judaism, the two factions were united under one united Agudat Yisrael party, but the late mentor and supreme guide of the non-Hasidic group, Rabbi Elazar Shach, broke away from the Hasidic wing when he concluded that the party was not representing all Ashkenazi Haredim. At that point, he split from them, and created the &quot;Degel HaTorah&quot; party for the &quot;Lithuanian&quot; Haredi Jews (also known as &quot;Mitnagdim&quot; by some). He chose the name Degel HaTorah, meaning &quot;Flag of The Torah&quot;, to be a contrast to the well-known flag of Israel and its connection with the secular-dominated State of Israel (an &quot;anti-Torah&quot; entity, in his opinion). Rabbi Shach was known as an outspoken critic of the secular Israeli way of life.

The UTJ party also had considerable influence on the Israeli Sephardi Jews&#x27; Shas party. In fact, the Shas party was founded by Rabbi Shach at an earlier juncture when he was previously also frustrated with the policies of the Hasidic rebbes; so, he turned to the Sephardic Jews, and urged his own Ashkenazi followers at that time, to vote for the new Shas party, which they did in record numbers. Later, Shas broke with Rabbi Shach, as it adopted its own independent political stance under Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Yet, Shas generally goes in the same direction, as it has similar values, needs and interests within the state.

&quot;Haaretz&quot; cited that some women activists have protested the fact that UTJ, along with other Haredi parties, refuses to run female candidates for office. UTJ responded that they have the right to follow the Jewish laws of modesty, which separates roles of men and women, and maintain that they do not deny women the right to vote for any other Knesset parties of their choice. They add that Haredi women will not vote for them if they elect women.

=== 2004 split ===
In January 2004, the party split back into its two factions following a disagreement over how to join Ariel Sharon&#x27;s coalition, which had been negotiated by Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Rabbi Eliashiv wanted the five MKs to have a three-month &quot;waiting period&quot; before accepting jobs in the government. Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter, the Gerrer rebbe, however, thought that all Agudat members should accept positions immediately. The Agudat MKs argued that they should be entitled to follow their own rabbis&#x27; ruling, while their Degel HaTorah counterparts accused them of disrespecting Rabbi Eliashiv. The Agudat faction proceeded to follow the rebbe of Ger&#x27;s instructions, with MK Yaakov Litzman accepting the position as chairman of the Knesset Finance Committee. This infuriated Degel HaTorah and its leaders, and in response, they left the party, dissolving a twelve-year-old partnership.

=== Re-unification as a party ===
In December 2005, there was a meeting between representatives of the two factions, presumably to smooth over the ill-feelings of the previous year and to attempt to re-group before the March 2006 elections. A number of issues were worked out, such as Degel HaTorah&#x27;s insistence on the joint list being equally divided between the two parties. (In the past, Agudat Israel has received slightly more votes than Degel HaTorah.) Degel HaTorah has re-organized itself. It has a fully equipped modern party office on Hamabit Street 10 in Jerusalem&#x27;s Geula neighborhood. It conducted a party convention, its first in 15 years, in December 2005.

In early February 2006, Agudat Israel and Degel HaTorah agreed to run together as United Torah Judaism, despite the fact that the contentious &quot;sixth seat&quot; issue remained undecided. The two groups finally compromised by proposing dividing the sixth seat between two representatives on a rotating schedule (as was done in the last Knesset between the Belz and Vizhnitz communities for the fifth seat). This solution seemed to mollify the respective groups, and paved the way for the re-establishment of a joint list for the 2006 elections, although the Belz court was reportedly irked that once again, it was being asked to sacrifice part of its representation.

UTJ MKs told reporters that any decision to join future government coalitions will be dependent on achieving two &quot;central posts&quot; to be split between Agudah and Degel. Similarly, in order to avoid the problems that led to the 2004 split, disagreements about joining a coalition will not be determined by a majority vote of MKs, but rather taken to the party&#x27;s rabbinic leaders.

Various media interviews with the party&#x27;s Knesset members confirmed that it would strongly consider joining a coalition with the Ehud Olmert-led Kadima party, should it be offered to them after the elections. In March 2006, the rabbinical leaders of UTJ, including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, issued public declarations urging the Haredi public to vote for the party&#x27;s list. In the election, the party increased its mandate by one, to six seats.

== Ideology ==

UTJ wants to maintain a status quo relationship in regard to religion-and-state issues. The party has no uniform opinion on the issue of increasing settlements in the West Bank.

== Structure and constituency ==
UTJ has always been a coalition of two individual parties, choosing to take advantage of Israeli election law in order to maximize the number of seats it can gain in the Knesset (and thus maximize its influence):
* The Agudat Yisrael (&quot;Union of Israel&quot;) party that is guided by the followers of Hasidism in Israel, and also consisting of Ashkenazi Jews. The leading members of this party are the followers of the Ger, Vizhnitz, and Belz Hasidim.
* The Degel HaTorah (&quot;Banner of the Torah&quot;) party that is guided by the rabbinic heads (usually the leading rosh yeshivas (&quot;deans&quot;) of the Lithuanian yeshivas) of non-Hasidic Haredi Ashkenazi Jews.

The Agudat Yisrael faction takes its directions from the Hasidic rebbes of Ger (Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter), Vizhnitz (Rabbi Yisroel Hager), and Belz (Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach). Policy decisions are also weighed and decided by a Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (&quot;Council of Torah Sages&quot;), a council of communal rabbis, made up of mostly senior and elderly rebbes.

Degel HaTorah&#x27;s pre-eminent sages are Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein, of Bnei Brak. Policy decisions are also weighed and decided by their own &quot;Moetzes&quot; (Council) of experienced communal rabbis, made up of mostly senior and elderly rosh yeshivas.

<text>Pa Hin Ngam () is a national park in Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. &quot;Hin ngam&quot; means &quot;beautiful stone&quot;, &quot;pa&quot; means &quot;forest&quot;. The park got its name from the strange rock formations at the west end of the park. Erosion has carved several large rocks into striking and unusual shapes.

In 1985, the Tep Satit Forestry Department first surveyed the area, long popular with locals, and recommended its protection. In October 1986, Pa Hin Ngam Park was created, covering 10 km2 around the strange rock formations which gave the park its name. In 1993, the Forestry Department of Thailand conducted a more thorough survey including the surrounding area, and recommended that it become a national park. The national park covering 62,437 rai ~ was created on 19 September 1994, which was officially gazetted in 2007.

The park is at the boundary of the Dong Phaya Yen Mountains and the Khorat Plateau. The steep cliff at the 846 m high Sut Phan Din viewpoint affords a view into a valley of the Sonthi River and the Sap Langka Wildlife Sanctuary. The name &quot;Sut Phan Din&quot; (สุดแผ่นดิน) means &quot;end of land&quot;, reflecting the steepness of the cliff. This cliff also marks the watershed between the Chao Phraya and the Mekong rivers.

* Lan Hin Ngam (ลานหินงาม) It was caused by the erosion of the soil and rocks into different shapes, which can be imagined as many kinds of objects and animals such as nails, radar, and hens.
* Dok Kra Jiao or Bua Sawan Field (ทุ่งดอกกระเจียว หรือ ทุ่งบัวสวรรค์) Kra Jiao, a kind of curcuma, is an annual plant in the same species as ginger-galingale, scattered generally from Lan Hin Ngam to the Sut Phaendin viewpoint. Near the viewpoint is one of the fields of the Siam tulip (&quot;Curcuma alismatifolia&quot;), called &quot;Dok Kra Jiao&quot; (ดอกกระเจียว) in Thai. The dipterocarp forests bloom with the purple flowers at the beginning of the rainy season in July.
* Sut Phaendin (สุดแผ่นดิน) is a steep cliff and the highest point of the Phang Hoei mountain range, two kilometres from the park office at 846 metres elevation. It is the cliff connecting between the central and northeastern regions.
* Namtok Thep Phana (น้ำตกเทพพนา) is a medium-size waterfall originating from Huai Krachon flowing from the Phang Hoei mountain range. It has three tiers. There is water only during the rainy season.

<text>Evin Prison () is a prison located in the Evin neighborhood of Tehran, Iran. The prison has been the primary site for the housing of Iran&#x27;s political prisoners since 1972, before and after the Iranian Revolution, in a purpose-built wing nicknamed &quot;Evin University&quot; due to the high number of students and intellectuals detained there. Evin Prison has been accused of committing &quot;serious human rights abuses&quot; against its political dissidents and critics of the government.

==History==
Evin Prison was constructed in 1972 under the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It is located at the foot of the Alborz mountains on the former home of Ziaeddin Tabatabaee, who briefly served as prime minister in the 1920s.

The prison grounds include an execution yard, a courtroom, and separate blocks for common criminals and female inmates. It was originally operated by the Shah&#x27;s security and intelligence service, SAVAK. It was initially designed to house 320 inmates—20 in solitary cells and 300 in two large communal blocks—and was expanded to hold more than 1,500 prisoners, including 100 solitary cells for political prisoners, by 1977. On 11 February 1979, during the Iranian Revolution, crowds of rebels stormed the prison and freed all the inmates.

Under the Islamic Republic of Iran, the prison population was again expanded, to 15,000 inmates. According to scholar Ervand Abrahamian: &quot;In theory, Evin was a detention center for those awaiting trial&quot;, after which the prisoners would be transferred to another prison, either Qezel Hesar or Gohardasht Prison. &quot;In reality, Evin served as a regular prison, as many waited years before being brought to trial&quot;. Prominent prisoners often served their entire sentences in Evin. Executions were carried out at Evin. Following the Islamic Revolution, Mohammad Kachouyi was made warden of Evin. After his assassination in June 1981, Asadollah Lajevardi, the chief prosecutor of Tehran, served as warden until 1985. In 1998, the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran assassinated Lajevardi.

The prison is located in a residential and commercial area known as Evin, next to the Saadat Abad district. A large park area with a popular upscale teahouse and restaurant is immediately next to it. Photography in front of and around the prison is forbidden. Prisoners from Evin and Ghezel Hesar prison are to be transferred eventually to the Central Prison of Tehran, also known as Fashafaviye or Fashafoyeh.

Iran&#x27;s judicial system is based on &quot;sharia&quot; (Islamic) law. The system is supervised by the Minister of Justice and the chief public prosecutor, appointed by the Supreme Leader.

===2022 fire===

On 15 October 2022, amidst the Mahsa Amini protests, a severe fire started in this prison, and the sound of security forces shooting was heard from inside the prison during numerous clashes with prisoners. The Center for Human Rights in Iran confirmed that it had received reports that there was a &quot;gun battle&quot; in Evin prison on Saturday night that was continuing at 22:00 local time. Videos shared on social media on Saturday showed smoke rising from the prison. Repeated gunfire, as well as anti-government chants, could also be heard in the videos. The media affiliated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the government reported the conflict and fire in the prison. According to the Judiciary Media Center, during a fight between several prisoners in Ward 6 and Ward 7, both of which are special prisons for financial convictions and theft, the sewing workshop of the prison caught fire. The families of prisoners in Evin and various others gathered near the prison. Government forces used tear gas against them in response. The security forces also blocked Yadegar-e-Emam Expressway to prevent people from approaching. Anti-government slogans can be heard in videos taken around the prison.

==Prisoners==
===1970s and 1980s===

Notable prisoners at Evin before the 1979 revolution include Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani and Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri. A prisoner held after the Islamic revolution was Marina Nemat, who spent two years in Evin starting in 1982 for participating in anti-regime protests at her school. She has written about her torture and the death of her fellow students at the prison. In her 2013 memoir, &quot;Face to Face with the Beast: Iranian Women in Mullahs&#x27; Prisons&quot;, the former Iranian nurse Hengameh Haj Hassan wrote about her incarceration in Evin prison in 1981, after being arrested for suspected connections with the Mojahedin. She described a system in which female inmates were frequently and systematically tortured by members of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard, mostly by being beaten on the soles of their feet with cables. She also describes mass executions:&quot;In Unit 209, every day about 6.00pm, at dinner time, we heard an enormous and deafening noise, like a lorry shedding a heavy load of metal... It was the discharge of tens of firearms being fired at once on our friends.&quot;

===2000s===

He was sentenced to death by hanging, but due to the raising of human rights campaigns initiated by members of the public, the Iranian Justice System was pushed to reduce the sentence to 3 months of jail time and a US$100,000 penalty, conditional upon totally ceasing all his musical activities. Tavakoli continues his work outside Iran, a renowned record producer.

The memoir is the basis of the film &quot;Rosewater&quot;, which was written and directed by former &quot;The Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart.

Their families say they crossed the border accidentally, but a top Iranian prosecutor last month accused the three of spying.&quot; In December 2009, Iran&#x27;s foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said the three would be put on trial, in a move that coincided with other points of contention between the two countries. Sarah Shourd was freed on bail on 14 September 2010. Two days earlier, the three Americans had been charged with espionage by Iranian prosecutors. Bauer and Fattal were released in September 2011.

After having his family threatened by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security while he was in Paris, he returned to Iran. In October 2011, security agents raided his parents&#x27; home and arrested him without a charge. He was put in solitary confinement at the Evin Prison in section 240, reserved for political prisoners, where he endured psychological torture, and then charged with espionage and embezzlement. Revolutionary Court judge Salavati then sentenced him without due process of law or access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to two years in prison for espionage and one year and ten months for embezzlement. The court then acquitted him of embezzlement, but even though the sentence was revoked, he was unlawfully kept for another 13 months in prison and was fined. He was later released on bail for good conduct.

From February to April 2018, Sufis activist Kasra Nouri during the 2018 Dervish protests was held in Evin, primarily in solitary confinement. He was later transferred to Fashafoyeh Prison, but was sent back to Evin in January 2021.

In February 2022, Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele, who was working as a volunteer for Relief International in Iran, was arrested with &quot;espionage&quot; charges, and subsequently detained at Evin Prison. After being initially sentenced to 40 years in prison for spying, money laundering and currency smuggling in January 2023, Vandecasteele was freed in May of the same year, following a prisoner swap for Iranian ex-diplomat Asadollah Asadi.

On 28 September 2022, 30-year-old Italian travel blogger Alessia Piperno was arrested in Tehran and detained at Evin Prison, in the midst of the Mahsa Amini protests; following diplomatic negotiations between the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Iranian authorities, Piperno was released and returned to Rome on 10 November.

Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old Italian journalist and war correspondent, was arrested in Tehran on 19 December 2024, while reporting in the capital. Her arrest was kept secret even in Italy so as not to hinder diplomatic work, and was only made public on December 27. Sala, who works for the newspaper Il Foglio and the podcast company Chora Media, was held in solitary confinement until the penultimate day of her detention, which lasted 21 days. She was interrogated every day for the first two weeks, less often on the remaining days, and for 10 consecutive hours on the last day. She was freed by the Italian secret services on January 8, 2025 through intense diplomatic work. The unclear official circumstances of her detention prompting calls for her release from international press freedom organizations. In fact, she had been taken hostage to obtain the release of the Iranian-Swiss citizen Mohammad Abedini Najafabadi, accused by the USA of terrorism and arrested at Milan Malpensa airport on December 16, three days before Sala. Than released back to Iran on 12 January.

===Allegations of rape and torture===
In August 2009, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a live broadcast on state radio on rape and torture in Iranian prisons, &quot;In some detention centers, inappropriate measures have taken place for which the enemy was again responsible.&quot;

Following the 2009 Iranian presidential election and subsequent protests, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to senior cleric and former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Karroubi said this was a &quot;fragment&quot; of the evidence he had and that if the denials did not stop, he would release even more.

It is said that interrogators have used rape in Iran for decades. During the 1980s, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s deputy, to write to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: &quot;Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?&quot; Two prominent members of Iran&#x27;s human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic.

In August 2021, a &quot;hacktivist&quot; group, going by the name &quot;&quot; (), leaked CCTV footage showing the mistreatment of inmates, including a cleric walking over the body of an elderly man, who was dragged across the institution by prison guards. The head of Iran&#x27;s prison system, Mohammad Mehdi Haj-Mohammadi, apologized for incident.

<text>Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope, aka Charles Mahon, 3rd Earl Stanhope, FRS (3 August 175315 December 1816), was a British , inventor, and scientist. He was the father of Lady Hester Stanhope and brother-in-law of William Pitt the Younger. He is sometimes confused with an exact contemporary of his, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington.

==Early life==
The son of Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl Stanhope, he was educated at Eton and the University of Geneva. While in Geneva, he devoted himself to the study of mathematics under Georges-Louis Le Sage, and acquired from Switzerland an intense love of liberty.

==Politics==

In politics he was a democrat. As Lord Mahon he contested the Westminster without success in 1774, when only just of age; but from the general election of 1780 until his accession to the peerage on 7 March 1786 he represented through the influence of Lord Shelburne the Buckinghamshire borough of High Wycombe. During the sessions of 1783 and 1784 he supported William Pitt the Younger, whose sister, Lady Hester Pitt, he married on 19 December 1774. He was close enough to be singled out for ridicule in the &quot;Rolliad&quot;:

:——This Quixote of the Nation
:Beats his own Windmills in gesticulation;
:To &quot;strike&quot;, not &quot;please&quot;, his utmost force he bends,
:And all his sense is at his fingers&#x27; ends, &amp;c. &amp;c.

When Pitt strayed from the Liberal principles of his early days, his brother-in-law severed their political connection and opposed the arbitrary measures which the ministry favoured. Lord Stanhope&#x27;s character was generous, and his conduct consistent; but his speeches were not influential.

He was the chairman of the &quot;Revolution Society,&quot; founded in honour of the Glorious Revolution of 1688; the members of the society in 1790 expressed their sympathy with the aims of the French Revolution. In 1794 Stanhope supported Thomas Muir, one of the Edinburgh politicians who were transported to Botany Bay; and in 1795 he introduced into the Lords a motion deprecating any interference with the internal affairs of France. In all these points he was hopelessly beaten, and in the last of them he was in a &quot;minority of one&quot;—a sobriquet which stuck to him throughout life—whereupon he seceded from parliamentary life for five years.

==Business, science and writing==
Stanhope was an accomplished scientist. This started at the University of Geneva where he studied mathematics under Georges-Louis Le Sage. Electricity was another of the subjects which he studied, and the volume of &quot;Principles of Electricity&quot; which he issued in 1779 contained the rudiments of his theory on the &quot;return stroke&quot; resulting from the contact with the earth of the electric current of lightning, which were afterwards amplified in a contribution to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1787. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society so early as November 1772, and devoted a large part of his income to experiments in science and philosophy. He invented a method of securing buildings from fire (which, however, proved impracticable), the first iron printing press, a method to produce plaster molds of pages to be printed and then cast solid metal printing plates from them (stereotype matrix and stereotype plate), and the lens, all of which bear his name, as well as a monochord for tuning musical instruments, improvements in canal locks, experiments in steam navigation in 1795–1797, and two calculating machines (first in 1775). He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, elected in 1774.

When he acquired extensive property in Devon, Stanhope projected a canal through that county from the Bristol to the English Channel and took the levels himself.

His principal labours in literature consisted of a reply to Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the French Revolution&quot; (1790) and an &quot;Essay&quot; on the rights of juries (1792), and he long meditated the compilation of a digest of the statutes.

Stanhope was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.

==Marriages and children==
Stanhope married twice. Firstly on 19 December 1774 to Lady Hester Pitt (19 October 175520 July 1780), daughter of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (&quot;Pitt the Elder&quot;), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, by whom he had three daughters:
*Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope (1776–1839) a traveller and Arabist who died unmarried at the age of 63 in Syria.
*Lady Griselda Stanhope (21 July 177813 October 1851), wife of John Tekell.
*Lady Lucy Rachel Stanhope (20 February 17801 March 1814) who eloped with Thomas Taylor of Sevenoaks, the family apothecary, following which her father refused to be reconciled to her; but Pitt made her husband Controller-General of Customs and his son was one of the Earl of Chatham&#x27;s executors.
Secondly in 1781 he married Louisa Grenville (1758–1829), daughter and sole heiress of the Hon. Henry Grenville (Governor of Barbados in 1746 and ambassador to the Ottoman Porte in 1762), a younger brother of Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, and of George Grenville. She survived him and died in March 1829. By her he had three sons:

*Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope (1781–1855), eldest son and heir, who inherited many of his father&#x27;s scientific tastes.
*Maj. Hon. Charles Banks Stanhope (3 June 178516 January 1809), aide-de-camp to John Moore. He was killed at the Battle of Corunna
*Lt Col Hon. James Hamilton Stanhope (1788–1825) captain and lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Foot Guards.

==Death and succession==

Lord Stanhope died at the family seat of Chevening, Kent, and was succeeded by his eldest who shared much of his father&#x27;s scientific interest but is known also for his association with Kaspar Hauser. His monument at Chevening was sculpted by Josephus Pinnix Kendrick.

<text>Sir Milton Augustus Strieby Margai (7 December 1895 – 28 April 1964) was a Sierra Leonean physician and politician who served as the country&#x27;s head of government from 1954 until his death in 1964. He was titled chief minister from 1954 to 1960, and then prime minister from 1961 onwards. Margai studied medicine in England, and upon returning to his homeland became a prominent public health campaigner. He entered politics as the founder and inaugural leader of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party. Margai oversaw Sierra Leone&#x27;s transition to independence, which occurred in 1961. He died in office aged 68, and was succeeded as prime minister by his brother Albert. Margai enjoyed the support of Sierra Leoneans across classes, who respected his moderate style, friendly demeanor, and political savvy.

== Early life ==

Milton Augustus Strieby Margai was born on 7 December 1895 in the village of Gbangbatoke, Moyamba District, in the Southern Province of British Sierra Leone to Mende parents. He was the oldest of eighteen children. At the time of his birth, Sierra Leone was a British protectorate. His father was M.E.S. Margai, an affluent trader from Bonthe District. His grandfather was a Mende warrior chief. Margai received his primary education at the Evangelical United Brethren School in Bonthe, Bonthe District. He graduated from the Albert Academy in Freetown.

In 1921, Margai earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Fourah Bay College. Margai went to medical school in England and graduated as a medical doctor from the Durham University College of Medicine (which went on to become Newcastle University Medical School) in 1926. Margai also attended the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. He became the first doctor from the protectorate. He was the first protectorate man to become a medical doctor.

Margai also played the piano, violin and organ.

== Medical career ==

Margai returned to Sierra Leone in 1928 after earning his medical degree and enjoyed an exceptional career in the Colonial Medical Service. He served in 11 of 12 districts in the protectorate. He waged informational campaigns on social welfare and hygiene.

=== Women&#x27;s health reform ===

Margai trained health care workers to instruct female community leaders in the Mende women&#x27;s religion, the Sande. The Sande religion served as a facilitation system of practical knowledge about midwifery passed down by generations of women in the region. In 1948, Margai wrote an article for &quot;African Affairs&quot; entitled &quot;Welfare Work in a Secret Society,&quot; in which he discusses his successes in establishing a series of training camps which taught hygiene and domestic skills to young female Sande initiates. In the article, Margai states &quot;It is simply natural that such a society, when correctly approached, will not be very much averse to the idea of infusing in its teachings a correct and more up-to-date information on the subjects it has been trying to teach, provided it does not interfere or expose the secrets of the society.&quot;

Working in concert with local women&#x27;s groups, Margai helped introduce health and hygiene training into puberty initiation ceremonies. He also trained midwives and was the author of an instruction manual on midwifery in the Mende language. The women whom Margai trained became known as &quot;Mamma Nurses&quot;, and were respected for their prowess in midwifery due to Margai&#x27;s training.

== Political career ==

=== Early work ===

Margai&#x27;s entry into politics occurred in the 1930s when he became a nonchief member of the Protectorate assembly representing the Bonthe region. By 1950, he was in charge of the Sierra Leone Organization Society. In 1951, Margai founded the nationalist Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) with Siaka Stevens, which won the 1951 election to the Legislative Council. After heading the departments of Health, Agriculture, and Forestry, Margai was elected chief minister in 1954. Although the SLPP won elections again in 1957, the following year Margai&#x27;s leadership of the party was challenged by his younger brother, Albert, but even though he narrowly won the internal party election, he declined the leadership of the party, and left to form the opposition People&#x27;s National Party, rejoining his brother in a coalition government in 1960.

=== Path to independence ===

Though Margai was pro-British and conservative in his political views, he felt that Sierra Leone would fare better as a self-determined state. In 1951, Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution which triggered the process of decolonisation. In 1953, Sierra Leone was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was made Chief Minister. The new constitution ensured Sierra Leone a parliamentary system within the Commonwealth of Nations and was formally adopted in 1958.

Margai led the Sierra Leonean delegation at the constitutional conferences that were held with British Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod in London in 1960. On 27 April 1961, Milton Margai led Sierra Leone to independence from the United Kingdom. The nation held its first general elections on 27 May 1962 and Margai was elected Sierra Leone&#x27;s first Prime Minister by a landslide. His party, the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) won a majority of seats in parliament. Margai then sought to heal divides between Sierra Leone&#x27;s ethnic groups, as several northern ethnic groups felt underrepresented in the SLPP. To ameliorate their concerns, Margai appointed several elites from northern ethnic groups to key ministerial positions. However, this did little to lessen poverty in the north, and forced the SLPP to engage in clientelism in order to ease tensions with northern ethnic leaders.

=== Premiership ===

While Margai was only Prime Minister for three years, he served as a crucial first figurehead for Sierra Leone at the time of democratisation. In large part, Margai sought to unite the country and build a sense of national identity while becoming a member of the British Commonwealth. Margai was critical of colonialism as such, but also sought to give &quot;credit where it was due,&quot; saying that if more colonial administrators &quot;had been like Beresford-Stooke, Hodson, Wilkinson and Ransford Slater, colonialism would have had a better reputation. However, most simply were not.&quot; He also singled out the referendums held by Leslie Probyn as a point of praise. Margai sought good relations with the British government after independence. He said he felt &quot;genuine respect&quot; from Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and that &quot;the respect was mutual.&quot; Margai gained the respect of the country&#x27;s large illiterate population for his reputation as a skilled explainer. He also garnered support from local chiefs, who wielded significant social power at the time, because they respected the work he had done to achieve independence for the country. However, Margai faced criticism for suppressing the political activities of the All People&#x27;s Congress (APC), Sierra Leone&#x27;s opposition political party. Margai focused heavily on modernisation, particularly in the areas of education, health, and agriculture. Margai allowed local councils and governments to spearhead many improvement projects, but they were ultimately accountable to the central government, and Margai sometimes withheld funding from councils controlled by the opposition party.

When Margai became Prime Minister, he left control of the Sierra Leonean national army in the hands of the British. Slowly, Margai gave more control of the army over to Sierra Leoneans, and by 1964, the army was fairly ethnically heterogenous, with 26% of officers being Mende, 12% Temne, and 64% other groups. Once Margai died, however, his brother Sir Albert Margai took power and sought to make the army homogeneously Mende.

Margai struggled to handle issues of illegal immigration of the Fula people from Guinea. In 1962, his government rounded up several &quot;strangers&quot; under the assumption that they were illegal immigrants from Guinea, but released them upon learning they were local chiefs.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Legacy ==

Today, Sierra Leoneans regard Sir Milton Margai as a man of honesty and high principle, and look back to his time in office as a period of prosperity and social harmony. In 1964, Sierra Leone released ½, 1, 5, 10 and 20 cent coins, all of which featured portraits of Margai.

=== Sir Milton Margai School for the Blind ===

In 1961, Margai appealed for funding to build a school for the blind in Freetown. In 1962, he set the foundation stone for the building at Wilkinson Road. The school motto is: &quot;We cannot see but we will conquer&quot;. In 2006, the school was the subject of a three-part documentary on BBC News. The Milton Margai School for the Blind Choir has toured the UK twice in 2003 and 2006.

=== Milton Margai College of Education and Technology ===

In 1963, the Milton Margai College of Education and Technology was established. The first incarnation of the school was the Milton Margai Teacher&#x27;s College but as the school grew and the curriculum expanded the name was changed to the Milton Margai College of Education. In 2000, the school merged with the Freetown Technical Institute.

<text>Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope (12 March 1776 – 23 June 1839) was a British adventurer, writer, antiquarian, and one of the most famous travellers of her age. Her excavation of Ascalon in 1815 is considered the first to use modern archaeological principles, and her use of a medieval Italian document is described as &quot;one of the earliest uses of textual sources by field archaeologists&quot;. Her letters and memoirs made her famous as an explorer.

==Early life==
Stanhope was the eldest child of Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope by his first wife, Lady Hester Pitt. She was born at her father&#x27;s seat of Chevening and lived there until early in 1800, when she was sent to live with her grandmother, Hester Pitt, Countess of Chatham, at Burton Pynsent.

In August 1803, she moved into the home of her uncle, William Pitt the Younger, to manage his household and act as his hostess. In his position as British prime minister, Pitt, who was unmarried, needed help with political social life. Lady Hester sat at the head of his table and assisted in welcoming his guests; she became known for her beauty and conversational skills. When Pitt was out of the office she served as his private secretary. She was also the prime initiator of the gardens at Walmer Castle during his tenure as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Britain awarded her an annual pension of £1200 after Pitt&#x27;s death in January 1806.

After living for some time at Montagu Square in London, she moved to Wales and then left Great Britain for good in February 1810 after the death of her brother. A series of romantic disappointments may have prompted her decision to go on a long sea voyage. Her former lover Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville married another woman in 1809, and Stanhope&#x27;s niece (Wilhelmina Powlett, Duchess of Cleveland) suspected she and Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore - with whom Stanhope enjoyed a warm correspondence while he was fighting in the Peninsular War - might have been considering marriage before his death in battle the same year.

==Life abroad==
In February 1810, Stanhope left Portsmouth with her brother James Hamilton Stanhope, who accompanied her as far as Rhodes. Among her entourage were her physician and later biographer Charles Lewis Meryon and her maids Elizabeth Williams and Ann Fry. In Rhodes she met Michael Bruce, an adventurer and later MP, who became her lover and travelling companion. It is claimed that when the party arrived in Athens, the poet, Lord Byron, a university friend of Bruce&#x27;s, dived into the sea to greet them. Byron later described Stanhope as &quot;that dangerous thing, a female wit&quot;, and remarked that she had &quot;a great disregard of received notion in her conversation as well as conduct&quot;. He later claimed that he chose not to engage in a debate on women&#x27;s rights with Stanhope (a formidable conversationalist), because &quot;I despise the sex too much to squabble with them.&quot; From Athens, Stanhope&#x27;s party travelled on to Istanbul, capital of the Ottoman Empire. They intended to proceed to Cairo, only recently emerged from the chaos following Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt and the international conflicts that followed.

===Journey to the Near and Middle East===
En route to Cairo, the ship encountered a storm and was shipwrecked on Rhodes. With all their possessions gone, the party borrowed Turkish clothing. Stanhope refused to wear a veil, choosing the garb of a Turkish male: robe, turban and slippers. When a British frigate took them to Cairo, she continued to wear clothing which was extremely unorthodox for an English woman: she bought a purple velvet robe, embroidered trousers, waistcoat, jacket, saddle and sabre. In this costume she went to greet the Pasha. From Cairo she continued her travels, and over a period of two years she visited Gibraltar, Malta, the Ionian Islands, the Peloponnese, Athens, Constantinople, Rhodes, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. She refused to wear a veil even in Damascus. In Jerusalem, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was cleared of visitors and reopened in her honour.

Learning from fortune-tellers that her destiny was to become the bride of a new messiah, she made matrimonial overtures to Ibn Saud, chief of the Wahhabi Arabs and leader of the First Saudi State. She decided to visit the city of Palmyra, even though the route went through a desert with potentially hostile Bedouins. She dressed as a Bedouin and took with her a caravan of 22 camels to carry her baggage. Emir Mahannah el Fadel received her and she became known as &quot;Queen Hester.&quot;

===Archaeological expedition===
According to Charles Meryon, she came into possession of a medieval Italian manuscript copied from the records of a monastery somewhere in Syria. According to this document, a great treasure was hidden under the ruins of a mosque at the port city of Tel Ashkelon which had been lying in ruins for 600 years. In 1815, on the strength of this map, she travelled to the ruins of Ashkelon on the Mediterranean coast north of Gaza, and persuaded the Ottoman authorities to allow her to excavate the site. The governor of Jaffa, Muhammad Abu Nabbut was ordered to accompany her. This resulted in the first archaeological excavation in Palestine.

While she did not find the hoard of three million gold coins reportedly buried there, the excavators unearthed a headless marble statue. In an action which might seem at odds with her meticulous excavations, Stanhope ordered the statue to be smashed into &quot;a thousand pieces&quot; and thrown into the sea. She did this as a gesture of goodwill to the Ottoman government, in order to show that her excavation was intended to recover valuable treasures for them, and not to loot cultural relics for shipment back to Europe, as so many of her countrymen were doing at this time.

Her expedition paved the way for future excavations and tourism to the site.

===Life among the Lebanese===

Lady Hester settled near Sidon, a town on the Mediterranean coast in what is now Lebanon, about halfway between Tyre and Beirut. She lived first in the disused Mar Elias monastery at the village of Abra, and then in another monastery, Deir Mashmousheh, southwest of the Casa of Jezzine. Her companion, Miss Williams, and medical attendant, Dr Charles Meryon, remained with her for some time; but Miss Williams died in 1828, and Meryon left in 1831, only returning for a final visit from July 1837 to August 1838. When Meryon left for England, Lady Hester moved to a remote abandoned monastery at Joun, a village eight miles from Sidon, where she lived until her death. Her residence, known by the villagers as Dahr El Sitt, was at the top of a hill. Meryon implied that Hester liked the house because of its strategic location, &quot;the house on the summit of a conical hill, whence comers and goers might be seen on every side.&quot;

At first she was greeted by emir Bashir Shihab II, but over the years she gave sanctuary to hundreds of refugees of Druze inter-clan and inter-religious squabbles and earned his enmity. In her new setting, she wielded almost absolute authority over the surrounding districts and became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the region. Her control over the local population was enough to cause Ibrahim Pasha, when about to invade Syria in 1832, to seek her neutrality. Her supremacy was maintained by her commanding character, and by the belief that she possessed the gift of divination. She kept up a correspondence with important people and received curious visitors who went out of their way to visit her.

Finding herself deeply in debt, she used her pension from England in order to pay off her creditors in Syria. From the mid-1830s she withdrew ever more from the world, and her servants began to steal her possessions, because she was less and less able to manage her household in her reclusive state. Stanhope may have suffered from severe depression; it has been suggested that, alternatively, she had become prematurely senile. At any rate, in her last years she would not receive visitors until dark, and even then, she would let them see only her hands and face. She wore a turban over her shaven head.

Lady Hester died in her sleep in 1839. She died destitute; Andrew Bonar and Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne, who visited the region a few weeks&#x27; later, reported that after her death, &quot;not a &quot;para&quot; of money was found in the house.&quot;

==Memoirs==
In 1846, some years after her death, Dr Meryon published three volumes of &quot;Memoirs of the Lady Hester Stanhope as related by herself in Conversations with her Physician&quot;, and these were followed in the succeeding year by three volumes of &quot;Travels of Lady Hester Stanhope, forming the Completion of her Memoirs narrated by her Physician&quot;.

<text>Raising Arizona is a 1987 American crime comedy film written, directed and produced by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Nicolas Cage as H.I. &quot;Hi&quot; McDunnough, an ex-convict, and Holly Hunter as Edwina &quot;Ed&quot; McDunnough, a former police officer and his wife. Other members of the cast include Trey Wilson, William Forsythe, John Goodman, Frances McDormand, Sam McMurray, and Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb.

The Coen brothers set out to work on the film with the intention of making a film as different from their previous film, the dark thriller &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, as possible, with a lighter sense of humor and a faster pace. &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Some criticized it as too self-conscious, manneristic, and unclear as to whether it was fantasy or realism. Other critics praised the film for its originality.

The film ranks 31st on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list, and 45th on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; list. &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; was released in the United States on March 13, 1987.

==Plot==
Convenience store robber Herbert (&quot;H.I.&quot; or &quot;Hi&quot;) McDunnough meets police officer Edwina (&quot;Ed&quot;) when she takes his mugshot after each of several arrests in Tempe, Arizona. He learns that Ed&#x27;s fiancé has left her and proposes after release from prison. They marry and move into a desert mobile home, and Hi works in a machine shop. They want children, but Ed is infertile and they cannot adopt due to Hi&#x27;s criminal record.

Hi and Ed learn of the quintuplet sons born to regional furniture magnate Nathan Arizona. They kidnap one of the babies, whom they believe to be Nathan Jr., intending to start a family. Soon afterward, Hi&#x27;s former cellmates Gale and Evelle Snoats escape from prison and visit the couple. They persuade Hi to shelter them and tempt him to return to his former criminal life. That night, Hi has a nightmare of monstrous biker Leonard Smalls.

Hi&#x27;s foreman Glen visits with his large and unruly family the next day. Glen and wife Dot offer parenting advice amid their children&#x27;s misbehavior, but when Glen suggests that he and Hi exchange wives, Hi punches Glen in the face. That night, Hi succumbs to robbing a convenience store while buying diapers, leading to a chase with police and a pack of dogs that he manages to outrun. As Ed and Nathan Jr. sleep, Hi decides to leave his family to join Gale and Evelle in a bank robbery.

The next morning, Smalls approaches Nathan Sr. and reveals himself as a bounty hunter. When Nathan Sr. rejects Smalls&#x27; offer to bring back Nathan Jr. for $50,000, Smalls decides to do the job anyway and threatens to sell the baby on the black market. Glen returns to fire Hi, revealing his inference that Hi and Ed kidnapped Nathan Jr. Glen threatens to turn them in unless they agree to give the baby to him and Dot. Overhearing this, Gale and Evelle overpower Hi and kidnap Nathan Jr. themselves. Hi and Ed resolve to rescue him.

Gale and Evelle grow attached to Nathan Jr. The two nearly leave him behind while robbing a convenience store, then forget him again during the bank robbery. A dye pack explodes in their stolen money sack, covering them and the getaway car interior with blue dye. The distraction allows Smalls to capture the baby before Hi and Ed arrive. In the ensuing struggle, Ed grabs Nathan Jr. while Smalls severely beats Hi. Hi pulls the pin from one of the hand grenades clipped to Smalls&#x27; vest, causing them all to explode and kill Smalls.

Hi and Ed sneak back into the Arizona home to return Nathan Jr. but Nathan Sr. catches them. Nathan Sr. sympathizes with their motives and decides not to report them to the authorities. Learning that Hi and Ed are considering a divorce, he suggests that they think about it first.

While sleeping beside Ed that night, Hi has a series of prophetic dreams. Gale and Evelle return to prison, having realized that they are not ready for society; Glen is arrested by a Polish-American police officer who is unamused by the ethnic jokes he tells; and Nathan Jr. becomes a high school football star with Hi and Ed anonymously watching and encouraging him. Later he dreams of an elderly couple with a large, wholesome family, and wonders whether this was a vision of him and Ed, or of Utah.

==Cast==

==Production==

===Casting and conception===
The Coen Brothers started working on &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; with the idea to make it as different as possible from their previous film, &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, by having it be far more optimistic and upbeat. The starting point of scriptwriting came from the idea of the character of Hi, who has the desire to live a regular life within the boundaries of the law. To create their characters&#x27; dialect, Joel and Ethan created a hybrid of local dialect and the assumed reading material of the characters, namely, magazines and the Bible. In contrast to &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, the characters in &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; were written to be very sympathetic. The Coens wrote the character Ed for Holly Hunter. The character of Leonard Smalls was created when the Coen Brothers tried to envision an &quot;evil character&quot; not from their imagination, but one that the character would have thought up. His name is widely thought to be a reference to the character of Lennie Small, from John Steinbeck&#x27;s novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. John Goodman was drawn to characters of &quot;great feeling, [guys] who could explode or start weeping at any moment&quot; and became a frequent collaborator following his performance as Gale Snoats. The script took three and a half months to write.

A send-up of the screwball comedy, the film was influenced by the works of director Preston Sturges and writers such as William Faulkner and Flannery O&#x27;Connor (who was known for her Southern literature; &quot;She also has a great sense of eccentric character,&quot; Ethan Coen told one interviewer). Joel and Ethan showed the completed script to Circle Films, their American distributor for &quot;Blood Simple&quot;. Circle Films agreed to finance the movie. The Coens came to the set with a complete script and storyboard. With a budget of just over five million dollars, Joel Coen noted that &quot;to obtain maximum from that money, the movie has to be meticulously prepared&quot;.

===Filming===
&quot;Raising Arizona&quot; was shot in ten weeks beginning on February 3, 1986 and lasting till April 25. Principal photography took place in Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe, Arizona. Many crew members who had worked with Joel and Ethan on &quot;Blood Simple&quot; returned for &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, including cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, co-producer Mark Silverman, production designer Jane Musky, associate producer and assistant director Deborah Reinisch, and film composer Carter Burwell.

The relationship between actor Nicolas Cage and the Coens was respectful, but turbulent. When he arrived on-set, and at various other points during production, Cage offered suggestions to the Coen brothers, which they ignored. Cage said that &quot;Joel and Ethan have a very strong vision and I&#x27;ve learned how difficult it is to accept another artist&#x27;s vision. They have an autocratic nature.&quot; Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb also gave the Coens difficulty on set, with Joel noting that &quot;he&#x27;s less an actor than a force of nature ... I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d rush headlong into employing him for a future film.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Raising Arizona&quot; was initially released in the US, three dates; A New York City premiere on March 6, 1987, a limited release on March 13, 1987 and a nationwide release on April 17, 1987. The film was also released in Argentina on March 25, 1987 before it was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

Despite the cult following of their later films, such as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, in 2000 Ethan Coen described their second feature as &quot;the last movie [we] made that made any significant amount of money&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A terrifically original, eccentric screwball comedy, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; may not be the Coens&#x27; most disciplined movie, but it&#x27;s one of their most purely entertaining.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 based on 23 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; wrote that the film was a &quot;deranged fable of the New West&quot; which turned &quot;sarcasm into a rude yet affectionate mode of comedy&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; referred to the film as &quot;exuberantly original&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave a positive review, stating that it was &quot;the best kidnapping comedy since last summer&#x27;s &quot;Ruthless People&quot;&quot;. On the film review television show &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, critic Gene Siskel said the film was as &quot;good looking as it is funny&quot; and that &quot;despite some slow patches&quot; he recommended the film, giving it a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote that &quot;&quot;Raising Arizona&quot; is no big deal, but it has a rambunctious charm&quot;.

Negative reviews focused on a &quot;style over substance&quot; view of the film. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;While [&quot;Raising Arizona&quot;] is filled with many splendid touches and plenty of yocks, it often doesn&#x27;t hold together as a coherent story.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;Like &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, it&#x27;s full of technical expertise but has no life of its own ... The direction is without decisive style.&quot; Julie Salamon of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the Coen Brothers &quot;have a lot of imagination and sense of fun—and, most of all, a terrific sense of how to manipulate imagery,&quot; but &quot;by the end, the fun feels a little forced.&quot; Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;the overlooked form peels away from the slight, frail content, and the film starts to look like an episode of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; directed by an amphetamine-crazed Orson Welles&quot;. Roger Ebert wrote a negative review, stating the film &quot;stretches out every moment for more than it&#x27;s worth, until even the moments of inspiration seem forced. Since the basic idea of the movie is a good one and there are talented people in the cast, what we have here is a film shot down by its own forced and mannered style.&quot;

Later writings about the film have been generally positive. Both the British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; and film database Allmovie gave the film five stars, their highest ratings. Allmovie&#x27;s Lucia Bozzola wrote, &quot;Complete with carefully modulated over-the-top performances from the entire cast, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; confirmed the Coens&#x27; place among the most distinctive filmmakers to emerge from the 1980s independent cinema&quot;, while Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; declared it a &quot;hilarious, madcap comedy from the Coen brothers that demonstrates just why they are the kings of quirk&quot;. Bilge Ebiri considers &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; to be &quot;the Coens&#x27; masterpiece — their funniest movie, and quite possibly their most poignant as well&quot;. The Dutch magazine &quot;Vrij Nederland&quot; placed its bank robbery scene second on their list of &quot;the 5 best bank robberies in film history&quot;, behind the bank robbery scene from the 1995 thriller &quot;Heat&quot;. Actor Simon Pegg described the film as &quot;a living, breathing Looney Tunes cartoon&quot; during a BFI screening. Pegg&#x27;s friend and frequent collaborator Edgar Wright has stated that &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; is his favorite film of all time. Likewise, Spike Lee put &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; on his &quot;Essential Films&quot; list.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – 

== Soundtrack ==

The score to &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; is written by Carter Burwell, the second of his collaborations with the Coen brothers. The sounds are a mix of organ, massed choir, banjo, whistling, and yodeling.

Themes are borrowed from the Goofing Off Suite, originally recorded by Pete Seeger in 1955, which includes an excerpt from the Chorale movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 and &quot;Russian Folk Themes and Yodel&quot;. Credited musicians for the film include Ben Freed (banjo), Mieczyslaw Litwinski (Jew&#x27;s harp and guitar), and John R. Crowder (yodeling). Holly Hunter sings a traditional murder ballad, &quot;Down in the Willow Garden&quot;, as an incongruous &quot;lullaby&quot; during the film.

Selections from Burwell&#x27;s score to &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; were released on an album in 1987, along with selections from the Coens&#x27; sole previous feature film, &quot;Blood Simple&quot;. The tracks from &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; constitute the first ten tracks on a 17-track CD that also features selections from the &quot;Blood Simple&quot; soundtrack.

<text>W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) is the variable star designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Ursa Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of about 7.9, which is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. However, it can be viewed with a small telescope. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of roughly 169 light years (52 parsecs) from Earth.
In 1903, the luminosity of this system was found to vary by the German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf. It has since become the prototype and for a class of variable stars called W Ursae Majoris variables. This system consists of a pair of stars in a tight, circular orbit with a period of 0.3336 days, or eight hours and 26 seconds. During every orbital cycle, each star eclipses the other, resulting in a decrease in magnitude. The maximum magnitude of the pair is 7.75 mag. During the eclipse of the primary, the net magnitude drops by 0.73 mag, while the eclipse of the secondary causes a magnitude decrease of 0.68 mag.

The two stars in W Ursae Majoris are so close together that their outer envelopes are in direct contact, making them a contact binary system. As a result, they have the same stellar classification of F8Vp, which matches the spectrum of a main-sequence star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen. However, the primary component has a larger mass and radius than the secondary, with 1.14 times the Sun&#x27;s mass and 1.09 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. The secondary has 0.55 solar masses and 0.79 solar radii.

The orbital period of the system has changed since 1903, which may be the result of mass transfer or the braking effects of magnetic fields. Star spots have been observed on the surface of the stars and strong X-ray emissions have been detected, indicating a high level of magnetic activity that is common to W UMa variables. This magnetic activity may play a role in regulating the timing and magnitude of mass transfer occurs.

W Ursae Majoris has a 12th magnitude companion star with the designation ADS 7494B, not to be confused with W UMa B, the secondary of the close eclipsing pair. They may be moving together through space.

<text>Henry Green was the pen name of Henry Vincent Yorke (29 October 1905 – 13 December 1973), an English writer best remembered for the novels &quot;Party Going&quot;, &quot;Living,&quot; and &quot;Loving&quot;. He published a total of nine novels between 1926 and 1952. He is considered as one of the group designated in the 1920s/30s as the &#x27;Bright Young Things&#x27; by the tabloid press. 

== Life and work ==
Green was born near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, into an educated family with successful business interests. His father, Vincent Wodehouse Yorke, the son of John Reginald Yorke and Sophia Matilda de Tuyll de Serooskerken, was a wealthy landowner and industrialist in Birmingham. His mother, Hon. Maud Evelyn Wyndham, was daughter of the second Baron Leconfield. Green grew up in Gloucestershire and attended the New Beacon School in Sevenoaks. He then went to Eton College, where he became a friend of fellow pupil Anthony Powell and wrote most of his first novel, &quot;Blindness&quot;. He studied at Magdalen College, Oxford and there began a friendship and literary rivalry with Evelyn Waugh of Hertford College. At Oxford Yorke and Waugh were members of the Railway Club.

Green left Oxford in 1926 without taking a degree and returned to Birmingham to engage in his family business. He started by working with the ordinary workers on the factory floor of his family&#x27;s factory, which produced beer-bottling machines, and later became the managing director. During this time he gained the experience to write &quot;Living&quot;, his second novel, which he worked on during 1927 and 1928. In 1929, he married his second cousin, the Hon. Adelaide Biddulph, also known as &#x27;Dig&#x27;. They were both great-grandchildren of the first Baron Leconfield. Their son Sebastian was born in 1934. In 1940, Green published &quot;Pack My Bag&quot;, which he regarded as a nearly-accurate autobiography. During World War II, Green served as a fireman in the Auxiliary Fire Service. His wartime experiences are echoed in his novel &quot;Caught&quot;; they were also a strong influence on his subsequent novel, &quot;Back&quot;.

Green&#x27;s last published novel was &quot;Doting&quot; (1952); this was the end of his writing career. In his later years, until his death in 1973, he became increasingly focused on studies of the Ottoman Empire, and became alcoholic and reclusive. Politically, Green was a traditional Tory throughout his life.

==Novels==
Green&#x27;s novels are important works of English modernist literature. His best-regarded novels are &quot;Living&quot; (1929), &quot;Party Going&quot; (1939), and &quot;Loving&quot; (1945) (now often published together).

&quot;Living&quot; documents the lives of Birmingham factory workers in the interwar boom years. The main plot concerns Lily Gates and her courting with Bert Jones, one of the factory workers. They seek an opportunity to escape the British working-class existence by travelling abroad. Crucial to their attempted elopement is Lily&#x27;s desire to work. She is constantly stifled in this venture by the man she calls &#x27;Grandad&#x27;, Craigan, who is her father&#x27;s best friend and with whom she lives. Another plotline concerns &#x27;Dick&#x27; Dupret, the son of the factory owner. His father dies, leaving the business to his son. There are many disputes between Dupret and Mr Bridges, the factory foreman. Mr Bridges fears for his job as Dupret seeks to renovate the factory and its workers. The language of the novel is notable for its deliberate lack of definite articles to reflect a Birmingham accent. In addition, very few articles are used: &quot;Noise of lathes working began again in this factory. Hundreds went along road outside, men and girls. Some turned into Dupret factory&quot;. Green later explained his reasons for using this technique: &quot;I wanted to make that book as taut and spare as possible, to fit the proletarian life I was leading. So I hit on leaving out the articles.&quot;

&quot;Party Going&quot; tells the story of a group of wealthy people travelling by train to a house party. Due to fog, however, the train is much delayed and the group takes rooms in the adjacent large railway hotel. All the action of the story takes place in the hotel.

&quot;Loving&quot; describes life above and below stairs in an Irish country house during the Second World War. In the absence of their employers the Tennants, the servants enact their own battles and conflict amid rumours about the war in Europe. In an interview published in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; in 1958 Terry Southern asked Green about his inspiration for &quot;Loving&quot;. Green replied, &quot;I got the idea of &quot;Loving&quot; from a manservant in the Fire Service during the war. He was serving with me in the ranks, and he told me he had once asked the elderly butler who was over him what the old boy most liked in the world. The reply was: &#x27;Lying in bed on a summer morning, with the window open, listening to the church bells, eating buttered toast with cunty fingers.&#x27; I saw the book in a flash.&quot;

&quot;Back&quot; (1946) tells the story of Charley Summers, a young Englishman who comes back from Germany, where he was detained as a POW for three years after having been wounded in combat in France. Due to his wound, Charley&#x27;s leg had to be amputated. While he was prisoner, Rose, the woman he loved, died; moreover, Rose was married to another man, so Charley cannot even express his bereavement for fear of scandal. Charley calls on Rose&#x27;s father, Mr Grant, who encourages him to make acquaintance with a young widow. When he does, he is astonished at the uncanny resemblance between the woman, whose name is Nancy Whitmore, and Rose. He discovers that Nancy is the illegitimate daughter of Mr Grant, who sent Charley to her thinking he might console her for the death of her husband, an RAF pilot killed in action. The rest of the novel describes the complex and troubled relation between Charley and Nancy, as it unfolds against the background of a war-torn Britain.

Green had his own opinion of what writing should be: &quot;Prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night, and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations [...] Prose should be a direct intimacy between strangers with no appeal to what both may have known. It should slowly appeal to fears unexpressed, it should in the end draw tears out of the stone.&quot;

==Reception==
In the introduction to his interview with Green in the &quot;Paris Review&quot; Terry Southern wrote: &quot;An ancient trade compliment, to an author whose technique is highly developed, has been to call him a &#x27;writer&#x27;s writer&#x27;; Henry Green has been referred to as a &#x27;writer&#x27;s writer&#x27;s writer.&#x27;&quot; Green was always more popular among fellow authors than with the general public; none of his books sold more than 10,000 copies, although he was more widely read in the 1940s, when &quot;Loving&quot; appeared briefly on US best-seller lists. He was admired in his lifetime by W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Eudora Welty, Anthony Burgess, Evelyn Waugh (who knew him well), and Rebecca West. The last-named said of him, &quot;He was a truly original writer, his prose was fresh minted, he drove his bloodless scalpel inches deeper into the brain and heart, none of it had been said before. He is nearly forgotten.&quot; V. S. Pritchett called Green &quot;the most gifted prose writer of his generation&quot;. In a 1952 profile of Green published by &quot;Life&quot;, W. H. Auden was quoted as saying that Henry Green was &quot;the best English novelist alive&quot;.

After his death Green&#x27;s works went out of print and were little-read. However, since the early 1990s there have been attempts to revive his reputation. In 1993 &quot;Surviving&quot;, a collection of previously unpublished works, edited by his grandson Matthew Yorke, was published by Viking Press. Other works have been reissued. Many contemporary authors have cited him as an influence, including John Updike, writing, &quot;His novels made more of a stylistic impact upon me than those of any writer living or dead&quot; in an introduction to an edition (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics USA, 1993) of three of Green&#x27;s novels (&quot;Living&quot;, &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;Party Going&quot;). The novelist Sebastian Faulks, who also wrote an introduction to an edition (Vintage Classics UK, 2005) of these three novels, calls Green &quot;unique&quot; and says: &quot;No fiction has ever thrilled me as the great moments in &quot;Living&quot; and &quot;Loving&quot;&quot;. David Lodge calls Green &quot;an exceptionally gifted and truly original writer&quot;. In his essay &quot;The Genesis of Secrecy&quot; Frank Kermode discussed Green&#x27;s novel &quot;Party Going&quot; and suggested that behind its realistic surface the book hides a complex network of mythical allusions. This led Kermode to include Green in the Modernist movement and to suggest that the novelist was strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot&#x27;s idea of a &quot;mythic method&quot;. Green&#x27;s work has otherwise received comparatively little critical attention from academics; four of the few academics engaged with Green&#x27;s work are Rod Mengham, author of &quot;The Idiom of the Time: The Writings of Henry Green&quot; (2010), Nick Shepley, author of &quot;Henry Green: Class, Style, and the Everyday&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2016) Jeremy Treglown, author of &quot;Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green&quot; (Faber and Faber, 2000), and Becci Carver, author of &quot;Granular Modernism&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2015). New York Review Books has reprinted eight of Green&#x27;s novels.

Edwin Frank, editor of the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, said Green was &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s great unpeggable originals, each of whose novels (each of whose sentences, you could even say) takes off for new and unexpected places&quot;. Frank said his favourite book was &quot;Back&quot;.

<doc id="279898" wikidata="Q311789" url="?curid=279898" title="Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt">
<text>Ibrahim Pasha ( &quot;Ibrāhīm Bāshā&quot;; 1789 – 10 November 1848) was an Egyptian general and politician; he was the commander of both the Egyptian and Ottoman armies and the eldest son of Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman Wāli and unrecognized Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. Ibrahim served as a general in the Egyptian army that his father established during his reign, taking his first command of Egyptian forces when he was merely a teenager. In the final year of his life, he was appointed Regent for his still-living father and became the effective ruler of Egypt and Sudan, owing to the latter&#x27;s ill health. His rule also extended over the other dominions that his father had brought under Egyptian rule, namely Syria, Hejaz, Morea, Thasos, and Crete. Ibrahim pre-deceased his father, dying 10 November 1848, only four months after rising to power. He was succeeded as Regent by his nephew (son of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s second oldest son), Abbas, who upon Muhammad Ali&#x27;s death the following year inherited the Egyptian throne.

Ibrahim remains one of the most celebrated members of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, particularly for his impressive military victories, including several crushing defeats of the Ottoman Empire. Among Egyptian historians, Ibrahim, his father Muhammad Ali, and his son Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent are held in far higher esteem than other rulers from the dynasty, who were largely viewed as indolent and corrupt; this is largely the result of efforts by his grandson Fuad I of Egypt to ensure the positive portrayal of his paternal ancestors in the Royal Archives that he created, which were the primary source for Egyptian history from the 1920s until the 1970s. Today, a statue of Ibrahim occupies a prominent position in Egypt&#x27;s capital, Cairo.

== Background ==
His mother was Amina Hanim (1770-1824). She was the widow of Ottoman official Serezli Ali Bey, and a daughter of the Ottoman Major Ali Aga of Nusratli. Ibrahim was her first-born son with Muhammad Ali of Egypt (her first born was Princess Tawhida). It is further known that he was born in the village of &quot;Nusratli&quot; (today Nikiforos), near the town of Drama, the Ottoman province of Rumelia, in what is now the eastern parts of Macedonian region in Greece.

In 1805, during his father&#x27;s struggle to establish himself as ruler of Egypt, the adolescent Ibrahim, at 16, was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman Kapudan Pasha. However, Ibrahim was allowed to return to Egypt once his father was recognised as Wāli of Egypt by the Ottoman Sultan, and had defeated the British military expedition of Major General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser.

When Muhammad Ali went to Arabia to prosecute the war against the Al Saud in 1813, Ibrahim was left in command of Upper Egypt. He continued the war against the broken power of the Mameluks, whom he suppressed. In 1816 he succeeded his brother Tusun Pasha in command of the Egyptian forces in Arabia.

== Campaigns against the house of Saud==

Muhammad Ali had already begun to introduce European discipline into his army, and Ibrahim had probably received some training, but his first campaign was conducted more in the old Asiatic style than his later operations. The campaign lasted two years, and ended in the destruction of the House of Saud as a political power. Muhammad Ali landed at Yanbu, the port of Medina, in 1813. The holy cities had been recovered from the Saudis, and Ibrahim&#x27;s task was to follow them into the desert of Nejd and destroy their fortresses. Such training as the Egyptian troops had received, and their artillery, gave them a marked superiority in the open field. But the difficulty of crossing the desert to the Saudis stronghold of Diriyah, some 400 miles east of Medina, made the conquest a very arduous one. Ibrahim displayed great energy and tenacity, sharing all the hardships of his army, and never allowing himself to be discouraged by failure. By the end of September 1818 he had forced the Saudi leader Abdullah bin Saud to surrender, and had taken Diriyah, which he sacked. Ibrahim pasha was called in Egyptian “Qahir Al Wahhabiyyin” (annihilator of the wahhabis) for his brutality against Wahhabis.

== Operations in the Morea ==


On 11 December 1819 he made a triumphal entry into Cairo. After his return Ibrahim gave effective support to the Frenchman, Colonel Sève (Suleiman Pasha), who was employed to drill the army on the European model. Ibrahim set an example by submitting to be drilled as a recruit. In 1824, Muhammad Ali was appointed governor of the Morea (the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece) by Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II. Mahmud actually required the assistance of the well-trained Egyptian Army against the contemporary Greek Revolution, which his forces had been unable to quell: in 1822 the Greeks had decisively defeated an army of some 30,000 men under Sultanzade Mahmud Dramali Pasha.

Ibrahim was sent to the Peloponnese with a squadron and an army of 17,000 men. The expedition sailed on 4 July 1824, but was for some months unable to do more than come and go between Rhodes and Crete. The fear of the Greek fire ships stopped his way to the Morea. When the Greek sailors mutinied from want of pay, Ibrahim was able to land at Modon on 26 February 1825. He remained in the Morea until the capitulation of 1 October 1828 was forced on him by the intervention of the Western powers.

He defeated the Greeks in the open field, and though the siege of Missolonghi proved costly to his own troops and to the Ottoman forces who operated with him, he brought it to a successful termination on 24 April 1826. But he was defeated in Mani three times in a row. The Greek guerrilla bands harassed his army, and in revenge he desolated the country and sent thousands of the inhabitants into slavery in Egypt. These measures of repression aroused great indignation in Europe and led to the intervention of the naval squadrons of the United Kingdom, the Restored Kingdom of France and Russia in the Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827). Their victory was followed by the landing of a French expeditionary force in the so-called Morea expedition. By the terms of the capitulation of 1 October 1828, Ibrahim evacuated the country.

== Campaigns in Syria ==
In 1831, his father&#x27;s quarrel with the Porte having become flagrant, Ibrahim was sent to conquer Ottoman Syria. He took Acre after a severe siege on 27 May 1832, occupied Damascus, defeated an Ottoman army at Homs on 8 July, defeated another Ottoman army at Beilan on 29 July, invaded Asia Minor, and finally routed the Grand Vizier Reşid Mehmed Pasha at Konya on 21 December. It was there in Syria where he met Umar Tal the mystic, according to accounts Umar Tal healed the son of Ibrahim Pasha from a deadly fever. Umar Tal was inspired by Ibrahim Pasha, when Umar returned to Sokoto he followed the trends set by the Pasha. Umar Tal later became the commander of the Toucouleur in what is now Guinea, Senegal, and Mali.

The Convention of Kütahya on 6 May left Syria for a time in the hands of Muhammad Ali. Ibrahim was undoubtedly helped by Colonel Sève and the European officers in his army. After the campaign of 1832 and 1833, Ibrahim remained as governor in Syria. He might perhaps have administered successfully, but the exactions he was compelled to enforce by his father soon caused the popularity of his government to decline and provoked revolts. He was assisted by French officer Beaufort d&#x27;Hautpoul from 1834 to 1837, who was his Chief-of-Staff.

During the 1834 peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine, Ibrahim Pasha besieged the Transjordanian city of Al-Karak for 17 days, in pursuit of the revolt&#x27;s leader Qasim al-Ahmad. After a hole was blasted into the town&#x27;s walls in late August, Al-Karak was destroyed and the orchards outside the town were uprooted as punitive measures against the residents for hosting Qasim. Fearing further retaliation from Ibrahim Pasha, the rebel leaders were handed to the Egyptians.

In 1838, the Porte felt strong enough to renew the struggle, and war broke out once more. Ibrahim won his last victory for his father at Nezib on 24 June 1839. But the United Kingdom and the Austrian Empire intervened to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Their squadrons cut his communications by sea with Egypt, a general revolt isolated him in Syria, and he was finally compelled to evacuate the country in February 1841.

The Karakis were to take their revenge from Ibrahim Pasha, 6 years later when the Pasha and his Egyptian army were driven out of Damascus. In 1841, as the Pasha and his troops took the Hajj road from Damascus, they were persistently attacked all the way from Qatraneh to Gaza. The weary army were killed and robbed, and by the time Ibrahim Pasha reached Gaza, the commander had lost most of his army, ammunition and animals.

== Last years ==
Ibrahim spent the rest of his life in peace, but his health was ruined. In 1846, he paid a visit to Western Europe, where he was received with some respect and a great deal of curiosity. When his father became senile, Ibrahim was appointed Regent in his place. He held his regency from July till the time of his death on 10 November 1848.

<doc id="279990" wikidata="Q15527774" url="?curid=279990" title="James Sayers (caricaturist)">
<text>James Sayers (or Sayer) (1748 – April 20, 1823) was an English caricaturist . Many of his works are described in the Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum which has an extensive holdings of his works collected at the time of original publication by Sarah Sophia Banks.

He was born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of a merchant captain. He began as clerk in an attorney&#x27;s office, and was for a time a member of the borough council. In 1780 his father&#x27;s death provided him with a small fortune, and he went to London. As a political caricaturist he supported William Pitt the Younger. His plate of &quot;Carlo Khan&#x27;s triumphal entry into Leadenhall Street&quot; was admitted by Charles James Fox, against whom it was directed, to have damaged his public image. Sayer was always at his best when attacking Fox, whose strong features he portrayed with remarkable power, always so as to make them convey expressions of defiant impudence or anger. Pitt, not known as a patron of the arts, provided Sayer with a place as marshal of the Exchequer court. He died in Curzon Street, Mayfair.
Sayer&#x27;s &quot;Carlo Khan&quot; has been frequently reproduced. But he can only be judged with confidence after examining the collection in the British Museum, or other public libraries. His drawings, made originally with pencil on oil paper, were etched for him by the Brethertons ((James Bretherton, Charles Bretherton)). They were then sold in collections of the size of a large octavo copybook, under such titles as &quot;Illustrious Heads&quot; (1794) or &quot;Outlines of the Opposition&quot; (1795). Sayer left a complete gallery of small full-length pictures of the public men of his time, slightly caricatured. In his large plates he is inferior to James Gillray, and he never has the grace of Thomas Rowlandson, but he was closer to the truth than either.

He also wrote political propaganda as prose and verse &quot;The Foundling Chapel Brawl&quot;, &quot;Elijah&#x27;s Mantle&quot;, &quot;All The Talent&#x27;s Garland&quot;, &quot;Hints to J.Nollekens Esq&quot;

She has written a column for &quot;The Independent&quot; about her domestic trials, including her partner, the screenwriter and director Jonathan Myerson, and their children Jacob (known as Jake), Chloe and Raphael. Since then, she has written a column for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; about homes and houses. Myerson was a regular reviewer on the UK arts programme, &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;, on BBC Two.

==Fiction==
Myerson&#x27;s novels are usually dark in mood, tending towards the supernatural.

Her first was &quot;Sleepwalking&quot; (1994), which was to some degree autobiographical. It deals in part with the suicide of an uncaring and abusive father. (Myerson&#x27;s own father had committed suicide.) The main character Susan is heavily pregnant and begins an affair. She also feels she is haunted by her father&#x27;s mother, reliving the neglect that had made him abusive. The book was shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize.

In &quot;The Touch&quot; (1996), a group of young people try to help a tramp who preaches fundamentalist Christianity and turns violently against them. In &quot;Me and the Fat Man&quot; (1999), a waitress takes to earning extra giving oral sex in a park, though not out of necessity. She gets involved with two other men, friends who have an awkward relationship and a secret between them that turns out to be related to her own birth. &quot;Laura Blundy&quot; (2001) is set in the Victorian period. Julie Myerson tries to bring out the freshness and modernity of the period as it would have appeared at the time. &quot;Something Might Happen&quot; (2003) is about a murder in a Suffolk seaside town based on Southwold, where Myerson has a second home.

The novel &quot;Nonfiction&quot; was published in 2022.

==Family controversies==
Julie Myerson was the anonymous author of &quot;Living with Teenagers&quot;, a &quot;Guardian&quot; column and later book that detailed the lives of a family with three teenage children. The column ended after one of the children was identified and ridiculed at school, although Myerson had denied being the author three times to her own children, only coming clean when it became clear there was no other option. After &quot;The Guardian&quot; confirmed the authorship, it removed the articles from its website to &quot;protect their privacy&quot;.

Myerson was at the centre of a media controversy in March 2009, when details of her book &quot;The Lost Child: a True Story&quot; emerged; commentators criticised her for what Minette Marrin in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called &quot;betrayal not just of love and intimacy, but also of motherhood itself&quot;. Tim Lott called the book a &quot;moral failure&quot;, adding: &quot;Julie has betrayed Jake for her own ambition.&quot; However, some critics took a diametrically opposing view. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mark Lawson, a friend of Julie Myerson, called the book noble, saying, its &quot;elegance and thoughtfulness... and its warning of a fate that may overtake many parents – should not be lost in the extra-literary frenzy.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Kate Kellaway called the book rash but courageous, as if Myerson had tried to &quot;write honestly about a nightmarish situation and a subject that never seems to get the attention it deserves.&quot; The book appeared in the US in August 2009.

Myerson stated in 2009 she might sell the film rights to &quot;The Lost Child&quot; at some point, &quot;maybe in 20 years.&quot;

<text>The Convair 990 Coronado is a retired American narrow-body four-engined jet airliner produced between 1961 and 1963 by the Convair division of American company General Dynamics. It was a stretched version of its earlier Convair 880 produced in response to a request from American Airlines: the 990 was lengthened by , which increased the number of passengers from between 88 and 110 in the 880 to between 96 and 121. This was still fewer passengers than the contemporary Boeing 707 (110 to 189) or Douglas DC-8 (105 to 173), although the 990 was faster than either in cruise.

==Design and development==
American Airlines asked Convair to design an aircraft for coast-to-coast flights, able to fly nonstop from New York City to Los Angeles against the wind. They wanted a larger passenger capacity than the Convair 880, which was the smallest of the first-generation U.S. jet airliners. The design was known as the Convair 600 and was redesignated the Convair 990 in the month of its first flight. The 990 began flight testing on January 24, 1961.

One change from the 880 was the large anti-shock bodies on the upper trailing edge of the wings, to increase the critical Mach by reducing transonic drag. The inboard shock bodies, which were larger, were also used for additional fuel tankage. Later during the design period, Convair modified the design to include fuel in the outboard pods as well, but during the initial test flights the extra weight caused the outboard engines to oscillate in certain conditions. The pods were redesigned once more and shortened by , causing increased drag. The inner set of pods were used to route the fuel-dump tubes from the fuel tanks, terminating in a prominent outlet.

The engines were also changed to the uprated General Electric CJ-805-23s, which were unique in that they used a fan stage at the rear of the engines, compared to the fan stage at the front of the engine found on the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D that powered the 990&#x27;s competitors. The engine was a simplified, non-afterburning civil version of the J79, used in supersonic military aircraft. Like most versions of the J79, the CJ805 and CJ805-23 were smoky, although secondary operator Spantax eventually had their engines refitted with low-smoke combustion chambers in the 1970s.

Like the 880, 990s incorporated a dorsal &quot;raceway&quot; added to the top of the fuselage to house the two ADF antennas and one VHF antenna.

==Operational history==

The 990 did not meet the specifications promised, and American Airlines reduced its order as a result. The 990A was developed by adding fairings to the engine nacelles, among other changes. Despite the modifications from the basic 880 and those in response to drag problems in testing, the aircraft never lived up to its promise of coast-to-coast nonstop capability from JFK to LAX. American Airlines&#x27; timetables show little or no difference in scheduled time between 707 and 990A flights. AA began to dispose of its 990As in 1967.

During May 1961, one of the pre-production 990 aircraft, while demonstrating the margin between its operating speed and its capability during a dive at .97 Mach from 32,000 ft to 22,500 ft, reached at an altitude of : the fastest true airspeed ever attained by a commercial jet transport at that time. However, in level flight the maximum speed, 0.84 Mn, was less than that guaranteed to American Airlines, 0.89 Mn, because the drag levels with the anti-shock bodies were much higher than predicted. A drag reduction program was instituted during which streamlining of the engine pylon/wing interface and addition of nacelle fairings achieved 0.89 Mn.

In 1963, the 990A was reported to burn per hour of fuel at at at a mass of . In contrast, a modern Boeing 737 MAX 8 typically carries 162 passengers and burns per hour at at sub-optimal parameters.

Swissair bought eight 990As beginning in 1962, operating them on long-distance routes to South America, West Africa, the Middle and Far East, as well as on European routes with heavy traffic. Their fleet was withdrawn from service in 1975. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) also operated 990A Coronados on their long-haul schedules to Tokyo and other destinations in the Far East and also to South America and Africa.

The 990&#x27;s niche was soon captured by the Boeing 720 and Boeing 720B, derivatives of the Boeing 707, and later by the Boeing 727. By the time the assembly line shut down in 1963, only 37 990s had been produced, bringing General Dynamics&#x27; entire production of commercial jet airliners to 102 airframes. The failure of airlines to broadly accept the Convair 880 and 990 led Convair&#x27;s parent company, General Dynamics, to suffer one of the largest corporate losses in history. As a result, Convair exited the jet airliner business, although it later built fuselages for McDonnell Douglas, specifically for the DC-10, KC-10 and MD-11.

When the major airlines retired their Convair 990s, they found a second life on charter airlines. Spantax of Spain had a large fleet until the mid-1980s, as did Denver Ports of Call. In 1967, Alaska Airlines purchased Convair 990 PP-VJE from Varig, and operated it as N987AS in scheduled airline service until 1975.

==Accidents and incidents==
* May 28, 1968: Garuda Indonesian Airways Flight 892, a Convair 990 (PK-GJA), crashed minutes after takeoff from Bombay-Santacruz Airport, killing all 29 passengers and crew on board. One fatality also occurred on the ground.
* January 5, 1970: A Spantax Convair 990 (EC-BNM) crashed at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport outside Stockholm, Sweden while taking off on a three-engine ferry flight to Zürich, Switzerland, killing five of seven passengers; the three crew members survived.
* February 21, 1970: Swissair Flight 330 crashed near Würenlingen, Switzerland while trying to return to Zurich International Airport after a bomb detonated in the aft cargo compartment, killing all nine crew and 38 passengers. The aircraft was also carrying a significant amount of mail, some of which survived the crash.
* August 8, 1970: A Modern Air Transport Convair 990 (N5603) was being ferried from New York to Acapulco when it crashed on approach to Alvarez International Airport, Mexico. No one was killed, but one of the eight crew was badly injured.
* December 3, 1972: Spantax Flight 275, a Convair 990 (EC-BZR), crashed at Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife while taking off in almost-zero visibility, killing all seven crew and 148 passengers.
* March 5, 1973: Spantax Flight 400, a Convair 990 on a flight from Madrid to London, was involved in a mid-air collision with Iberia Flight 504, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, over Nantes. The Convair 990 lost part of its left wing, but its pilots managed to land safely at Cognac – Châteaubernard Air Base. The DC-9 crashed, killing all 68 passengers and crew on board.
* April 12, 1973: A U.S. Navy Lockheed P-3C (&quot;157332&quot;) operating from NAS Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California collided with a NASA Convair 990 (N711NA) during approach to runway 32R. The aircraft crashed on the Sunnyvale Municipal Golf Course, half a mile short of the runway, resulting in the destruction of both aircraft and the deaths of all aboard except for one Navy crewman.
* July 17, 1985: A NASA Convair 990 (N712NA) suffered a blown tire during take-off at a speed of around 140 knots (259 km/h) at Riverside-March AFB, California. While attempting to clear the runway, the rim shattered and caused a puncture of the right-wing fuel tank forward of the right main gear. All 19 occupants survived, but the subsequent intense fire destroyed the plane, its equipment and documentation.

<text>Thomas Rowlandson (; 13 July 175721 April 1827) was an English artist and caricaturist of the Georgian Era, noted for his political satire and social observation. A prolific artist and printmaker, Rowlandson produced both individual social and political satires, as well as a large number of illustrations for novels, humorous books, and topographical works. Like other caricaturists of his age such as James Gillray, his caricatures are often robust or bawdy. Rowlandson also produced highly explicit erotica for a private clientele; this was never published publicly at the time and is now only found in a small number of collections. His caricatures included those of people in power such as the Duchess of Devonshire, William Pitt the Younger and Napoleon Bonaparte.

== Biography ==
Rowlandson was born in Old Jewry, in the City of London. He was baptised on 23 July 1757 at St Mary Colechurch, London to William and Mary Rowlandson. The baptismal record for St Mary, now in the London archives, clearly gives his birth-date as 13 July 1757, not 1756 as given in most earlier biographies. His father, William, had been a weaver, but had moved into trading supplies for the textile industry and after overextending himself was declared bankrupt in 1759. Life became difficult for William in London and, in late 1759, he moved his family to Richmond, North Yorkshire. Thomas&#x27;s uncle James died in 1764, and his widow Jane probably provided both the funds and accommodation which allowed Thomas to attend school in London.

Rowlandson was educated at the school of Dr Cuthbert Barwis at 8 Soho Square, then &quot;an academy of some celebrity,&quot; where one of his classmates was Richard Burke, son of the politician Edmund Burke. As a schoolboy, Rowlandson &quot;drew characters of his master and many of his scholars before he was ten years old,&quot; covering the margins of his schoolbooks with his artwork.

In 1765 or 1766 he started at the Soho Academy. There is no documentary evidence that Rowlandson took drawing classes at the mainly business-oriented school, but it seems likely, as on leaving school in 1772, he became a student at the Royal Academy. According to his obituary of 22 April 1827 in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine,&quot; Rowlandson was sent to Paris at the age of 16 (1772), and spent two years studying in a &quot;drawing academy.&quot; there. In Paris he studied drawing &quot;the human figure&quot; and continued developing his youthful skill in caricature. It was on his return to London that he took classes at the Royal Academy, then based at Somerset House.

Rowlandson spent six years studying at the Royal Academy, but about a third of this time was spent in Paris where he may have studied under Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. He later made frequent tours to the Continent, enriching his portfolios with numerous sketches of life and character. In 1775 he exhibited a drawing of &quot;Dalilah Payeth Sampson a Visit while in Prison at Gaza&quot; at the Royal Academy and two years later received a silver medal for a bas-relief figure. He was spoken of as a promising student. On the death of his aunt, he inherited £7,000 with which he plunged into the dissipations of the town and was known to sit at the gaming-table for 36 hours at a stretch.
In time poverty overtook him; and the friendship and examples of James Gillray and Henry William Bunbury seem to have suggested caricature as a means of earning a living. His drawing of Vauxhall, shown in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1784, had been engraved by Pollard, and the print was a success. Rowlandson was largely employed by Rudolph Ackermann, the art publisher, who in 1809—issued in his &quot;Poetical Magazine&quot; &quot;The Schoolmaster&#x27;s Tour&quot;—a series of plates with illustrative verses by Dr. William Combe. They were the most popular of the artist&#x27;s works. Again engraved by Rowlandson himself in 1812, and issued under the title of the &quot;Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque,&quot; they had attained a fifth edition by 1813, and were followed in 1820 by &quot;Dr Syntax in Search of Consolation,&quot; and in 1821 by the &quot;Third Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of a Wife&quot;. He also produced a body of erotic prints and woodcuts.

The same collaboration of designer, author and publisher appeared in the &quot;English Dance of Death,&quot; issued in 1814–16 and in the &quot;Dance of Life,&quot; 1817. Rowlandson also illustrated Smollett, Goldsmith and Sterne, and his designs will be found in &quot;The Spirit of the Public Journals&quot; (1825), &quot;The English Spy&quot; (1825), and &quot;The Humorist&quot; (1831).

Rowlandson&#x27;s designs were usually done in outline with the reed-pen, and delicately washed with colour. They were then etched by the artist on the copper, and afterwards aquatinted—usually by a professional engraver, the impressions being finally coloured by hand. As a designer he was characterised by his facility and ease of draughtsmanship. He dealt less frequently with politics than his fierce contemporary, Gillray, but commonly touching, in a rather gentle spirit, the various aspects and incidents of social life. His most artistic work is to be found among the more careful drawings of his earlier period; but even among the exaggerated caricature of his later time we find hints that this master of the humorous might have attained to the beautiful had he so willed.

His work included a personification of the United Kingdom named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and George Cruikshank. He also produced many works depicting the characters involved in election campaigns and race meetings. However, his satirical works of London&#x27;s street life such as the &quot;pleasure gardens at Vauxhall, jostling with soldiers, students, tarts and society beauties&quot;, which exhibit acute social observation and commentary are amongst his finest.

Rowlandson&#x27;s caricatures include those on the medical profession which developed through his friendship with John Wolcot around 1778. He also earned money illustrating books of physicians and quacks. Later in life, he also produced caricatures on medical themes.

His patron and friend Matthew Michell collected hundreds of his paintings which Michell displayed at his country residence, Grove House in Enfield, Middlesex. After Michell&#x27;s death his nephew, Sir Henry Onslow, sold the contents of Grove House at an eight-day sale in November 1818. One of the best-known of Rowlandson&#x27;s paintings is &quot;Hengar House the seat of Mitchell Esqr., Cornwall&quot; (1812) which was sold at the Sir Richard Onslow sale, Sotheby&#x27;s, 15 July 1959. Another of Rowlandson&#x27;s paintings is &quot;Glorious Defeat of the Dutch Navy Octr 10 1797, by Admirals Lord Duncan and Sir Richard Onslow, with a View Drawn on the Spot of the Six Dutch Line of Battle Ships Captured and Brought into Yarmouth&quot; (1797). Rowlandson also painted early scenes of Brighton where Michell&#x27;s sister, Lady Anne Onslow, lived after the death of her husband Sir Richard Onslow, 1st Baronet. Rowlandson&#x27;s painting &quot;Mr Michell&#x27;s Picture Gallery at Grove House, Enfild&quot; was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s, London, on 4 July 2002.

Rowlandson died at his lodgings at 1 James Street, Adelphi, London, after a prolonged illness, on 21 April 1827. He was buried at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden on 28 April 1827 aged 69 years. Some authors have suggested that his housekeeper Betsy Winter who inherited his belongings was his mistress but this has been rejected by others.
