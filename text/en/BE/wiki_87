<text>US Airways was a major airline in the United States. It was originally founded in Pittsburgh as a mail delivery airline called All American Aviation, which soon became a commercial passenger airline. In 1953, it was renamed [[Allegheny Airlines]] and operated under that name for a quarter-century. In October 1979, after the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act, Allegheny Airlines changed its name to USAir. A decade later it had acquired Piedmont Airlines and Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), and was one of the U.S.&#x27;s seven transcontinental legacy carriers. In 1997, it rebranded as US Airways.

The airline had an extensive international and domestic network, with 193 destinations in 24 countries in North America, South America, Europe, and the Middle East. The airline was a member of the Star Alliance, before becoming an affiliate member of Oneworld in March 2014. US Airways had 343 mainline jets, as well as 278 regional jet and turboprops flown by contract and subsidiary airlines under the name US Airways Express via code sharing agreements.

The airline had severe financial difficulties in the early 2000s, filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy twice in two years. In 2005, America West Airlines carried out a reverse merger, acquiring the assets and branding of the larger US Airways while putting the America West leadership team largely in charge of the merged airline.

In 2013, American Airlines and US Airways announced plans to merge, creating the largest airline in the world. The holding companies of American and US Airways merged effective December 9, 2013. The combined airline carried the American Airlines name and branding and maintained the existing US Airways hubs for a period of at least five years under the terms of a settlement with the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general. US Airways management ran the combined airline from the American headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. On April 8, 2015, the FAA officially granted a single operating certificate for both carriers, marking the end of US Airways as an independent carrier. The brand continued to exist until October 2015.

Its first hub was in Pittsburgh, and it operated hubs in Charlotte, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Phoenix–Sky Harbor, and Washington–Reagan.
The final US Airways flight was San Francisco to Philadelphia via Phoenix and Charlotte, operating as Flight 1939 with 1939 commemorating the birth of All American Aviation, which eventually became US Airways. Repainting of US Airways&#x27; planes into the American Airlines scheme was expected to take until &quot;late 2016&quot;, with new flight attendant uniforms also being introduced in 2016.

==History==

===Early years===
US Airways traces its history to All American Aviation Inc., a company founded in 1939 by du Pont family brothers Richard C. du Pont and Alexis Felix du Pont Jr. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the airline served the Ohio River valley in 1939. In 1949 the company was renamed All American Airways as it switched from airmail to passenger service; it changed its name again to Allegheny Airlines on January 1, 1953.

Allegheny&#x27;s first jet was the Douglas DC-9 in 1966; it absorbed Lake Central Airlines in 1968 and Mohawk Airlines in 1972 to become one of the largest carriers in the northeastern United States. In 1973 it was the ninth-largest airline in the free world by passengers carried (and 24th largest by passenger-miles). With expansion came growing pains: in the 1970s Allegheny had the nickname &quot;Agony Air&quot;.

Allegheny&#x27;s agreement with Henson Airlines, the forerunner to today&#x27;s US Airways Express carrier Piedmont Airlines, to operate &quot;Allegheny Commuter&quot; flights was the industry&#x27;s first code-share agreement, a type of service now offered throughout the industry.

===1970s: Deregulation and rebranding===
Allegheny changed its name to USAir in 1979 after the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act the previous year, which enabled the airline to expand its route network to the southeastern United States.

USAir was a launch customer for the Boeing 737-300, as the airline needed an aircraft with greater capacity to serve its growing Florida markets. USAir was the world&#x27;s largest operator of DC-9 aircraft at the time and approached McDonnell Douglas to negotiate a new design. However, in the late 1970s, the McDonnell Douglas&#x27; proposed successor to the DC-9-50 did not suit USAir. After the negotiations with McDonnell Douglas broke down, Boeing came forward with a proposed variant of the 737. USAir selected the new 737 and the company worked closely with Boeing during its development, taking delivery of the first plane on November 28, 1984.

===1980s: Mergers and expansion===
In 1979, USAir&#x27;s network was east of the Mississippi, plus spokes to Houston and Phoenix; it added Dallas-Ft Worth and Kansas City in 1981, Denver in 1982 and Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego in 1983. It acquired two commuter airlines, Pennsylvania Airlines and Suburban Airlines, in 1985. It bought San Diego–based Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) in 1986 and Winston-Salem, North Carolina–based Piedmont Airlines in 1987. The PSA acquisition was completed on April 9, 1988, and the Piedmont acquisition on August 5, 1989.

The PSA acquisition gave USAir a network on the West Coast, while the Piedmont acquisition gave USAir a strong East Coast presence and hubs in Baltimore and Charlotte, which remained hubs for USAir. The Piedmont acquisition in 1989 was the largest airline merger until then and USAir became one of the world&#x27;s largest airlines, with more than 5,000 flights daily to 134 airports (plus 48 more airports on USAir Express). In the next few years USAir closed down PSA&#x27;s hubs in California and Piedmont&#x27;s hubs in Dayton and Syracuse, though both remained focus cities.

By 1990, the airline had consolidated its headquarters, moving from Washington National Airport to a new building at Crystal City, in Arlington County, Virginia, near the airport. Maintenance and operations headquarters remained at Pittsburgh International Airport.

===1990s: Rebranding, fleet modernization, and failed sell-off===
In the early 1990s, USAir expanded to Europe with flights to London, Paris, and Frankfurt from its four main hubs. The company formed partnerships, marketing the Trump Shuttle as the &quot;USAir Shuttle&quot; and accepting a large investment from British Airways that started one of the first transatlantic alliances, resulting in several Boeing 767-200ERs being painted in the British Airways livery, but operated by USAir. In 1992, it also invested in a new terminal at its hub in Pittsburgh.

In 1996 the alliance between USAir and British Airways ended in a court battle when British Airways announced its intentions to partner with American Airlines.

About March 1, 1997 USAir changed its name to US Airways and introduced a new corporate identity. A stylized version of the United States flag was adopted as a new logo. The new branding was applied to terminals and ticket jackets. The airline painted aircraft in deep blue and medium gray with red and white accent lines.
That same year, the airline also introduced a single-class subsidiary known as MetroJet, which competed with low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines expanding to the East. MetroJet operated Boeing 737-200s, the oldest aircraft in the fleet, allowing it to achieve the best utilization possible before being retired.

On November 6, 1996, immediately prior to the rebranding to US Airways, the airline placed an order for up to 400 Airbus A320-series narrow-body aircraft, with 120 firm orders at the time of signing. The order was regarded as the largest bulk aircraft request in history. In 1998 the airline followed with an order for up to 30 Airbus A330-series wide-body aircraft, with an initial firm order for seven of the Airbus A330-300s. These orders enabled US Airways to replace its older aircraft with newer, more efficient aircraft.

In 1997 US Airways bought the remains of Trump Shuttle. US Airways expanded its flights to Europe through the end of the decade. Although the airline returned to profitability in the mid-1990s, its route network&#x27;s concentration in the Northeastern United States and high operating costs prompted calls for the company to merge with another airline.

===2000s===

====2000–2004: September 11 and financial woes====
Beginning in 2000 US Airways started retiring aircraft in an attempt to simplify its fleet and reduce costs, replacing many of its older planes with the new Airbus A320-family aircraft. On March 30, 2000, US Airways received its first Airbus A330-300.

On May 24, 2000, US Airways announced plans to be acquired for $4.3 billion by UAL Corp., the parent company of United Airlines, the world&#x27;s largest commercial carrier at the time. The complex deal drew immediate objections from labor unions, consumer advocates and antitrust regulators. Negotiations stalled; with both airlines losing money and the deal all but certain to be blocked by the federal government, UAL withdrew its purchase offer on July 27, 2001, paying US Airways a $50 million penalty for withdrawing from the deal.
As the largest carrier at Washington National Airport, US Airways was disproportionately affected by that airport&#x27;s extended closure following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The resulting financial disaster precipitated the closure of the airline&#x27;s MetroJet network, which led to the closing of the subsidiary&#x27;s primary operating base at Baltimore-Washington International Airport and the furloughing of thousands of employees. The airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 11, 2002, but received a government-guaranteed loan through the Air Transportation Stabilization Board and was able to exit bankruptcy in 2003 after a relatively short period. The airline made major cost reductions during its bankruptcy, but it still encountered higher-than-average per-seat-mile costs.

In 2003, US Airways began exploring the availability of financing and merger partners, and after no financing was available, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again in 2004 for the second time in two years. The airline merged in 2005 with America West Airlines. Under terms of the merger agreement, the America West board of directors created two new entities. First, a new &quot;US Airways Group&quot; was created to receive the bankrupt US Airways&#x27; assets and form the new corporation. Second, &quot;America West Holdings&quot; was merged into &quot;Barbell Acquisition Corporation&quot;, a subsidiary of the new &quot;US Airways Group&quot;, on September 27, 2005; through this transaction, &quot;America West Holdings&quot; became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new &quot;US Airways Group&quot;. The &quot;America West Holdings&quot; stockholders were required to authorize these changes. Upon completion, 37% of the new &quot;US Airways Group&quot; would be owned by &quot;America West Holdings&quot; stockholders, 11% by the old &quot;US Airways Group&quot; debtholders and 52% by new equity investors. The result was the fifth largest US-based airline in terms of revenue. The merger was completed on November 4, 2007. While America West was the nominal survivor, the merged airline retained the US Airways name, since studies indicated that &quot;US Airways&quot; had better brand recognition worldwide than did &quot;America West&quot;.

In early 2003, US Airways management liquidated the pensions of its 6,000 pilots by releasing their pensions into the federal pension program Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The company was one of the first major airlines to eliminate pilots&#x27; pensions in order to cut costs.

Following a trial run of selling in-flight food in 2003, US Airways discontinued free meal service on domestic flights later that year.

====2003–2004: Pittsburgh hub conflict====

In late 2003-early 2004, US Airways lobbied for lower operating fees at Pittsburgh International Airport, citing its economies of scale as the primary carrier and largest tenant at the airport. US Airways attempted to leverage its adverse cash position and &quot;red ink&quot; in the years following 9/11 to negotiate better financial terms with the airport. The Allegheny County Airport Authority rejected US Airways&#x27; demands for reduced landing fees and lower lease payments, in part due to antitrust and FAA regulations that required the airport operator to extend the same financial terms to all carriers if it accepted US Airways&#x27; demands. US Airways threatened to move traffic to rival hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte, and the airline made good on its threat in November 2004, reducing its flights at Pittsburgh International Airport from primary-hub to secondary-hub status. This action also resulted in the closing of the commuter terminal, also known as concourse E. The airline, led by former ExpressJet Airlines CEO David N. Siegel, continued to demote Pittsburgh International Airport in subsequent years until it became only a focus city airport for the company. By 2010, Pittsburgh was no longer listed as a US Airways focus city. US Airways now operated an average of only 39 departures a day exclusively to domestic destinations, compared to 2001 when it was a hub with 500+ flights a day with service across the United States and to Europe.

Western Pennsylvania leaders and most notably the designer of the 1992 modernization of Pittsburgh International, Tasso Katselas, pointed out that the reason fees and payments were higher than average is expressly because US Airways requested the most modern and advanced airport in the world in return for basing its hub there. Katselas has also been vocal that the issue of negotiable fees and payments are irrelevant when compared to the three biggest costs of any airline: fuel, time, and labor, all of which his redesign of PIT from 1987 to 1992 helped to reduce. In fact, those changes created the most efficient, least costly, and least financially wasteful airfield in the world. Although conceding that those updates cost more, he argued they were more than offset by Pittsburgh&#x27;s vast built-in nonnegotiable fuel and time, and to a lesser degree, labor savings. Local officials maintain that Allegheny County &quot;bent over backwards&quot; to accommodate US Airways and saved them millions of dollars, only to be abandoned.

US Airways&#x27;s abandonment of its Pittsburgh hub nearly bankrupted the Pittsburgh airport itself, since US Airways had signed a 30-year lease and the county had issued $600 million in bonds for construction, which were supposed to be paid by US Air. US Air&#x27;s move eliminated thousands of jobs and was a financial gut punch for the entire Pittsburgh region; former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said US Air&#x27;s departure was the &quot;second devastating economic blow after steel in the early &#x27;80s.&quot;

====2004–2005====
In August 2004, US Airways attempted to build a Latin American gateway at Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood, announcing service to 10 cities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The attempt was largely unsuccessful and short-lived, in part due to Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s proximity to American Airlines&#x27; hub at Miami International Airport and its extensive Latin American network. US Airways also began a process of de-emphasizing its hub-and-spoke system to capitalize on direct flights between major eastern airports such as Washington National Airport and New York-LaGuardia.

The airline became the 15th member of the Star Alliance on May 4, 2004.

Fuel costs and deadlocked negotiations with organized labor, chiefly the Air Line Pilots Association, traditionally the first group to come to a concessionary agreement, forced US Airways into a second round of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection proceedings on September 12, 2004. Widespread employee discontent and a high volume of employee sick calls were blamed by the airline for a staff shortage around the 2004 Christmas holiday, a public relations disaster which led to speculation that the airline could be liquidated; the USDOT found that the problems were caused primarily by poor airline management.

====US Airways/America West merger====
Even before the second bankruptcy filing of 2004, one of the alternatives US Airways Group explored was a possible merger with America West, as the two airlines had complementary networks and similar labor costs. The parties held preliminary discussions and conducted due diligence from February through July 2004. Ultimately, these talks ended due to issues related to labor, pension, and benefit costs.

By December 2004, US Airways had cut labor costs significantly. Its investment adviser, the Seabury Group, suggested putting the airline up for sale. The following month, US Airways Group and America West Holdings resumed their discussions. On May 19, 2005, both airlines officially announced the merger deal, structured as a reverse takeover. Financing for the deal was supplied by outside investors included Airbus, Air Wisconsin (a &quot;US Airways Express&quot; operator), and ACE Aviation Holdings, the parent company of Air Canada. The merged airline retained the US Airways name to emphasize its national scope, as well as to capitalize on US Airways&#x27; worldwide recognition, Dividend Miles frequent flyer program, and Star Alliance membership. On September 13, 2005, America West shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement and three days later the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia approved US Airways&#x27; emergence from bankruptcy, allowing the merger to close on September 27.

Since the merger, US Airways had been headquartered at the former America West corporate offices in Tempe, Arizona, and America West executives and board members were largely in control of the merged company. The company&#x27;s aircraft merged FAA operating certificate included America West&#x27;s airline call sign and identifiers &quot;CACTUS&quot; and &quot;AWE&quot;.

====Post-2005 merger====
During 2006, the airline began consolidating its operations under the US Airways brand. Operations were not fully integrated until October 2008, when government approval was obtained to allow the airlines to operate under a single operating certificate.

In May 2006, the US Airways and America West web sites were merged. The new US Airways web site united the two brands using graphics and styles reflective of the airline&#x27;s new livery and services.

In July 2006, US Airways and America West ordered 20 new Airbus A350 aircraft.

In December 2006, US Airways became the first American &quot;legacy&quot; carrier to add the Embraer 190 to its mainline fleet. It remains one of only three American carriers to operate the E190 in scheduled service, JetBlue and Breeze being the others.

At the end of 2006, US Airways made a bid for competitor Delta Air Lines, which it opposed, treating it as a hostile takeover by US Airways. The final bid was valued at $10 billion but was withdrawn on January 31, 2007, since US Airways failed to secure backing from Delta&#x27;s creditors. The airline stated that it would no longer pursue a possible takeover of Delta.

Aircraft were equipped with Verizon Airfone in every row of seats. Since Verizon ended this service, the airline has deactivated the service and as of 2007, has removed the phones or has covered them in all aircraft.

Overnight on March 4, 2007, the US Airways and America West computer reservation systems merged. US Airways, which previously used the Sabre airline computer system, switched to the new QIK system, an overlay for the SHARES system, that had been used by America West. A few of the features from the Sabre system were incorporated into the new joint system, with the most prominent being the continued utilization of the Sabre ramp partition &quot;DECS&quot; for all computer functions related to weight and balance, aircraft loading and technical flight tracking within the company.

America West Airlines and US Airways merged FAA certificates on September 25, 2007. Former America West employees (including pilots, fleet service personnel, flight attendants) remained on their original America West union contracts and did not fully combine workforces with their pre-merger US Airways counterparts. Until October 2008, former America West aircraft flew with their respective crews and used the call sign &quot;CACTUS&quot;, while the pre-merger US Airways crews primarily flew with their respective aircraft and used the call sign &quot;US AIR&quot;. In October 2008, the company began operating under a single operating certificate (that of the former US Airways). This required operation under a single call sign and identifier and that of America West (&quot;CACTUS&quot; and &quot;AWE&quot;) were chosen as a sign of the company lineage. In addition, flights operated using former America West aircraft and crews were numbered 1–699, whereas flights operated by pre-merger US Airways aircraft and crews were numbered 700–1999. (Flights numbered 2000–2199 were shuttle services and those 2200 and higher were operated by express subsidiaries.) Aircraft operated by pre-merger US Airways crews or former America West crews flew under two different United States Department of Transportation operating certificates until September 25, 2007. However, until pilot and flight attendant union groups from both sides successfully negotiated a single contract, each group of crewmembers would fly only on its pre-merger airlines&#x27; aircraft and the flights would be marked accordingly.

Since the computer systems were merged, former America West-operated flights were marketed as though America West was a wholly owned carrier. This marketing is common practice for airlines that have code-share agreements with other airlines operating aircraft for feeder or regional routes and although the practice is uncommon for major airlines, it greatly simplified the process for passengers connecting between historically US Airways-operated flights and former America West-operated flights.

In the summer of 2007, US Airways began upgrading its in-flight services, from food and entertainment to the training of flight attendants. The airline was planning to test-market a new seatback entertainment system in early 2008, however, the 2008 fuel crisis ended those plans. As a further result of the skyrocketing fuel costs, the airline rolled back the planned summer 2007 service upgrades as well as ending its existing in-flight entertainment on all domestic routes.

====2007====
A Consumer Reports survey of 23,000 readers in June 2007 ranked US Airways as the worst airline for customer satisfaction. The survey was conducted before the airline&#x27;s March 2007 service disruptions. A follow-up survey polling a smaller sample size, conducted in April, found that US Airways remained in last place, with its score dropping an additional 10 points. Also in 2007, the Today/Zagat Airline Survey rated US Airways as the worst airline overall in the United States, ranking it 10/30 for comfort, 5/30 for food, 10/30 for service and 15/30 for its online reservations system.

On August 1, 2008, US Airways ceased providing free drinks; passengers could buy bottled water or soda for $2 or coffee and tea for $1. Shuttle flights between LGA, DCA and BOS continued to offer free beverages. US Airways resumed serving complimentary drinks in March 2009.

US Airways ranked last out of 20 domestic airline carriers for on-time performance in March, April, and May 2007, according to DOT figures. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics June 2008 report (using data from May 2008), US Airways ranked seventh for percentage of on-time arrivals.

US Airways was the leader in service complaints with 4.4 complaints per 100,000 customers. The US Airways rate of customer complaints was 7.5 times the rate of JetBlue (0.59 complaints per 100,000 customers) and 11 times the rate of Southwest Airlines (0.4 complaints per 100,000 customers). US Airways had a very poor record of addressing customer complaints, answering only 50% of the telephone calls to its customer service department.

By September 2007, US Airways continued to downgrade Pittsburgh International Airport&#x27;s status from 500 flights a day (with 12,000 employees) in 2001 to just 68 flights a day (with only 1,800 employees). CEO Parker stated his frustration at the economics of Pittsburgh and referred to the possibility of service further decreasing. This represented a further deterioration of a strained relationship with Allegheny County, with which the airline shared significant historical ties. US Airways Group Inc. said October 3, 2007 it would cut mainline flights at Pittsburgh International Airport to 22 a day from 31 and reduce regional flights to 46 a day from 77, beginning January 6, 2008, essentially reducing the airport to a destination spoke in its network. Pittsburgh was no longer a focus city for the airline as of its most recent annual report and January 2008 flight schedule reductions.

====2008====
US Airways East pilots took steps to relinquish their ALPA membership and form their own in-house union. &quot;East&quot; pilots were dissatisfied with the results of binding arbitration when the arbitrator&#x27;s ruling placed all active former America West pilots, including their most junior pilot, who had been hired only three months previous to the merger, ahead of furloughed US Airways pilots with up to seventeen years of service. The former US Airways pilots petitioned the National Mediation Board to conduct a vote to determine whether to replace their union. East pilots (3,200) outnumbered west pilots (1,800) and the proposed union&#x27;s president stated that the union had a sufficient number of requests to call a vote according to National Mediation Board regulations. The new union would be called the US Airline Pilots Association (USAPA). On April 17, 2008, USAPA was voted in as the sole bargaining agent for the pilots of US Airways, East and West.

It took more than a year to correct problems stemming from the merger and by 2008, US Airways was one of the best performers among the legacy carriers. The carrier had the best departure and arrival performances among the other major US carriers. Because of the strong On-Time departure and On-Time arrival performances, it was the number one major carrier. Northwest was the only other carrier that had better performances but became a part of Delta during that year.

On April 25, 2008, it was reported that US Airways was in talks to merge its operations with either American Airlines or United Airlines, partially as a response to the recent Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines merger. Then, on April 28, 2008, reports stated that US Airways would announce its intent to merge with United within two weeks. At the end of May 2008, the airline announced that merger talks were formally ended.

On May 20, 2008, according to the annual American Customer Satisfaction Index by the University of Michigan, US Airways ranked last in customer satisfaction among the major airlines. However, it was making steady ground to bridge its gap with other airlines.

In late 2008, US Airways closed its Las Vegas hub, which was part of the America West network.

====2009====
On January 15, 2009, an Airbus A320 registered N106US, Flight 1549 under the command of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, flying from New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, ditched into the Hudson River shortly after takeoff. Multiple bird hits from a flock of Canada geese caused both engines to lose power. All 150 passengers and 5 crew members (2 pilots and 3 flight attendants) survived. New York&#x27;s Governor David Paterson called it &quot;the miracle on the Hudson&quot;.

US Airways received its first Airbus A330-200 in June 2009.

In mid-2009 it was reported that US Airways, along with American Airlines and United Airlines was placed under credit watch. Experts say several factors, including capital and revenue, played a role in the airline&#x27;s addition to the list. On October 2, US Airways reported that it had a buyer for 10 of its 25 Embraer 190 Aircraft. The remaining 15 aircraft were scheduled to be redeployed to Boston where they would operate Boston to Philadelphia and the Boston to New York LaGuardia leg of the US Airways Shuttle service. On December 8, 2009, US Airways began service to Rio de Janeiro-Galeão airport operated by a Boeing 767-200, its first route to South America.

===2010s===
The airline continued to operate scheduled flights and profits were seen to be sustainable. The airline was in good shape. 2010 was a better year for the airline due to no recorded incidents or accidents following the ditching of flight 1549 the previous year. The airline was profitable up to the merging with American Airlines in 2015.

====2010====
US Airways cut many routes to close its focus cities at Las Vegas, Boston, and New York LaGuardia. The airline was given tentative government approval to trade many of its LaGuardia takeoff and landing slots to Delta Air Lines in exchange for Delta&#x27;s slots at Washington National. This exchange would strengthen each airline&#x27;s presence at both airports. The DOT gave approval pending the carriers selling a small percentage of their routes to other carriers. US Airways and Delta disagreed with the decision and said they planned to sue the US DOT.

On April 7, 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that US Airways was &quot;deep in merger discussions&quot; with United Airlines. The report stated that a deal would not be reached for several weeks, but indicated that a deal was close. Several weeks later, however, on April 22, 2010, the airline ended discussions with United regarding the merger. Shortly thereafter, United announced that it would merge with Continental Airlines instead.

====2011====
In April 2011, US Airways earned the top spot in the 2011 Airline Quality Rating (AQR) report among &quot;Big-Five&quot; hub-and-spoke carriers. US Airways President Scott Kirby said that US Airways was the last viable airline in the U.S. to merge and that any potential merger would be with one of three U.S. carriers: United Airlines, American Airlines or Delta Air Lines. Kirby also commented that US Airways&#x27; membership in the Star Alliance would make a merger with United Airlines easier, but added that &quot;it&#x27;s not meaningful enough to really be a factor&quot;. Among the 10 largest domestic airlines, consumers scored US Airways last for overall customer satisfaction in a May 2011 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; survey.

In May 2011, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) ranked US Airways sixth in a list of &quot;The 19 Most Hated Companies in America&quot;.

In July 2011, the pilots&#x27; union, USAPA, purchased a full-page advertisement in &quot;USA Today&quot;, questioning US Airways management&#x27;s commitment to safety. US Airways transmitted a communication to all of its employees, on the same day as the ad, denying the accusations. In September 2011, US Airways requested and was granted an injunction against the pilots, claiming the pilots union, USAPA, was using their commitment to safety as a negotiating tactic.

====2012====
In January 2012, US Airways expressed interest in taking over bankrupt carrier American Airlines. Tom Horton, CEO of American parent AMR Corporation, said in March that American was open to a merger. A Bloomberg News report dated March 23, 2012, stated that US Airways had been in talks with AMR&#x27;s creditors about a takeover bid. On December 7, 2012, US Airways announced a merger proposal with American Airlines. The merger required approval from a bankruptcy judge, which was successful. The combined airline would keep the American Airlines name and would be based in American&#x27;s hometown of Fort Worth.

====2013====

On February 14, 2013, US Airways Group and AMR Corporation announced that the two companies would merge to form the largest airline in the world. In the deal, shareholders of AMR would own 72% of the new company and US Airways Group shareholders would own the remaining 28%. The combined airline would carry the American Airlines name and branding, while US Airways&#x27; management team, including CEO Doug Parker, would retain most operational management positions. The headquarters for the new airline would also be consolidated at American&#x27;s current headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. On August 13, 2013, the United States Department of Justice along with attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit seeking to block the merger, arguing that it would mean less competition and higher prices. Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia, states where either American or US Airways maintained a large presence, were among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as was Tennessee.

On November 12, 2013, the two companies reached a deal with the Department of Justice. That allowed the companies to complete the merger on December 9, 2013.

====Final years and ceasing operations====
On April 8, 2015, American Airlines flights operated by US Airways retired the Cactus callsign used by US Airways since the America West merger. The final flight to use it was Flight 774 from London-Heathrow to Philadelphia.

On July 13, 2015, American announced that it planned to discontinue the US Airways brand name on October 17, 2015. On that date, US Airways made its final flight: Flight 1939 (originally named Flight 434, changed for the year the airline was founded), using an Airbus A321 registered N152UW, and would take off as US Airways Flight 1939 and land as American Airlines Flight 1939. The flight originated from Philadelphia International Airport at 10:05 AM, October 16, 2015, continuing to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, then to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and then to San Francisco International Airport. (The final flight did not stop in Pittsburgh, which some local officials regarded as the &quot;final insult&quot; by US Air to Pittsburgh.) The aircraft made its final leg on the evening of October 16, as a red-eye flight from San Francisco International Airport back to Philadelphia International Airport. It landed ahead of schedule at 5:52 AM EDT, and at that point, the US Airways brand and all operations under its name were officially terminated.

==Company affairs and identity==

===Headquarters===

Prior to the merger with American Airlines, US Airways had its headquarters in Tempe, Arizona, in Greater Phoenix. The nine-story, building was originally occupied by America West Airlines. Jahna Berry of the &quot;Arizona Business Gazette&quot; said in 2005 that the building &quot;is one of the dominant buildings in downtown Tempe&quot;. It is located in proximity to the southwest intersection of Rio Salado Parkway and Mill Avenue. The city of Tempe gave America West $11 million in incentives and tax breaks so it would occupy what became the US Airways headquarters, which cost $37 million to construct.

Construction began in January 1998, although the official groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 19 of that year. By of 2006 over 700 employees worked in the building. On May 31, 2013, W.P. Carey Inc. gave 75% interest in the US Airways headquarters to Parkway Properties Inc. for $41.8 million or $185 per square foot. As of December 2013, 780 employees worked in the building. After the merger between American Airlines and US Airways concluded, Hayley Ringle of the &quot;Phoenix Business Journal&quot; stated in December 2013 that the facility became &quot;just a large office of American Airlines Group&quot;. That month, John McDonald, the American Airlines vice president of corporate communications and public affairs stated that the US Airways headquarters would continue to be used for at least five years and for the time being most of the employees at the US Airways headquarters would remain.

Previously US Airways had its headquarters in Crystal Park Four, a class A mixed-use development in Crystal City, Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. Park Four is between Reagan National Airport, the Pentagon, and the District of Columbia. After the merger with America West Airlines, the company decided to close its Virginia headquarters and moved the employees into the former America West building in three to six months after the merger closed. Russell Grantham at &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said that the decision to move the headquarters to Tempe was not that difficult because the Crystal City facility &quot;consisted of like two or three floors of people.&quot;

===Flight Operations Center===
Pittsburgh International Airport won a three-way competition with Phoenix and Charlotte in 2007 for the right to continue as US Airways&#x27; Global Flight Operations center. Opening in November 2008, US Airways invested more than $25 million ($ million today) into a facility. It replaced a smaller 11-year-old (pre-merger) operations center closer to downtown Pittsburgh. The state-of-the-art Ops Center opened ahead of schedule and was home to approximately 600 employees. It served as the nerve center for all of US Airways&#x27; nearly 1,400 daily mainline flights. As part of its merger with American Airlines, the airline intended to close the flight operations center and would consolidate with the American Airlines Integrated Flight Operations Center near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the headquarters of American Airlines. The move was expected to take within 18 months. It was announced that the operations center would close on August 23, 2015.

===Community support===

====Do Crew====
The US Airways &quot;Do Crew&quot; program was the airline&#x27;s employee community-service program. Employee volunteers in the program participated in community-based projects on a monthly basis through local chapters in Boston, Charlotte, Las Vegas, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

===Livery===

US Airways had various liveries under the US Airways name. In general, the Express and Shuttle divisions had liveries that closely paralleled the company-wide livery, but later shared the same aircraft with mainline US Airways.

The pre-2005 US Airways had a dark blue livery; after it merged with America West, US Airways, switched to a mostly white livery.

Following US Airways merger with American Airlines, US Airways aircraft were painted into the American Airlines livery. The first jet to re-enter revenue service in the American livery in January 2014 was an Airbus A319, tail number N700UW, which previously sported a Star Alliance scheme.

One aircraft, an Airbus A321 under registration N578UW, has been left painted in the US Airways livery, as one of American&#x27;s heritage aircraft. The actual US Airways logo near the front of the fuselage has been replaced with the American Airlines logo, but the rest of the aircraft remains in the US Airways livery.

==Destinations==

US Airways operated 3,031 flights a day to 193 destinations in 24 countries from its hubs in Phoenix, Charlotte, and Philadelphia.

US Airways&#x27; routes were concentrated along the East Coast of the United States, Southwestern United States, and the Caribbean, with a number of routes serving Europe and primary destinations along the U.S. West Coast. The airline&#x27;s western U.S. presence had increased following the merger with America West. Codesharing with United Airlines (before leaving the Star Alliance) had helped US Airways by enabling the airline to offer its customers service throughout the Midwest, Great Plains, and Rocky Mountains states. Services to South America, Asia, and Australia also were offered via the American Airlines codeshare. Likewise, American passengers benefitted from increased access via US Airways to the U.S. East Coast, Europe, and the Caribbean. US Airways Express carriers operated a large number of domestic routes, primarily into US Airways&#x27; hubs and focus cities, but with some exceptions, particularly small markets where the regional express carriers operated service under the EAS program, as well as some point-to-point commuter routes in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and south through the Carolinas. Before US Airways completely merged into American Airlines, US Airways was the last and only major US airline that has never flown to Eastern Asia, although it had codeshares with American Airlines and most Asian air carriers partnered in the OneWorld Alliance.

In 2007 the airline applied for flights to Bogotá, Colombia, but the U.S. Department of Transportation denied the application after the agency awarded Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and Spirit Airlines the routes from Delta&#x27;s New York-JFK hub, JetBlue from Orlando and Spirit from Fort Lauderdale.

In 2008, US Airways and other airlines struggled with the price of fuel. Despite that, US Airways CEO Doug Parker said &quot;It [Philadelphia] is our international gateway. We&#x27;d like to expand that&quot;. Service to London Heathrow Airport began in March 2008. The airline also added three international flights during the summer of 2009, including Tel Aviv, from Philadelphia. US Airways also started year-round service between Charlotte and Rio de Janeiro, which was discontinued in early 2015.

In 2009 US Airways and Delta reached an agreement to exchange landing/takeoff slots at LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. US Airways also planned to receive additional route authority to São Paulo from Delta as a result of this transaction. Service to São Paulo from its Charlotte hub was discontinued on October 1, 2014.

On November 21, 2012, the airline was awarded a landing slot at London Heathrow Airport for nonstop flights between Charlotte and London Heathrow Airport, complementing the existing route from Philadelphia to London Heathrow. The airline began service from Charlotte to Heathrow on March 30, 2013, replacing its service from Charlotte to Gatwick, which ended the airline&#x27;s service at Gatwick.

===Codeshare agreements===
Throughout its existence, US Airways had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Aegean Airlines 
* Air Berlin
* Air China 
* Air New Zealand 
* All Nippon Airways 
* American Airlines 
* Asiana Airlines 
* Avianca 
* Big Sky Airlines

==Fleet==

By mid-2014, US Airways maintained a predominantly Airbus fleet, with some Boeing jets and small fleet of Embraer jets. The post-merger US Airways continued to operate the largest fleet of Airbus aircraft in the world.

Subsidiaries Piedmont and PSA exclusively flew Bombardier CRJs (PSA), and de Havilland Canada Dash 8s (Piedmont).

==Cabin==

===Envoy===
Envoy was US Airways&#x27; international business class product. It was offered on all Airbus A330s and Boeing 767-200ERs, as well as select Boeing 757-200s. There were three types of Envoy seating in the US Airways fleet:
* Fully flat suites in a reverse herringbone 1–2–1 configuration were found on all Airbus A330s. These were the &quot;Cirrus&quot; model designed by Sicma Aeroseat and featured a fully flat semi-private &quot;pod&quot;.
* Internationally configured Boeing 757-200s and all 767-200ERs featured deep recline cradle seats with around 165 degrees of recline.

Previously, the first row of all Airbus A330-300s were fully flat seats, formerly US Airways&#x27; international first class product. With the transition from three- to two-class international service, these seats were, for a time, offered at a fee to Envoy customers.

Every seat had a personal on-demand video screen either attached to the arm rest or as a portable unit passed out by the crew that offered movies, games and syndicated television shows in multiple languages. There was also an EmPower or AC outlet at each seat.

The airline offered complimentary food and beverage service for all Envoy passengers.

===First Class===
First Class was offered on all domestically configured aircraft. Seat pitch ranged from and a seat width ranging from . Free wine, beer and spirits and a snack basket were offered on all flights, as were blankets. Meals were provided on flights of 2.5 hours or longer.

===Main Cabin===
Main Cabin (Economy Class) was available on all aircraft, with a seat pitch ranging from and a seat width ranging from . Domestic service was a buy-on-board program with full meals available for purchase on flights of 3.5 hours or longer, while shorter flights offered snack boxes. Coffee, tea and soft drinks were complimentary with alcohol available for purchase. Transatlantic and South American flights included standard meals and beverages (including wine) free of charge, with premium meals available for purchase, which included one alcoholic beverage.

===Inflight entertainment===
US Airways offered GoGo Inflight Internet on Airbus A319/A320/A321 and Embraer 170/175/190 aircraft. US Airways had also signed up for GoGo Vision streaming video service which would be available on all GoGo equipped aircraft. Flights to Europe, South America, Hawaii, and domestic flights over 700 miles operated with Boeing aircraft featured movies and TV episodes on overhead screens in Coach. The Airbus A330s featured AVOD at every seat in both Economy and Business Class with a selection of movies, TV episodes, music, and games. Complimentary headsets were available in both Business and Economy on flights to Europe, South America, and the Middle East.

GoGo was usually priced US$5–15 on domestic flights. It was never available on international flights.

==Dividend Miles==
Dividend Miles was US Airways Group&#x27;s frequent-flyer program. Members earned one mile for every mile flown on US Airways on any published fare – paid flights taken in First Class or Envoy received a 50% mileage bonus. Members also earned miles on flights on partner airlines and for partner hotel stays, car rentals, shopping at the Dividend Miles mall and for purchases made with a US Airways credit card. Miles could be redeemed for free flights, upgrades, and more. Dividend Miles was to be absorbed into American Airlines&#x27;s AAdvantage program in the second quarter of 2015. However, American Airlines announced on March 13, 2015, that Dividend Miles would be merged into American&#x27;s AAdvantage program &quot;within the next 30 days&quot;. On March 24, 2015, it was confirmed that Dividend Miles would be absorbed into American&#x27;s AAdvantage program on March 28, 2015. On March 28, 2015, Dividend Miles was officially absorbed into American Airlines&#x27;s AAdvantage program.

In addition to its US Airways Express and Oneworld partnerships, the Dividend Miles program with other partner airlines or programs included:
* Aegean Airlines
* Air China
* Hawaiian Airlines
* Jet Airways
* Shenzhen Airlines
* South African Airways
* TAP Portugal
* Turkish Airlines

==Airport lounges==

===US Airways Club===
US Airways&#x27; airport lounge was called the US Airways Club. There were 19 lounges in 13 airports across the United States. As part of the merger, all US Airways clubs were gradually rebranded as American&#x27;s Admirals Clubs in 2014, except for a few that closed.

In addition to those with paid memberships, the following customers also had complimentary access to Admirals Club locations:
* Passengers traveling in Business Class (renamed from Envoy Class) on an international flight
* Oneworld Emerald and Sapphire members, except American&#x27;s AAdvantage members and US Airways Dividend Miles members who were travelling domestically.

=== Envoy Lounge ===
Philadelphia International Airport&#x27;s Terminal A formerly had an Envoy Lounge reserved exclusively for Envoy Class, Star Alliance international premium passengers, and Star Alliance Gold members traveling on long-haul international flights. Due to the lounge&#x27;s proximity to departing long-haul international flights, this lounge offered a much wider array of food than was typically found at US Airways Clubs. In 2011, the airline converted the Envoy Lounge into a standard US Airways Club, now an Admirals Club.

<text>&quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; () is a Danish literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875). It was first published on 11 November 1843 in &quot;New Fairy Tales. First Volume. First Collection&quot;, with three other tales by Andersen in Copenhagen to great critical acclaim. The tale has been adapted to various media, including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is an original story by Andersen.

==Plot==
After a mother duck&#x27;s eggs hatch, one of the ducklings is perceived by the other animals as an ugly little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse. He wanders from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly, and once again he sets off alone.

The duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited but cannot join them because he is too young, ugly, and unable to fly. When winter arrives, a farmer finds and carries the freezing duckling home but he is frightened by the farmer&#x27;s noisy children and flees the house. The duckling spends a miserable winter alone outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over.

The duckling, now having fully grown and matured, cannot endure a life of solitude and hardship anymore. He decides to throw himself at a flock of swans, feeling that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realise by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been not a duckling but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and he spreads his wings to take flight with the rest of his new family.

==Commentaries and criticism==

In reviewing &quot;Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life&quot; by biographer Jens Andersen, British journalist Anne Chisholm writes &quot;Andersen himself was a tall, ugly boy with a big nose and big feet, and when he grew up with a beautiful singing voice and a passion for the theater, he was cruelly teased and mocked by other children&quot;.

Speculation suggests that Andersen was the illegitimate son of Prince Christian Frederik (later King Christian VIII of Denmark), and found this out sometime before he wrote the book, and then that being a swan in the story was a metaphor not just for inner beauty and talent but also for secret royal lineage.

According to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen&#x27;s friend Jenny Lind.

==Variations==
An alternate version of the tale (&quot;The Blue Hen&#x27;s Chicken&quot;) was included in Joel Chandler Harris&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Rabbit at Home. A Sequel to Little Mr. Thimblefinger and His Queer Country&quot; (1895). Since the story stops at the moment of the birth of the puddle duckling within the family of chicks, the message of the tale could be totally different, focusing on the &quot;bad temper&quot; and the snobbery of the Blue Hen who thus - having found herself with a such an anomalous son - is punished by ending up on everyone&#x27;s lips and constantly being pointed at.

==Adaptations==
The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in Technicolor. The latter film won the 1939 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird&#x27;s ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short &quot;The Little Stranger&quot;, reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks.

In 1932, Yasuji Murata directed &quot;Ahiru no ko&quot; (&quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;), a 15-minute Japanese short animated film based on the tale.

In 1956, the Soviet animation studio Soyuzmultfilm produced its 19-minute version of The Ugly Duckling. The anime &quot;Princess Tutu&quot; is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. The 1954 Tom and Jerry cartoon &quot;Downhearted Duckling&quot; is also based on the famous story.

The tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya&#x27;s adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; composed by Frank Loesser and sung by Danny Kaye for the 1952 Charles Vidor musical film &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;, and &quot;Honk!&quot;, a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an Olivier Award. The tale was adapted into a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.

In 1999, Jerry Pinkney adapted the story as a children&#x27;s picture book.

<text>Fawkes is a surname of Norman-French origin, first appearing in the British Isles after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The surname may be a corruption of the Norman surname Vaux, which means valley. Notably, Guy Fawkes was sometimes recorded as Guy Vaux. An alternative origin for the surname is that it originates from the pre-6th century Germanic given name of &quot;Falco&quot; (later &quot;Faulques&quot;) meaning &quot;falcon&quot;. The first recorded spelling of the surname in England is that of one Geoffrey Faukes in 1221.

It is also, less frequently, a given name.

<doc id="291327" wikidata="Q2845236" url="?curid=291327" title="P-adic analysis">
<text>In mathematics, &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis is a branch of number theory that deals with the mathematical analysis of functions of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers.

The theory of complex-valued numerical functions on the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers is part of the theory of locally compact groups. The usual meaning taken for &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis is the theory of &quot;p&quot;-adic-valued functions on spaces of interest.

Applications of &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis have mainly been in number theory, where it has a significant role in diophantine geometry and diophantine approximation. Some applications have required the development of &quot;p&quot;-adic functional analysis and spectral theory. In many ways &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis is less subtle than classical analysis, since the ultrametric inequality means, for example, that convergence of infinite series of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers is much simpler. Topological vector spaces over &quot;p&quot;-adic fields show distinctive features; for example aspects relating to convexity and the Hahn–Banach theorem are different.

==Important results==

===Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem===

Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem, due to Alexander Ostrowski (1916), states that every non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers Q is equivalent to either the usual real absolute value or a -adic absolute value.

===Mahler&#x27;s theorem===

Mahler&#x27;s theorem, introduced by Kurt Mahler, expresses continuous &quot;p&quot;-adic functions in terms of polynomials.

In any field of characteristic 0, one has the following result. Let

:formula_1

be the forward difference operator. Then for polynomial functions &quot;f&quot; we have the Newton series:

:formula_2

where

:formula_3

is the &quot;k&quot;th binomial coefficient polynomial.

Over the field of real numbers, the assumption that the function &quot;f&quot; is a polynomial can be weakened, but it cannot be weakened all the way down to mere continuity.

Mahler proved the following result:

Mahler&#x27;s theorem: If &quot;f&quot; is a continuous p-adic-valued function on the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers then the same identity holds.

===Hensel&#x27;s lemma===

Hensel&#x27;s lemma, also known as Hensel&#x27;s lifting lemma, named after Kurt Hensel, is a result in modular arithmetic, stating that if a polynomial equation has a simple root modulo a prime number , then this root corresponds to a unique root of the same equation modulo any higher power of , which can be found by iteratively &quot;lifting&quot; the solution modulo successive powers of . More generally it is used as a generic name for analogues for complete commutative rings (including &quot;p&quot;-adic fields in particular) of the Newton method for solving equations. Since &quot;p&quot;-adic analysis is in some ways simpler than real analysis, there are relatively easy criteria guaranteeing a root of a polynomial.

To state the result, let formula_4 be a polynomial with integer (or &quot;p&quot;-adic integer) coefficients, and let &quot;m&quot;,&quot;k&quot; be positive integers such that &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;. If &quot;r&quot; is an integer such that

:formula_5 and formula_6

then there exists an integer &quot;s&quot; such that

:formula_7 and formula_8

Furthermore, this &quot;s&quot; is unique modulo &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;+m, and can be computed explicitly as

:formula_9 where formula_10

==Applications==

===Local–global principle===

Helmut Hasse&#x27;s local–global principle, also known as the Hasse principle, is the idea that one can find an integer solution to an equation by using the Chinese remainder theorem to piece together solutions modulo powers of each different prime number. This is handled by examining the equation in the completions of the rational numbers: the real numbers and the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers. A more formal version of the Hasse principle states that certain types of equations have a rational solution if and only if they have a solution in the real numbers &quot;and&quot; in the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers for each prime &quot;p&quot;.

<text>Beijing Capital International Airport is the busiest of the two international airports serving Beijing, the capital city of China (the other one being Beijing Daxing International Airport). The airport is located northeast of downtown Beijing, in an exclave of Chaoyang and the surroundings of that exclave in suburban Shunyi. The airport is owned and operated by the Beijing Capital International Airport Company Limited, a state-controlled company. The airport&#x27;s IATA Airport code, PEK, is based on the city&#x27;s former romanized name, Peking. The facility covers an area of of airport property.

==History==

Beijing Airport was opened on 1 March 1958. The airport then consisted of one small terminal building, which still stands to this day, apparently for the use of VIPs and charter flights, along with a single runway on its eastern side, which was extended to in 1966 and in 1982 respectively. Another runway on the west was completed in October 1978. On 1 January 1980, a newer, larger Terminal 1 – green in color – opened, with docks for 10 to 12 aircraft. The terminal was larger than the one built in the 1950s but, by the mid-1990s, its size had become inadequate.

The first international flight to China and Beijing Capital International Airport was of Pakistan International Airlines from Islamabad.

In late 1999, to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, the airport underwent a new round of expansion. Terminal 2 opened on 1 November of that year and Terminal 1 was temporarily closed for renovation. 20 September 2004 saw the opening of the renovated Terminal 1 which, at that time, only handled China Southern Airlines&#x27; domestic and international flights from Beijing. Other airlines&#x27; domestic and international flights still operated in Terminal 2.

More expansion began in 2007. A third runway opened on 29 October 2007, to relieve congestion on the other two runways. Terminal 3 (T3) was completed in February 2008, in time for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. The significant expansion included a rail link to the city center.

At its opening, the new Terminal 3 was the largest man-made structure in the world in terms of area covered, and a major landmark in the developing Chinese capital. The expansion was largely funded by a 30 billion yen loan from Japan and a 500-million-euro (US$625 million) loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The loan was the largest ever granted by the EIB in Asia, and the agreement was signed during the eighth China-EU Summit held in September 2005.

Following the 2008 Summer Olympics and the addition of adding the new terminal building, Beijing Capital overtook Tokyo Haneda as the busiest airport in Asia based on scheduled seat capacity.

Due to limited capacity of Beijing Capital International Airport, plans were announced for the construction of a new airport at Daxing. The project was given final approval on 13 January 2013. Construction began in late 2014 and was completed in 2019. The new Daxing Airport became the Beijing home of China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and China United Airlines, while Air China and Hainan Airlines remained at Capital.

==Terminals==

Shuttle buses connect the airport&#x27;s three terminals. Terminal 2 serves Hainan Airlines and SkyTeam with the exception of China Airlines, Oneworld member SriLankan Airlines, and also other domestic and international flights. Terminal 3, the newest terminal, serves Air China, Star Alliance, Oneworld members with the exception of SriLankan Airlines, plus SkyTeam member China Airlines, and some other domestic and international flights that do not operate from Terminals 2.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 opened on 1 November 1999, with a floor area of . This terminal was used to replace Terminal 1 while the latter was undergoing renovation, cramping all airlines despite being far bigger than Terminal 1. It can handle twenty aircraft at docks connecting directly to the terminal building. Prior to the opening of Terminal 3, all international flights (and the majority of domestic flights) operated from this terminal. This terminal now houses Hainan Airlines (all international, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan flights), SkyTeam with the exception of China Airlines, which uses Terminal 3, Oneworld member SriLankan Airlines, Air Koryo, and other domestic and international flights other than those operated by Shanghai Airlines, Star Alliance members and Oneworld members. A gate capable of handling the A380 (gate 21) was also built at the terminal. Star Alliance member Air China also uses Terminal 2 for some of its domestic flights.

Terminals 1 and 2 are linked by a public walkway that takes about 10–15 minutes to traverse.

====Westwing Satellite Terminal (formerly Terminal 1)====
Terminal 1, with of space, opened on 1 January 1980, and replaced the smaller existing terminal, which had been in operation since 1958. Terminal 1 was closed for renovation from 1 November 1999 to 20 September 2004, during which all airlines operated from Terminal 2. Featuring 16 gates, it was the operational base for the domestic routes of China Southern Airlines and a few other airlines such as XiamenAir and Chongqing Airlines, and was originally planned to handle domestic traffic excluding those to Hong Kong and Macau.

With the opening of Terminal 3, the terminal was closed for light refurbishment, and its airlines were moved to Terminal 2 on 20 May 2008. Terminal 1 reopened for a second time on 27 June 2008, and became the operational base for all domestic flights operated by the HNA Group including those of Hainan Airlines, Grand China Air and Tianjin Airlines, while all HNA Group&#x27;s international, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan flights remain in Terminal 2.

On May 3, 2020, Terminal 1 temporary closed for reproposing, after Hainan Airlines moved its all domestic routes to Terminal 2. The Terminal 1 was reopened on August 1, 2023 as Westwing Satellite Terminal as part of Terminal 2.

===Terminal 3===
Construction of Terminal 3 started on 28 March 2004, and the terminal opened in two stages. Trial operations commenced on 29 February 2008, when seven airlines including El Al, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Shandong Airlines and Sichuan Airlines moved into the terminal. Twenty other airlines followed when the terminal became fully operational on 26 March 2008. Currently, it mainly houses Air China, Star Alliance, Oneworld with the exception of SriLankan Airlines, which uses Terminal 2, SkyTeam member China Airlines, and other domestic and international flights that are not operated from Terminal 2. Star Alliance members LOT Polish Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, United Airlines, Air Canada, Turkish Airlines, Thai Airways International, Singapore Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, and Air China use Terminal 3-E as part of the &quot;Move Under One Roof&quot; program to co-locate alliance members.

Terminal 3 was designed by a consortium of Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO), Foster and Partners, Arup and the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD). Lighting was designed by UK lighting architects Speirs and Major Associates. The budget for the expansion is US$3.5 billion. Much larger in size and scale than the other two terminals, Terminal 3 was the largest airport terminal-building complex in the world to be built in a single phase, with in total floor area at its opening. It features a main passenger terminal (Terminal 3C) and two satellite concourses (Terminal 3D and Terminal 3E), all of the five floors above ground and two underground, with the letters &quot;A and B&quot; omitted to avoid confusion with the existing Terminals 1 and 2. Only two concourses were initially opened, namely, Terminal 3C dedicated for domestic flights and Terminal 3E for international flights. Terminal 3D officially opened on 18 April 2013. The newly opened concourse is temporarily used solely by Air China for some of its domestic flights.

At the time of its opening, Terminal 3 was the largest airport passenger terminal building in the world. Its title as the world&#x27;s largest passenger terminal was surrendered on 14 October 2008 to Dubai International Airport&#x27;s Terminal 3, which has of floor space.

On 20 July 2013, a man in a wheelchair detonated small homemade explosives in Terminal 3 of the Beijing International Airport. The bomber, reported to be Ji Zhongxing, was injured and taken to a hospital for his injuries. No other people were hurt.

====System, security and luggage====

Terminal 3 has a transportation hub with a 7,000-car garage. The transportation center has designated traffic lanes for airport buses, taxis, and private vehicles. Travelers bound for T3 can exit their vehicles and enter T3 within five minutes. There is also a station for the Capital Airport Express of the Beijing Subway.

Terminal 3 has 243 elevators, escalators or moving walkways.

One of Terminal 3&#x27;s highlights is the US$240 million luggage-transfer systems. The luggage system is equipped with yellow carts, each of which has a code that matches the bar code on every piece of luggage loaded and allows easy and accurate tracking. More than 200 cameras are used to monitor activities in the luggage area.

The luggage system can handle 19,200 pieces of luggage per hour. After luggage is checked in at any of the 292 counters in Terminal 3C, it can be transferred at a speed of ten meters per second. Hence, a suitcase can travel from T3C to T3E in five minutes. Arriving passengers should be able to begin retrieving their luggage within 4.5 minutes after airplanes are unloaded.

Besides X-ray scanners, additional equipment is used to conduct baggage screening. Passengers will be able to check-in their luggage at the airport from several hours to even a day before their flights. The airport will store the luggage in its luggage system and then load it on the correct aircraft.

====Appearance====
The highest building at the airport, a monitoring tower, stands at the southern end of T3. The roof of T3 is red, the Chinese color for good luck. The terminal&#x27;s ceilings use white strips for decoration and to indicate directions. Under the white strips, the basic color of the ceiling is orange with light to dark tones indicating where a passenger is inside the building. The roof is light orange in the center. The color deepens as the roof extends to the sides in T3E and goes the other way round in T3C.

The roof of T3 has dozens of triangular windows to let in the daylight. Light angles can be adjusted to ensure adequate interior lighting. Many traditional Chinese elements will be employed in the terminal&#x27;s interior decoration, including a &quot;Menhai&quot;, a big copper vat used to store water for fighting fires in the Forbidden City, and the carvings imitating the famous Nine-Dragon Wall.

An indoor garden in the T3E waiting area is built in the style of imperial gardens such as the Summer Palace. In T3C, a tunnel landscape of an underground garden has been finished with plants on each side so that passengers can appreciate them inside the mini-train.

====Facilities====
The T3 food-service area is called a &quot;global kitchen&quot;, where 72 stores provide food ranging from formal dishes to fast food, from Chinese to Western, and from bakery goods to ice cream. Airport officials have promised that people who buy products at the airport will find the same prices in central Beijing. In addition to food and beverage areas, there is a domestic retail area, a duty-free-store area and a nearly convenience-service area, which includes banks, business centers, Internet services and more. At , the commercial area is twice the size of Beijing&#x27;s Lufthansa Shopping Center.

The terminal provides 72 aerobridges or jetways and is further complemented with remote parking bays that bring the total number of gates to 150. Terminal 3 comes with an additional runway. It increases BCIA&#x27;s total capacity by 72 million passengers per year to approximately 90 million.

====Airbus A380====
The terminal has gates and a nearby runway that can handle the Airbus A380. This capability was proven when Singapore Airlines briefly offered A380 flights to Beijing in August 2008 during the Summer Olympics. Emirates started its scheduled daily operation to Dubai on 1 August 2010. Singapore Airlines has been using an A380 since June 2014 and increased to two A380s in 2015. China Southern Airlines operated two flights to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, Chongqing Jiangbei Airport, and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport starting from 2011, 2013, and 2015 before retiring them in 2023. Lufthansa has been using these facilities since October 2010 to handle up to five A380 flights per week.

Terminal 3 consists of three sub-concourses. Both domestic and international travellers check in at concourse T3C. Gates for domestic flights are in T3C, and gates for domestic flights operated by Air China are also located in concourse T3D. All international, Hong Kong, and Macau, and Taiwan flights are handled in concourse T3E.

In conjunction with the construction of the new terminal, Bombardier Transportation installed a automated people mover which connects T3C and T3E via T3D in a 2–5-minute one-way trip. The line uses Innovia APM 100 vehicles running at 6-minute intervals at a maximum speed of .

New Innovia APM 300 vehicles is being delivered to Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3 People Mover in July 2021.

Beijing Capital International Airport is served by the Capital Airport Express, a dedicated rail link operated as part of the Beijing Subway system. The line runs from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 and then to the city with stops at Sanyuanqiao and Dongzhimen before ending at Beixinqiao. The line opened on 19 July 2008, in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics, while a one-stop extension to Beixinqiao station was opened on 31 December 2021. A one-way trip takes approximately 16–20 minutes.

===Bus===

There are 18 bus routes to and from points throughout the city including Xidan, Beijing railway station, Beijing South railway station, Beijing West railway station, Zhongguancun, Fangzhuang and Shangdi. The airport buses run to each of the three terminals and cost up to ¥30 per ride depending on the route. The airport buses accept only paper tickets that are sold at each terminal and certain bus stops in the city. The airport also offers intercity bus services to and from neighboring cities including Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Baoding, Langfang and Tangshan.

===Car===
The airport is accessible by four expresses tollways, two of which run directly from northeastern Beijing to the airport. The other two connect to the airport from nearby highways.

*The Airport Expressway is a toll road that runs from the northeastern 3rd Ring Road at Sanyuanqiao directly to Terminals 1 and 2. It was built in the 1990s and has served as the primary road connection to the city.
*The 2nd Airport Expressway, opened in 2008, is a toll road that runs east from Yaojiayuan Lu at the eastern 5th Ring Road and then north to Terminal 3.
*The Northern Airport Line, opened in 2006, is an toll road that runs east from the Jingcheng Expressway to Terminals 1 and 2.
*The Southern Airport Line, opened in 2008, is a toll road that runs parallel and to the south of the Northern Airport Line from the Jingcheng Expressway to the eastern Sixth Ring Road at the Litian Bridge. This highway crosses the Airport Expressway and 2nd Airport Expressway, and enables drivers on the former to reach Terminal 3 and the latter to head to Terminals 1 and 2.

<text>Traffic is the second studio album by the English rock band of the same name, released in 1968 on Island Records in the United Kingdom as ILPS 9081T (stereo), and United Artists in the United States, as UAS 6676 (stereo). The album peaked at number 9 in the UK Albums Chart and at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. It was the last album recorded by the group before their initial breakup.

==Background and content==
In January 1968, after some initial success in Britain with their debut album &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot;, Dave Mason had departed from the group. He produced the debut album by the group Family, containing in its ranks future Traffic bass player Ric Grech, while Traffic went on the road. In May, the band had invited Mason back to begin recording the new album.

The album was somewhat of a departure from the psychedelia of Traffic&#x27;s debut, featuring a more eclectic display of influences from blues to folk and jazz. Mason ended up writing and singing half of the songs on the album (including his biggest hit &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot;), but making scant contribution to the songs written by Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood. His flair for pop melody had always been at odds with the others&#x27; jazz ambitions, evidenced by the dichotomy seen for the songs on this album, and by October he was again out of the band. He would return one more time for a tour and album in 1971 to run out the band&#x27;s contract.

&quot;Traffic&quot; was reissued for compact disc in the UK on 11 January 2000, with five bonus tracks, two from the soundtrack to the United Artists film &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot; and three from &quot;Last Exit&quot;. In the US, the remastered reissue of 27 February 2001 included mono single mixes of &quot;You Can All Join In&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot;, and the stereo single mix of &quot;Withering Tree&quot;. The original album was produced by Jimmy Miller. The remasters were assisted in their production by Jim Capaldi.

==Reception==

Both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in the US and &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; in the UK gave highly positive reviews at the time of release, with the latter calling it &quot;an album of pure pleasure&quot; and declaring Traffic to be &quot;one of the most perfect musical groups in the world.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; enthused that the album showed tremendous pace and originality, more accurately reflecting their live act. AllMusic gives a five-star retrospective review of the album, commenting that it achieved a strong balance between Dave Mason&#x27;s simple and straightforward folk-rock songs and Steve Winwood&#x27;s complex and often haunting rock jams.

It was voted number 312 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="291336" wikidata="Q223729" url="?curid=291336" title="White paper">
<text>A white paper is a report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body&#x27;s philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. Since the 1990s, this type of document has proliferated in business. Today, a business-to-business (B2B) white paper is closer to a marketing presentation, a form of content meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a certain product or viewpoint. That makes B2B white papers a type of grey literature.

The term originated in the 1920s to mean a type of position paper or industry report published by a department of the UK government.

== In government ==
The term &quot;white paper&quot; originated with the British government, with the Churchill White Paper of 1922 being an early example. In the British government, a white paper is usually the less extensive version of the so-called &quot;blue book&quot;, both terms being derived from the colour of the document&#x27;s cover.

White papers are a &quot;tool of participatory democracy ... not [an] unalterable policy commitment&quot;. &quot;White papers have tried to perform the dual role of presenting firm government policies while at the same time inviting opinions upon them.&quot;

In Canada, a white paper is &quot;a policy document, approved by Cabinet, tabled in the House of Commons and made available to the general public&quot;. The &quot;provision of policy information through the use of white and green papers can help to create an awareness of policy issues among parliamentarians and the public and to encourage an exchange of information and analysis. They can also serve as educational techniques.&quot;

White papers are a way the government can present policy preferences before it introduces legislation. Publishing a white paper tests public opinion on controversial policy issues and helps the government gauge its probable impact.

By contrast, green papers, which are issued much more frequently, are more open-ended. Also known as &quot;consultation documents&quot;, green papers may merely propose a strategy to implement in the details of other legislation, or they may set out proposals on which the government wishes to obtain public views and opinion.

Examples of governmental white papers include, in Australia, &quot;Full Employment in Australia&quot; and, in the United Kingdom, the White Paper of 1939 and the 1966 Defence White Paper. In Israeli history, the British White Paper of 1939 marking a sharp turn against Zionism in British policy and at the time greeted with great anger by the Jewish Yishuv community in Mandatory Palestine is remembered as &quot;&quot;The&quot; White Paper&quot; (in Hebrew Ha&#x27;Sefer Ha&#x27;Lavan literally &quot;The White Book&quot;).

== In business-to-business marketing ==
Since the early 1990s, the terms &quot;white paper&quot; or &quot;whitepaper&quot; have been applied to documents used as marketing or sales tools in business. These white papers are long-form content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts and logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document.

B2B (business-to-business) white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, grow email lists, grow audiences, increase sales, or inform and persuade readers. The audiences for a B2B white paper can include prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, investors, or any other stakeholders.

White papers are considered to be a form of content marketing or inbound marketing; in other words, sponsored content available on the web with or without registration, intended to raise the visibility of the sponsor in search engine results and build web traffic. Many B2B white papers argue that one particular technology, product, ideology, or methodology is superior to all others for solving a specific business problem. They may also present research findings, list a set of questions or tips about a certain business issue, or highlight a particular product or service from a vendor.

There are, essentially, three main types of commercial white papers:
* Backgrounder: Describes the technical or business benefits of a certain vendor&#x27;s offering; either a product, service, or methodology. This type of white paper is best used to supplement a product launch, argue a business case, or support a technical evaluation at the bottom of the sales funnel or the end of the customer journey. This is the least challenging type to produce, since much of the content is readily available in-house at the sponsor.
* Numbered list: Presents a set of tips, questions, or points about a certain business issue. This type is best used to get attention with new or provocative views, or cast aspersions on competitors. Also called a listicle this is the fastest type to create; a numbered list can often be devised from a single brainstorming session, and each item can be presented as an isolated point, not part of any step-by-step logical argument.
* Problem/solution: Recommends a new, improved solution to a nagging business problem. This type is best used to generate leads at the top of the sales funnel or the start of the customer journey, build mind share, or inform and persuade stakeholders, building trust and credibility in the subject. This is the most challenging type to produce, since it requires research gathered from third-party sources and used as proof points in building a logical argument.

While a numbered list may be combined with either other type, it is not workable to combine a backgrounder with a problem/solution white paper. While a backgrounder looks inward at the details of one particular product or service, a problem/solution looks outward at an industry-wide problem. This is rather like the difference between looking through a microscope and looking through a telescope.

==Variants==
Several variations on the colour theme exist:
* The green paper is a proposal or consultative document rather than being authoritative or final.
* The Red Book, the UK Chancellors Budget will set out the highlights and reasoning behind the governments proposed taxation and spending policies in a White Paper called &quot;The Financial Statement and Budget Report&quot; (FSBR) while an accompanying document called the &quot;Red Book&quot; will contain the detailed financial costings of the policies, estimates of revenue and forecasts for public sector borrowing.

Two others are much less well established:
* A blue paper sets out technical specifications of a technology or item of equipment.
* A yellow paper is a document containing research that has not yet been formally accepted or published in an academic journal. It is synonymous with the more widely used term &quot;preprint&quot;.

<text>Carmine ()also called cochineal (when it is extracted from the cochineal insect), cochineal extract, crimson [[Lake pigment|lake]], or carmine lake is a pigment of a bright-red color obtained from the aluminium complex derived from carminic acid. Specific code names for the pigment include natural red 4, [[Colour Index International|C.I.]] 75470, or [[E number|E120]]. &quot;Carmine&quot; is also a general term for a particularly deep-red color.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;carmine&quot; is derived from the French word &quot;carmin&quot; (12th century), from Medieval Latin &quot;carminium&quot;, from Persian &quot;qirmiz&quot; (&quot;crimson&quot;), which itself derives from Middle Persian &quot;carmir&quot; (&quot;red, crimson&quot;). The Persian term &quot;carmir&quot; is likely cognate with Sanskrit &quot;krimiga&quot; (&quot;insect-produced&quot;), from &quot;krmi&quot; (&quot;worm, insect&quot;). The Persian word for &quot;worm, insect&quot; is &quot;kirm&quot;, and in Iran (Persia) the red colorant carmine was extracted from the bodies of dead female insects such as &quot;Kermes vermilio&quot; and cochineal. The form of the term may also have been influenced in Latin by &quot;minium&quot; (&quot;red lead, cinnabar&quot;), said to be of Iberian origin. 

The word &quot;carmine&quot; has been used as a color name as early as 1799. It is a popular food color, used in yogurt, candy, gelatin, meat, and beverages including fruit juices.

== History ==
Female &quot;Dactylopius coccus&quot; (cochineal) insects were used for their red coloring power as early as 700 BC. American civilizations (from the American continent) crushed the bugs present on cacti to extract the carmine they contain. Carmine pigment was extensively used by the Aztec civilization to dye textiles. It was imported later to Europe during the 16th century.

Red is a color often associated with power and social status. Through the centuries, red has been worn by tribal chiefs, kings and queens, and military officers.

Cochineal was a major source of income for the Spanish Crown. By weight, it was a far more valuable commodity than sugar, making it especially lucrative for overseas trade. As part of the triangular trade, its production and consumption were intertwined with slavery.

In European markets, the Spanish Crown had a monopoly on cochineal until 1820 when the French learned to cultivate them. Later, German and British scientists created a synthetic red dye that competed with carmine. The combination of these factors contributed to the end of the Spanish monopoly and considerably lowered the price of carmine, making it accessible to a wider audience.  

==Production==
The pigment is produced from carminic acid, which is extracted from some scale insects such as the cochineal scale (&quot;Prima&quot;), and certain &quot;Porphyrophora&quot; species (Armenian cochineal and Polish cochineal). Attempts have been made to farm cochineal.

Carmine is a colorant used in the manufacture of artificial flowers, paints, crimson ink, rouge and other cosmetics, and some medications.

Synthetic carminic acid is complex and expensive to produce. Therefore, natural cochineal carmine is predominant on the market. Its instability presents challenges for use in art and textiles, but this is less of a hindrance in the context of cosmetics. As its synthetic production is still largely experimental, ongoing research focuses on improving the efficiency and sustainability of the synthetic pathways.
=== Preparation ===
To prepare carmine, the powdered scale insect bodies are boiled in an ammonia or sodium carbonate solution. After separating the insoluble matter, the extract is treated with alum to precipitate the red solid. This precipitate is called &quot;carmine lake&quot; or &quot;crimson lake&quot;. Purity of color is ensured by the absence of iron. Stannous chloride, citric acid, borax, or gelatin may be added to modify the precipitation. The traditional crimson color is affected not only by carminic acid but also by choice of its chelating metal salt ion. For shades of purple, lime is added to the alum.

To obtain of red dye, 70,000 cochineal insects are required.

==Identification and characteristics ==
Scientists can detect the presence of carminic acid through liquid chromatography and a diode array detector combined with a mass spectrometer with a quadruple-time-of-flight analyzer (LC-DAD-QTOF). The process is used for identifying carmine in works of art.

Scientific methods can also distinguish among the different species of cochineal used in artworks.

=== Wavelength ===
As confirmed by reflectance spectroscopy, carmine reflects mostly red light. Its hue ranges from 497 nm for a dark purplish red and 612 nm for a vibrant red.

=== Hue ===
Carmine&#x27;s hue is dependent on the metallic ions present in the pigment. For instance, carmine combined with zinc or aluminum yields a crimson hue.

=== Translucence ===
The translucence of carmine depends on its binding medium. Mixed with oil, carmine remains translucent and adequate for glazes. Combined with tempera or glue, carmine turns opaque.

=== Value ===
On the Munsell color scale, carmine&#x27;s value can range between 3.32 and 6.35.

== Permanence ==
Carmine is a fugitive color, whose fading is influenced by different factors such as light, humidity, or even the color of the glass of a frame. It is highly sensitive to light and tends to fade into brownish tones.

In painting, its durability depends on the type of binding. For instance, pigments are more stable if mixed with linseed oil rather than with gum arabic. It is especially sensitive to light in watercolor. Carmine can be stabilized when precipitated with alum and when combined with tin salt mordants.

== Notable occurrences in art ==
Carmine was used in dyeing textiles and in painting since antiquity. Numerous examples are found among Inca remains such as textile artifacts. The Aztecs also used carmine.

In Europe, the 16th century Italian painter Jacopo Tintoretto used carmine in several of his paintings, the most notable being &quot;Portrait of Vincenzo Morosini&quot; (1575-80) and &quot;Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples&quot;(1575-80).

Carmine was also used by nineteenth-century artists such as Vincent van Gogh in &quot;Bedroom in Arles&quot; (1889). The floor of the bedroom is painted with carmine cochineal lake, geranium lake and indigo. This produced a reddish color, which over time changed to blueish.           

Analysis of J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s palettes found that he used cochineal carmine. The fading of this pigment affected the appearance of the sky in &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot; (1839).

== Other uses ==
=== Architecture ===

Carmine red has been used in military cartography at least since the 17th century. Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, General Engineer of France, recommended the use of this red pigment to represent fortifications (ramparts, wood timbers, and brick buildings being reddish). This made buildings more distinct on maps

=== Cosmetics ===
Carmine is present in numerous cosmetics because of its red color. This use has continued from antiquity to the present. It can be found in lipstick, eye shadow, nail polish. It may cause allergies.

=== Histology ===
Carmine can be used in histology, as &quot;Best&#x27;s carmine&quot; to stain glycogen, &quot;mucicarmine&quot; to stain acidic mucopolysaccharides, and &quot;carmalum&quot; to stain cell nuclei. In these applications, it is applied together with a mordant, usually an Al(III) salt.

=== Medicine ===
Cochineal, the insect used to make carmine, also has medical properties that were exploited by the Aztecs. It is said to help cure wounds when mixed with vinegar and applied to lesions. Aztecs used it to clean teeth.

=== Regulations for use in foods ===
==== United States ====
In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluated a proposal that would require food products containing carmine to list it by name on the ingredient label. It was also announced that the FDA will separately review the ingredient labels of prescription drugs that contain colorings derived from carmine. A request from the Center for Science in the Public Interest urging the FDA to require ingredient labels to explicitly state that carmine is derived from insects and may cause severe allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock was declined by the FDA. Food industries were aggressively opposed to the idea of writing &quot;insect-based&quot; on the label, and the FDA agreed to allow &quot;cochineal extract&quot; or &quot;carmine&quot;.

==== European Union ====
In the European Union (EU), the use of carmine in foods is regulated under the European Commission&#x27;s directives governing food additives in general and food dyes in particular and listed under the names &quot;Cochineal&quot;, &quot;Carminic acid&quot;, &quot;Carmines&quot; and &quot;Natural Red 4&quot; as additive E 120 in the list of EU-approved food additives. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods only and specifies a maximum amount which is permitted or restricts it to the quantum satis.

The EU-Directive 2000/13/EC on food labeling mandates that carmines (like all food additives) must be included in the list of ingredients of a food product with its additive category and listed name or additive number, that is either as &quot;Food colour carmines&quot; or as &quot;Food colour E 120&quot; in the local language(s) of the market(s) the product is sold in.

, EFSA has changed the way they allow use of Carmine E120 for pharmaceutical products. The EFSA had raised concerns over the increasing number of allergic reactions to carmine derived from insects (E120.360), when used within the &quot;British Pharmacopoeia&quot;. Pharmaceutical products which had previously contained insect-derived carmine, have been replaced with a synthesized version of the food colorant. Internal studies have shown that the new formulations of popular anti-nausea and weight-gain liquid medication had a significantly lower risk in terms of allergic reactions. The new formulation is known to be of plant origin, using calcium oxide to gauge color depth.

<text>The Church in Wales () is an Anglican church in Wales, composed of six dioceses.

The Archbishop of Wales does not have a fixed archiepiscopal see, but serves concurrently as one of the six diocesan bishops. The position is currently held by Andy John, Bishop of Bangor, since 2021.

Unlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales is not an established church. Disestablishment took place in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914.

As a province of the Anglican Communion, the Church in Wales recognises the Archbishop of Canterbury as a focus of unity but without any formal authority. A cleric of the Church in Wales can be appointed to posts in the Church of England, including the See of Canterbury; a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, was from Wales and served as Archbishop of Wales before his appointment to Canterbury.

==Official name==
The Church in Wales () adopted its name by accident. The Welsh Church Act 1914 referred throughout to &quot;the Church &quot;in&quot; Wales&quot;, the phrase being used to indicate the part of the Church of England within Wales. At a convention (of the Welsh Church) held in Cardiff in October 1917, Mr Justice Sankey said that, while the name &quot;the Church &quot;of&quot; Wales&quot; appealed to him, he advised that there were good legal reasons why the name &quot;the Church &quot;in&quot; Wales&quot; should be adopted, at least at first, to follow the wording in the act. The matter was therefore left at that convention for the second Governing Body to decide at its first session.

==History==

Christianity in Wales can be traced back to the Romano-British culture and an organised episcopal church has had continuous existence in Wales since that time. The Age of the Saints in the 6th and 7th centuries was marked by the establishment of monastic settlements throughout the country by religious leaders such as Saint David, Illtud, Padarn and Saint Teilo. This was the period when the Welsh people developed a shared national identity, arising from their language and religious beliefs.

The Welsh refused to cooperate with Augustine of Canterbury&#x27;s mission to the Anglo-Saxons. However, a combination of other Celtic dioceses reconciling with the Holy See and the conquest of Wales by Edward I meant that from the Middle Ages, the Welsh dioceses were part of the Province of Canterbury and also in communion with the See of Rome until the English Reformation. Afterward, they were part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920, as during the reign of Henry VIII, Wales was incorporated into the legal realm of the Kingdom of England. 

===Disestablishment===

During the 19th century, Nonconformist churches increased in Wales, and eventually, the majority of Welsh Christians were Nonconformists, although the Church of England remained the largest single denomination. By the mid-19th century, failing to appoint a Welsh-speaking bishop to any Welsh diocese for 150 years caused real resentment; disestablishment was seen as a way to assert national and linguistic identity.

Under the influence of Nonconformist politicians such as David Lloyd George, the Welsh Church Act 1914 was passed by the Liberal Government to separate Anglicanism in Wales from the Church of England. The bill was fiercely resisted by members of the Conservative Party and blocked in the House of Lords, but it was eventually passed under the provisions of the Parliament Act 1911.

The opposition to disestablishment was led by the Conservative politician F. E. Smith, who characterised the disestablishment bill as &quot;a Bill which has shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe.&quot; In response to this description, the writer G. K. Chesterton penned the satirical poem &quot;Antichrist, or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode&quot; containing the memorable retort &quot;Chuck It, Smith&quot;.

The act both &quot;disestablished&quot; and &quot;disendowed&quot; the &quot;Church in Wales&quot;, the term used to define the part of the Church of England which was to be separated. Disestablishment meant the end of the church&#x27;s special legal status, and Welsh bishops were no longer entitled to sit in the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. As the Church in Wales became independent of the state, tithes were no longer available to the church, leaving it without a major source of income.

Disendowment, which was even more controversial than disestablishment, meant that the endowments of the Church in Wales were partially confiscated and redistributed to the University of Wales and local authorities. This process was carried out by the Welsh Church Commissioners following the principles set out in the Welsh Church Act 1914. Endowments before 1662 were to be confiscated; those of later date would remain. This was justified by the theory that the pre-1662 endowments had been granted to the national church of the whole population, and hence belonged to the people as a whole rather than to the Church in Wales; understandably, this reasoning was hotly contested. The date 1662 was that of the Act of Uniformity following the Restoration; it was after this point that Nonconformist congregations began to develop and the Church of England ceased to be a comprehensive national church. Although secularisation of the cathedrals had previously been suggested,
the Church in Wales retained all the ancient church buildings and the privilege of conducting legal marriages without reference to the civil registrar.

Due to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Suspensory Act 1914 was passed at the same time as the Welsh Church Act 1914, meaning that the act would not be implemented for the duration of the war. Disestablishment finally came into effect in 1920. The Church in Wales adopted a written constitution, which has been revised from time to time, and elected a Governing Body which initially met once a year,
but now meets twice annually. The Governing Body has ultimate authority &quot;to approve liturgies, review organizational structures, and secure firm fiscal resources for the mission and ministry of the church&quot;. The Church in Wales was one of the first members of the Anglican Communion to adopt synodical government.

===Since 1920===
Parishes overlapping the border were allowed to vote either to accede to the Church in Wales or to continue in the Church of England; so the line of disestablishment is not the same as the border between the two countries. A few districts in the former counties of Monmouthshire, Radnorshire and Flintshire remain attached to parishes in the Dioceses of Hereford and Chester and consequently they are part of the Church of England. A complete English rural deanery with the generalised name March containing Oswestry and areas to the north-west of Shrewsbury, was transferred from its historic setting in the Diocese of St Asaph to be consistent with the civil border there. The churches of St Mary, Caernarfon, and Llangadwaladr, Anglesey, were transferred from the Diocese of Chester to that of Bangor.

Today, the Church in Wales is fully independent of both the state and the Church of England. It is an independent member of the Anglican Communion, as are the Church of Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church.

In the first years of the 21st century, the Church in Wales has begun to engage in numerous debates. These particularly concern the appointment of women to the episcopate and the provincial recognition of the equal statuses of the Welsh and English languages in all aspects of church life.

==Membership==
Following disestablishment in 1920, the Church in Wales initially fared better than the Nonconformist churches, which suffered a decline during the late 20th century. In 1960 the Church claimed to have 182,854 communicants, an increase on the comparable figure of 155,911 for 1945, although a reduction on the figure of 196,389 Easter communicants in 1938. The Anglican Church does not have &quot;a single definition of &#x27;membership&#x27; in the Church in Wales.&quot; In 2006 the average weekly attendance was recorded at 6,780 aged under 18 and 39,490 aged over 18. The highest attendance was at Easter, with 68,120 at worship (68,837 in 2007).
In 2014, the attendance in the Church in Wales was 52,021 at Easter: a decline of about 16,000 members since 2007, but an increase from 2013. Also, in 2014, nineteen churches were closed or made redundant. Overall, in 2014, the Church in Wales reported 152,000 attenders in its parishes and congregations, compared to 105,000 in 2013. In 2018, the number of communicants during Easter was 46,163 and the number of persons on the Electoral Roll was 42,441.

From 2015 statistics, when all &quot;other major acts of worship&quot; are included, the church reported having 206,000 total attenders. &quot;Such additional services, which include civic services, family services, Remembrance, Carol and Christingle services, registered a total attendance of some 206,000 in 2015, compared with 152,000 in 2014.&quot; In 2017, &quot;parishes recorded 210,000 people attending other types of traditional worship, which might include civic services, family services, Remembrance, Carol and Christingle services.&quot;

In 2000, membership figures taken as a percentage of the population was 1.6%. Between 1996 and 2016 the number of signed-up Church in Wales members dropped from 91,247 to 45,759 or 1.5% out of a total population of 3,113,150 The number of Church in Wales members on the &quot;Electoral Roll&quot; dropped further to 42,441 by 2018 or 1.4% out of the total Welsh population of 3,187,203 The Anglican church claims to be the largest denomination in Wales.

==Structure==

The polity of the Church in Wales is episcopal church governance, which is the same as other Anglican churches.

Prior to 1920, there were four dioceses in Wales, all part of the Province of Canterbury and each led by its own bishop:

*The Diocese of Bangor
*The Diocese of St Asaph
*The Diocese of St Davids
*The Diocese of Llandaff

Two additional dioceses were created soon after the disestablishment of the Church in Wales:

*The Diocese of Monmouth in 1921
*The Diocese of Swansea and Brecon in 1923

Monmouth was created from one of the archdeaconries of Llandaff diocese, largely following the boundaries of the traditional (pre-1974) county of Monmouthshire. Swansea and Brecon was created from the eastern part of the St Davids diocese, largely corresponding to the present day city and county of Swansea and the traditional counties of Breconshire and Radnorshire (now part of the county of Powys).

Each diocese is divided into two or three archdeaconries, with 15 of these in total. Each has an archdeacon, who is responsible to the bishop for its administration. The archdeaconries are further divided into deaneries.

Each diocese has its own cathedral, the &quot;mother church&quot; of the diocese and the seat of the bishop - literally, as the cathedral holds the &#x27;cathedra&#x27;, the bishop&#x27;s chair. In the cathedral are held important events such as the enthronement of a new bishop and the ordination of priests and deacons. Each cathedral has a dean, appointed to manage the cathedral, with the assistance of the chapter. Together with the archdeacons, the dean of the cathedral is one of the most prominent clerics of the diocese, after the bishop. The chapter is composed of the dean and a number of canons selected from among the clerics of the diocese.

===Diocesan and episcopal coats of arms===
The following episcopal coats of arms are those each bishop is privileged to carry whilst in office. The diocesan coat of arms is identical to the episcopal version except that it is not surmounted by the mitre. With the introduction of the new logos for many of the diocese, their strict use has fallen away during recent years (generally since 2006 onwards) and, as such, the coats of arms are often used synonymously.
===Archbishop===
Until 1920 the Welsh church was part of the Church of England and under the metropolitical jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury. Since independence in 1920, the Church in Wales has been led by the Archbishop of Wales, who is both the metropolitan bishop and primate. The archbishop of Wales is elected from the currently seated diocesan bishops and continues as a diocesan after election. Although it is not necessary for every see in the Church in Wales to be filled before an archbishop may be elected, if the vacancy in a see is caused by the resignation of the archbishop, or it arises within 14 days thereafter, the vacant see must be filled before an archbishop can be elected. In an archiepiscopal vacancy, the senior bishop by date of appointment is acting archbishop.

A former Archbishop of Wales, Rowan Williams, became the first Welsh-born Archbishop of Canterbury. He was consecrated and enthroned as Bishop of Monmouth in 1992 and as Archbishop of Wales in 1999. He was appointed by the Queen (his appointment having been proposed by the Crown Appointments Commission) as Archbishop of Canterbury in July 2002. He left the post in December 2012.

===Diocesan bishops===
Unlike bishops in the Church of England, each bishop of the Church in Wales is elected by an &quot;electoral college&quot; which consists of all diocesan bishops of the church (including the archbishop), and clerical and lay representatives of all of the dioceses of the Church in Wales. The composition of the electoral college is weighted so that the diocese in which a vacancy occurs is entitled to twice the number of clerical and lay electors compared with other individual dioceses. If no candidate who is considered by the electoral college obtains the support of the necessary two-thirds majority of the electors within the three consecutive days of deliberation which are allowed, the decision passes to the bench of bishops. This has occurred on two recent occasions. In 2013 the Church in Wales officially agreed to the ordination of women as bishops, after a previous proposal for their ordination failed in 2008.

In descending order of seniority, as of 17 October 2023 (after Davies&#x27; election to St Davids), the bench of Welsh bishops consists of:
* Andy John, Bishop of Bangor and Archbishop of Wales
* Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph
* Cherry Vann, Bishop of Monmouth
* John Lomas, Bishop of Swansea and Brecon
* Mary Stallard, Bishop of Llandaff
* Dorrien Davies, Bishop of St Davids

In addition, it has been announced that David Morris is to become Assistant Bishop of Bangor and titular Bishop of Bardsey in summer 2024.

In cases where a see is vacant due to the death or translation of a bishop, episcopal acts such as ordinations and confirmations are carried out by the archbishop or by another bishop appointed for that purpose by the archbishop.

, four of the bishops used the Welsh name of their See as their episcopal signature (Bangor, Llanelwy for St Asaph, Tyddewi for St Davids, and Mynwy for Monmouth); Landav derives from the Latin Landavensis and the then-Bishop of Swansea and Brecon was Archbishop (who signs as Cambrensis, Latin for &#x27;of Wales&#x27;).

===Assistant bishops===
Assistant bishops may be appointed within the Church in Wales. Although there have been several assistant bishops in the diocese of Llandaff, in practice assistant bishops have been appointed in other dioceses only when the diocesan bishop is the archbishop for the time being, in order to assist them with diocesan episcopal functions. As archbishop, Barry Morgan had an Assistant Bishop of Llandaff: from April 2009 to April 2017 that post was held by David Wilbourne. See also: Assistant Bishop of St Asaph. On 26 January 2022, it was announced that Mary Stallard had been appointed Assistant Bishop of Bangor, to assist Andy John in his diocesan duties while he also serves as Archbishop of Wales; her consecration took place on 26 February 2022 at Bangor Cathedral.

A provincial assistant bishop was appointed in 1996 to provide episcopal ministry to congregations which could not accept the ministry of bishops who ordained women. The role was analogous to the office of Provincial episcopal visitor in the Church of England. David Thomas held the position for twelve years, retiring in 2008. At that time the Bench of Bishops decided that it would not continue to appoint a specific bishop to minister to those who reject the ordination of women as priests. This point was reiterated by Barry Morgan at the Governing Body of the Church in Wales in September 2013, during the debate on whether or not the Church in Wales would ordain women to the episcopate.

Historically, there have been suffragan bishops both before and since disestablishment, including two Bishops of Swansea and one Bishop of Maenan. From 1946 until his death in 1953, Richard William Jones (Archdeacon of Llandaff and Rector of Peterston-super-Ely) was &quot;Assistant Bishop of Wales&quot;.

===Representative Body===
The Representative Body of the Church in Wales is responsible for the care of the church&#x27;s property and for funding many of the activities of the church, including support for clergy stipends and pensions. Its somewhat misleading title - unlike the Governing Body, it is not a representative decision-making body - is derived from the fact that under the Welsh Church Act 1914 the bishops, clergy and laity were required to set up a body to &quot;represent&quot; them and to hold property which was transferred to them by the Welsh Church Commissioners.

===Governing Body===
The Governing Body of the Church in Wales is responsible for decisions that affect the church&#x27;s faith, order and worship. It also has powers to make regulations for the general management and good government of the church and its property and affairs. The Governing Body is the supreme legislature of the Church in Wales, broadly speaking the Parliament of the Church in Wales. It usually meets twice a year to receive reports and make decisions on matters brought before it.

==Worship and liturgy==
The Church in Wales as a whole tends to be predominantly High Church, meaning that many of the traditions are inherited from the Oxford Movement in more rural dioceses such as St Davids and Bangor and especially in the industrial parishes of Llandaff and Monmouth. Although the province tends more toward liberal and Anglo-Catholic positions in theology and liturgy, it also has a tradition of evangelicalism, especially in the southern parts of Wales, and the university town of Aberystwyth. In the 1960s there was a revival of evangelicalism within the Church in Wales and the Evangelical Fellowship of the Church in Wales exists to support such members of the church.

===&quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;===

An Act of Parliament passed in the year 1563, entitled &quot;An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue,&quot; ordered that the Old and New Testament, together with the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, were to be translated into Welsh. A translation by Richard Davies, bishop of St Davids and the scholar William Salesbury was published in 1567 by Humphrey Toy as &quot;Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin&quot;. A new revision — based on the 1662 English prayer book and probably by George Griffith, Bishop of St Asaph - was published in 1664. The 1662 prayer book and its Welsh equivalent continued to be used, even after the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920.

The Church in Wales began revising the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in the 1950s. The first material authorised for experimental use was a lectionary in 1956, followed by a baptism and confirmation service in 1958, an order for Holy Matrimony in 1960, and an order for the Burial of the Dead in 1962. These did not however enjoy widespread use. In 1966 an experimental order for the Holy Eucharist was authorised. This was the first to enjoy widespread use. Revision continued throughout the 60s and 70s, with an experimental version of morning and evening prayer in 1969. In 1971 a definitive version of baptism and confirmation was authorised, replacing the equivalent in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. This was followed in 1974 with a definitive order for the Burial of the Dead, and in 1975 with a definitive order for Holy Matrimony. It was hoped that a new Book of Common Prayer for the Church in Wales would be produced in 1981. However, in 1979 a definitive version of the Holy Eucharist failed to gain a two-thirds majority in the House of Clergy and the House of Laity at the Governing Body. A light revision of the 1966 experimental Eucharist was approved by the Governing Body, and the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales was authorised in 1984. This Prayer Book is unique in that it is in traditional English. The Church in Wales first considered a modern language Eucharist in the early 70s but this received a lukewarm reception. A modern language Eucharist (The Holy Eucharist in modern language) was authorised alongside the new prayer book in 1984, but this did not enjoy widespread use. In 1990 new initiation services were authorised, followed in 1992 by an alternative order for morning and evening prayer in 1994 by an alternative order for the Holy Eucharist, in 1995 by the alternative calendar lectionary and collects, and in 1998 an order for compline was produced. These enjoyed widespread use. In 2003 a new calendar and collects was made part of the Book of Common Prayer for use in the Church in Wales. This was followed in 2004 by an order for the Holy Eucharist, services for Christian initiation in 2006 and in 2009 by daily prayer. Experimental services continued, with an ordinal produced in 2004, Ministry to the Sick and Housebound in 2007, healing services in 2008, funeral services in 2009, and in 2010 marriage services which became part of the Book of Common Prayer in 2013. The ordinal was made part of the prayer book the following year. In 2017 prayers for a child were released, together with a Revised Order for Confirmation, the latter authorised for five years experimental use following the bench of Bishops&#x27; decision to admit unconfirmed children and adults to communion. In 2018 Times and Seasons was released. All of these were published on line. The following year Funeral Services became part of the Book of Common Prayer, and additional prayers for different events in life were launched (Blessing of a home, prayers for victims of crime etc.).

===Other publications===
Discontinued publications which frequently provided articles of sub-academic quality were &quot;Province&quot;, &quot;Yr Haul â&#x27;r Gangell&quot;, and &quot;Y Llan&quot;. Bi-annual news from the Governing Body meeting is released in &quot;Highlights&quot;. News is predominantly circulated on the Church in Wales&#x27; provincial and diocesan websites, and in various diocesan magazines.

==Doctrine and practice==
Central to the teaching of the Church in Wales is the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, include:
*Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
*Jesus continues to provide the way to eternal life for those who believe.
*The Old and New Testaments were written by people &quot;under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit&quot;. The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine.
*The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist
*Other sacramental rites are confirmation, holy orders, matrimony, reconciliation of a penitent, and anointing of the sick.
*Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus&#x27; return in glory.

The balance of Scripture, tradition and reason as authority for faith and practice is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker&#x27;s model, Scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine, and things stated plainly in Scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.

=== Ordination of women ===
A proposal to ordain women as priests was introduced and debated in 1995 after it had failed to secure a two-thirds majority in 1994. The ordination of women to the priesthood was approved by the two-thirds majority in 1996. The Church in Wales has ordained women as priests since 1997. Prior to 1997, women were permitted to serve as deacons. The first deaconess was consecrated in 1884. In 2013, the church voted to allow women to serve as bishops. In 2016, Joanna Penberthy was elected the first woman bishop in the church. Penberthy was enthroned as Bishop of St Davids on 11 February 2017. As of 2020, following the enthronement of Cherry Vann as Bishop of Monmouth, there were three women bishops, and three men bishops, sitting on the Welsh Bench of Bishops. This situation was maintained in 2021, with John Lomas having been elected as Bishop of Swansea and Brecon following the resignation of John Davies. In 2022, Stallard&#x27;s consecration as Assistant Bishop of Bangor meant that a majority of the active bishops in the Church in Wales was female, a situation presumed to be a first in any Anglican church. Although a Twitter feed suggested that Stallard had joined the &quot;Bench&quot; of bishops, this was a loose use of terminology, as the &quot;Bench&quot; consists of the Archbishop and the other diocesan bishops.

===Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy===
Beginning in the 1980s, the Church in Wales embarked on an increasingly open stand on various issues including economic justice, the ordination of women and inclusion of homosexual people. In some areas, such as human sexuality, the church establishment has faced resistance from congregations. In 2005, the church allowed gay priests to enter into civil partnerships. &quot;In the wake of civil partnerships, the Welsh Bishops sought legal advice, and told gay partnered clergy that they were welcome, as well as gay ordination candidates.&quot; Speaking on such partnerships, it was communicated that &quot;The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships who are in a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, it is up to the relevant Bishop to decide.&quot; Therefore, the Welsh church does not require abstinence for clergy in civil unions. Regarding transgender issues, an officer announced that the church believes transgender people &quot;should be acknowledged and celebrated in their new gender.&quot; Currently, &quot;the Church has published prayers that may be said with a couple following the celebration of a [same-sex] civil partnership or civil marriage.&quot;

Currently, &quot;the Church in Wales is much more liberal on this issue [than the Church of England]&quot; and is discussing the possibility of blessing or performing same-sex marriages. In 2018, the Welsh Bishops released a statement saying it was &quot;unjust&quot; to not offer formal provision for same-sex marriages and civil partnerships. Following the bishops&#x27; announcement, the General Synod voted in favour of requesting formal provision for same-sex couples. The Welsh Church has decided to move forward with possibly offering same-sex marriage and blessing rites for same-sex unions. The Diocese of St Asaph provides a chaplaincy and services for LGBT people. Jeffrey John, who is openly gay and in a civil partnership, was nearly elected bishop of Llandaff when he &quot;won more than half of a Church in Wales electoral college, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required.&quot; As of 2020, the Church in Wales has consecrated a bishop, Cherry Vann, who is openly lesbian and in a civil partnership.

&quot;The Anglican Church in Wales took the first steps towards allowing clergy to celebrate same sex marriage in its churches when more than half its Governing Body voted in favour of the move.&quot; In the 2016 results, 52% of the Governing Body voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages in church. &quot;Members of the Church in Wales Governing Body voted 61 in favour of gay marriages in church, nine in favour of blessing gay partnerships and 50 for making no change.&quot; As a result of the majority support for same-sex couples, but not a two-thirds majority needed to create a same-sex marriage ceremony, the church&#x27;s Bench of Bishops affirmed members in same-sex relationships and &quot;published a series of prayers which may be said with a couple following the celebration of a civil partnership or civil marriage.&quot; The service, in Form One, gives God thanks &quot;for [the two people] who have found such love and companionship in each other, that it has led them to dedicate their lives in support of one another.&quot; In September 2021, the Church in Wales voted to &quot;formally bless same-sex couples&quot; instead (by way of debate and compromise) – but still not legally recognising same-sex marriage within titles of the Church officially.

===Ecumenical relations===
Following the similar step taken by the Church of England in 1932, and other Anglican provinces, the Church in Wales entered into intercommunion with the Old Catholics in 1937. The Church in Wales has also been a member of the Porvoo Communion since September 1995. Because of the Anglo-Catholic dominance, relations with the Free Churches (formerly known during establishment times as Nonconformists), ecumenical progress has been slower in Wales than in England. The Church in Wales is a member of the Covenanted Churches in Wales. A covenant (with church unity as an ultimate goal) was signed by the Church in Wales, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church of Wales, the United Reformed Church, and some Baptist churches in 1982 under the title of &quot;Enfys&quot; (&quot;rainbow&quot;).

<text>Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport — also known as Guam International Airport — is an international airport located in Tamuning and Barrigada, east of the capital city of Hagåtña (formerly Agana) in the United States territory of Guam. The airport is a primary cargo hub for Asia Pacific Airlines. It is also the home of the former Naval Air Station Agana, and is the only international airport in the territory. The airport is named after Antonio Borja Won Pat, the first delegate from Guam to the United States House of Representatives, and is operated by the A.B. Won Pat International Airport Authority, Guam (GIAA, ), an agency of the Government of Guam.

==History==
===Military use===
The airport was built by the Japanese Navy about 1943, calling the military airfield Guamu Dai Ni (Guam No. 2) as part of their defense of the Marianas. After the island was recaptured by American forces in 1944, it was renamed Agana Airfield, due to the proximity of the town. After being repaired by Seabees of the 5th Construction Brigade in October 1944, the United States Army Air Forces Seventh Air Force used the airfield as a base for the 11th Bombardment Group, which flew B-24 Liberator bombers from the station until being moved to Okinawa in July 1945. With the reassignment of the heavy bombers, the 41st Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron flew long-range reconnaissance aircraft (F-5 Lightnings) from the field until January 1946.

After the war, the USAAF used the airfield for fighter defense of the Marianas (21st Fighter Group), (549th Night Fighter Squadron) until early 1947 and as a transport hub (9th Troop Carrier Squadron). In 1947, the USAAF turned over the airfield to the United States Navy, which consolidated its facilities with those at the closing Harmon Air Force Base in 1949, and operated Naval Air Station Agana until it was closed by the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

===Civilian use===
Travel to Guam was restricted to military personnel with a security clearance until 1962. During these early years, a single Quonset hut served as Guam&#x27;s air terminal. The lifting of this travel restriction spurred the development of the airport; its International Air Terminal opened in March 1967 and accommodated its first tour group from Japan two months later. Operations of the terminal were passed onto the Government of Guam&#x27;s Department of Commerce in 1969. In 1975, the Guam International Airport Authority (GIAA) was created as a separate agency. After NAS Agana was closed in April 1995, GIAA took over the entire airport&#x27;s operations.

A new passenger terminal building was opened in 1982, and the current, much larger terminal building was opened in phases between 1996 and 1998.

After a period of seasonal charters, the first regular flight to Mainland China from Guam was established in 2014. The United Airlines service to Shanghai Pudong International Airport began on October 29, 2014.

===Project Hulo&#x27;===
In July 2017, the A.B. Won Pat International Airport Authority launched its Vision Hulo&#x27; campaign, which includes around $167 million in capital improvement projects to help boost services and operation for the airport. The projects are set to increase the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity, which already annually serves 3.55 million departing and transiting passengers. The projects include the relocation of bulky baggage screenings, additional security lanes, the expansion of parking spaces, and more.

A $110 million international arrivals corridor, the largest in the project, is the airport&#x27;s newest capital improvement project. The third level corridor will finally put the airport compliance with federal regulations by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration in 2005, in response to 9/11, by separating arriving international passengers with departing passenger and allowing the airport to finally remove the semi-permanent barriers and reclaim full use of the concourse.

In the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Guam, flights to and from Guam stopped, except for United Airlines, which maintained daily service to Honolulu and thrice-weekly service to Narita. A year later in April 2021, limited flights were being conducted by United Airlines, Philippine Airlines and Jin Air.

==Customs, immigration, and security inspections==
Arrival passenger inspection is conducted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (immigration only) and Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency. Departure security checks are conducted by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.

===Customs===
Because Guam is outside the United States customs jurisdiction, passengers from all arrival flights go through Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency inspection. Passengers bound for Honolulu, which is currently the only Stateside flight, go through a normal U.S. Customs and Border Protection customs inspection upon arrival.

===Immigration===
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspects all arriving passengers from foreign points.

Passengers arriving from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a separate U.S. immigration jurisdiction with slightly different visa requirements, are pre-inspected there for admissibility to Guam. Nonstop passengers bound for Honolulu are pre-inspected at Guam&#x27;s boarding gate for admissibility to the United States because of the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands Visa Waiver Program, which allows visa-free entry to Guam for tourists from Australia, Brunei, mainland China, Hong Kong (with a Hong Kong Identity Card), Japan, Malaysia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (with a Republic of China passport with a National ID number and a valid Republic of China national identity card), and United Kingdom (with a British Citizen passport or a British National Overseas passport).

For U.S. citizens, passports are not required to enter Guam from the Northern Mariana Islands; other forms of identification proving admissibility are accepted. Passports are required for those transiting a foreign country between the United States and Guam.

Transit passengers, except from Honolulu and the Northern Mariana Islands, are also inspected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection before being allowed to proceed to their connecting gate. Because all onward flights depart Guam&#x27;s customs jurisdiction, no baggage claim is necessary.

===Security===
The Transportation Security Administration conducts security inspection for departing passengers and all transit passengers.

Transit passengers who arrive from the United States or the Northern Mariana Islands are screened by Transportation Security Administration at their origins, so they are not screened again in Guam.

Guam–Honolulu passengers who have onward connections must go through Transportation Security Administration inspection again in Honolulu because they will have come into contact with their checked baggage during U.S. customs inspection there.

==Facilities==
The airport covers at an elevation of above sea level. It has two asphalt runways:

* Runway 6L/24R: 12,017 x 150 ft (3,663 x 46 m.), surface: asphalt, ILS/DME equipped, with approved GPS and VOR/DME approaches
* Runway 6R/24L: 10,014 x 150 ft (3,052 x 46 m.), surface: asphalt, ILS/DME equipped, with approved GPS approaches

For the 12-month period ending February 28, 2022, the airport had 24,804 aircraft operations, an average of 68 per day: 65% general aviation, 1% air taxi, 27% commercial airline and 7% military. At that time, there were 42 aircraft based at this airport: 25 single-engine and 4 multi-engine airplanes, and 13 jets.

===Passenger terminal===


The current passenger terminal&#x27;s first phase was completed on September 10, 1996. The terminal included a new customs and immigration hall and a 710 space parking lot. In August 1998, the second phase of the current passenger terminal opened. The expansion program that opened the current terminal had a cost of $741 million.

The terminal has three levels. The basement level houses arrival facilities, including customs and baggage claim. The basement also houses the GIAA Airport Police and GIAA Arcade offices and the Hafa Adai Gardens. The apron level (the departure level) houses the ticketing counters. The third floor houses the departure gates, immigration facilities, and GIAA administrative offices. The front of the airport displays stylized latte stone motifs; the latte stone is an icon of modern CHamoru identity.

Since all flights require customs or immigration inspection, the airport&#x27;s post-security concourse and gate area was not designed to separate arriving and departing passengers. The only normal passenger entrance is through security and the only normal exit is through immigration. Except for the few gates designated for Honolulu arrivals, which route passengers directly to customs, all other gates do not have a separate arrival corridor. Arrival passengers walk directly into the gates&#x27; waiting area, and in the past could purchase food or merchandise before entering the immigration hall.

The original design is said to be compliant with security standards at the time of opening. However, after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. government began to require separation of uninspected arrival passengers. The airport initially used a system of chairs, moving sidewalks, retractable belts and security/police staffing to usher arriving passengers from the gate to the immigration hall without coming into physical contact with departing passengers. In recent years, semi-permanent movable walls separate much of the length of the terminal building into two halves, decreasing the need for human staffing and those lighter objects previously in use.

Two lounges are available to passengers at Guam, the Sagan Bisita Lounge and the United Club.

===Old terminal building===
The old terminal served as the corporate headquarters of Continental Micronesia until late 2010. The , $43 million Commuter Terminal was dedicated on January 19, 1982. At the time of opening, the Guamanian people referred to the terminal as a &quot;white elephant,&quot; believing that the terminal was so large that it would never be fully used. After the current terminal building opened, the old terminal building became the Commuter Terminal (serving Freedom Air and Pacific Island Aviation). By 2003, the Guam International Airport Authority moved commuter airlines out of the Commuter Terminal and leased the entire facility to Continental Micronesia.

===Other facilities===
* Cargo facilities are located between the main terminal and the commuter terminal.
* Japan Airlines opened a flight crew training center at GUM in October 2013. JAL trains Boeing 737 and Boeing 767 pilots at the airport, including touch-and-go operations during off-peak hours.
* The airport can handle multiple larger aircraft, including the former world&#x27;s largest, the Antonov An-225.
* United Airlines opened a new City Ticket Office location on the airport grounds in 2017.

==Accidents and incidents==
Several fatal accidents have occurred on and near Guam over the years. In total, 367 deaths occurred from six aircraft accidents.

* On August 6, 1997, Korean Air Flight 801, a Boeing 747-300, crashed as it was attempting to land at the airport. Of the 254 people on board, 229 were killed.
* On June 10, 2009, Jetstar Airways Flight 20 flying from Kansai International Airport to Gold Coast Airport experienced a small fire in the cockpit apparently caused by a fault in the heating system. The fire was quickly extinguished by the pilots who subsequently diverted the plane to Guam. All 203 people on board were unharmed in the incident. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau determined the cause of the fire to be an overheat related to the use of a polysulfide sealant in the electrical connections to the windshield.

<doc id="291341" wikidata="Q74109" url="?curid=291341" title="World War II in Albania">
<text>In Albania, World War II began with its invasion by Italy in April 1939. Fascist Italy set up Albania as its protectorate or puppet state. The resistance was largely carried out by Communist groups against the Italian (until 1943) and then German occupation in Albania. At first independent, the Communist groups united in the beginning of 1942, which ultimately led to the successful liberation of the country in 1944.

The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless.

==Background==

In 1938, Germany annexed Austria and moved against Czechoslovakia without notifying Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in advance, so he decided in early 1939 to proceed with his own annexation of Albania. Italy&#x27;s King Victor Emmanuel III criticised the plan to take Albania as an unnecessary risk. 

Italy, however, issued an ultimatum to the Albanian government on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy&#x27;s occupation of the country. King Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonisation of Albania, and on April 7, 1939, Mussolini&#x27;s troops, led by General Alfredo Guzzoni, invaded Albania, attacking all Albanian ports simultaneously. There were 65 units in Sarandë, 40 at Vlorë, 38 in Durrës, 28 at Shëngjin and 8 more at Bishti i Pallës. The original Italian plans for the invasion called for up to 50,000 men supported by 137 naval units and 400 aircraft. Ultimately the invasion force grew to 100,000 men supported by 600 aircraft.

In Durrës, a force of only 360 Albanians—mostly gendarmes and townspeople—led by Abaz Kupi, the commander of the gendarmerie in Durrës, and Mujo Ulqinaku, a marine official, tried to halt the Italian advance. Equipped only with small arms and three machine guns, they succeeded in keeping the Italians at bay for several hours. Then a large number of small tanks were unloaded from Italian ships and resistance crumbled. Within five hours Italian troops had captured the city. By 1:30 pm on the first day, all Albanian ports were in Italian hands.

Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son Skander fled to Greece and eventually to London. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to unite the country with Italy. The Albanian parliament voted to depose Zog and unite the nation with Italy &quot;in personal union&quot; by offering the Albanian crown to Victor Emmanuel III. The Italians set up a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci and soon absorbed Albania&#x27;s military and diplomatic service into Italy&#x27;s. On April 15, 1939, Albania withdrew from the League of Nations, from which Italy had resigned in 1937. On June 3, 1939, the Albanian foreign ministry was merged into the Italian foreign ministry. The Albanian military was placed under Italian command and formally merged into the Italian Army in 1940. Additionally, the Italian Blackshirts formed four legions of Albanian Fascist Militia, initially recruited from Italian colonists living in Albania, but later also from ethnic Albanians.

Upon invading, Galeazzo Ciano tried to reinforce an impression of benevolence with a number of initial gestures aimed more at public relations than at addressing any of Albania&#x27;s profound social and economic problems. One of Ciano&#x27;s first moves was to distribute food and clothing in some of the poor areas and to release political prisoners. He personally distributed 190,000 gold francs to the needy in Tirana, Shkodra, Vlora, Gjirokastra, Saranda, Korçë and Kukës. Because the money was given directly to the poor, bypassing the usual bureaucracy, it did some good. The Italians also contributed greatly to infrastructure, agriculture, and chrome and hydrocarbon exploration, in which Albania was rich. The Italians hoped that extensive investment in Albania would bring both economic and political benefits. Despite a weak domestic economy, Mussolini guaranteed the Albanians 22 million pounds over five years for economic development, considerably more than the 8.2 million Rome had spent since the early 1920s.

Initial reports of Italian activity were quite favourable. American journalist Ruth Mitchell commented at the end of April 1939, &quot;What a great improvement there is in the condition of the people already. The whole atmosphere had become brisker and more enterprising; now at least there is hope.&quot; Even the German minister , perpetually critical of the Italians, commented favorably on the Italian tempo, which he likened to the tempo in Austria after its annexation by Germany. The new construction projects brought in large amounts of capital and employed many Albanians. The government began permitting Italians to take technical positions in Albania&#x27;s civil service, and also began allowing Italian settlers to enter Albania. This largely affected the Albanians&#x27; attitude towards the Italian invaders and the locals greeted them with more respect and amity.

==Italian puppet state==
In spite of Albania&#x27;s long-standing protection and alliance with Italy, on 7 April 1939 Italian troops invaded Albania, five months before the start of the Second World War. The Albanian armed resistance proved ineffective against the Italians and, after a short defense, the country was occupied. On 9 April 1939, Zog I fled to Greece.

In an effort to win Albanian support for Italian rule, Galeazzo Ciano and the Fascist regime encouraged Albanian irredentism towards Kosovo and Chameria. Despite Francesco Jacomoni&#x27;s assurances of Albanian support in view of the promised &quot;liberation&quot; of , Albanian enthusiasm for the war was distinctly lacking. The few Albanian units raised to fight during the developments of the Greco-Italian War (1940–1941) alongside the Italian Army mostly &quot;either deserted or fled in droves&quot;. Albanian agents recruited before the war, are reported to have operated behind Greek lines and engaged in acts of sabotage but these were few in number. Support for the Greeks, although of limited nature, came primarily from the local Greek populations who warmly welcomed the arrival of the Greek forces in the southern districts.

One of Mussolini&#x27;s plans for the Italian protectorate of Albania was to italianize its citizens.

==Communist and Nationalist resistance==

===Origin of Communism===
Faced with an agrarian and mostly Muslim society monitored by King Zog&#x27;s security police, Albania&#x27;s Communist movement attracted few adherents in the interwar period. In fact, the country had no fully-fledged Communist Party before World War II. After Fan Noli fled in 1924 to Italy and later the United States, several of his leftist protégés migrated to Moscow, where they affiliated themselves with the Balkan Confederation of Communist Parties and through it the Communist International (Comintern), the Soviet-sponsored association of international communist parties. In 1930, the Comintern dispatched Ali Kelmendi to Albania to organise communist cells. However, Albania had no working class on which the communists could rely for support. Paris became the Albanian communists&#x27; hub until Nazi deportations depleted their ranks after the fall of France in 1940.

===Enver Hoxha&#x27;s and Mehmet Shehu&#x27;s early years===
Enver Hoxha and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, Mehmet Shehu, eventually rose to become the most powerful figures in Albania for decades after the war. The dominant figure of modern Albanian history, Enver Hoxha rose from obscurity. Born in 1908 to a Tosk landowner from Gjirokastër who returned to Albania after working in the United States, Hoxha attended the country&#x27;s best college-preparatory school, the National Lycée in Korçë. In 1930 he attended the university at Montpellier in France, but lost an Albanian state scholarship for neglecting his studies. He subsequently moved to Paris and Brussels. After returning to Albania in 1936 without having earned a degree, he taught French for years at his former lycée and participated in a communist cell in Korçë. He later went to Tirana and when the Albanian Communist Party was formed in November 1941, he was appointed as the general secretary of the party, a post he kept until his death in 1985.

Shehu, also a Tosk, studied at Tirana&#x27;s American Vocational School. He went on to a military college in Naples but was expelled for left-wing political activity. In Spain Shehu fought in the Garibaldi International Brigade and became a commander of one of the brigade&#x27;s battalions. After the Spanish conflict was over, he was captured and interned in France. He returned to Albania in 1942 and soon became a prominent figure. During the conflict, he won a reputation for his command abilities with the partisans. In his memoirs published in 1984, British Special Operations Executive David Smiley wrote:

&quot;Mehmet Shehu was a short, wiry, dark sallow-faced man of about thirty who seldom smiled except at other people&#x27;s misfortunes. He spoke good English, was very capable and had far more military knowledge than most other Albanians... He had a reputation for bravery, courage, ruthlessness, and cruelty--he had boasted that he personally cut the throats of seventy Italian carabinieri who had been taken prisoner. I got along with him at first, for as soldiers we had something in common; but he did little to conceal his dislike for all things British, and my relations with him deteriorated.&quot;

===Beginning of Albanian Communist and Fascist parties and National Liberation Movement===

After the invasion of Albania by Italy in April 1939, 100,000 Italian soldiers and 11,000 Italian colonists settled in the country. Initially the Albanian Fascist Party received support from the population, mainly because of the unification of Kosovo and other Albanian-populated territories with Albania proper after the conquest of Yugoslavia and Greece by the Axis powers in the spring 1941. Benito Mussolini boasted in May 1941 to a group of Albanian fascists that he had achieved the Greater Albania long desired by Tirana nationalists. The Albanian Fascist Party of Tefik Mborja had strong support among the population after the Albania annexation of Kosovo.

Several groups were led by Baba Faja Martaneshi, former gendarmerie officer Gani bey Kryeziu, communist Mustafa Gjinishi, and rightist politician Muharrem Bajraktari. An attempt to unite those groups in one organization was undertaken by Major Abaz Kupi, by now a democratic politician, who created an underground organisation called the Unity Front. This front, which increased in numbers within several months, was crushed in April 1941 after the defeat of Yugoslavia and Greece. Some of its members passed over to the collaborationist camp, some were arrested, and some others fled to the mountains. The warfare ceased for a while.

In November 1941, the small Albanian Communist groups established an Albanian Communist Party in Tirana of 130 members under the leadership of Hoxha and an eleven-man Central Committee. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organisation netted few recruits.
The resistance in Albania became active after the defeats of the Italian forces in the war with Greece, which started on 28 October 1940. Originally the slogan of building the &quot;Greater Albania&quot;, into which the Italians promised to incorporate a substantial part of Greek Epirus (Cameria), allowed collaborationist authorities to mobilise several thousand volunteers for the army (besides regular troops). The collapse of the Italian offensive in Greece caused a crisis among the regular troops, who refused to take part in further fights, as well as in volunteer units, which dispersed; some soldiers made for the mountains. Eventually, the number of combat groups and partisan detachments, reinforced by deserters from the army, had grown to dozens, with over 3,000 men. In November in Lezhë, a town near the port of Shëngjin on Adriatic coast, mutinous soldiers who refused further service in Italian units fought a battle with an Italian punitive expedition, killing 19 and badly wounding 30 Italians, before retreating to the mountains. In the same month a partisan detachment laid an ambush for an Italian transport column &quot;en route&quot; to Gjirokastër. Several Italians were killed. On 17 May 1941 in Tirana a young man called Vasil Laçi attempted to assassinate king Victor Emmanuel III by shooting at him. However he failed and was shortly after executed.

In mid-1942, however, the Party called on young people to fight for the liberation of their country from Italy. This increased the number of new recruits by many young people eager for freedom. In September 1942, the party organised a popular front organisation, the National Liberation Movement (NLM), from a number of resistance groups, including several that were strongly anti-Communist. During the war, the NLM&#x27;s Communist-dominated partisans, in the form of the National Liberation Army, ignored warnings from the Italian occupiers that there would be reprisals for guerrilla attacks. Such reprisals would elicit a desire for revenge, and new recruits.

On 17–22 February 1943 in the village of Labinot, the first nationwide conference of ACP took place. The estimation of the political and military situation in the country pointed to the need to create a homogeneous national liberation army. A decision concerning warfare tactics also was taken; it recommended that commanders of units conduct actions with bigger forces. On 17 May, twelve partisan detachments under the homogeneous command carried out an attack on the Italian garrison in Leskovik, which protected an important road junction. Partisans encircled the town in a tight ring and undertook the offensive. Over 1,000 Italians held the town. The battle lasted three days. The commander of the garrison had demanded air support, but before the support arrived, partisans seized the town. The Italians lost several hundred soldiers and considerable quantities of weapons and equipment. At the end of June the Italians started a punitive expedition against partisans in the region of Mallakastra and Tepelenë. Two thousand partisans took up defensive positions on mountain passes. In the first clash the Italians were forced back, but they renewed the action on 14 July with tanks, artillery and aircraft. After four days of fighting, the partisans had suffered heavy losses and retreated to higher parts of the mountains. In general from May to July the Italians lost thousands and many were wounded.

After March 1943, the NLM formed its first and second regular battalions, which subsequently became brigades, to operate along with existing smaller and irregular units. Resistance to the occupation grew rapidly as signs of Italian weakness became apparent. At the end of 1942, guerrilla forces numbered no more than 8,000 to 10,000. By the summer of 1943, when the Italian effort collapsed, almost all of the mountainous interior was controlled by resistance units.

The NLM formally established the National Liberation Army (NLA) in July 1943 with Spiro Moisiu as its military chief and Enver Hoxha as its political officer. It had 20,000 regular soldiers and guerrillas in the field by the end of that year. However, the NLA&#x27;s military activities in 1943 were directed as much against the party&#x27;s domestic political opponents, including prewar liberal, nationalist, and monarchist parties, as against the occupation forces.

=== Nationalist resistance ===

A nationalist resistance to the Italian occupiers emerged in October 1942. Ali Këlcyra and Mit’hat Frashëri formed the Western-oriented and anti-communist Balli Kombëtar (National Front). This movement recruited supporters from both the large landowners and peasantry. They supported the creation of Greater Albania by Italians and called for the creation of a republic and the introduction of economic and social reforms, opposing King Zog&#x27;s return. Their leaders acted conservatively, however, fearing that the occupiers would carry out reprisals against them or confiscate the landowners&#x27; estates. The nationalistic Gheg chieftains and the Tosk landowners often came to terms with the Italians, and later the Germans, to prevent the loss of their wealth and power. The Balli Kombëtar, which had fought against the Italians, was threatened by the superior forces of the LNC and the Yugoslav Partisans, who were backed by the Allies.
Among prominent Balli Kombëtar commanders were Safet Butka and . Butka had been interned in Italy for two years until he was released in August 1942 and allowed to return to Albania. He then took to the mountains and became an outstanding leader of the Balli Kombëtar movement in the Korçë area. The nucleus of his guerrilla group, 70 seasoned and highly experienced fighters, could in an emergency become a thousand men strong. The Butka group had been giving valuable assistance to the fighters at Vlorë and had recovered from the military depots in the villages of Dardhe, Suli, Gračani, Progri, Pleshishti, and Verbinj all the agricultural production (corn, tobacco, wool, etc.) which the Italians had requisitioned and restored to its owners. His forces attacked Italians on Floq in January 1943, Vithkuq in March 1943.

The fighting that took place with general commander Hysni Lepenica during August 1942 in Dukat, Mavrovë, Vadicë, Drashovicë and with the help of Allied aviation resulted in victory. After Italian capitulation, Communists and Ballists sought the peaceful surrender of all remaining Italian forces. However Hysni Lepenica, instructed by the Central Committee of the National Front, went to Gërhot, where the Italian division &quot;Ferrara&quot; was located to take their weapons as agreed with the division general, but after Tilman&#x27;s intervention the division general attacked Lepenica&#x27;s group. At the battle of Gjorm that resulted in a decisive victory for the Albanians and the death of Italian Colonel Clementi, Lepenica committed suicide when he heard that clashes between the Communists and Ballists had started. In the autumn of 1943, Nazi Germany occupied all of Albania after Italy was defeated. Fearing reprisals from larger forces, the Balli Kombëtar made a deal with the Germans and formed a &quot;neutral government&quot; in Tirana with which it continued its war with the LNC and the Yugoslav Partisans.

The Balli Kombëtar were also active in Kosovo and Macedonia. Their forces were mainly centered in Mitrovica, Drenica, and Tetovo. However the Balli Kombëtar in these regions were more aggressive than the Ballists of Albania. 

With the Germans driven out by the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Albanian communists claiming victory in Albania, Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito ordered the collection of weapons in Kosovo and the arrest of prominent Albanians. This was not well received among Albanians. Combined with the passions felt about Kosovo, it inflamed an insurrection. On 2 December 1944, Ballists from the Drenica region attacked the Trepča mining complex and other targets. Similarly in Kičevo, Gostivar and Tetovo, the remaining Ballists tried to remain in control of the region after the Yugoslav Partisans announced victory. The insurrection was later crushed and Ballist leaders were either imprisoned, exiled or killed due to their co-operation with the Nazis. Ballists were also active in Montenegro and Sandžak fighting the Chetniks in the area.

===Between Italian surrender and German occupation===
With the overthrow of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist regime and Italy&#x27;s surrender in 1943, the Italian military and police establishment in Albania buckled. Five Italian divisions were disarmed by the Germans, but many Italians soldiers evaded capture and flocked to the guerrilla forces; the sixth Italian division in Albania (41st Infantry Division Firenze) went over to the Resistance. The communists took control of most of Albania&#x27;s southern cities, except Vlorë, which was a Balli Kombëtar stronghold, and nationalists attached to the NLM gained control over much of the north.

British agents working in Albania during the war fed the Albanian resistance fighters with false information that the Allies were planning a major invasion of the Balkans and urged the disparate Albanian groups to unite their efforts. In August 1943, the Allies convinced communist and Balli Kombëtar leaders to sign the Mukje Agreement that would coordinate their guerrilla operations. The two groups eventually ended all collaboration, however, over a disagreement on the postwar status of Kosovo. The communists supported returning the region to Yugoslavia after the war with the hope that Tito would cede Kosovo back to Albania peacefully, while the nationalist Balli Kombëtar advocated keeping the province.

====Mukje agreement====

The Mukje Agreement was a treaty signed on August 2, 1943, in the Albanian village of Mukje between the nationalist Balli Kombëtar and the communist National Liberation Movement. The two forces would work together in fighting off Italy&#x27;s control over Albania. However, a dispute arose concerning Kosovo. Whereas the Balli Kombetar proposed to fight for the integration of Kosovo into Albania, the Communist representatives objected fiercely. The Balli Kombetar labelled the partisans traitors to Albania and often called them &quot;Tito&#x27;s dogs&quot; while the partisans accused the Balli Kombetar of collaborating with the Axis powers, thus igniting a war between the two that lasted a year.

===German occupation===
After the neutral government was formed, Ballist forces in collaboration with Germans fought the Communists extensively. Balli Kombëtar captured Struga in Macedonia after defeating the partisan garrison.

Tirana was liberated by the partisans on 17 November 1944 after a 20-day battle. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. The National Liberation Army, which in October 1944 consisted of 70,000 regulars, also took part in the war alongside the antifascist coalition. The Albanian partisans also helped in the liberation of Kosovo, and assisted Tito&#x27;s communist forces in liberating part of Montenegro and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that time, the Soviet Army was also entering neighboring Yugoslavia, and the German Army was retreating from Greece into Yugoslavia.

==Communist takeover==
===Provisional Communist administration===
The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, German attacks drove them out of certain areas until June. On May 29 the members of the National Liberation Front (as the movement was by then called) held the Congress of Përmet, which chose an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania&#x27;s administration and legislature. Hoxha became the chairman of the council&#x27;s executive committee and the National Liberation Army&#x27;s supreme commander. The communist partisans defeated the last Balli Kombëtar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944 and encountered only scattered resistance from the Balli Kombëtar when they entered central and northern Albania by the end of July. The British military mission urged the remnants of the nationalists not to oppose the communists&#x27; advance, and the Allies recalled their representatives with them to Italy. They did not evacuate nationalist leaders, although many fled.

Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from Tirana, and the communists took control by attacking it. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at Berat in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.
==Aftermath==
Albania stood in an unenviable position after World War II. The NLF&#x27;s strong links with Yugoslavia&#x27;s communists, who also enjoyed British military and diplomatic support, guaranteed that Belgrade would play a key role in Albania&#x27;s postwar order. The Allies never recognized an Albanian government in exile or King Zog and failed to raise the question of Albania or its borders at any of the major wartime conferences. No reliable statistics on Albania&#x27;s wartime losses exist, but the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration reported about 30,000 Albanian war dead, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people left homeless. Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses.

Furthermore, thousands of Cham Albanians were driven out of Greece and accused of collaborating with the Axis occupation forces.

During the Nazi occupation, most Jews in Albania proper were saved. During the Axis occupation of Kosovo, Albanian collaborators persecuted Serb and Montenegrin settlers. Between 70,000 and 100,000 were expelled or transferred to concentration camps in Pristina and Mitrovica while nearly 10,000 are estimated to have been killed by the Vulnetari and other Albanian paramilitaries.

==Foreign participation==
There were a significant number of foreign citizens who participated in Albanian resistance during World War II. They were composed mostly of Italian soldiers who wished to continue the war against Nazi Germany, but other people from different nationalities participated also.

===Italian participation===
Albanian resistance began in 1940 with small &quot;çetas&quot; but it became a significant force in 1942. Even during this period there were small groups of Italian soldiers who deserted the fascist army and joined the Albanian partisans. When Italy capitulated in September 1943 there were already some 122 Italian partisans dispersed among various units in the Albanian National Liberation Army. When Italy capitulated there were some 100,000 Italian soldiers in Albania. They were from the &quot;Firenze&quot;, &quot;Parma&quot;, &quot;Perugia&quot;, &quot;Arezzo&quot;, &quot;Brennero&quot; divisions and other small independent units.

Many Italian forces surrendered to the advancing German army. Most of them were sent to concentration camps or for forced labour in Albania in the service of the German army, and there were also mass killings of Italian officers, mostly from the &quot;Perugia&quot; Division centred in Gjirokastër. Its general, Ernesto Chiminello, together with 150 officers, were executed in Saranda. Some other 32 officers were also killed in Kuç area three days later.

Some Italians took refuge in the mountains of Albania, while about 15,000 Italian soldiers surrendered to Albanian partisans. Some Italian troops led by Arnaldo Azzi, ex-commander of Firenze Division, created CITM, &quot;()&quot; (Italian Command of the Troops in the Mountains). Its objective was to resist German troops with help from the Albanian Partisans. They managed to create some units of Italian soldiers under their command, but these troops were dispersed in the months of October–November 1943, by the German winter offensive. The officers of this command were attached to British missions in Albania and were repatriated to Italy in August 1944.

There were also some 2,150 Italians who expressed their desire to continue the fight dispersed among Albanian partisan units. Some 472 Italian fighters were dispersed among Partisan shock brigades. A group of 137 men who created the Antonio Gramsci Battalion were attached to the First Shock Brigade and the &quot;Matteotti&quot; unit was attached to Third Shock Brigade. Some 401 were engaged in logistics roles and another 1,277 were attached to local commands. During the period 1943–1945 there were other units of Italian fighters among Albanian partisans, such as the 6th Battalion of the Fifth Shock Brigade, composed of some 200 Italians.

===Wehrmacht deserters===
Part of the German force which occupied Albania was composed of Wehrmacht recruits from the Caucasus region. The first Wehrmacht deserters went to Albanian Partisan units at the end of 1943 during the German winter offensive, but their numbers grew in the summer of 1944 during the German summer offensive. There was a great flow of Wehrmacht deserters during the end of conflict to Albania from September to October 1944 as German forces began withdrawing from Albania. In August 1944 a new unit was formed, Third Shock Brigade, from some 40 Wehrmacht deserters (mostly Armenians and Turkmen). Another 70 Armenians created their own unit attached to the First Shock Brigade in September 1944. There were also other small groups of Wehrmacht deserters dispersed among Albanian partisan forces, composed of Germans, Austrians, Frenchmen, Czechs and Poles.

===Allied links and assistance===
The British had tried mounting liaison operations into Italian-occupied Albania in early 1941, from what was then neutral Yugoslavia. These attempts were quickly abandoned after the Germans and Italians overran Yugoslavia. Thereafter, no attempt was made to contact Albanian resistance groups until 17 April 1943, when M.O.4, a branch of the liaison organisation SOE, dispatched a mission commanded by Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Billy&quot; MacLean, with Major David Smiley as his second-in-command. Rather than drop &quot;blind&quot; into Albania, the mission was dropped into North-West Greece, where British parties were already operating with Greek guerrillas. From there, they made their way into Albania on foot or on mules.

After several false starts, the mission made contact with the NLM. The first supply drop of arms and equipment was received on 27 June. The bulk of the stores received in this and subsequent drops were donated to the NLM, who were the dominant group in Southern Albania, and were used to equip the &quot;First Partisan Brigade&quot;.

Later in 1943, SOE increased the size of the mission to Albania. The new commander was Brigadier Edmund Frank Davies of the Royal Ulster Rifles (nicknamed &quot;Trotsky&quot; at Sandhurst because of the &quot;disciplined bolshevism&quot; in his character), with Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Nicholls as Chief of Staff. MacLean and Smiley were withdrawn to SOE&#x27;s new base at Bari in southern Italy to report. Although they noted that the Communist-led NLM appeared to be more interested in securing political power after the war than fighting the Germans, they recommended that SOE continue to supply them, while attempting to achieve agreement between the NLM and the other resistance movements.

In January 1944, the Germans attacked and overran the British mission HQ. Brigadier Davies was captured, while Lieutenant Colonel Nicholls died of exposure and post-operative shock after leading the survivors to safety.

During the remainder of 1944, SOE continued to supply the NLM, despite complaints from MacLean and Smiley, now running liaison parties with Abaz Kupi&#x27;s group and the Balli Kombëtar in northern Albania, that the NLM were using these arms against their political opponents rather than the Germans. Smiley, MacLean and Julian Amery were evacuated to Italy at the end of October. SOE refused to evacuate Abaz Kupi on the same boat. He made his own escape from the country, and picked up by a Royal Naval vessel in the Adriatic.

<text>Hagåtña, formerly Agana or Agaña, is a coastal village and the capital of the United States territory of Guam. From the 18th through mid-20th century, it was Guam&#x27;s population center, but today, it is the second smallest of the island&#x27;s 19 villages in both area and population. However, it remains one of the island&#x27;s major commercial districts in addition to being the seat of government.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hagåt&quot; (also romanized as &quot;haga&quot;&#x27;, with a glottal stop instead of a syllable-final &quot;t&quot;) means &quot;blood&quot; in the Chamorro language. The suffix &quot;-ña&quot; can be translated as either the possessive pronouns &quot;his&quot;, &quot;hers&quot; or &quot;its&quot; in English (cognate to &quot;-nya&quot; in Malay, and &quot;niya&quot; in Tagalog), or a signification of greater comparative degree, similar to some uses of the English suffix &quot;-er&quot;. There is much speculation that the indigenous peoples originally migrated from the village of Agat/Hagåt. Therefore, &quot;Hagåtña&quot; can be translated &quot;his or her blood&quot; possibly meaning &quot;related to him, her or it&quot;, or it could be translated to what might roughly mean &quot;more Hagåt&quot;, as in, an extension of the village of Hagåt. It could also mean &quot;better Hagåt&quot;, or &quot;more than, surpassing or superior to Hagåt&quot; in a sense of being &quot;more Hagåt than Hagåt itself&quot;. In 1998, the Guam Legislature changed the name from &quot;Agana&quot; back to the original Chamorro form. However, the name of the neighboring village Agana Heights remains unchanged.

== Geography ==
Hagåtña is located at the mouth of the Hagåtña River on Guam&#x27;s west coast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1 square mile (2.6 km²). It is (by direction of travel) the westernmost state or territorial capital city of the United States. The village is bounded by the sandy beaches of Agana Bay to the north, the Hagåtña River and associated wetlands to the east, and a cliff (above which is the village of Agana Heights) to the South. Several high-rise office buildings are in the center of the village, while the western portion of the city known as Anigua is more residential. Unlike many villages, central Hagåtña is divided into city blocks with shops and small restaurants throughout the center of the village. Highly populated residential areas in the villages of Mongmong-Toto-Maite, Sinajana, and Agana Heights surround Hagåtña.

=== Climate ===
The city has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) similar to that found in the Amazon Basin. Rainfall is high especially from June to November, reaching in a single month in August 1997, whilst the year 2004 was the wettest in history with .

== History ==


Hagåtña was a prominent village before Guam&#x27;s colonization by the Spanish. In 1668, the first Spanish missionary, Padre San Vitores arrived on the island. The family of Chief Kepuha donated land in Hagåtña enabling San Vitores to build the first church (Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral-Basilica) on Guam.

Under Spanish rule, and particularly the Spanish-Chamorro Wars, much of the indigenous population of Guam and other Mariana Islands was forced to relocate to the city. The remains of buildings from the Spanish administration can be seen in the Plaza de España located beside the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Agana. The remains of the Spanish Governor&#x27;s Palace is here and is closer to the Department of Education than the Cathedral.

After Guam was ceded by Spain to the United States in the Spanish–American War of 1898, Agana remained the seat of government under U.S. Naval Administration. By 1940, the city&#x27;s population had grown to about 10,000 containing nearly half of the island&#x27;s residents. Villages had been established nearby for immigrants from the Caroline Islands.

Guam was captured by Japanese forces on December 8, 1941. The Japanese, renamed Guam Ōmiya-jima (ja.: 大宮島) or &quot;Great Shrine Island&quot;, and Agana Akashi (ja.: 明石) or &quot;Bright Stone&quot;. During Guam&#x27;s 1944 liberation from the Japanese during World War II, the city was heavily damaged by U.S. naval bombardment. Many former residents settled in other parts of Guam after the war. As part of Guam&#x27;s reconstruction plan, the U.S. Navy constructed new straight city streets that passed through existing lots and created many plots of land with multiple owners. This has hindered the development of the city to the present day. In December 1944 Guam was the scene of the Agana race riot, between black and white servicemen stationed on the island.

Today, despite a resident population of about 1,000 (less than 1% of Guam&#x27;s total), the city remains the seat of the territorial government. Its historic sites are major attractions for visitors. Hagåtña is served by Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in Tamuning and Barrigada.

==Culture==
As Guam&#x27;s historic population and administrative center, many traditional celebrations take place in Hagåtña. On December 8, Santa Marian Kamalen, Patroness of the Mariana Islands, is honored with a procession in which a statue of the patroness is pulled on a cart amid the prayers of thousands of the island&#x27;s Catholics. Guam&#x27;s most celebrated patriotic holiday, Liberation Day, is on July 21. The annual Liberation Day Parade takes place on Marine Corps Drive in Hagåtña. In addition to the historic sites at the Plaza de España and the Basilica, Latte Stone Park and the Chamorro Village shopping area offer further information about the island&#x27;s history and culture.

==Demographics==

The U.S. Census Bureau has the municipality a single census-designated place.

<doc id="291345" wikidata="Q4679394" url="?curid=291345" title="Adam Leonard (singer-songwriter)">
<text>Adam Leonard (born 27 March 1969) is an English singer-songwriter working mainly in the folk, psychedelic and electronic music fields. His style is often described as lo-fi and the subject matter of his songs somewhat unconventional. Since his debut album &quot;How Music Sounds&quot; in 2003, he has released many EPs, albums and mini-albums on various small labels. Live performances, which have so far been limited to the UK (Manchester, London and Northern Ireland) are as intriguing as they are rare. In 2008 he opened for British folk musician Steve Ashley. He regularly collaborates with other musicians, most notably Pat Gubler (P.G. Six), Ashley Cooke (Pulco), Gareth Davies, and Steven Collins of The Owl Service, a band for which Leonard provided vocals for their 2010 album &quot;The View From A Hill&quot;. At the close of 2010, a limited edition album entitled &quot;Nature Recordings&quot; was released on vinyl only by the London label The Great Pop Supplement. In 2011, Leonard provided the soundtrack to Claudia Heindel&#x27;s award-winning independent film, &quot;Lucky Seven&quot;. In 2012, Nature Recordings was issued on CD by Manchester-based label The Northwestern Series.

In 2013 Leonard formed Invaderband, a four-piece &quot;Artrock/Garagerock/Krautrock&quot; group and began gigging locally around Northern Ireland, including a slot at Other Voices in 2014. Occasional solo gigs still took place, including opening for Nick Harper.

Leonard was the winner of UK City of Culture 2013 Resonate Award for Best Song (&quot;My Love&quot;).

In 2014, he embarked on the Octopus Project releasing eight albums over an eight-month period. In 2015, Invaderband released two singles (&quot;The Implausible Man&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Pod People&quot;), the latter making the BBC 6 Music playlist in December 2015. Invaderband&#x27;s debut album was released in January 2017. In September 2017, the Invaderband album was shortlisted for the Northern Ireland Music Prize

In 2018, Leonard released a solo 7&quot; single &quot;Entkommen&quot;, on the Polytechnic Youth label, and also collaborated with Irish/French/New York band, Warriors Of The Dystotheque, on the &quot;I Know You&#x27;ll Never Die&quot; EP released by Dublin&#x27;s Reckless Records. The two main tracks were remixed by Le Galaxie and Richard March of Bentley Rhythm Ace.

In January 2021 a new Invaderband album was announced via invaderband.com. The first single from the album &#x27;I Won&#x27;t Remember You&#x27; was released on March 12

Invaderband&#x27;s 2nd album &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; was released September 2021. The sleeve was a painting of Peter Gabriel by Luke Haines. The band played the Other Voices festival in November and the album received national radio play in the UK and Ireland, favourable reviews, and ended up in a number of ‘Best albums of 2021’ lists

Leonard&#x27;s solo electronic album &quot;Rendlesham&quot; was released on cassette by The Dark Outside late 2021, and on vinyl by Polytechnic Youth July 2022. The album was reviewed by The Quietus and Fortean Times

<text>The House of Zogu, or Zogolli during Ottoman times and until 1922, is an Albanian dynastic family whose roots date back to the early 20th century. The family provided the first president and the short-lived modern Albanian Kingdom with its only monarch, Zog I of Albania (1928–1939).

==History==
The dynasty was founded by Zogu Pasha, who migrated to the region of Mat in north-central Albania during the early 13th century.

The Zogu family’s roots are tied to the Mati region of Albania, where they established prominence following the Ottoman conquest over four centuries ago. According to local legend, their rise began with a warrior from the village of Zogaj who intervened during a moment of crisis. An Ottoman official, Gazi Bey, sought to humiliate the families of Mati by demanding their unmarried daughters perform degrading acts. Outraged by this, the warrior from Zogaj rallied the people of Mati, leading a rebellion that ended with the defeat of Gazi Bey. In gratitude, a local chief offered the warrior his daughter’s hand in marriage, laying the foundation for the family’s legacy in Mati. The family name, “Zogolli,” reflects a blend of Albanian and Ottoman influences. It derives from the warrior’s village, Zogaj, with the addition of the Turkish suffix “-oglu,” meaning “son of.” This naming custom was typical under Ottoman rule. Another, less substantiated theory suggests a connection to a German crusader duke (Herzog) who settled in Mati and adopted the name &quot;Zog,&quot; but this narrative is largely dismissed as speculative.

The most famous member of the dynasty is Zog I, who in 1928 proclaimed himself King of the Albanians and ruled until he was deposed by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy following the Italian invasion of 1939. Victor Emmanuel subsequently assumed the Albanian throne.

With the death in exile of King Zog in 1961, he was succeeded as claimant to the throne and head of the House of Zogu by his only son Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1939), who was proclaimed &quot;King of the Albanians&quot; by the Albanian National Assembly in exile. Leka I remained head of the house and claimant to the throne until his death in 2011 when he was succeeded by his only son, Leka II.

Leka II has no sons and is the only living male descendant of King Zog. The current heir presumptive to Prince Leka is Skënder Zogu, his first cousin once removed.

===Situation ===
Prince Leka II, the only living male descendant of King Zog I and the head of the royal house , has no sons. The current heir presumptive to Prince Leka is Skënder Zogu, his first-cousin once removed.

<text>SN Brussels Airlines (SNBA) was the flag carrier of Belgium, which mainly operated from Brussels Airport. SNBA was the trading name of the Belgian airline Delta Air Transport. SNBA was a full-service airline, connecting Brussels with the rest of Europe. It also flew to Africa, continuing Sabena&#x27;s extensive network there. The airline merged with Virgin Express into Brussels Airlines which started operations on 25 March 2007. The airline had its head office in Airport Building 117 in Brussels Airport, Zaventem, near Brussels.

== History ==

The airline was founded in 2002, when a group of Belgian investors (companies, financial institutions and regional investment companies, as well as the Brussels and Walloon governments) set up SN Airholding, headed by Étienne Davignon. After the 2001 collapse of Sabena, Belgium&#x27;s then flag carrier airline, Belgium was left without a national airline for a few months. In February 2002, SN Airholding took over the Belgian airline DAT, a subsidiary of Sabena, and changed its trading name to SN Brussels Airlines.

In 2002, a strategic reorganization started, led by the former CEO Peter Davies.
On 12 April 2005 SN Brussels took holding control of Virgin Express and on 31 March 2006 they announced their merger. On 7 November 2006 they announced at a press conference held at Brussels Airport that the new airline would be called Brussels Airlines.

== Destinations ==
== Fleet ==
Before merging, SN Brussels Airlines operated the following aircraft:
== Codeshare agreements ==
SN Brussels Airlines had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* American Airlines
* Etihad Airways
* Hainan Airlines
* Jet Airways
* Malmö Aviation

== Livery ==
The airline had various color schemes before finally settling on a uniform scheme for the fleet. The upper fuselage is white, while the belly and engines were painted lilac. An orange cheat line runs between the white and lilac parts of the fuselage. The tail shows the old Sabena &quot;S&quot;. The website address is near the end of the fuselage. There are differences in livery between the Avro planes and the Airbus planes: most notably, the company name is written on the white part of the fuselage for the Airbus planes, but on the lilac part on the Avro.

Both this livery and the Virgin Express livery were replaced with the Brussels Airlines livery.

<doc id="291355" wikidata="Q746500" url="?curid=291355" title="Elyakim Rubinstein">
<text>Elyakim Rubinstein (; born June 13, 1947) is a former Vice President of the Supreme Court of Israel. Beforehand, he served as the Attorney General of Israel from 1997 to 2004. Rubinstein, a former Israeli diplomat and long-time civil servant, has had an influential role in that country&#x27;s internal and external affairs, most notably in helping to shape its peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan.

==Early life==
Born in Tel Aviv and raised in Givatayim, he graduated from Zeitlin, a religious high school in Tel Aviv, and earned his bachelor&#x27;s (1969) and master&#x27;s (1974) degrees from Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Career==
Rubinstein launched a career in law, serving as a legal advisor to the ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs during the mid-1970s. His diplomatic career started in 1977, and from then through 1979 he was a member of Israel&#x27;s delegation to the peace talks with Egypt that led to the signing of the Camp David Accords between the two countries. Upon their completion, he became in 1980 an assistant director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in charge of implementing the normalization of relations with Egypt.

During the early 1980s he served in a variety of capacities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1981-1985 served as Legal adviser for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in 1985-1986 served as Deputy Chief of Mission of the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C. In 1986 he was appointed Cabinet Secretary and in this capacity he served in various roles relating to Israel–United States relations.

In 1991 he was again a member of an Israeli peace negotiating team, traveling as part of the Israeli delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference that opened the negotiations (for which he served as chairman of the Israeli delegation) that would eventually lead to the 1993 Oslo Accords, a major breakthrough in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

Following the conclusion of these talks, he chaired the Israeli delegation to peace talks with Jordan, which concluded successfully with the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty.
He then turned towards domestic Israeli jurisprudence, serving as a judge on Jerusalem&#x27;s District Court from 1995 to 1997, and then as Attorney General of Israel, a position he held until January 25, 2004. He has written several books on Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court, especially focusing on the relation of Judaism to Israeli political and legal life. In this role he has gained a reputation for being somewhat of a liberal reformer, going up against the established might of Orthodox Judaism in favor of religious pluralism to represent all factions of Judaism. His most important success in this endeavor has been to gain Reform and Conservative Judaism seats on Jerusalem&#x27;s religious council, previously controlled entirely by the Orthodox. He has proposed opening a section of the Western Wall for non-Orthodox religious services, but this has not yet been successful.

Rubinstein has been criticized for being too hesitant or indecisive in cases involving powerful Israeli officials. In particular, he was criticized for having moved too slowly on corruption charges involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his son Gilad. In the weeks following Rubinstein&#x27;s end of term as Attorney General The State Attorney, Edna Arbel, was quick to recommend that Sharon be indicted on bribery charges, however Rubinstein&#x27;s replacement Menachem Mazuz subsequently exonerated Sharon and his sons and did not press charges of corruption due to insufficient evidence.

In May 2004, Rubinstein was appointed to Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court. In January 2015 he was appointed Vice President of the Court, a position he held until his statutory retirement at the age of 70, in 2017.

== Controversies ==
=== As Attorney General ===
Rubinstein gained a reputation for being somewhat of a liberal reformer, going up against the established might of Orthodox Judaism in favor of religious pluralism to represent all factions of Judaism. His most important success in this endeavor came when Reform and Conservative Judaism gained seats on Jerusalem&#x27;s religious council, previously controlled entirely by the Orthodox. He has proposed opening a section of the Western Wall for non-Orthodox religious services, but this has not yet been implemented.

In 1999, Rubinstein decided not to investigate former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the founder and spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, for calling Supreme Court justices &quot;evildoers&quot;, &quot;empty-headed and reckless&quot; and various other harsh epithets. A year later, however, he did order an investigation after Rabbi Yosef compared the secular education minister, Yossi Sarid, to the Pharaoh of the Book of Exodus and said he should be &quot;extirpated from the Earth&quot; like Haman in the Book of Esther.

In January 2000, Rubinstein asked President Ezer Weizman to hand over financial documents after it was disclosed in the press that he failed to report $450,000 he received as a &quot;gift&quot; from a friend to the Knesset and tax authorities. Weizman ultimately resigned six months later.

Despite this, Rubinstein was often criticized for being too hesitant or indecisive in cases involving powerful Israeli officials, in particular for moving too slowly on those corruption charges involving Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his son Gilad. In the weeks following the end of his term as Attorney General, the State Attorney, Edna Arbel, was quick to recommend that Sharon be indicted on bribery charges. Rubinstein&#x27;s initial hesitancy, however, was subsequently vindicated by his replacement, Menachem Mazuz, who decided not to press charges of corruption against Sharon and his son due to insufficient evidence.

In the midst of the Sharon investigation Rubinstein suspended a state prosecutor for leaking to a &quot;Haaretz&quot; reporter a document that outlined corruption allegations against Sharon and his son while the matter was &quot;sub judice&quot;.

During the 2003 legislative election campaign, Attorney General Rubinstein supported the Central Election Committee&#x27;s decision to ban the anti-Zionist Balad party and its leader, Azmi Bishara, as well as Baruch Marzel of the right-wing Yamin Yisrael party from running, but he objected to its decision to disqualify Ahmad Tibi on account of his public support for Yasser Arafat, which it viewed as tacit support for terrorism. The Committee based its opinion on Article 7 of the Basic Law on the Knesset, which states that candidates for Knesset cannot oppose the Jewish and democratic character of the state, preach racism or support armed attacks by an enemy state or terrorist organization. Rubinstein even submitted to the Court information gathered by the Shin Bet to support the ban on Bishara (who subsequently fled the country before he was charged with treason and espionage for advising Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and stealing millions of shekels from Arab aid organizations). Balad, Bishara, and Marzel, however, were ultimately allowed to participate in the elections when the decisions against them were overturned by the Supreme Court.

=== On the Supreme Court ===
In 2012, Rubinstein, who is regarded by many as a &quot;relative conservative&quot; on the Court, openly supported the right of his Arab-Christian colleague, Justice Salim Joubran, not to sing the national anthem, Hatikvah, at an official ceremony:

In his capacity as chairman of the 2013 Knesset election committee, Rubinstein forced the removal of several television ads, one from Shas, which he viewed as insulting to Russian-speaking immigrants, and the others from Otzma LeYisrael, which he viewed as racist against Arabs.

Vered Peri&quot; of April 30, 2009: Rubinstein joined four colleagues in a landmark decision that upheld a Tel Aviv District Court decision allowing working parents to deduct childcare expenses from their taxes. In his concurring opinion, he quoted a commentary by Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher rebbe, on the obligation of charity in &quot;Halakha,&quot; or Jewish religious law, to apply a parallel obligation in Israeli civil law, and concluded:

* HCJ 746/07 &quot;Ragen v. Ministry of Transport&quot; of January 5, 2011: Speaking for the High Court of Justice, Rubinstein ruled that public buses could not bow to pressure from Haredim (ultra-Orthodox) Jews and segregate passengers by gender without their consent, citing the American civil rights movement as his precedent:

* HCJ 6298/07 &quot;Ressler v Knesset&quot; of February 21, 2012: Rubinstein sided with the High Court&#x27;s majority declaring the so-called Tal Law unconstitutional. The law provided special exemption from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to ultra-Orthodox Jews and extended mandatory military service to Israeli-Arabs. Rubinstein, who is religious, included numerous texts from traditional Jewish texts in his written ruling. This prompted former Chief Rabbi Yosef to label the High Court &quot;a court of gentiles,&quot; call Rubinstein and his colleagues &quot;wicked&quot; and declare that they should not be allowed to lead synagogue prayers.

While sitting on the High Court, Rubinstein ruled in favor of evicting residents of two of the 46 unrecognized Bedouin villages inside Israel that were established illegally, without official administrative or planning approval.

* HCJ 3094/11 &quot;Ibrahim Farhood Abu al-Qi’an et al v. the State of Israel&quot; of May 5, 2015: In ruling on the case of Umm al-Hiran, Rubinstein wrote:

* CA 3094/11 &quot;Al-Qi&#x27;an v. the State of Israel&quot; of May 5, 2015: In a case involving Al-Araqeeb, the court stated that the 2007 United Nations General Assembly’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and a pro-indigenous peoples’ rights 1992 Australia court ruling were not binding and did not reflect codified customary international law. In his decision, Rubinstein, together with Justice Neal Hendel, approved the removal of the village, stating:

* AAA 5875/10 &quot;The Conservative Movement and the Movement for Progressive Judaism in Israel v. Be&#x27;er Sheva Religious Council and the Ministry of Religious Services&quot; of February 11, 2016: In this landmark decision, Rubinstein ruled that all of Israel’s public ritual baths (&quot;mikva&#x27;ot&quot;) must allow access to groups wishing to perform non-Orthodox conversions. A month later, he joined with the majority in another landmark ruling that held that immigrants who converted to Judaism through independent conversion courts outside the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel must be recognized as Jews under the country&#x27;s Law of Return.
* HCJ 4374/15 &quot;The Movement for Quality Government v. The Prime Minister of Israel&quot; of March 27, 2016: Rubinstein wrote the High Court&#x27;s decision invalidating Israel&#x27;s natural gas plan, siding with the appellants, which included the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, and the Israel Labor Party and Meretz. The ruling was criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said in response that &quot;the court&#x27;s decision seriously threatens the development of gas reserves of the State of Israel. Israel is seen as a state in which excessive judicial intervention makes it difficult to do business with.&quot; Rubinstein wrote:


* HCJ 5304/15 &quot;Israel Medical Association v. Israel Knesset&quot; of September 11, 2016: Rubinstein, joined by other justices on the High Court, denied petitions on behalf of Palestinian hunger strikers imprisoned on terrorism-related charges, challenging an amendment to the law that permits their force-feeding by physicians. Declaring the amendment constitutional, Rubinstein, writing for the Court, declared that a hunger striker &quot;is not an ordinary patient but a person who knowingly and willingly places himself in a dangerous situation as a protest or a means of attaining a personal or public goal.&quot; He also noted that laws in France, the United States, Australia, Germany, and Austria enable forced artificial feeding under exceptional cases that vary from country to country. Moreover, he argued, relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights do not completely prohibit forced feeding. Although security considerations by themselves do not justify the use of forced treatment, Rubinstein stated, such considerations may be weighed when a treating physician has already determined that the prisoner’s medical status is grave and that there is a real danger to his or her life or that lack of treatment will expose the prisoner to an irreversible serious handicap.

Certain Israeli human rights organizations and the appellant, the Israel Medical Association (IMA), opposed the Court&#x27;s decision. The IMA announced that it would instruct its members to ignore it. &quot;This is a case in which medical ethics unequivocally trump the law, and the message we wish to convey to physicians is that forced feeding is tantamount to torture and that no doctor should take part in it,&quot; stated the association&#x27;s president.

==Personal life==
Rubinstein&#x27;s wife, Miriam, is also an advocate, a former director of the Civil Division at the Office of the State Attorney and, like her husband, a former Jerusalem District Court judge. They had four daughters, one of whom, Sari, died from cancer on October 25, 2016 at the age of 39. A mother of two small daughters herself, Sari, like her parents, studied law and became a licensed advocate upon passing the bar examination, after which she was accepted as a cadet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Elyakim and Miram Rubinstein have 11 grandchildren.

<text>&quot;&quot; (Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl: ), officially translated as &quot;Patriotic Song&quot;, is the national anthem of North Korea. It was composed in 1945 as a patriotic song celebrating independence from Japanese occupation and was adopted as the state anthem in 1947. Performance of this anthem is prohibited in South Korea under the National Security Act.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aegukka&quot; is a Romanized transliteration of &quot;The Patriotic Song&quot;; the song is also known by its incipit &quot;Ach&#x27;imŭn pinnara&quot; or &quot;Let Morning Shine&quot; or in its Korean name or alternatively as the &quot;Song of a Devotion to a Country&quot;.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; defines the word &quot;Aegukka&quot; as &quot;the song to wake up the mind to love the country&quot;. &quot;Aegukka&quot; in itself is differentiated from a national anthem. While a national anthem or &quot;gukka&quot; () is an official symbol of the state, &quot;aegukka&quot; refers to any song, official or unofficial, that contains patriotic fervor towards its country, such as Hungary&#x27;s &quot;Szózat&quot; or the U.S. &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. However, the nationally designated &quot;Aegukka&quot; plays the role of symbolizing the country. In general shorthand, the term &quot;aegukka&quot; refers to the national anthem of North Korea.

== History ==
Originally, the Korean exile government (1919–1945) in Shanghai, China adopted as their national anthem &quot;Aegukga&quot; (which has the same name with a different Romanization) to the tune of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. After World War II, South Korea kept the words, put to a new tune (changed from &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;), while North Korea adopted this newly written piece in 1947. The words were written by Pak Se-yong and the music was composed by Kim Won-gyun.

In the early 1980s, Kim Jong Il sought to reduce the song&#x27;s importance to the benefit of &quot;Song of General Kim Il Sung&quot;.

The complete version of &quot;Aegukka&quot; consists two verses. On official occasions, when only the first verse is performed, it is customary to repeat the last four bars. However, if both verses are performed, it is the last four bars of the second verse that are repeated instead. &quot;Song of General Kim Il Sung&quot; and &quot;Song of General Kim Jong Il&quot; have since taken the place of &quot;de facto&quot; national anthems domestically, and &quot;Aegukka&quot; is reserved for representing North Korea internationally: when foreign dignitaries visit the country or North Korean athletes compete at international sporting competitions. &quot;Aegukka&quot; is almost unique among most North Korean patriotic songs, as it praises neither the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea nor the Kim family, but rather the whole of Korea itself. &quot;Aegukka&quot; is played at the start of each of Korean Central Television&#x27;s broadcast days.

In February 2024, in line with Kim Jong Un&#x27;s announcement of officially abandoning efforts to peacefully reunifying Korea, the lyrics were partially modified, with the phrase &quot;three thousand ri&quot; () referring to the Korean Peninsula being replaced by &quot;this world&quot; ().

On 17 April 2024, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of 10,000 new homes in Hwasong District, Pyongyang, in which the national anthem was performed. This was broadcast on Korea Central Television, and was rebroadcast on the next day, 18 April. However, during the rebroadcast, the title was changed from &quot;Aegukka&quot; () to &quot;National Anthem of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot; (). It has been speculated that this was done to further strengthen the division between the north and south after North Korea abandoned the idea of peaceful reunification, by giving the national anthem a different title to that of South Korea. However, the Constitution of North Korea, in Article 171, still mentions that the national anthem is &quot;Aegukka&quot;, and there have been no reports regarding revision of this article. On 25 October 2024, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly adopted the &quot;Law of the DPRK on the National Anthem&quot;, without reporting what the new law mandates.

<doc id="291359" wikidata="Q2616676" url="?curid=291359" title="Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?">
<text>Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? is an American live action/animated television series based on the series of computer games. The show was produced by DIC Productions L.P. and originally aired from February 5, 1994 to January 2, 1999, on Saturday mornings during FOX&#x27;s Fox Kids Network block. Reruns aired on the Qubo television network from June 9, 2012 (alongside &quot;Animal Atlas&quot;) to May 26, 2018.

The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Animated Program in 1995, and in the same year was spun-off into a &quot;Where in the World&quot;-styled video game entitled &quot;Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective&quot;. Its theme song uses the melody from the chorus &quot;Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder&quot; (&quot;Sing Songs of the Great Pasha&quot;) from Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;).

==History==
===Production and broadcast (1994–1999)===
The script for every &quot;Earth&quot; episode had to meet the approval of Broderbund, which created and, at the time, owned the &quot;Carmen&quot; franchise. Their cause for concern was the level of the violence on other FOX children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. Broderbund did not require this of the creators of the &quot;World&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; game shows that aired on PBS, presumably since PBS, as the distributor of such shows as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, had a long-standing reputation for non-violent educational children&#x27;s programming. The lead characters of &quot;Earth&quot; were featured in &quot;Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective&quot;, released in 1995. The opening theme song for the show is &quot;Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder&quot; from &quot;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, with new lyrics, pop instrumentation, and a backbeat. The Rainbow Animation Group (later renamed Galaxy World, Inc., not to be confused with the Italian studio Rainbow S.p.A.), and Han Yang Productions contributed some animation for this series.

===Home media releases===
Fox Video originally released the series on VHS through their Fox Kids Video label, which contained two episodes each.

In November 2001, Lions Gate Home Entertainment and Trimark Home Video released two VHS tapes, &quot;Carmen&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Time Traveler&quot;, consisting of the show&#x27;s three-part episodes (&quot;Retribution&quot; and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;) in a feature-length format. &quot;Time Traveller&quot; was also released on DVD, and alongside the &quot;Labyrinth&quot; episode, also came with a demo of &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? Treasures of Knowledge&quot;. A video of the episode &quot;Timing is Everything&quot; was included with some versions of the mentioned game.

In September 2003, Sterling Entertainment released &quot;Into the Maelstrom&quot; and &quot;No Place like Home&quot; on VHS and DVD. &quot;Into the Maelstrom&quot; contained the three part &quot;Retribution&quot; episode, while &quot;No Place like Home&quot; contained the episode &quot;The Remnants&quot; and the two-part episode &quot;Can You Ever Go Home Again?&quot; The DVD versions contained &quot;When it Rains...&quot; and &quot;Follow My Footprints&quot; as bonus episodes, respectively. NCircle Entertainment reissued both DVDs in 2007.

In June 2006, Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment released the first season on DVD. Due to poor sales, no further seasons were released.

Mill Creek Entertainment released &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on February 21, 2012. This four-disc set contains all forty episodes of the series. They also released a ten-episode best-of collection the same day. These releases have been discontinued and are now out of print. Mill Creek re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 in June 2017.

PIDAX, a German company, released the complete series on DVD for Region 2 in 3 Volumes in 2019 in English and German.

The whole series is available to stream on Paramount+ in some territories.

==Plot==
Following the plot of the &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; franchise, &quot;Earth&quot; sees international thief Carmen Sandiego (voiced by Rita Moreno) lead the organization V.I.L.E. in stealing treasures from around the world and leaving clues behind for ACME agents Zack (voiced by Scott Menville) and Ivy (voiced by Jennifer Hale), under the guidance of the Chief (voiced by Rodger Bumpass), to find, in order to capture her. In this version, Carmen Sandiego was a former agent of ACME who left to seek a greater challenge, and has a strong code of ethics when stealing items and why she went rogue. The Player is an unseen live-action character who bookends acts by communicating with Carmen; it is implied that the television series is a video game that they are playing from a computer. Mostly the recurring bit in the series, where Zack and Ivy finds Carmen and she gets away and Zack and Ivy retrieves the stolen items that Carmen stole and mostly her henchmen are usually captured. The player and Carmen have a couple words at the end of the episode and will play again soon and someday Zack and Ivy will capture her.

While Carmen is originally presented as the show&#x27;s titular antagonist, she becomes more of an anti-hero as the series progresses; she even helps Zack and Ivy fight against mutual enemies.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Carmen Sandiego (voiced by Rita Moreno) – An international thief and the head of V.I.L.E. Despite the name of her organization, she has a strong code of morals and only steals for the challenge of it. She was a former agent of the ACME Detective Agency.
* Chief (voiced by Rodger Bumpass) – The head of ACME. Short for Computerized Holographic Imaging Educational Facilitator, his role consisted of providing exposition, information, alerts of Carmen&#x27;s recent crime, and comic relief. He had a very intimate professional and personal relationship with Carmen. He once also had a robotic body while working with Carmen back when she was still part of the ACME Detective Agency.
* Ivy (voiced by Jennifer Hale) – An 18-year-old woman who has short red hair and green eyes. She and Carmen seem to have a past history, although it is only hinted at in the series.

She can get frustrated easily, such as hating it when Zack calls her &quot;sis&quot; or when Carmen is getting away.
* Zack (voiced by Scott Menville) – Ivy&#x27;s 14-year-old brother, who has blond hair and blue eyes. He speaks multiple languages and knows cultures from all over the world and he is also highly intelligent. He takes cases less seriously than his sister Ivy.

* A substantial number of unnamed henchmen who work for Carmen Sandiego and other V.I.L.E. agents. They wear head-to-toe blue outfits with goggles and boots and appear in most episodes.

===Other villains===
As Carmen Sandiego became less villainous and evolved into more of an antihero, other characters began to fill her original role as the show&#x27;s antagonist. The following villains are:

* Dr. Sara Bellum – Carmen Sandiego&#x27;s former robotics and computer expert who appears in &quot;Split Up&quot; and &quot;Chapter and Verse&quot;. She betrays V.I.L.E., impersonating Carmen in an attempt to become known as the world&#x27;s greatest thief in &quot;When It Rains&quot;, but later appears to be a V.I.L.E. member again in &quot;Follow My Footprints&quot; where she competes to become Carmen&#x27;s successor following her apparent death. Her name is a play on &quot;cerebellum.&quot;
** Ira Gation (voiced by Michael Earl) – Sara&#x27;s sole henchperson during her time away from V.I.L.E. who appears in &quot;When It Rains&quot;. His name is a play on &quot;irrigation.&quot;
* Dr. Gunnar Maelstrom (voiced by Tim Curry) – A hostile and extremely violent criminal who considers Carmen Sandiego his archenemy and appears in the three part &quot;Retribution&quot; episodes. As an ACME detective, Carmen pursued him and eventually put him in prison following his attempt to steal the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Years later, following his escape from prison and apparent death, Carmen had come to consider him a rolemodel, but his escape was in fact part of a plot for revenge on her. His last name is a reference to maelstroms, a term for powerful oceanic whirlpools.
** Bilge – Maelstrom&#x27;s lead henchman who appears in &quot;Retribution&quot; Pts. 1–3.
* Mason Dixon – A V.I.L.E. agent and avowed Southerner who resents Carmen&#x27;s success and appears in &quot;Timing Is Everything&quot;. In 1989, the two were partners in an art theft in Amsterdam, but Mason was arrested and Carmen escaped when he turned the wrong way down a street and was captured by police. He uses her time machine to change the outcome of that incident, allowing him to take over V.I.L.E. and leaving Carmen exceedingly meek, and to attempt to overturn the outcome of the Civil War. His name is a reference to the Mason–Dixon line.
* Lee Jordan (voiced by David Coburn) – The first ACME agent to have captured Carmen Sandiego, he was among ACME&#x27;s most accomplished employees, making him arrogant and womanizing. Embittered by his fame and the lack of challenge in fighting crime, he left ACME and helped Carmen Sandiego escape in order to train to be a V.I.L.E. agent. However, his impulsive and violent nature clashed greatly with Carmen&#x27;s more refined, pacifistic approach, leading her to fire him. One plot had him getting close to Ivy in &quot;Boyhood&#x27;s End&quot; Pts. 1 &amp; 2 so that he can have his revenge on Carmen Sandiego. In &quot;Can You Ever Go Home Again?&quot; Pt. 1 and 2, Lee sought his latest revenge on her, eventually kidnapping Malcolm Avalon, a businessman she believed to be her birth father, in order to blackmail her into stealing for him.
** Cruiser – Lee Jordan&#x27;s lead henchman (&quot;Can You Ever Go Home Again?&quot; Pts. 1&amp;2).

<doc id="291360" wikidata="Q1188530" url="?curid=291360" title="US Airways Express">
<text>US Airways Express was the brand name for the regional affiliate of US Airways, under which a number of individually owned commuter air carriers and regional airlines operate short and medium haul routes. This code sharing service was previously operated as USAir Express. Mainline carriers often outsource to regional airlines to operate services in order to increase frequency, serve routes that would not sustain larger aircraft, or for other competitive reasons. US Airways Express operations were conducted from smaller markets in the United States, Canada, and the Bahamas primarily centered on US Airways&#x27; major hubs and focus cities. 

Upon the completion of US Airways&#x27; merger process with American Airlines, US Airways Express was rebranded as American Eagle on October 17, 2015.

==History==

US Airways Express traced its beginnings to 1967, when Henson Airlines began operating as Allegheny Commuter, a feeder carrier for Allegheny Airlines, predecessor to US Airways. The initial route was Baltimore-Hagerstown. This is generally credited as the industry&#x27;s first codeshare agreement and the first major airline to use another airline as its commuter partner. 

Throughout the 1970s, many other commuter airlines would join the Allegheny Commuter system providing feeder service from small communities for Allegheny Airlines. Allegheny Airlines was changed to USAir in 1979 however the feeder network still carried the name of Allegheny Commuter until 1989 when it was changed to USAir Express. In 1997 USAir changed its name again to US Airways at which time the feeder network became US Airways Express. 

Two major carriers that merged into USAir in the late 1980s, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989) had their corporate names retained to protect their trademarks. Henson Airlines later took on the name Piedmont Airlines and another USAir Express carrier, Jetstream International took on the name of PSA Airlines. The aircraft and other characteristics of the rebranded regional carriers bear no relation to their namesakes however many of the routes of Piedmont Airlines are former routes of the original Piedmont Airlines.

The aircraft livery of US Airways Express aircraft was identical to US Airways&#x27; mainline colors except for the word Express, which is attached to the basic US Airways livery. 

In April 2013, an internal memo distributed to American Eagle employees at American Airlines Group&#x27;s subsidiaries: (OW) Executive Airlines and American Eagle; indicated the US Airways Express banner and marketing brand, were expected to be discontinued although the remaining and independently operating airline subsidiaries, were expected to continue but operated with American Eagle branded colors.

==Accidents and incidents==
* January 3, 1992, CommutAir Flight 4281, a Beechcraft 1900C operating for USAir Express, was flying from Plattsburgh to Saranac Lake when it crashed into wooded mountaintop as it was landing at Adirondack Regional Airport. Of the 4 people on board (2 passengers and 2 crew) 2 died while the other 2 sustained serious injuries. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error in establishing a stabilized approach and cross-checking instruments.
* January 8, 2003, Air Midwest Flight 5481, a Beechcraft 1900D operated by Air Midwest as US Airways Express under a franchise agreement, crashed into an airport hangar and burst into flames 37 seconds after leaving Charlotte/Douglas International Airport located in Charlotte, North Carolina for Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in Greer, South Carolina. All 19 passengers and 2 pilots aboard died in the crash. The NTSB concluded that the standard estimates used when calculating the aircraft’s weight were inaccurate. These estimates were subsequently changed. Additionally, improper maintenance that was performed on the aircraft resulted in the crew’s inability to recover from the stall, caused by a dangerous center of gravity resulting from improper weight estimates. 
* August 26, 2003, Colgan Air Flight 9446 a positioning flight involving a Beechcraft 1900D, crashed just before take-off at Barnstable Municipal Airport in Massachusetts killing both crew members on board. The NTSB stated that the probable cause of the accident was to do with the pilot not noticing maintenance errors with the aircraft.
* November 16, 2008, Flight 4551, a US Airways Express Dash 8 turboprop operated by Piedmont Airlines, took off from Lehigh Valley International Airport at 8:20am heading to Philadelphia International Airport, had to make an emergency landing. The flight crew was indicated that the front nose gear hadn&#x27;t come down and had to make a flyover the runway for confirmation. Of 35 passengers and 3 crew, there were no injuries. The aircraft (N326EN) incurred only minor damage and was returned to service shortly thereafter.
* January 1, 2011, US Airways Express Flight 4352, operated by Piedmont Airlines forced an evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and fighter jets were scrambled from Andrews Air Force Base after Flight 4352, operated by a de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 suffered radio problems on approach to Washington, DC&#x27;s Washington–National and strayed into restricted airspace. The Capitol was evacuated for approximately 20 minutes until the Dash 8 aircraft landed at Reagan National Airport.
* May 18, 2013, Flight 4560 operated by Piedmont Airlines made a belly landing at Newark Liberty International Airport after landing gear would not extend. All passengers and crew members were evacuated safely.

<doc id="291367" wikidata="Q582680" url="?curid=291367" title="Albania in the Middle Ages">
<text>When the Roman Empire divided into east and west in 395, the territories of modern Albania became a part of the Byzantine Empire. At the end of the 12th century, the Principality of Arbanon was formed which lasted until mid 13th century, after its dissolution it was followed with the creation of the Albanian Kingdom after an alliance between the Albanian noblemen and Angevin dynasty. After a war against the Byzantine empire led the kingdom occasionally decrease in size until the Angevins eventually lost their rule in Albania and led the territory ruled by several different Albanian chieftains until the mid 14th century which for a short period of time were conquered by the short-lived empire of Serbia. After its fall in 1355 several chieftains regained their rule and significantly expanded until the arrival of the Ottomans after the Battle of Savra.

After the Battle of Savra in 1385 most of local chieftains became Ottoman vassals. In 1415–1417 most of the central and southern Albania was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and its newly established Sanjak of Albania. In 1432-36 local Albanian chieftains dissatisfied with losing their pre-Ottoman privileges organized a revolt in southern Albania. The revolt was suppressed until another revolt was organized by Skanderbeg in 1443, after the Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Niš, during the Crusade of Varna. In 1444, Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg was proclaimed as the leader of the regional Albanian chieftains and nobles united against the Ottoman Empire in the League of Lezhë disestablished in 1479. Skanderbeg&#x27;s rebellion against the Ottoman Empire lasted for 25 years. Despite his military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in the North Albania where almost all his victories against the Ottomans took place. By 1479 the Ottomans captured all Venetian possessions, except Durazzo which they captured in 1501. Until 1913 the territory of Albania would remain part of the Ottoman Empire.

== Komani-Kruja culture ==
The Komani-Kruja culture is an archaeological culture attested from late antiquity to the Middle Ages in central and northern Albania, southern Montenegro and similar sites in the western parts of North Macedonia. It consists of settlements usually built below hillforts along the Lezhë (Praevalitana)-Dardania and Via Egnatia road networks which connected the Adriatic coastline with the central Balkan Roman provinces. Its type site is Komani and its fort on the nearby Dalmace hill in the Drin river valley. Kruja and Lezha represent significant sites of the culture. The population of Komani-Kruja represents a local, western Balkan people which was linked to the Roman Justinianic military system of forts. The development of Komani-Kruja is significant for the study of the transition between the classical antiquity population of Albania to the medieval Albanians who were attested in historical records in the 11th century.

Research greatly expanded after 2009 and the first survey of Komani&#x27;s topography was produced in 2014. Until then, except for the area of the cemetery the size of the settlement and its extension remained unknown. In 2014, it was revealed that Komani occupied an area of more than 40 ha, a much larger territory than originally thought. Its oldest settlement phase dates to the Hellenistic era. Proper development began in the late antiquity and continued well into the Middle Ages (13th-14th centuries). It indicates that Komani was a late Roman fort and an important trading node in the networks of Praevalitana and Dardania. Participation in trade networks of the eastern Mediterranean via sea routes seems to have been very limited even in nearby coastal territory in this era. In the Avar-Slavic raids, communities from present-day northern Albania and nearby areas clustered around hill sites for better protection as is the case of other areas like Lezha and Sarda. During the 7th century as Byzantine authority was reestablished after the Avar-Slavic raids and the prosperity of the settlements increased, Komani saw increase in population and a new elite began to take shape. Increase in population and wealth was marked by the establishment of new settlements and new churches in their vicinity. Komani formed a local network with Lezha and Kruja and in turn this network was integrated in the wider Byzantine Mediterranean world, maintained contacts with the northern Balkans and engaged in long-distance trade.

==History==
=== Byzantine Empire ===
After the region fell to the Romans in 168 BC it became part of Epirus Nova that was in turn part of the Roman province of Macedonia. Later it was part of provinces of the Byzantine empire called &quot;themes&quot;.

When the Roman Empire was divided into East and West in 395, the territories of modern Albania became part of the Byzantine Empire. Beginning in the first decades of Byzantine rule (until 461), the region suffered devastating raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths. In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region experienced an influx of Slavs.

The Albanians appear in medieval Byzantine chronicles in the 11th century, as &quot;Albanoi&quot; and &quot;Arbanitai&quot;, and in medieval Latin sources as &quot;Albanenses&quot; and &quot;Arbanenses&quot;, gradually entering in other European languages, in which other similar derivative names emerged. At this point, they are already fully Christianized. In later Byzantine usage, the terms &quot;Arbanitai&quot; and &quot;Albanoi&quot;, with a range of variants, were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising name Illyrians.

The Albanians, during the Middle Ages, referred to their country as &quot;Arbëria&quot; () and called themselves &quot;Arbëreshë&quot; ().

=== Barbarian Invasions ===

In the first decades under Byzantine rule (until 461), Epirus nova suffered the devastation of raids by Visigoths, Huns, and Ostrogoths. Not long after these barbarian invaders swept through the Balkans, the Slavs appeared. Between the 6th and 8th centuries they settled in Roman territories. In the 4th century, barbarian tribes began to prey upon the Roman Empire. The Germanic Goths and Asiatic Huns were the first to arrive, invading in mid-century; the Avars attacked in AD. 570; and Slavs invaded in the 6th and 7th century. About fifty years later, the Bulgars conquered much of the Balkan Peninsula and extended their domain to the lowlands of what is now central Albania. In general, the invaders destroyed or weakened Roman and Byzantine cultural centers in the lands that would become Albania.

=== Bulgarian Empire ===
In the mid-9th century most of eastern Albania became part of the First Bulgarian Empire, during the reign of Khan Presian. The area, known as Kutmichevitsa, became an important Bulgarian cultural center in the 10th century with many thriving towns such as Devol, Glavinitsa (Ballsh) and Belgrad (Berat). Coastal towns such as Durrës remained in the hands of the Byzantines for most of that period. When the Byzantines managed to conquer the Bulgarian Empire in 1018–19, the fortresses in eastern Albania were some of the last Bulgarian strongholds to be submitted by the Byzantines. Durrës was one a centre of a major Bulgarian uprising in 1040–41 following the discontent of the Bulgarian population by the heavy taxes levied by the Byzantines. Soon the rebellion encompassed the whole of Albania, but it was quelled in 1041, after which Albania again came under Byzantine rule. In 1072 another uprising broke out under Georgi Voiteh but it was also crushed.

Later the region was recovered by the Second Bulgarian Empire. The last Bulgarian Emperor to govern the whole territory was Ivan Asen II (1218–1241) but after his successors the Bulgarian rule diminished.

=== Serbian Empire ===
The Serbs controlled parts of what is now northern and eastern Albania toward the end of the 12th century. In 1204, after Western crusaders sacked Constantinople, Venice won nominal control over Albania and the Epirus region of northern Greece and took possession of Durrës. A prince from the overthrown Byzantine ruling family, Michael Comnenus, made alliances with Albanian chiefs and drove the Venetians from lands that now make up southern Albania and northern Greece, and in 1204 he set up an independent principality, the Despotate of Epirus, with Ioannina in northwest Greece) as its capital. In 1272 the king of Naples, Charles I of Anjou, occupied Durrës and formed an Albanian kingdom that would last for a century. Internal power struggles further weakened the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century, enabling Serbian most powerful medieval ruler, Stefan Dusan, to establish a short-lived empire that included all of Albania except Durrës.

== Principality of Arbanon ==


Arbanon was an autonomous principality that existed between the late 12th century and the 1250s. Throughout its existence, the principality was an autonomous dependency of its neighbouring powers, first Byzantium and, after the Fourth Crusade, Epirus, while it also maintained close relations with Serbia. Arbanon extended over the modern districts of central Albania, with the capital at Kruja, and it did not have direct access to the sea. Progon was the first ruler, believed to have ruled in ca. 1190. He was succeeded by his sons Gjin (r. c. 1200–08) and Dimitri (r. 1208–16). After this dynasty, the principality came under Greek lord Gregory Kamonas and then his son-in-law Golem. Dimitri&#x27;s widow, Serbian princess Komnena Nemanjić, had inherited the rule and remarried Kamonas. Arbanon declined after a rebellion against Nicaea in favour of Epirus in 1257–58.

== Kingdom of Albania ==
After the fall of the Principality of Arber in its territories and in territories captured by the Despotate of Epiros was created the Kingdom of Albania, which was established by Charles of Anjou. He took the title of King of Albania in February, 1272. The kingdom extended from Durazzo (modern Durrës) south along the coast to Cape Linguetta, with vaguely defined borders in the interior. A Byzantine counter-offensive soon ensued, which drove the Angevins out of the interior by 1281. The Sicilian Vespers further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the Epirotes to a small area around Durrës. The Angevins held out here, however, until 1368, when the city was captured by Karl Thopia.

After the fall of the Principality of Arber in territories captured by the Despotate of Epirus, the Kingdom of Albania was established by Charles of Anjou. He took the title of King of Albania in February 1272. The kingdom extended from the region of Durrës (then known as Dyrrhachium) south along the coast to Butrint. After the failure of the Eighth Crusade, Charles of Anjou returned his attention to Albania. He began contacting local Albanian leaders through local catholic clergy. Two local Catholic priests, namely John from Durrës and Nicola from Arbanon, acted as negotiators between Charles of Anjou and the local noblemen. During 1271 they made several trips between Albania and Italy eventually succeeding in their mission.

On 21 February 1272, a delegation of Albanian noblemen and citizens from Durrës made their way to Charles&#x27; court. Charles signed a treaty with them and was proclaimed King of Albania &quot;by common consent of the bishops, counts, barons, soldiers and citizens&quot; promising to protect them and to honor the privileges they had from Byzantine Empire. The treaty declared the union between the Kingdom of Albania (Latin: &quot;Regnum Albanie&quot;) with the Kingdom of Sicily under King Charles of Anjou (&quot;Carolus I, dei gratia rex Siciliae et Albaniae&quot;). He appointed Gazzo Chinardo as his Vicar-General and hoped to take up his expedition against Constantinople again. Throughout 1272 and 1273 he sent huge provisions to the towns of Durrës and Vlorë. This alarmed the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII Palaiologos, who began sending letters to local Albanian nobles, trying to convince them to stop their support for Charles of Anjou and to switch sides. However, the Albanian nobles placed their trust on Charles, who praised them for their loyalty. But Charles of Anjou imposed a military rule on Kingdom of Albania.

Throughout its existence the Kingdom saw armed conflict with the Byzantine empire. By 1282 the Angevins were weakened by the Sicilian Vespers but held control of the nominal parts of Albania and even recaptured some and held out until 1368 when the kingdom&#x27;s territory was reduced to a small area in Durrës. Even before the city of Durrës was captured, it was landlocked by Karl Thopia&#x27;s principality. Declaring himself as Angevin descendant, with the capture of Durrës in 1368 Karl Thopia created the Princedom of Albania. During its existence Catholicism saw rapid spread among the population which affected the society as well as the architecture of the Kingdom.A Western type of feudalism was introduced and it replaced the Byzantine Pronoia.

== Albanian principalities ==
The 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century was the period in which sovereign principalities were created in Albania under Albanian noblemen. Those principalities were created between the fall of the Serbian Empire and the Ottoman invasion of Albania.

In the summer of 1358, Nikephoros II Orsini, the last despot of Epirus of the Orsini dynasty, fought against the Albanian chieftains in Acheloos, Acarnania. The Albanian chieftains won the war and they managed to create two new states in the southern territories of the Despotate of Epirus. Because a number of Albanian lords actively supported the successful Serbian campaign in Thessaly and Epirus, the Serbian Tsar granted them specific regions and offered them the Byzantine title of despotes in order to secure their loyalty.

The two Albanian lead states were: the first with its capital in Arta was under the Albanian nobleman Pjetër Losha, and the second, centered in Angelokastron, was ruled by Gjin Bua Shpata. After the death of Pjetër Losha in 1374, the Albanian Despotate of Arta and Angelocastron were united under the rule of Despot Gjin Bua Shpata. The territory of this despotate was from the Corinth Gulf to Acheron River in the North, neighboring with the Principality of Gjon Zenevisi, another state created in the area of the Despotate of Epirus.

From 1335 until 1432 four main principalities were created in Albania. The first of them was the Muzakaj Principality of Berat, created in 1335 in Berat and Myzeqe. The most powerful was the Princedom of Albania, formed after the disestablishment of Kingdom of Albania, by Karl Thopia. The principality changed hands between the Thopia dynasty and the Balsha dynasty, until 1392, when it was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. When Skanderbeg liberated Kruja and reorganised the Principality of Kastrioti, the descendant of Gjergj Thopia, Andrea II Thopia, managed to regain control of the Princedom. Finally, it was united with other Albanian Principalities forming the League of Lezhë in 1444.

Another principality was the Principality of Kastrioti, created by Gjon Kastrioti, and later captured by the Ottoman Empire. Finally, it was liberated by the national hero of Albania, Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. The Principality of Dukagjini extended from the Malësia region to Prishtina in Kosovo.

==League of Lezhë==
Under pressure by the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian Principalities were united into a confederation, created in the Assembly of Lezhë on 2 March 1444. The league was led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, and by Lekë Dukagjini following his death. Skanderbeg organized a meeting of Albanian nobles: the Arianiti, Dukagjini, Spani, Thopias, Muzakas, and the leaders of the free Albanian principalities from high mountains, in the town of Lezhë, where the nobles agreed to fight together for mutual gain against the common Turkish enemy. They voted Skanderbeg as their suzerain chief. The League of Lezhë was a confederation and each principality kept its sovereignty.

In the light of the modern geopolitical science, the League of Lezhë represented an attempt to form a state union. In fact, this was a federation of independent rulers who undertook the duty to follow a common foreign policy, to jointly defend their independence and recruit their allied armed forces. Naturally, it required a collective budget for covering the military expenditures; each family contributed their mite to the common funds of the League.
At the same time, each clan kept its possessions and autonomy, to solve internal problems within its own estate. The formation and functioning of the League, of which Gjergj Kastrioti was the supreme feudal lord, was the most significant attempt to build up an all-Albanian resistance against the Ottoman occupation and, simultaneously, an effort to create, for the span of its short-lived functioning, of some sort of a unified Albanian state.
Under Skanderbeg&#x27;s command, the Albanian forces marched east, capturing the cities of Dibra and Ohrid. For 25 years, from 1443 – 1468, Skanderbeg&#x27;s 10,000 men army marched through Ottoman territory, winning victory after victory against the consistently larger and better supplied Ottoman forces. Threatened by Ottoman advances in their homeland, Hungary, and later Naples and Venice, their former enemies, provided the financial backbone and support for Skanderbeg&#x27;s army.

On 14 May 1450, an Ottoman army, larger than any previous force encountered by Skanderbeg or his men, stormed and overwhelmed the castle of the city of Krujë. This city was particularly symbolic to Skanderbeg as he had been previously appointed suba of Krujë in 1438 by the Ottomans. The fighting lasted four months, with an Albanian loss of over 1,000 men and over 20,000 for the Ottomans. The Ottoman forces were unable to capture the city and had no choice but to retreat before winter set in. In June 1446, Mehmed II, known as &quot;the conqueror&quot;, led an army of 150,000 soldiers back to Krujë, but failed to capture the castle. Skanderbeg&#x27;s death in 1468 did not end the struggle for independence, and fighting continued until 1481, under Lekë Dukagjini, when Albanian lands were finally forced to succumb to the Ottoman forces.

==Medieval culture==

In the latter part of the Middle Ages, Albanian urban society reached a high point of development. Foreign commerce flourished to such an extent that leading Albanian merchants had their own agencies in Venice, Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik, Croatia), and Thessalonica (now Thessaloniki, Greece). The prosperity of the cities also stimulated the development of education and the arts. Albanian, however, was not the language used in schools, churches, and official government transactions. Instead, Greek and Latin, which had the powerful support of the state and the church, were the official languages of culture and literature. The new administrative system of the themes, or military provinces created by the Byzantine Empire, contributed to the eventual rise of feudalism in Albania, as peasant soldiers who served military lords became serfs on their landed estates. Among the leading families of the Albanian feudal nobility were the Thopia, Shpata, Muzaka, Arianiti, Dukagjini and Kastrioti. The first three of these rose to become rulers of principalities that were practically independent of Byzantium.

<text>The Saab 9-3 (pronounced &quot;nine-three&quot;) is a compact executive car initially developed and manufactured by the Swedish automaker Saab.

The first generation 9-3 (1998–2003) is based on the GM2900 platform, changing to the GM Epsilon platform with the introduction of the second-generation car (2003–2012). Other vehicles using this platform include the Opel Vectra, Chevrolet Malibu, and Cadillac BLS.

Saab&#x27;s parent company during 2013 and 2014, National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), briefly assembled a few 9-3 sedans.

== Overview ==
The car was badged as 93 starting in the 1998 model year when Saab revised the naming of the smaller car to match that of the larger 95 version. The model was marketed as 9-3, pronounced as &quot;nine three.” The Saab 9-3 was launched in 1998 for the 1999 model year essentially as a rebadged second-generation Saab 900 (1994–1998 model) and succeeded by a redesigned 9-3 for the 2003 model year. It is not related to the Saab 93 (&quot;ninety-three&quot;), a car produced by Saab from 1955 until 1960.

== First generation (1998–2003)==



The first generation 9-3, an updated Saab 900 (NG), was launched in 1998 for the 1999 model year. It is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;OG&#x27; (old generation) 9-3 and internally as body style 9400. Production ended on 8 May 2002 at the Trollhättan plant and on 25 April 2003 at the Valmet plant in Finland.

Saab claimed that 1,100 changes were made between the outgoing NG 900 and the 9-3 such as revised suspension with more wheel travel and quicker steering. The 9-3 received revised styling with some models included a rear spoiler, while the underbody mounted &#x27;snow &amp; gravel flaps&#x27; were removed. It was available as a three or five-door hatchback, and as a two-door convertible. Further improvements over the Saab 900 (NG) included better crashworthiness courtesy of more extensive A-pillar reinforcements, stronger door sills and frames, standard torso/head side airbags, and Saab Active Head Restraints. Other changes included a bigger AC compressor, higher flow cabin ventilation system, a CAN bus based electrical architecture similar to the one in the 9-5, and a switch to a hydraulically operated convertible roof rather than an electric powered.

The 9-3 was available with a new variant of the B204 engine (B204E, ), a low-pressure turbo (LPT) engine based on the B204L used in the last generation Saab 900. For the U.S. market, all 9-3s received turbocharged petrol engines with the &quot;full pressure turbo&quot; (B204L, ) as the standard offering, and a &quot;HOT&quot; (B204R, 200 hp) variant in the SE models for the 1999 model year. The 2000 model year saw a revision from SAAB&#x27;s Trionic T5.5 to Trionic 7 engine management system. The T7 based engines were the B205E, the B205L with and the B205R HOT engine with . The first generation 9-3 was also the first Saab available with a diesel engine, a unit also found in the Opel Vectra, Astra G, Signum, and Zafira A.

A Saab innovation is the &#x27;Night Panel&#x27;, carried over from the Saab 900, which permits dousing of the instrument panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when night driving.

A total of 326,370 first-generation 9-3s were built. As with the preceding generation, convertibles were built by Valmet in Uusikaupunki, Finland. Valmet was also the only plant assembling the 9-3 Viggen, in all three body styles. After production at Saab&#x27;s main plant ended, Valmet kept producing non-Viggen hatchbacks until 2003. Altogether, Valmet built 7789 Hatchbacks of all models.

=== Saab 9-3 Viggen===
Between 1999 and 2002, Saab offered a limited edition and higher-performance version of the 9-3. The &#x27;Viggen&#x27; (English: &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;) is named after the Saab 37 Viggen aircraft, and was developed by Saab with input from the Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR) Group.

The Viggen production car draws upon the earlier Saab 900 Concept Coupe that had been developed by the Saab Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) group. For Saab, the team was led by Peter Leonard and John-Gustav Gudmundsson. Only 4,600 9-3 Viggen specification cars were produced.

====Mechanical features====
The Viggen is powered by Saab&#x27;s 2.3 L B235R engine, running at a 9.3:1 compression ratio and fitted with Nimonic valves. Initially rated at , power later increased to on of boost from its Mitsubishi TD04-HL15-5 turbocharger.

The cars are equipped with a higher capacity intercooler, performance-tuned ECU, flow-through muffler and tip, stiffer gearbox casing and stronger output shaft, a heavy-duty clutch and pressure plate, stiffened and lowered springs with revised spring rates, firmer dampers, as well as stronger CV joints and driveshafts.

The Viggen is only available with a five-speed manual transmission which features an electronic torque-sensing function to prevent damage to the gearbox.

In 1999, the Viggen was the first 9-3 to use Saab&#x27;s Trionic 7 engine management system. The 2001 model year introduced a Traction Control System (TCS). The TCS was later made available in the SE line.

====Exterior and interior features====
The exterior of the Viggen features a larger rear wing that also located the radio antenna to the rear of the roof, aerodynamically designed bumpers and side skirts, model-specific 17-inch alloy wheels, and upgraded brakes. Paint options include Black, Metallic Silver, Steel Grey, Monte Carlo Yellow, Laser Red, and the exclusive Viggen &#x27;Lightning Blue&#x27;.

The interior offers special bolstered and coloured leather seats and door cards in four colours: black with black inserts (&#x27;Charcoal&#x27;), black with blue inserts (&#x27;Deep Blue&#x27;), black with orange inserts (&#x27;Flame Ochre&#x27;), and tan with tan inserts.

Other interior features include a CD player with four or six-speaker, amplifier and CD-changer options, power moonroof, and what were initially Viggen-specific motorized and heated leather seats with the Viggen delta logo embossed in the backrest. The Viggen seats later became available in the Aero model (U.S. market &#x27;SE&#x27; model) without the embossed Viggen logo. Some colors feature carbon-fibre interior trim, offered between 1999 and the middle of the 2001 model year. Cars built afterward came with a less expensive printed grey pattern for the dash and standard trim.

Buyers of new Viggen models in the U.S. were offered two days of advanced driving instruction at Road Atlanta and an opportunity to dine with Saab USA executives from nearby Norcross, Georgia.

==== Production summary ====
A total of 4,600 Viggens were manufactured by Valmet Automotive in Finland until production ended in June 2002; of which 500 units were produced for the UK market. For 1999, 426 3-door Viggens were imported into the U.S.; of those 420 were blue, two were silver, two were Monte Carlo yellow, and two were black.

====Reception====
Some journalists have criticised the Viggen, in particular for untamed torque steer in low gears, with Britain&#x27;s &quot;Evo Magazine&quot; naming the car as one of its 10 worst cars ever tested. Other commentators, however, have named the Viggen a &#x27;classic&#x27;. US reviewers at &quot;Motor Trend&quot; (writing in 2000) noted the crisp turn-in and grip on offer. Jalopnik has named the Viggen &quot;The Last Great True Saab&quot;.

=== First generation 9-3 engines ===
All the petrol engines offered in the first generation 9-3 were versions of the Saab H engine. The Saab 9-5 and the first generation 9-3 were the last Saab cars to use this all-Saab DOHC 16-valve fuel injection design. The non-turbo models use a distributor that leads to each spark plug, while the turbocharged engines utilize Saab&#x27;s Trionic engine management system with a Direct Ignition Module (or cassette) mounted at the top of the engine, directly connecting to the spark plugs. Trionic 5 was used on the B204 Engines, and Trionic 7 was introduced with the B2x5 Engines. The latter two technologies were migrated into other GM products during the ten years that GM controlled Saab. All of the engines, other than the normally aspirated version and the low-pressure turbo, had high specific power outputs. The B205R generated per litre and of torque.
Notes:
* Turbochargers used: B204E, B204L: Garrett T25; B204R, B205E &amp; B205L: Garrett GT17; B205R &amp; B235R: MHI TD04-HL15T with 5 cm? exhaust port.
* The Primary differences between the B204E and the B204L are the use of a Boost Pressure Control Valve and the ECU tuning.
* The primary differences between the B204L and the B204R are with the intercooler and the ECU tuning.
* The primary differences between the B205L and the B205R are the upgrade to the TD04-HL15T turbo from the GT17 and the ECU tuning.
* B204L with automatic gearbox has 185 hp @ 5500rpm and 250Nm @ 1900rpm
* B205R with automatic gearbox has 205 hp @ 5750rpm and 250Nm @ 1900rpm.

==Second generation (2003–2014)==
The 9-3X concept, a preview of the next-generation 9-3, premiered in January 2002 at the North American International Auto Show. Originally, the 9-3 was due to début with the Opel Vectra in October 2001, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, but in July 2001, it was announced that delays had forced General Motors to postpone the introduction. The new 9-3 was eventually launched in July 2002 for the 2003 model year. The convertible version of the second-generation 9-3 began with the MY04, and SportCombi with MY05.

The new 9-3 remained an exclusively front-wheel drive powertrain at launch. The most significant aesthetic change from the previous generation cars was the elimination of the hatchback design. The second-generation 9-3 was available as a four-door saloon, an estate (introduced in late 2005 as a 2006 model, known as the SportWagon, SportCombi, or Sport-Hatch depending on the market), and a two-door convertible (introduced in 2004). It included Saab Active Head Restraints (SAHR II) to reduce whiplash and ReAxs, a feature of the rear suspension bushings which changes the toe angle to help reduce understeer under heavy braking.


The new 9-3 departed from the Saab H / EcoPower engine used previously for a new 2.0 L straight-four &quot;Ecotec&quot; engine from General Motors&#x27; for the petrol-powered models. There are three different versions of the turbocharged inline-four, with the amount of turbo boost determining the power output: 1.8T (112 kW), 2.0t (131 kW) and 2.0T (157 kW). The engines were mated with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed &#x27;Sentronic&#x27; which is a traditional automatic, not to be confused with SAAB&#x27;s earlier &#x27;Sensonic&#x27; which was a clutchless manual transmission that retained a conventional H-pattern shifter, but the clutch system was hydraulically actuated. In 2003 models, the standard manual transmission was a 5-speed gearbox with the 6-speed optional. The 6-speed manual was standard on US 2.0T (Vector) models.

There were four trim levels: the entry-level Linear, mid-range Vector and Arc (with emphasis on sporty appeal and luxury), and a top-of-the-range Aero model. In non-US markets, any trim level except the Aero (which was exclusively available with the 210 hp 2.0T) was available with any engine the buyer opted for. However, in the US, the Linear was exclusively available with the 2.0t engine, the Arc and Vector trims were exclusively available with the 2.0T, and the Aero model offered more options, such as a sunroof, larger wheels, and a 6-speed manual while retaining the same engine as the 2.0T, the B207R. It would be given a 2.8 L turbocharged V6 in 2006. No diesel models were sold in the US, neither were the 1.8T nor any BioPower engines.

The 9-3 and the Opel Vectra were the first of the global GM Epsilon platform, which was then lengthened to accommodate four new cousins, the Chevrolet Malibu/Malibu Maxx, the Pontiac G6, and the Saturn Aura. A proprietary fiber-optic electric/electronic system, the possibility of AWD (exploited from 2008 on, dubbed Saab XWD), and ReAxs were features exclusive to the 9-3.

On 22 February 2012, the last of final 47 Saabs were built. All those cars were 9-3 Cabriolets and 37 where &#x27;Independence Edition&#x27; convertible models all of them where assembled by one of Sweden&#x27;s largest car dealers, ANA, in Trollhättan. Of the 47 cars assembled, 21 were LHD, and 26 RHD. The final Saab was a Saab 9-3 Aero Independence Edition TTiD convertible.

=== 2004 ===

The Vector trim level was replaced with the Aero in the United States. The Arc trim level received the five-speed manual in place of the six-speed. In the UK, the 9-3 Aero 2.0T was made available with a six-speed manual transmission.

=== 2005 ===
The 2.2 TiD engine was replaced with the common rail 1.9 TiD engine, sourced from Fiat. The 1.9 TiD was available both as an 8-valve version with 120 PS and a 16-valve version with 150 PS. The 8V version was available exclusively with a 6-speed manual, while the 16V was also available with a 6-speed automatic. The 16V was equipped with a diesel particulate filter as standard, while it was optional on the 8V for the 2005 MY. Like the 2.2 TiD, the 1.9 TiD was not available in the US.

US versions were sold with 16-inch wheels standard (17-inch for the Aero), unlike the 15-inch wheels which were previously found in the Linear version. In the United States, but not in most countries, 2005 was the last year of the Linear and Arc versions. In addition, the 6-speed manual was dropped and both the Arc and Aero received the 5-speed manual.

=== 2006 ===
A new 2.8-liter turbocharged V6 engine, branded as 2.8T by Saab, was introduced for the Aero. The 2006 Aero was exclusively available with the V6 in the US, replacing the 2.0T engine. In other markets, the 2006 Aero was available with both the four-cylinder 2.0T and the 6-cylinder 2.8T engine. The 2.0T had 12.3 psi maximum turbo boost pressure and turned out , while the 2.8T had 8.7 psi boost and turned out . In certain markets, like Switzerland, a 230 hp variant of the 6-cylinder was also offered in Vector trim.

In the United States, the Linear model and the 175 hp engine was dropped, thus all four-cylinder 9-3 models had the 210 hp engine. The Arc designation was discontinued, and replaced by a trim level called 2.0T, which was similar to the 2005 Arc except that Linear wheels were used. A &quot;20 Years Edition Aero Convertible&quot; for the American market was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2006 to celebrate 20 years since the introduction of the Saab 900 convertible. All of these models were finished in metallic electric blue.

=== 2007 ===

The dashboard was revamped for 2007, with the Saab Information Display moved from its high-mounted position to the main instrument binnacle. The button-heavy climate control system was discontinued and replaced by the Saab 9-5 system, OnStar was re-introduced and required when Nav was ordered in North America, and the corporate GM head unit debuted, which allowed for satellite radio and MP3 CD capability. Steel Gray was also replaced with Titan Gray as an exterior color choice. For the 2007 model year, the 9-3 was also available with Biopower versions of the 1.8t and 2.0t engines, able to run on E85 as well as petrol.

In the U.S. market, only the 210 hp 2.0 L 16-valve turbo engine and the 250 hp 2.8 L V6 turbo were available. The manual transmission in the 2.0T model was changed from a 5-speed to a 6-speed.

A 60th Anniversary Edition was also offered for the sedan, wagon, and convertible body styles for 2007 to celebrate 60 years of SAAB. The package was available on 2.0T cars. It included unique five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, black leather sport seats with grey inserts and SAAB embossments on the front seats, dark walnut trim, black floormats with grey binding, front fog lamps, and a BOSE audio system with 6-disc CD changer and satellite radio. Sedan and convertible models also received trunk-lid spoilers. An Ice Blue metallic paint was offered for the edition, as well as standard SAAB paint colors.

=== 2008 facelift ===

Saab claimed over 2,000 changes were made to the model year 2008 cars. Introduced at the Saab Festival in Trollhättan, Sweden on 10 June 2007, the 2008 models included new frontal styling inspired by the Saab Aero-X and Saab 9-2X, Saab&#x27;s first use of LED &quot;signature&quot; lighting in the revised headlamps, new door panels, a new clamshell bonnet, new rear bumper, and clear tail lamps, dubbed &quot;ice block&quot;. Black replaced charcoal gray as an interior color choice. Snow Silver became a new exterior color. The 2.8T V6 received a mild output boost from . Some additional exterior modifications are available on the limited-edition XWD, 9-3 Turbo X, presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show (9/07). The Turbo X made its North American debut at the New England Auto show in late November. Saab also released an all-wheel-drive version of the Aero, with the system dubbed &quot;XWD&quot;, in March 2008.

A new twin-turbo diesel engine with 180 PS, dubbed 1.9 TTiD, was introduced. The TTiD engine was also available in Aero trim. The TTiD Aero marked the first time Saab had used a diesel engine in a car with the Aero designation.

=== Saab Turbo X ===
Offered in either Sport Sedan, or Sportcombi (wagon) It was made to celebrate SAAB&#x27;s 30 years of turbocharging. All Turbo X models were offered in metallic jet black with matte grey trim. The Turbo X is SAAB&#x27;s first production car with the XWD all-wheel drive system from Haldex Traction and eLSD. It is powered by a 2.8 L V6 producing mated to a six-speed manual or automatic gearbox. It has larger brakes as well as stiffer springs and shocks. The dash, shift lever, and door panels have a carbon fiber look and the turbo boost gauge draws its inspiration from the Saab 900.
=== 2009 ===

The 2009 9-3 series expanded the trim levels while dropping the limited-edition Turbo X saloon and estate from the lineup. The 2.0T and Aero saloon and estate models are now available with Saab&#x27;s all-wheel drive (XWD). The convertible range lacked the all-wheel-drive option. The 2009 Saab 9-3 was mostly unchanged from the 2008 model, although the Aero trim level came standard with the XWD system, eLSD, and 280-horsepower power increase, all formerly reserved for the discontinued Turbo X. During 2009 the 9-3X was launched at the Geneva auto show. The 9-3X is a four-wheel-drive XUV version of the 9-3 SportWagon. The new 9-3X came with two engine choices: the 1.9 L diesel (producing 180 bhp) and the 2.0 L petrol engine (producing the 210 bhp). Only the 2.0 L petrol engine is equipped with the XWD while the diesel version is available only with front-wheel-drive.

=== 2010 ===
For 2010, the Saab 9-3 Aero&#x27;s turbocharged V6 was eliminated. All models used the 2.0-liter turbo-4.

=== Saab 9-3 Aero Carlsson ===
2010 marked the 50th anniversary of Erik Carlsson&#x27;s first win for Saab on the RAC Rally in a Saab 96. A total of 96 Aero Carlsson 9-3 were built. The 9-3 Aero Carlsson featured Saab&#x27;s cross wheel drive (XWD) system, a turbocharged engine, 2.8 L V6 producing 280 hp, and 400Nm of torque through a 6-speed &quot;Sentronic&quot; hydraulic automatic transmission.

===Saab 9-3 ePower===
The Saab 9-3 ePower electric car was unveiled at the 2010 Paris Motor Show as Saab&#x27;s electric vehicle. The concept car is based on the 9-3 SportWagon, has a 35.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, a top speed of , and an estimated driving range of . Saab had scheduled to run a two-year trial with 70 ePower demonstrators in Sweden by late 2011. The new owner of the Saab estate, National Electric Vehicle Sweden, initially stated that they intended to start producing the all-electric 9-3 ePower to be launched in China by late 2013 or early 2014.

The production version was slated to be unveiled at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show and market launch for 2015. In April 2014, NEVS began production on a batch of 200 units to be tested in Qingdao, China by mid-2014. After the test, sales were scheduled to begin in Sweden in 2015.

=== 2011 ===
For the 2011 model year, the single-turbo TiD diesel engines were replaced by twin-turbo diesel engines (TTiD), which increased the power output of the 8V version from 120 to 130 PS, and the 16V from 150 to 160, respectively.

=== 2012 ===
The 9-3 received some revisions in 2011 for the 2012 model year. Changes were in the engine range with an overall reduction in diesel and petrol engine fuel consumption of 12% and 7% respectively. An entry-level 163 hp, 2.0 L gasoline/BioPower engine was added for 9-3 saloon, estate, and 9-3X models with Saab XWD. Other changes included rear badging in line with the new Saab 9-5 saloon, &#x27;ice block&#x27; style headlights, a new front bumper design, titanium metallic-effect trim around the instrument panel, gearshift, doors, and glove box. The Aero included a graphite fiber effect and contrast stitching on leather upholstery.

In most markets, the car was badged &#x27;Griffin&#x27;. The three-spoke alloy wheel returned in 16- to 18-inch choices. An &quot;Independence Edition&quot; convertible was released with a total of 366 units to be built to commemorate the first anniversary of the sale to Spyker Cars. Unfortunately only 37 of those were completed.

===Motorsports===
After the demise of the Saab Automobile and the 9-3 phasing out of the market, the heavily modified 9-3s complied to TTA – Racing Elite League regulations have been raced in 2012 TTA season and from 2013 to 2016 STCC season.

===Second-generation 9-3 engines===
Note: Diesel, biopower, and certain petrol engines were not available in North America. Starting from late 2004, diesel engines are Fiat-sourced common-rail units.

== 2014 (NEVS) ==

National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) restarted production of the Saab 9-3 Aero Sedan MY14 on 2 December 2013, in Saab&#x27;s former Trollhättan assembly plant. The only exterior difference on the MY14 model is the lack of the Griffin badge, to which NEVS does not own the rights. The Griffin is replaced with a badge displaying the Saab logotype, as well as new seats. The 9-3 Aero MY14 features a 220-horsepower 2.0-liter direct-injected twin-scroll turbocharged engine and went on sale in Sweden on 10 December. The first cars were to deliver in Spring 2014 as a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; model. Only two colors were available, black and Silver.

The 9-3 no longer meets the latest Euro NCAP tests regarding pedestrian safety; therefore, only 1,000 cars of each body model could be sold in Europe, as a low-volume manufacturer. The only other market was China. An electric version was to be launched in spring 2014 in the Chinese market. The updated 9-3 have been tested favourably by motoring magazines. &quot;Vi Bilägare&quot; wrote that it feels modern and feels sporty yet comfortable.

Saab automobile production ended as of May 2014 because Qingbo Investment, one of NEVS shareholders, was not able to reach a financing agreement. By the end of 2014, India&#x27;s Mahindra &amp; Mahindra agreed to buy a majority stake in NEVS. In February 2015, it was announced that the remaining 100 cars that were stuck on the halted production line since May 2014 would be completed.

Production of the electric 9-3 in China was started in 2017.
==Third generation==
Work on a third-generation Saab 9-3 started in 2007, when designers in General Motors facilities in Rüsselsheim and Detroit began work on a design study. The design language was supervised by Simon Padian, and the design team managed to produce a clay model and several computer models before General Motors announced it had put the Saab brand &quot;under review&quot; in December 2008.

After an intended sale of Saab to Swedish supercar manufacturer Koenigsegg ultimately failed in 2009, General Motors reached an agreement with Dutch manufacturer Spyker N.V. in January 2010. The sale of Saab to Spyker was completed in late February 2010 and work on a replacement for the 9-3 was restarted virtually immediately. The new management of Saab, headed by CEO Victor Muller, felt, however, that a new design language was needed to distance a newly independent Saab from General Motors.

Muller hired Jason Castriota in June 2010 to work on a scalable car platform that would serve as the basis for future Saabs, beginning with the replacement for the 9-3. In October 2010 a number of prototypes were produced and evaluated against the prototypes made in 2007. Eventually, Castriota&#x27;s prototype was chosen and the design team was instructed to develop a five-door combi coupé, a convertible, and a crossover on the new platform.

The work on the new platform culminated in the unveiling of the Saab PhoeniX concept car at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2011. By that time, Saab had run into serious cash flow problems, but work on the PhoeniX platform and the 9-3 replacement continued to the point that bankruptcy papers were filed in late 2011.

The replacement of the 9-3, which had been renamed 900 by that time, was to have a 1.6 liter turbo engine supplied by BMW, who would have also supplied the cars&#x27; start-stop system. The car was to have a hybrid drivetrain and was to be released in both a premium Aero and an economy Vector variant.

When Saab finally filed for bankruptcy in December 2011, Castriota and his team had already finished most of the work on the car&#x27;s body and its engineering, with the interior being the only part yet to be developed. The car was set to be completed by fall of 2012. The main assets of the bankrupt company were acquired by National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), which may revisit the PhoeniX platform. NEVS was focusing its efforts on producing an electric variant of the second generation 9-3.

<text>Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is inflammation of the urethra that is not caused by gonorrheal infection.

For treatment purposes, doctors usually classify infectious urethritis in two categories: gonococcal urethritis, caused by gonorrhea, and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU).

==Symptoms and signs==
The symptoms of urethritis can include pain or a burning sensation upon urination (dysuria), a white/cloudy discharge and a feeling that one needs to pass urine frequently. For men, the signs and symptoms are discharge from the penis, burning or pain when urinating, itching, irritation, or tenderness. In women, the signs and symptoms are discharge from vagina, burning or pain when urinating, anal or oral infections, abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, which may be an indication that the infection has progressed to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.

NGU is transmitted by touching the mouth, penis, vagina or anus by penis, vagina or anus of a person who has NGU.

NGU is more common in men than women. Men may have a discharge (strange liquid) from the penis, pain when urinating, and itching, irritation or tenderness around the opening of the penis. Women might not have any symptoms and may not know they have NGU until severe problems occur. Women might have discharge from the vagina, burning or pain when urinating, pain in the abdominal (stomach) area, or bleeding from the vagina that is not from a monthly period. (This may be an sign that NGU has become worse and turned into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or PID).

==Causes==
There are many causes of NGU. This is in part due to the large variety of organisms living in the urinary tract. &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; are some of the culprits. NGU is also associated with reactive arthritis, in which the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis is seen.

===Bacterial===
The most common bacterial cause of NGU is &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis,&quot; but it can also be caused by &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus vaginalis&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma hominis&quot;, &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter lwoffii&quot;, &quot;Acinetobacter calcoaceticus&quot;, and &quot;E.coli&quot;.

===Viral===
Herpes simplex virus, Adenovirus,
Cytomegalovirus
===Fungi===
Candida Albicans

===Parasitic===
Parasitic causes include &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; (rare).

===Noninfectious===
Urethritis can be caused by mechanical injury (from a urinary catheter or a cystoscope), or by an irritating chemical (antiseptics or some spermicides).

==Diagnosis==
It has been easy to test for the presence of gonorrhea by viewing a Gram stain of the urethral discharge under a microscope: The causative organism is distinctive in appearance; however, this works only with men because other non-pathogenic gram-negative microbes are present as normal flora of the vagina in women. Thus, one of the major causes of urethritis can be identified (in men) by a simple common test, and the distinction between gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis arose for this reason.

Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is diagnosed if a person with urethritis has no signs of gonorrhea bacteria on laboratory tests. 

In men, the most frequent cause of NGU (15%-55% of cases) is &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;.

===Idiopathic urethritis or non-specific urethritis===
Historically, the terms idiopathic urethritis (US English) or non-specific urethritis (British English) have been used as synonyms for nongonococcal urethritis. &quot;Idiopathic&quot; and &quot;&quot; are medical term meaning &quot;specific cause has not been identified&quot;, and in this case refers to the detection of urethritis, and the testing for but found negative of gonorrhea. In this sense, the most likely cause of NSU is a chlamydia infection.

However, the term NSU is sometimes distinguished and used to mean that both gonorrhea and chlamydia have been ruled out. Thus, depending on the sense, chlamydia can either be the most likely cause or have been ruled out, and frequently detected organisms are &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma hominis&quot;.

However, in 20-50% of cases, a specific cause for urethritis can&#x27;t be identified, in which case a diagnosis of idiopathic urethritis is a diagnosis of exclusion.

==Treatment==
Treatment is based on the prescription and use of the proper antibiotics depending on the strain of the ureaplasma.

Because of its multi-causative nature, initial treatment strategies involve using a broad range antibiotic that is effective against chlamydia (such as doxycycline). It is imperative that both the patient and any sexual contacts be treated. Women infected with the organisms that cause NGU may develop pelvic inflammatory disease. If symptoms persist, follow-up with a urologist may be necessary to identify the cause.

According to a study, tinidazole used with doxycycline or azithromycin may cure NGU better than when doxycycline or azithromycin is used alone.

If left untreated, complications include epididymitis and infertility. Consistent and correct use of latex condoms during sexual activity greatly reduces the likelihood of infection.

<doc id="291380" wikidata="Q234271" url="?curid=291380" title="Nina Hartley">
<text>Marie Louise Hartman (born March 11, 1959), known professionally as Nina Hartley, is an American pornographic film actress and sex educator. By 2017 she had appeared in more than one thousand adult films. She has been described by &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; as an &quot;outspoken feminist&quot; and &quot;advocate for sexual freedom&quot;, and by CNBC as &quot;a legend in the adult world&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hartley was born on March 11, 1959, in Berkeley, California, to a Lutheran father, Louis Hartman, and a Jewish mother, Blanche Hartman (née Gelders). Her grandfather was a University of Alabama physics professor who was a Communist Party USA (CPUSA) party member in the 1930s. Hartley&#x27;s parents were members of the CPUSA who converted to Buddhism when she was young.
Her father was blacklisted in 1957 for his communist beliefs.

Hartley grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and as a teenager self-identified as a feminist, influenced by the slogan &quot;my body, my rules&quot;.
After graduating from Berkeley High School in 1977, she attended San Francisco State University&#x27;s undergraduate nursing school and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1985, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
She was a registered nurse until her license expired in 1986.

== Adult film career ==
Hartley sought a career in pornography as a way to make a living by having sex, later telling &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot;, &quot;Porn gave me easy access to women without having to date them or have a relationship.&quot;
She writes that part of her reason for choosing sex work was to be able to indulge her exhibitionistic and voyeuristic streak.
She has said she chose her life&#x27;s work when she saw the 1976 erotic film &quot;The Autobiography of a Flea&quot; alone at a theater in San Francisco.

In 1982, during her sophomore year of nursing school, Hartley started working as a stripper at the Sutter Cinema and then the Mitchell Brothers O&#x27;Farrell Theatre.
She told an interviewer that she chose the name &quot;Nina&quot; because it was easy for Japanese tourists to say during the time she was a dancer in San Francisco, and &quot;Hartley&quot; because it was close to her own last name, and she &quot;wanted a name that sounded like that of a real person.&quot;

Her pornographic film debut was in &quot;Educating Nina&quot; (1984), where she was cast and directed by fellow performer Juliet Anderson.
For many years, she toured the United States and Canada as a stripper and made personal appearances at sex shops.
In 2013 she described her father&#x27;s reaction upon learning about her occupation:

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Hartley starred in several of the &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; film series spin-offs such as &quot;Debbie Duz Dishes&quot; (1986) and &quot;Debbie Does Wall Street&quot; (1991).
In 1992, she directed her first movie, &quot;Nina Hartley&#x27;s Book of Love&quot;.
She also produced and starred in a series of sex education videos for Adam &amp; Eve.
In 1994, she began her line of instructional videos marketed under the &quot;Nina Hartley&#x27;s Guide&quot; brand.

She played the part of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 satirical pornographic film &quot;Who&#x27;s Nailin&#x27; Paylin?&quot;, with Lisa Ann in the role of Sarah Palin.
, she was still actively performing, and by 2017 had appeared in more than one thousand pornographic films.
She has been described by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as &quot;one of the best-known actresses in the industry&quot; and by CNBC as &quot;a legend in the adult world&quot;.

==Mainstream media appearances==
Hartley acted in the 1996 Canadian film &quot;Bubbles Galore&quot; and has appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.
In the 1997 film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, she played William H. Macy&#x27;s character&#x27;s serially unfaithful wife who is murdered.
She later remarked, &quot;The only movie I ever died in for having sex was a mainstream movie.&quot;

Hartley has appeared in several documentary films: she was interviewed in &quot;The Naked Feminist&quot; (2003) was featured in &quot;After Porn Ends&quot; (2012), and appears in &quot;&quot; (2016), in which she discusses masturbation with regards to education, the forced resignation of Joycelyn Elders, and her opinions on the blackballing of comedian Paul Reubens after his arrest for masturbating in a public theater.

==Activism==
&quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; has described Hartley as an &quot;outspoken feminist, sex educator and advocate for sexual freedom&quot; and &quot;a guiding force for a generation of feminist porn stars&quot;.
She has described herself both as a &quot;classical liberal feminist&quot; and a democratic socialist. Hartley began engaging in feminist activism in the 1980s. She has said:

Hartley has also been involved in socialist activism and has also been affiliated with the Adult Performer Advocacy Committee (APAC), a labor union founded in 2014 for pornographic film actors.

Hartley was elected to the board of the Free Speech Coalition in 1995, and is a long-time board member of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation (founded in 2003).
She has made frequent appearances at academic conferences, workshops, and in the media to promote sex positivity.
She has given lectures at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of California.

==Writing==
In 2006, Hartley co-authored &quot;Nina Hartley&#x27;s Guide to Total Sex&quot; with her husband Ira Levine. The book includes sections on sex toys, swinging, threesomes, dominance and submission, and erotic spanking.
&quot;Library Journal&quot; called the book a &quot;well-written guide&quot; that is &quot;strong on both safe sex and a permissive approach&quot;, saying Hartley &quot;handles the material frankly, accurately, and with sensitivity&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hartley is a self-described bisexual, swinger, and exhibitionist.
She married her first husband, a former Students for a Democratic Society leader, in a three-way marriage with a second woman in 1986.
She describes the relationship as a &quot;very unhappy marriage&quot; to &quot;someone who was not a good candidate for mating with a sex worker&quot;.

Following her divorce in 2003, Hartley married Ira Levine, known professionally as Ernest Greene, a director of bondage films and editor of &quot;Hustler&#x27;s Taboo&quot; magazine, with whom she had had a secret relationship in the 1980s.
They are openly polyamorous.
As of 2014, the couple lives in Los Angeles.

<doc id="291384" wikidata="Q8719" url="?curid=291384" title="Birmingham Airport">
<text>Birmingham Airport , formerly &quot;Birmingham International Airport&quot;, is an international airport located east-southeast of Birmingham city centre, west-northwest of Coventry slightly north of Bickenhill village, in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, England.

Officially opened as &quot;Elmdon Airport&quot; on 8 July 1939, the airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry during the Second World War and used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy as &quot;RAF Elmdon&quot;. It was largely used for flight training and wartime production purposes. On 8 July 1946, the aerodrome was reopened to civilian operations.

Birmingham Airport currently holds a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P451) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. Passenger throughput in 2017 was over 12.9 million, making Birmingham the seventh busiest airport in the UK. The airport offers international flights to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Birmingham Airport is an operating base for easyJet, Jet2.com, Ryanair and TUI Airways.

==Location==
Birmingham Airport is east-south-east of Birmingham city centre, in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. It is bordered by the National Exhibition Centre to the east, Marston Green to the north, Sheldon to the west, the village of Bickenhill to the south, and the village of Elmdon to the south west.

It is primarily served by the A45 main road, and is near Junction 6 of the M42 motorway. It is connected by the elevated Air-Rail Link with Birmingham International railway station on the West Coast Main Line.

The airport&#x27;s location southeast of the city, plus the only operational runway being northwest–southeast (15/33), means that depending on wind direction, aircraft land or take-off directly over Birmingham. The former northeast–southwest runway (06/24) has been incorporated into a taxiway for aircraft accessing runway 15/33.

==History==

===Construction and opening===
In 1928, Birmingham City Council decided that the city required a municipal airport; thus soon thereafter a committee was established to work towards establishing such a facility. By 1931, several locations, including Shirley, Elmdon and Aldridge, were reportedly under consideration as potential sites. While Elmdon was considered to be an impressive and appropriate site for the airport, further progress was delayed due to spending cutbacks that had been initiated as a consequence of the Great Depression. By 1933, the project was revived and a new airport committee was formed during the following year to oversee the airport&#x27;s establishment. Prior to any major construction decisions being taken, members of the committee visited various successful airports around Europe in 1935, including Amsterdam, Berlin, Lyon, Paris, Brussels and London.

During January 1935, the airport committee approached British architectural and engineering practice Norman and Dawbarn, inviting their attendance and seeking their participation as expert advisers on the airport&#x27;s construction, the practice was subsequently appointed as the project&#x27;s architects. In 1933, Birmingham City Council authorised the compulsory purchase of 300 acres of land for the use by the airport; another 214 acres were similarly acquired during the following year. During 1936, a private bill presented by the Birmingham Corporation was passed through Parliament, which authorised the acquisition of further land as well as the diversion of various roads and footpaths to permit the airport&#x27;s development. Shortly following the bill&#x27;s passing, various agencies, including the City Engineer and Surveyor, the Public Works Department and a firm of aeronautical consultants, including Norman and Dawbarn, commenced work on preparing the ground, designing both the terminal and hangar buildings, and planning out the airport&#x27;s detailed layout.

By January 1937, Norman and Dawbarn had been authorised to finalise the design drawings; these were apparently completed by June 1937. In October of that year, various contractors were appointed to construct various elements of the airport&#x27;s buildings, including its elaborate terminal. Reportedly, the project&#x27;s total expenditure amounted to around £360,000. Construction work proceeded at a rapid pace; on 1 May 1939, the airport had been completed to such a degree that it was ready to handle traffic.

On 8 July 1939, the Duchess of Kent, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, accompanied by the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, officiated at the opening of Elmdon Airport. Its terminal, which incorporated the airport&#x27;s air traffic control tower, was designed by Norman and Dawbarn in an Art Deco style; this facility would continue to be used as a terminal until 1984 and subsequently as staff offices and for private flights; it is still intact as of 2023. The airport was owned and operated by Birmingham City Council. Initial services flew to Croydon, Glasgow, Liverpool, Ryde, Shoreham, Manchester, and Southampton; further services were added soon thereafter, although its use as a civilian airport would soon be interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Elmdon Airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry and was used by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy as &quot;RAF Elmdon&quot;. It was largely operated as an Elementary Flying School and a base for the Fleet Air Arm. It was during this era that the original grass airstrip was replaced by two hard runways: 06/24 at and 15/33 at . Large numbers of Avro Lancaster and Stirling bombers were manufactured at the Austin Aero Company&#x27;s shadow factory at Cofton Hackett, but were unable to take off from the short runways at Longbridge; thus, they were transported by road to RAF Elmdon, their wings being removed beforehand and re-attached after arrival. They were test flown from the aerodrome and, once declared airworthy, they were flown to their operational units. On 8 July 1946, the aerodrome was reopened to civilian operations, though it remained under government control.

===1950 to 1980===
During the post-war years, a number of public events, such as air fairs and air races, were held on the site. In 1949, scheduled services began with British European Airways (BEA) launching routes to Paris; the number of flights to the continent steadily grew over the years, including services to Zürich, Düsseldorf, Palma, Amsterdam and Barcelona commencing between 1955 and 1960. During 1960, the City of Birmingham resumed responsibility for the airport&#x27;s operation again, ending central government control.

In 1961, an additional terminal building to handle the growing international traffic was opened, which was fittingly called &quot;The International Building&quot;. Furthermore, work to extend the airport&#x27;s main runway to 7,400 feet (1.4 miles) was undertaken between 1967 and 1970, which permitted the launch of new services using turboprop and jet-powered airliners. Accordingly, a new service to New York using VC-10 airliner was launched during 1967. By the early 1970s, Birmingham Airport was reportedly handling around one million passengers per year, albeit through a relatively congested passenger terminal. In 1974, the newly formed West Midlands Metropolitan County Council took over management of the airport.

On 16 September 1980, the supersonic airliner Concorde made its first visit to Birmingham Airport. On 20 October 2003, Concorde made its final visit to the airport as part of its farewell tour.

===1981 to 2000===
Birmingham Airport was once home to the world&#x27;s first commercial maglev system in the form of a low-speed maglev shuttle that ran along a 620-metre line between the terminal and the nearby Birmingham International railway station. Following a year of testing and trial use, the Birmingham Airport Maglev was opened to great fanfare during April 1984. However, during 1995, the Maglev rail link was discontinued after 11 years; the closure has been attributed to the system&#x27;s unreliability, it having suffered from frequent breakdowns. The original guideway lay dormant but intact for a time, while proposals for its restoration or adaption for other uses were considered. In 2003, a replacement cable-hauled system, the Air-Rail Link Cable Liner people mover, was opened, which reused the track and much of the existing infrastructure.

During 1993, the government limited public sector borrowing came into force and was applied to Birmingham Airport. This change meant that the airport could only expand by using private sector finance. 51% of the local council shares were sold to restructure the airport into a private sector company; this initiative led to the commencement of a £260 million restructuring programme in 1997.

===2000s===

During November 2007, Birmingham Airport published a master plan for its development up to 2030, called &quot;Towards 2030: Planning a Sustainable Future for Air Transport in the Midlands&quot;. This set out details of changes to the terminals, airfield layout and off-site infrastructure. As with all large scale plans, the proposals were controversial, with opposition from environmentalists and local residents. In particular, the requirement for a second parallel runway based on projected demand was disputed by opponents. Plans for a second runway (a third when demand requires) on the other side of the M42 and a new terminal complex and business park have been published, and they could help to create around 250,000 jobs. It has been estimated that if these plans went ahead, the airport could handle around 70,000,000 passengers annually, and around 500,000 aircraft movements.

In January 2008, the shorter runway (06/24) was decommissioned. It had been used less often due to its short length, noise impact, and its inconvenient position crossing the main runway, making it uneconomic to continue operation. The closure also allowed for apron expansion on both sides of the main runway. However, runway 06/24 remains open as a taxiway and a helicopter airstrip. In the same month, plans for the extension of the airport runway and the construction of a new air traffic control tower were submitted to Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council.

In June 2008, work began on building the new three-storey International Pier; it was officially opened on 9 September 2009. As part of the airport&#x27;s 70th anniversary, the airport welcomed the Airbus A380 as the first user of the pier. The special service was the first commercial A380 flight in the UK outside London Heathrow Airport. The new pier is 240 metres long and 24 metres wide. Departing passengers are accommodated on the top level, with arriving passengers on the middle level and office accommodation for airline and handling agents on the ground floor. The new facility provides air-bridged aircraft parking for seven wide-bodied aircraft and enough space for 13 smaller aircraft. It can accommodate &#x27;next generation&#x27; environmentally-efficient wide-bodied aircraft such as the Airbus A340-600, the Airbus A380, the Boeing 747-8, and the Boeing 777X. The new pier also has a new lounge for business class Emirates passengers. In March 2009, the runway extension plans were approved.

===2010s===
In September 2010, it was announced that after the merging of Terminals 1 and 2 into a single facility in 2011, the airport would drop the &quot;International&quot; from its official name to become &quot;Birmingham Airport&#x27;&quot;. A Midlands-based marketing agency was recruited to &quot;create a new corporate identity that reflects Birmingham Airport&#x27;s current position in the market place, as well as its future potential&quot;. Figures from Birmingham Airport show that 8 million people live within a one hour&#x27;s drive of the airport, but less than 40% of them use it. It is hoped that the rebrand will make the airport &quot;more visible to the market&quot;. In November 2010, the new name started to be used. The new logo, interlocking circles in shades of blue, and slogan, &quot;Hello World&quot;, were designed to reflect the airport&#x27;s new positioning as a global travel hub.

In January 2011 the viewing gallery, &#x27;Aviation Experience And Gift Shop&#x27;, closed indefinitely. In the same month, the airport merged its two terminals into a single terminal building, which involved the construction of two additional floors. A new lower ground floor accommodates the new Arrivals and Meet &amp; Greet area, while the 3rd floor was built in the Millennium Link and the two terminals to accommodate the new Centralised Security Search area. In July 2011, construction of a new control tower began. The new control tower was completed in March 2012; it replaced the airport&#x27;s original tower, which had been used since the airport opened in 1939.

On 23 February 2011, Birmingham Airport announced that the High Speed 2 railway could be a solution to runway capacity problems in London; management figures suggested that it would be quicker to get to London from Birmingham than from Stansted Airport once completed, and claimed that the airport had capacity for nine million more passengers.

Plans for the extension of the airport&#x27;s runway, and the construction of the new air traffic control tower, were submitted to Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council in January 2008, and approved in March 2009. Originally, the target for completion was in time for the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics. An Olympic ceremony was held at the airport on 23 April 2012. The Olympic rings were unveiled on the tower and could be seen from the A45 road and the main terminal building. This was to commemorate the build-up to the London 2012 Olympic Games. These rings were removed once the Olympic Games officially closed, just before the 2012 Summer Paralympics began. Work on the new runway eventually began in autumn 2012. The extension to the southern end of the runway originally required the A45 Coventry Road to be diverted into a tunnel under the extended section, but to cut costs, it was diverted south of the runway instead. In Summer 2013 the new air traffic control tower became fully operational; the old carriageway of the A45 was closed and the new carriageway was opened. In May 2014, the 400-metre runway extension was officially opened; the full length was first used on 22 July 2014, when China Southern Airlines operated its first charter between Birmingham and Beijing.

The Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, a Canadian institutional investor, increased its stake in the airport to 48.25% in early 2015. It also owns 100% of Bristol Airport. Birmingham handled over 11.6 million passengers in 2016, a record total for the airport, making it the seventh busiest UK airport.

On 28 September 2016, £100 million of investment was allocated to a new baggage handling system and two new car parks, including a drop-off car park.

===Since 2020===

British regional airline Flybe operated an extensive route network from Birmingham to destinations within the United Kingdom and mainland Europe until it entered administration on 4 March 2020, and has since resumed operations using the airport as its headquarters and main base of operations. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary mortuary was established in a hangar at the airport, with space for 12,000 bodies.

On 13 January 2023, Emirates announced that they will return to flying the iconic Airbus A380 on their daily flights to Birmingham Airport from 1 July 2023. Previously, Emirates had used the Airbus A380 on their flights to Birmingham since 2016; however, they resumed using the Boeing 777 during the COVID-19 pandemic due to less demand.

In January 2023, regional airline Flybe, successor to the aforementioned airline of the same name, which maintained its main base in Birmingham, entered administration and ceased all operations.

==Terminals==
Birmingham Airport&#x27;s current terminal complex combines the two old terminals via the Millennium Link in to one large terminal, with gates 1–20 in the old Terminal 2, and all other gates in the old Terminal 1. All check in desks and arrivals are on the ground floor. The central security area, along with airside shops and restaurants are located on the first floor.

Terminal 1 was opened on 3 April 1984, seventeen years after the original plans to construct a new terminal to ease congestion in the original Elmdon Terminal (Grade II listed since August 2018 and now used for private and official flights). Since then, T1 has been extended multiple times to accommodate the increase in both passenger numbers and aircraft movements.

===Public transport===
====Rail====
Birmingham Airport is served by Birmingham International railway station. The station is on the West Coast Main Line between Birmingham and London, and trains are operated by West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast, Transport For Wales, and CrossCountry. Access between the railway station and the airport terminal is provided by the free Air-Rail Link.

====Proposed High Speed 2====
As part of Phase 1 of the High Speed 2 rail link, a new railway station called Birmingham Interchange will be built to serve both the airport and the National Exhibition Centre. The station will be built on the far side of the M42 motorway and connect to the airport using a &quot;rapid transit people mover&quot;. High Speed 2 is currently planned for completion by 2029.

====West Midlands Metro====
There are plans to implement a new Line 3 of the West Midlands Metro to Birmingham Airport from Edgbaston, this would link Birmingham Interchange, Birmingham International and Birmingham Airport to the City Centre of Birmingham in 30 minutes travelling along the A45.

====Bus and coach====
National Express West Midlands operates the main bus routes calling at Birmingham Airport, those being the X1 to Birmingham city centre and Coventry, the X12 to Chelmsley Wood and Solihull, and the 96 to Chelmsley Wood, Erdington and Kingstanding. Other smaller operators also call at the airport. Bus stops are situated outside Terminal One. Most buses are operated by National Express West Midlands.

National Express Coaches operates various long-distance coaches calling at Birmingham Airport on the way to or from Birmingham coach station.

===Taxi===
Black cabs are available at the taxi-rank outside the arrivals area of the terminal.

===Car===
Birmingham Airport is accessible from the north and south via Junction Six of the M42 motorway. From Birmingham city centre, the A45 runs directly to the airport. Parking charges apply in some areas even for very short periods of time, with locations farther from the airport being cheaper than those near the airport.

===Bicycle===
The only cycle route available heads south over the A45 travelling towards Solihull. Birmingham Airport has, however, published &quot;recommended routes&quot; for cyclists. Free short term cycle parking is available close to the terminal. For longer stays, bicycles must be stored in the Left Luggage for a charge.

<text>Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport , formerly Birmingham Municipal Airport and later Birmingham International Airport, is a civil-military airport serving Birmingham, Alabama. The airport also provides scheduled airline service for the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas. It is located in Jefferson County, five miles northeast of Downtown Birmingham, near the interchange of Interstates 20 and 59.

BHM served 3,056,215 passengers in 2023, and is the largest and busiest airport in the state of Alabama by passenger volume. The airfield can handle all aircraft types. The main runway is long. The secondary runway is long. A CategoryII ILS allows operations in visibility as low as a quarter-mile. The airport was renamed in July 2008 after Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, founding president of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and a leader of the Birmingham campaign during the civil rights movement.

The airport carries the designation of an international airport and has a staffed U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility on site. There have been scheduled seasonal international flights to the Bahamas, Canada, and Mexico in the past, but as of March 2020, there are no scheduled international flights. However, air ambulance operator AirMed International regularly operates to and from destinations throughout the world; corporate aircraft routinely depart and arrive from foreign destinations, as well. The Southern Museum of Flight currently operates on Airport Authority property, to the east side of the north–south runway. There are plans for it to relocate to a new site near the Barber Motorsports Park.

==History==
Commercial air service to Birmingham began in 1928 by St. Tammy and Gulf Coast Airways, at Roberts Field on the west side of Birmingham on a route from Atlanta, Georgia to New Orleans, Louisiana. Delta Air Service began service to Birmingham in late 1929 with six seat Travel Air airplanes along a route from Love Field in Dallas, Texas to Birmingham. When American Airways (now American Airlines) began their Atlanta, Georgia to Fort Worth, Texas route, Birmingham was not included because their Ford Tri-Motors could not land at Roberts Field. Thus, Birmingham began construction of what is now Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport.

The airport opened on May 31, 1931 with a two-story, white, Georgian style terminal and a single east–west runway. The terminal was just east of the later 1962 and 1971 terminal complexes. No remains of the 1931 terminal or landscaping are visible. With the addition of American Airlines in 1931 and Eastern Airlines in 1934, air traffic increased enough to warrant a second runway.

World War II saw the airport leased to the United States Army Air Forces for $1 a year to support national defense. Birmingham Army Airfield was a section assigned to the Third Air Force as a fighter base, operated by the 310th Army Air Force Base Unit. The Army Air Forces considerably improved the airport with land acquisitions, paving of additional taxiways, and construction of a control tower and an aircraft modification center south of the terminal, now operated by Stewart Industries for aircraft disassembly and disposal.
Around the 1940s, Birmingham was considered as a potential air transportation hub for the Deep South. However, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines and the United States Postal Service each opted to use Atlanta for this purpose instead. One factor was an aviation fuel tax imposed by the City of Birmingham in the 1940s; other factors included Birmingham&#x27;s location in the Central Time Zone, which placed it at a disadvantage in accommodating traffic between East Coast points, and a relatively strong sales and marketing campaign by Atlanta under Mayor William Hartsfield.

After the airport returned to city control in August 1948 Southern Airways began service. In March 1951 four runways were in use, Runways 5/23 (now 6/24) and 18/36, and runways at about 45/225 degrees north of Runway 5/23 and 85/265 degrees mostly south of Runway 5/23. Runway lengths were about to . The runway at 45/225 degrees is now largely removed, though a paved portion remains crossing taxiway F near the Alabama Air National Guard facilities, used for airport equipment and helicopter landing/parking. The runway at 85/265 is also mostly removed, with remaining segments making up taxiway A5 and a portion of taxiway F east of Runway 18/36.

By 1959 Runway 5/23 was and service was started to Birmingham by Capital Airlines with Vickers Viscounts. The first scheduled jets were Delta Convair 880s in October 1961, flying ATL-BHM-MSY-LAX and back. Birmingham then had nonstops to Newark and Washington, DC, but no other nonstops beyond Charlotte, Memphis and New Orleans, and no nonstops to Florida. In the late 1960s Douglas DC-8, Douglas DC-9, Convair 880 and Boeing 727s were all scheduled to BHM.

During the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, pilots and crews from the Alabama Air National Guard&#x27;s 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Birmingham were selected to train Cuban exile fliers in Nicaragua to fly the Douglas B-26 Invader in the close air support role. Although the 117th was flying the RF-84F Thunderflash, it had only recently retired its RB-26C Invaders, the last squadron in the Air Force to do so; thus the 117th was seen as the logical choice for the CIA&#x27;s secret mission. Seven of the volunteer aviators participated combat operations during the final day of the invasion, on August 19, 1961. Birmingham natives Leo Baker, Wade Gray, Riley Shamburger, and Thomas &quot;Pete&quot; Ray were killed when their (two) aircraft were shot down. While American involvement had been suspected since before the invasion even began, Ray&#x27;s frozen body was kept as concrete proof of U.S. support.

Continued growth in passenger traffic by 1962 resulted in the construction of a second passenger terminal and a new air traffic control tower, built west of the original 1931 terminal. This was dedicated on February 11, 1962 as the Birmingham Air Terminal. Charles H. McCauley Associates was the supervising architect and Radar &amp; Associates was the designing architect. It consisted of a single story building of repeated bays with steeply pitched roofs, which flanked a wider, higher center bay at the south end of the building for ticketing. A long, flat roofed northern section comprised the ground-level aircraft gates. The air traffic control tower, completed in 1962 and located immediately southwest of the terminal, was tall. The 1962 control tower was demolished in 2004 after being replaced by the 2001 air traffic control tower. This terminal was demolished to make way for the 2011 terminal expansion; the 1962 terminal being located in the area now covered by the aircraft apron for Gate A1.

In 1973 a semi-circular terminal was completed west of the 1962 terminal and air traffic control tower. It had 15 aircraft gates and a 1,600 space parking deck. Allegheny Airlines (later US Airways) began service from Birmingham to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the late 1970s. Deregulation of the airline industry saw airlines such as Comair, Florida Express, People Express, Air New Orleans, L&#x27;Express Airlines, and Southwest Airlines enter the Birmingham market. The city unsuccessfully lobbied Piedmont Airlines to establish a Birmingham hub in the 1980s; American Airlines considered Birmingham as the site for a new north–south hub around the same time, but opted to establish hubs in Nashville and Raleigh/Durham instead.

The original 1931 terminal was finally demolished between 1970 and 1992. With the introduction of flights to Canada and Mexico, the official name of the airport was changed to Birmingham International Airport on October 20, 1993. Also in 1993, the airport marked the completion of a $50.4m terminal renovation.

In the early 1990s Runway 18/36 was extended to 7,100 feet, allowing use by airline jets. By the early 2000s, Birmingham had completed improvements to the air cargo areas, including a new facility at the far west end of runway 6-24 which houses FedEx and United Parcel Service. A new FAA air traffic control tower located south of the terminal parking deck and measuring in height entered service in the Summer of 2001. The 1962 blue and white air traffic control tower was demolished in 2004. In 2006 Birmingham International Airport celebrated its 75th year. In July 2007 an eastward extension to Runway 6/24 was completed. Now in length, Runway 6/24 allows a fully loaded Boeing 747 to land or take off.

On June 23, 2008 Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford announced his proposal to rename the airport as the Fred L. Shuttlesworth International Airport, in honor of civil rights activist Fred Shuttlesworth. On July 16, 2008, Mayor Langford and the Birmingham Airport Authority voted to change the name of the airport from the Birmingham International Airport to the Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport after the former civil rights activist. The name change cost about $300,000. The FAA approved the name change and signage of the airport took place on April 3, 2009.

In 2011, The Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport broke ground on a comprehensive Terminal Modernization Project. This project was completed in phases over three years, retaining with extensive renovations the 1973 landside terminal, demolishing the 1962 terminal and 1973 airside concourses and gates (portions of the 1973 Concourse C structure were reused), and constructing all new airside facilities with 19 gates equipped with jetways. Completed in 2014, the completed provided a beautiful new terminal that nearly doubled the airport&#x27;s footprint, but with minimal impact on the community and environment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Delta Airlines stored several of their widebody jets as well as many narrow body jets at BHM during the downturn in global travel demand.

==Facilities==
Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport covers 2,170 acres (878 ha) at an elevation of 650 feet (198 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 6/24 is 12,007 by 150 feet (3,660 x 46 m) and 18/36 is 7,099 by 150 feet (2,164 x 46 m).

Atlantic Aviation operates two general aviation fixed-base operator facilities, and there are numerous corporate hangars north of Runway 6/24 and east of Runway 18/36. AirMed International, a fixed-wing air ambulance company, operates its main hub from here. There is a large, full service aircraft modification and maintenance facility on the south side of the airport. It was originally built during World War II, but was subsequently expanded. While little work is now performed at the complex, the facility sits on approximately 180 acres of land and has 1.7 million square feet under its roof. It has 10 aircraft pull-through bays with space under the roof for 54 737-size aircraft.

In the year ending November 30, 2023, the airport had 98,681 aircraft operations, an average of 270 movements per day. Itinerant aircraft movements broke down as follows: 41% general aviation, 35% scheduled commercial, 17% air taxi, and 8% military. A total of 230 aircraft were then based at this airport.

===Commercial aircraft===

In September 2020, typical commercial passenger traffic included Boeing 737s, Boeing 717s, Embraer 170s, Embraer 145s, CRJ 900s, CRJ700s, CRJ550s, and CRJ 200s models on about 128 takeoffs or landings daily. Currently, Delta Airlines operates the Boeing 737 and 717 to BHM. Southwest utilizes Boeing 737s for all flights. United Express (GoJet Airlines, Mesa Airlines, SkyWest Airlines, Republic Airways) operate the Embraer 170/175, Embraer 140/145, and the CRJ-550 for their flights. American Eagle (PSA Airlines, Envoy Air, Mesa Airlines, and SkyWest Airlines) operate the ERJ145, ERJ175, and CRJ700/900 family. Recently, American Airlines also offered service on the Airbus A320 to their hub at Dallas/Fort Worth. The CRJ700/900 family was the most common regional aircraft, being used by American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. The Canadair Regional Jets and ERJ 145 shared the second spot for regional jets, being utilized by the airlines above as well as American Eagle. Southern Airways Express formerly operated on-demand charter flights to select cities on the Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft (which was the only scheduled passenger service to BHM on turbo-prop aircraft). Mountain Air Cargo also operates daily flights to Memphis using the ATR-72 twin-turboprop aircraft on behalf of FedEx Express. FedEx operates their Boeing 757-200; while UPS uses their Boeing 767-300F as well as the Airbus A300-600F, these are the only wide-body aircraft to routinely use the airport. Numerous other aircraft are used for frequent charter flights. Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport is also a primary diversion airport for Atlanta Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport due to its 12,007 ft runway, which frequently brings brief but unique visitors.

===Military aircraft===
Sumpter Smith Air National Guard Base is located at the airport. It covers approximately 147 acres and essential facilities to support the mission of the 117th Air Refueling Wing (117 ARW), an Alabama Air National Guard unit operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), as well as its KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft.

The 117 ARW occupies 101 facilities including offices, mission support structures, maintenance hangars, a petroleum/oil/lubricants (POL) storage and refueling station, a joint Army and Air Force evacuation hospital, as well as 24/7 Security Forces, Fire Response, Base Defense Operations Center, and Base Command Post. The 117 ARW has nine KC-135R Stratotankers allotted among two squadrons the 106Th Air Refueling Squadron (ANG), and the 99Th Air Refueling Squadron (USAF). The current complement of personnel is over 300 full-time personnel, including military and civilian employees. This expands to over 1,300 personnel for Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekends and during activation.

The Alabama Army National Guard (AL ARNG) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) have facilities and units co-located on the base. Alabama Army Aviation Support Facility #2 provides aircraft hangar and maintenance facilities for companies of the 1st Battalion, 169th Aviation Regiment which operate CH-47D Chinook and UH-72A Lakota aircraft. The Armed Forces Reserve Center Buildings 1&amp;2 provide facilities for the 109th Evacuation Hospital, 20th Special Forces Group (1st Battalion), and a Detachment of the 450th Military Police Company (USAR). The (AL ARNG) Field Maintenance Shop #11(FMS-11) facility is also on base.

==Terminal and concourses==
BHM has one terminal building with three concourses, which opened on March 13, 2013 (Concourses A, B) and on August 14, 2014 (Concourse C). The landside terminal (the area before the security threshold) has two levels. The upper level has ticketing and check-in facilities, a business center, and a large function room. The lower level has baggage claim facilities, airline baggage offices, airport operations offices, and meeting rooms available for use. The airport has its own police force with offices on the lower level of the terminal. There are vending machines and ATMs throughout both levels, pre-security.

Terminal A referred to the former 1962 terminal, which was still in use as office space until it was closed in 2011. The former ConcourseB was closed in June 2011 and demolished alongside TerminalA for the first phase of the terminal modernization project to make way for two new concourses, AandB, which opened on March 13, 2013. ConcourseC was closed on March 13, 2013 upon completion of Concourses AandB. ConcourseC was not demolished, but was completely gutted and structurally modified, removing the rotunda at the end of the old concourse and changing the structure to make a rectangle shape with the same width from end to end. It then underwent an intensive remodel covering all aspects of the concourse, culminating in the opening of the concourse to flights on August 14, 2014.

There is a rental car facility in an annex on the ground floor of the parking deck. Eight rental car companies are housed within this facility. The airport offers a parking deck with over 5000 spaces available for hourly and daily parking. A remote lot is available for long term parking, with over 700 spaces. A shuttle runs between the terminal and the remote lot continuously throughout the day. There is a free cell phone waiting lot with a digital flight display for people waiting on arriving passengers.

Beginning in December 2015, Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority introduced two new express Airport Shuttle routes from downtown Birmingham hotels directly to the terminal. The shuttle routes operate hourly on Mondays through Saturdays and the fare is $5.00.

===Concourses===
A ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Concourse A and Concourse B took place on February 26, 2013. The new terminal officially opened for business on March 13, 2013. The new ConcourseC was completed along with the second half of the main terminal building and baggage claim upon the completion of the second and final phase of the terminal modernization project. A ribbon cutting ceremony for the ConcourseC and phase2 completion was held on August 11, 2014, and ConcourseC officially opened for arriving and departing flights on August 14, 2014.

Concourse A, which opened on March 13, 2013, consists of eight gates: A1–A8. It is used by Delta, Spirit, and American. It also contains U.S. Customs and Immigration facilities capable of processing arriving international aircraft. For international arrivals, a partition is closed, redirecting deplaning passengers down a separate corridor to the customs facility. After being processed, passengers proceed through one-way doors into the main arrival hall.

Concourse B, which opened on March 13, 2013, consists of five gates: B1–B5. It is used by American. Concourse C, which opened on August 14, 2014, consists of six gates: C1-C6. It is used by Southwest and United. Former Concourse B consisted of six gates, B1-B6. Prior to its closure and demolition, ConcourseB was used by Northwest/Northwest Airlink, American/American Eagle, Continental/Continental Express and US Airways Express. Northwest moved to ConcourseC in May 2009 and was merged into Delta a year later. American Airlines moved to ConcourseC on June 10, 2011; while US Airways and Continental moved to ConcourseC on June 24, 2011. ConcourseB was then closed and demolished in August 2011 to make way for the construction for future concourses AandB.

Former ConcourseC consisted of 13 gates, C1–C14. It was the only concourse at the airport in operation and in use during the first phase of the terminal modernization project. Therefore, all commercial and charter services used this concourse. ConcourseC was then closed when the new concourses AandB opened on March 13, 2013.

===Architecture===
The 1974 terminal was built in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a single curved terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large floor to ceiling plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the airside terminal face at a sharp angle between the old concourses BandC. On the airside of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.

Externally, Concourse C and Concourse B before their reconstruction were radically different from the terminal structure, consisting of straight radial spokes clad with white panels. ConcourseC included a circular end which invokes the appearance of the terminal, whereas ConcourseB terminated at a flat wall. The concourse walls had relatively few windows, typically at waiting and dining areas. The presence of multiple shops, restrooms and service areas reduced the need for windows in the concourses. Jetways were used for the majority of the gates and aircraft, though Delta Connection and United Express used stairs leading to the tarmac to board flights on regional jets (currently all flights at the new concourses use jetways). Passenger gates and services are on the second floor with airside baggage handling and aircraft servicing on the ground level.

The interior of the terminal was renovated in the early 1990s and completed in 1993 at a cost of $50.4 million which included new floor surfaces, lighting, wall coverings, renovated public spaces, and public art. The flooring was a mixture of carpet and large tiles, with tile primarily in the heavily used terminal spaces, dining areas, and restrooms. Numerous planters were positioned in hallways.

The new terminal and concourses completed in the 2010s feature open spaces and clean lines. There is abundant natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and large skylights. Neutral colors accented with soft blue and chrome are found throughout the terminal.

===Terminal expansion and modernization===
In 2014, the airport completed a $201.6 million terminal renovation project. This project included a major renovation and upgrade to the airport&#x27;s existing ConcourseC, which was dismantled down to its structural components and rebuilt. ConcourseB was completely demolished and new concourses AandB were built. All three concourses are now linked, allowing passengers to walk from ConcourseA, through to ConcourseC without exiting the secure area. The main terminal containing the ticketing and baggage claim areas has been completely gutted and remodelled. Additionally, there have been enhancements to the parking deck, allowing passengers to move between the terminal and the parking deck under cover and without navigating any stairs. There is now a single large security screening checkpoint with TSA PreCheck which provides access to all concourses. Many concessions and shopping, as well as US Customs and Border Protection offices have been added. A completely new integrated baggage screening system has been installed to handle the screening of checked luggage. The new terminal is said to be built with new efficient building standards, making it one of the greenest airports in the country. The first phase of construction was completed on February 26, 2013 with the entire modernization project completed in 2014, culminating in a ribbon cutting ceremony held on August, 7th 2014. The project team included KPS Group and KHAFRA (Architects &amp; Engineers), A.G. Gaston Construction (Project Management), Margaret Jones Interiors, LLC and Brasfield &amp; Gorrie and BLOC Global Services Group (Construction Management).

On March 22, 2013, a digital flight arrival/departure screen fixture, added as part of the 2013–2014 renovation, fell on a mother and her children, killing ten-year-old Luke Bresette and injuring his mother and two other siblings of Overland Park, Kansas. In September 2014, the Bresette family and companies involved in the installation of the display reached a wrongful death settlement. A bronze relief of Luke Bresette was installed in the landside Departures level near the location of the accident.

===Artwork displays===
Several pieces of artwork are displayed within the terminal and on the airport grounds. Approaching the airport along Messer Airport Boulevard, travelers pass a series of white three dimensional triangular shapes placed on raised posts along the shoulder and median of the roadway with a mid-span folded crease to suggest the wings of birds in flight or aircraft. In the 1990s terminal there were multiple pieces of art that became well known to frequent visitors to the airport. However, with the terminal modernisation project, most of these pieces were replaced with new, more modern, and in some cases, technologically advanced works. There are two unique major artwork displays in the terminal, both of which are in ConcourseB. The first major display is a living plant wall entitled &quot;Earth Wind and Water: The Landscape of Alabama&quot;. This living wall is the largest living wall inside any airport terminal in the United States. The wall is 100 feet wide, 14 feet high, and contains 1,400 square feet of vegetated area. The second major work of art is an electronic display which is approximately 50 feet long and made up of 26 large format electronic LCD displays. The displays contain pictures and video clips which are linked to form an ever-changing moving wall depicting various &quot;stories&quot; focussing on African American history and civil rights.
An art program at the airport puts on display revolving collections of works throughout the terminal. The program includes works from local artists as well as artists from around the country. In addition there is a rotating Barber Motorsports exhibit on the lower level near the baggage claim. This exhibit features frequently changing displays containing various automobiles and race memorabilia such as driving suits and mounted steering wheels from famous race cars. There are many smaller works of art throughout the terminal, both pre and post-security. The airport website has an updated list of the various works of art on display.

===Airport amenities===
There are a range of dining and shopping options in the terminal, both pre and post-security. The airport features free Wi-Fi internet access throughout the terminal.

In 2014, Yahoo Travel ranked the airport as the 49th out of 72 on a list of &quot;Every Important U.S. Airport, Ranked by Its Food and Drink.&quot;

==Airlines and destinations==

As of January 2023, the top five markets served non-stop from Birmingham are Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Charlotte, Houston, and Denver. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines serve Birmingham with mainline, narrowbody aircraft. Regional airlines provide a large share of daily air carrier service to Birmingham. The most common aircraft serving the airport are the Bombardier CRJ700 / CRJ900, the Embraer E-175, the Boeing 717, the Boeing 737 family, and the Airbus A319/A320.

===Passenger===
===Cargo===
Currently, FedEx Express operates daily, weekday service to Memphis with a Boeing 757-200F, along with an ATR-72, operated by Mountain Air Cargo. UPS Airlines operates daily, weekday service to Louisville. On Friday nights, instead of a direct flight to Louisville, UPS Airlines sends a Boeing 767-300F from New Orleans to BHM before continuing onto Louisville. On Saturday mornings, UPS Airlines sends an Airbus A300-600F from Louisville to Birmingham, which then continues on to Pensacola. In April 2023, Kuehne+Nagel began twice weekly flights from Stuttgart, Germany to Birmingham, primarily to support the central Alabama automotive manufacturing industry. The flights are operated by Atlas Air using a Boeing 747-8F. Instead of returning to Stuttgart, the aircraft repositions to Hong Kong, with a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska. Also in April 2023, Air Atlanta Icelandic began operating flights between Liège, Belgium and BHM using Boeing 747-400F aircraft. The return flight stops in Atlanta before continuing on to Liège.

==Accidents and incidents==
* A fatal Part 121 (Air Carrier) accident occurred: the crash of Pennsylvania Central Airlines (a United Airlines predecessor) Flight 105 on January 6, 1946. The DC-3 landed on Runway 18 and continued off the end of the runway into Village Creek. Three crew members sustained fatal injuries as a result of the accident.

* On August 14, 2013, UPS Airlines Flight 1354, N155UP, an Airbus A300-600, crashed in an open field on approach to Runway 18, killing both the pilot and co-pilot.

* Two Part 135 (Air Taxi &amp; Commuter) accidents have occurred since 1962 which resulted in fatalities. The most significant accident was the crash of L&#x27;Express Airlines Flight 508 on July 10, 1991, with 13 people killed. Eight fatal General Aviation accidents have occurred at or in the vicinity of Birmingham International Airport since 1962, including a flight line ground accident.
* On November 10, 1972, Southern Airways Flight 49 was hijacked shortly after departing Birmingham for Montgomery on its multi-stop journey to Miami, Florida. All passengers and crew were safety released and the hijackers arrested over the two-day event, which is particularly notable as it led to the requirement that U.S. airline passengers be physically screened before boarding, beginning January 5, 1973.

==Controversy==
In September 2013, Atlanta-based ExpressJet Airlines, the then largest regional US passenger airline, told its pilots to avoid landing on Runway 18, following the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 1354 in Birmingham. An internal review following the accident concluded planes come &quot;dangerously close&quot; to nearby hills if even a few feet too low, that there is a significant &quot;terrain threat&quot; and a non-standard glide path. An aviation safety expert said the runway is &quot;absolutely&quot; safe.

==Cultural references==
A music video for contemporary Christian musician Brandon Heath&#x27;s song &quot;Give Me Your Eyes&quot; was filmed over the night of July 23–24, 2008 at the airport after most flights had landed for the night. It was directed by the Erwin Brothers and premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on August 23, 2008.

<doc id="291387" wikidata="Q1264490" url="?curid=291387" title="Duke of Albany">
<text>Duke of Albany is a peerage title that has occasionally been bestowed on younger sons in the Scottish and later the British royal family, particularly in the Houses of Stuart and Hanover.

==History==
The Dukedom of Albany was first granted in 1398 by King Robert III of Scotland on his brother, Robert Stewart, the title being in the Peerage of Scotland. &quot;Albany&quot; was a broad territorial term representing the parts of Scotland north of the River Forth, roughly the former Kingdom of the Picts. The title (along with the Dukedom of Rothesay) was one of the first two dukedoms created in Scotland. It passed to Robert&#x27;s son Murdoch Stewart, and was forfeited in 1425 due to the attainder of Murdoch.

The title was again created in 1458 for Alexander Stewart but was forfeit in 1483. His son John Stewart was restored to the second creation in 1515 but died without heirs in 1536. In 1541 Robert, second son of James V of Scotland, was styled Duke of Albany, but he died at less than a month old. The fourth creation, along with the Earldom of Ross and Lordship of Ardmannoch, was for Mary, Queen of Scots&#x27; king consort Lord Darnley, whose son, later James VI of Scotland, I of England and Ireland, inherited the titles on his death. That creation merged with the Scottish crown upon James&#x27;s ascension. The title, along with the title of Duke of York, with which it has since been traditionally coupled, was created for a fifth time in 1604 for Charles, son of James VI and I. Upon Charles&#x27;s ascent to the throne in 1625, the title of Duke of Albany merged once again in the crowns.

The title was next granted in 1660 to Charles I&#x27;s son, James, by Charles II. When James succeeded his elder brother to the throne in 1685, the titles again merged into the crown. The cities of New York and Albany, New York, were thus both named after James, as he was the Duke of York and of Albany. The pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, gave the title Duchess of Albany to his illegitimate daughter Charlotte; she died in 1789.

The title &quot;Duke of York and Albany&quot; was granted three times by the Hanoverian kings.
The title of &quot;Albany&quot; alone was granted for the fifth time, this time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, in 1881 to Prince Leopold, the fourth son of Queen Victoria. Prince Leopold&#x27;s son, Prince Charles Edward (who had succeeded as reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900), was deprived of the peerage in 1919 for bearing arms against the United Kingdom in World War I. His grandson, Ernst Leopold (1935–1996), only son of Charles Edward&#x27;s eldest son Johann Leopold, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1906–1972), sometimes used the title &quot;Duke of Albany&quot;, although the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 stipulates that any successor of a suspended peer shall be restored to the peerage only by direction of the sovereign, the successor&#x27;s petition for restoration having been submitted for and obtained a satisfactory review of the appropriate Privy Council committee.

==Dukes of Albany in fiction==
* Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; includes Fergus, the Duke of Albany, who tries to claim the British throne after Gorboduc&#x27;s death through his royal descent.
*William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, set in no particular century, includes as a major character the Duke of Albany, who is husband to Lear&#x27;s daughter Goneril.
*In the 2001 film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;, Hugh Jackman plays &quot;Leopold Mountbatten, Duke of Albany,&quot; who holds the title in 1876, making him a fictional analogue of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, who held the title at that time. However, the surname Mountbatten is an anachronism, as the equivalent family at the time would have been called Battenberg.

<doc id="291388" wikidata="Q1290138" url="?curid=291388" title="Albanian National Awakening">
<text>The Albanian National Awakening ( or ), commonly known as the Albanian Renaissance or Albanian Revival, is a period throughout the 19th and 20th century of a cultural, political, and social movement in the Albanian history where the Albanian people gathered strength to establish an independent cultural and political life, as well as the country of Albania.
Prior to the rise of nationalism, Albania remained under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for almost five centuries and the Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or institutional national conscience by the Albanian people. There is some debate among experts regarding when the Albanian nationalist movement should be considered to have started. Some sources attribute its origins to the revolts against centralisation in the 1830s, others to the publication of the first attempt by Naum Veqilharxhi at a standardized alphabet for Albanian in 1844, or to the collapse of the League of Prizren during the Eastern Crisis in 1881. Various compromise positions between these three theses have also emerged, such as one view positing that Albanian nationalism had foundations that dated earlier but &quot;consolidated&quot; as a movement during the Eastern Crisis (1878–1881). 

Another view is that Albanian nationalism&#x27;s roots &quot;sprouted&quot; in the reforms of the first decades of the 19th century, and that Albanian nationalism emerged properly in the 1830s and 1840s, when it was a romantic movement for societal reform that was initially mainly driven by Albanians publishing from abroad; it transformed into an overt political national movement in the 1870s. On 20 December 1912, the Conference of Ambassadors in London recognized an independent Albania within its present-day borders.

==Background==

===1831–1878===
After the fall of the Yanina Pashalik, the power and influence of the Albanian beys had faded. The remaining beys thus attempted to restore their rule. An assembly was held in Berat in 1828. In this Convention, the leaders were Zylyftar Poda and Shahin bej Delvina. The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent the rise of local beys, which presented a menace to centralised power. In 1830, the Sublime Porte sent an expeditionary force under the command of Reşid Mehmed Pasha to suppress the local Albanian beys. On hearing the news of the Ottoman forces&#x27; arrival, the three most powerful local chiefs, Zylyftar Poda, accompanied by the remains of Ali Pasha&#x27;s faction, Veli Bey (whose power base was around Yannina), and Arslan Bey, along with other less powerful beys, began to prepare their forces to resist a probable Ottoman attack. Realising the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a general uprising, Reşid Mehmed Pasha invited the Albanian beys to a meeting on the pretext that they would be rewarded for their loyalty to the Porte. The beys however, were all killed along with their guards.

The last Albanian pashalik to fall was the Scutari Pashalik. The Bushati dynasty rule ended when an Ottoman army under Mehmed Reshid Pasha besieged the Rozafa Castle and forced Mustafa Reshiti to surrender (1831). The Albanian defeat ended a planned alliance between the Albanian beys and the Bosnian nobility, who were similarly seeking autonomy. Instead of the &quot;pashalik&quot;, the &quot;vilayet&quot;s of Scutari and that of Kosovo were created.

=== Early revolts ===
By removing the Timar system, the Sublime Porte intended to strengthen its central government and reclaim the power of the Empire which had been severely weakened due to economic and social backwardness, from the exploitative system and from the ongoing uprisings of peoples. Reforms began to be implemented in Albania since the 1830s. They gave a blow to the ranks of the old military feudal class which had been weakened from Ottoman expeditions from 1822 to 1831. Parts of the feudal heads that had launched revolts were eliminated, others were exiled and those who could, had escaped from the country. All their properties were declared state-owned. This gave rise to new landowners who had connections to the Sublime Porte. Due to the Ottoman occupation, the ideology of Nationalism developed with difficulty and was limited in Albanian-inhabited territories in the Balkan. They found more favorable development conditions outside, in the capital of the Empire, Istanbul, Italy, other Balkan countries etc. The national ideas became apparent via popular uprisings against the Tanzimat reforms, but they still did not reach a period to be formulated in full policy of the National Movement. They were more expressed with literary works and studies of the Albanian people, history, language and culture. In their writings, the Rilindas fought to invoke feelings of love for the country by exalting patriotic traditions and episodes of history, especially that of the Skanderbeg era and folk culture; They devoted a lot of attention to native language and Albanian schools as a means to affirm individuality and national vindication.

The centralising reforms of the Ottoman government were implemented immediately with the deployment of civil and military personnel in Albania. This was met with resistance by the local population which first began with the refusal to execute orders and quickly transformed into armed rebellion. After two local uprisings that burst in the beginning of 1833 in Kolonjë and in Dibër were repressed, uprisings occurred in Berat-Vlorë-Delvinë-Çamëria area in larger scales than before. The actions of the Ottoman army were driven by terror and increased unhappiness in the local population, who were aptly anticipated to revolt again. Fugitive agitators circulated across the provinces to organise further rebellions, calling on the people to prepare for war. Others were sent to neighbouring provinces to secure their presence by pointing out they are &quot;brothers.&quot; To get ahead of the danger Of the new outbreak of popular hate, at the beginning of 1844, the Ottoman authorities urged urgent action. They concentrated large military forces at various points, especially in Bitola where the state was worse. By the end of March 1844, the new uprising erupted but was suppressed.

In the ensuing years there were bursts of armed insurrections throughout Albania against the Ottoman centralising reforms, and especially against the burden of the new taxes imposed and against the obligatory military service. But, at the same time and within the bosom of these insurrections, preliminary national claims started to spread. These claims came forth especially in the revolt of 1847, which assumed great proportions in two zones of Southern Albania: in the Gjirokastra region led by Zenel Gjoleka and in that of Berat led by Rapo Hekali.

=== Formation ===


There is some debate among experts regarding when the Albanian nationalist movement should be considered to have started. Some sources attribute its origins to the revolts against centralization in the 1830s, others to the publication of the first attempt by Naum Veqilharxhi at a standardized alphabet for Albanian in 1844, or to the collapse of the League of Prizren during the Eastern Crisis in 1881. Various compromise positions between these three theses have also emerged, such as one view positing that Albanian nationalism had foundations that dated earlier but &quot;consolidated&quot; as a movement during the Eastern Crisis (1878–1881). Another view is that Albanian nationalism&#x27;s roots &quot;sprouted&quot; in the reforms of the first decades of the 19th century but Albanian nationalism emerged properly in the 1830s and 1840s as a romantic movement for societal reform that was initially mainly driven by Albanians publishing from a broad, and it transformed into an overt political national movement in the 1870s. According to the view that the Rilindja evolved in the 1870s, because of religious ties of the Albanian majority of the population with the ruling Ottomans and the lack of an Albanian state in past, nationalism was less developed and the national movement was greatly delayed among Albanians in the 19th century compared to neighbouring southeast European nations, such as the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and Romanians. The Rilindja was a continuation of the Albanian revolts and cultural activities for independence that took place during the entire Ottoman period. The centralist Tanzimat reforms, which were aimed at replacing local Albanian functionaries and suppression of Albanian culture sowed the seeds of the Rilindja. In that period an intellectual and merchant class with the new ideas that were emerging in Europe was shaped, empowering the existing struggle against the Ottoman rule. Political nationalism and economic liberalism were two modern platforms that inspired many Albanian intellectuals.

The French Revolution left a socio-economic impact on the Albanian society, with many Albanian intellectuals highlighting ideals of the Revolution and important figures such as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During that time, the destruction of the Pashalik of Yanina and the growing Greek nationalist ambitions fueled reaction among the Albanian intellectual elite. The son of one merchant family, Naum Veqilharxhi, started his work to write an alphabet intended to help Albanians overcome religious and political issues in 1824 or 1825. Veqilharxhi thought that the continuous occupations had caused many problems to Albanian education. His work facilitated the diffusion of national awareness based on the unity of kin, identity of language and traditions. Some Albanian patriots, among them many from the Arbëreshë communities in Italy, built contacts with Italian democratic and revolutionary forces. This helped the Rilindja movement to expand beyond the frame of Albanian-Ottoman relations, and become an international issue. The Risorgimento actually served as an inspiration for the movement. The 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula. The Albanians&#x27; fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece fueled the rise of the Albanian national movement.

The first postwar treaty, the abortive Treaty of San Stefano signed on March 3, 1878, assigned Albanian-populated lands to Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom blocked the arrangement because it awarded Russia a predominant position in the Balkans and thereby upset the European balance of power. A peace conference to settle the dispute was held later in the year in Berlin.

The Treaty of San Stefano triggered profound anxiety among the Albanians meanwhile, and it spurred their leaders to organize a defense of the lands they inhabited. In the spring of 1878, influential Albanians in Constantinople—including Abdyl Frashëri, one of the first political ideologues of the &quot;National Revival&quot;-organized a secret committee to direct the Albanians&#x27; resistance. In May the group called for a general meeting of representatives from all the Albanian-populated lands. On June 10, 1878, about eighty delegates, mostly Muslim religious leaders, clan chiefs, and other influential people from the four Albanian-populated Ottoman vilayets, met in Prizren. The delegates declared the formation of the League of Prizren which consisted of two branches: the Prizren branch and the southern branch. The Prizren branch was led by Iljas Dibra and it had representatives from the areas of Kirçova (Kicevo), Kalkandelen (Tetovo), Pristine (Pristina), Mitroviça (Mitrovica), Viçitirin (Vushtrri), Üsküp (Skopje), Gilan (Gjilan), Manastir (Bitola), Debar (Debar) and Gostivar. The southern branch, led by Abdyl Frashëri consisted of sixteen representatives from the areas of Kolonjë, Korçë, Arta, Berat, Parga, Gjirokastër, Përmet, Paramythia, Filiates, Margariti, Vlorë, Tepelenë and Delvinë. The League of Prizren was set under the direction of a central committee that had the power to impose taxes and raise an army. The League of Prizren worked to gain autonomy for the Albanians and to thwart implementation of the Treaty of San Stefano, but not to create an independent Albania. The participants wanted to return to the status quo before the start of Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The main aim was to defend from immediate dangers. Among other things the League requested an official status for the Albanian language in the Albanian-inhabited territories and the foundation of Albanian schools.

At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League of Prizren, but the Sublime Porte pressed the delegates to declare themselves to be first and foremost Ottomans rather than Albanians. Some delegates supported this position and advocated emphasizing Muslim solidarity and the defense of Muslim lands, including present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other representatives, under Frashëri&#x27;s leadership, focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and creating a sense of Albanian identity that would cut across religious and tribal lines. Because conservative Muslims constituted a majority of the representatives, the League of Prizren supported maintenance of Ottoman suzerainty.
In July 1878, the league sent a memorandum to the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin, which was called to settle the unresolved problems of Turkish War, demanding that all Albanians be united in a single autonomous Ottoman province. The Congress of Berlin ignored the league&#x27;s memorandum. The congress ceded to Montenegro the cities of Bar and Podgorica and areas around the mountain towns of Gusinje and Plav, which Albanian leaders considered Albanian territory. Serbia also gained some Albanian-inhabited lands. The Albanians, the vast majority loyal to the empire, vehemently opposed the territorial losses. Albanians also feared the possible occupation of Epirus by Greece. The League of Prizren organized armed resistance efforts in Gusinje, Plav, Scutari, Prizren, Preveza, and Ioannina. A border tribesman at the time described the frontier as &quot;floating on blood.&quot;

In August 1878, the Congress of Berlin ordered a commission to trace a border between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro. The congress also directed Greece and the Ottoman Empire to negotiate a solution to their border dispute. The Great Powers expected the Ottomans to ensure that the Albanians would respect the new borders, ignoring that the sultan&#x27;s military forces were too weak to enforce any settlement and that the Ottomans could only benefit by the Albanians&#x27; resistance. The Sublime Porte, in fact, armed the Albanians and allowed them to levy taxes, and when the Ottoman army withdrew from areas awarded to Montenegro under the Treaty of Berlin, Roman Catholic Albanian tribesmen simply took control. The Albanians&#x27; successful resistance to the treaty forced the Great Powers to alter the border, returning Gusinje and Plav to the Ottoman Empire and granting Montenegro the Albanian-populated coastal town of Ulcinj. There the Albanians refused to surrender as well. Finally, the Great Powers blockaded Ulcinj by sea and pressured the Ottoman authorities to bring the Albanians under control. The Great Powers decided in 1881 to cede Greece only Thessaly and the district of Arta.

Faced with growing international pressure &quot;to pacify&quot; the refractory Albanians, the sultan dispatched a large army under Dervish Turgut Pasha to suppress the League of Prizren and deliver Ulcinj to Montenegro. Albanians loyal to the empire supported the Sublime Porte&#x27;s military intervention. In April 1881, Dervish Pasha&#x27;s 10,000 men captured Prizren and later crushed the resistance at Ulcinj. The League of Prizren&#x27;s leaders and their families were arrested and deported. Frashëri, who originally received a death sentence, was imprisoned until 1885 and exiled until his death seven years later. In the three years it survived, the League of Prizren effectively made the Great Powers aware of the Albanian people and their national interests. Montenegro and Greece received much less Albanian-populated territory than they would have won without the league&#x27;s resistance.

Formidable barriers frustrated Albanian leaders&#x27; efforts to instill in their people an Albanian rather than an Ottoman identity. Divided into four vilayets, Albanians had no common geographical or political nerve centre. The Albanians&#x27; religious differences forced nationalist leaders to give the national movement a purely secular character that alienated religious leaders. The most significant factor uniting the Albanians, their spoken language, lacked a standard literary form and even a standard alphabet. Each of the three available choices, the Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts, implied different political and religious orientations opposed by one or another element of the population. In 1878 there were no Albanian-language schools in the most developed of the Albanian-inhabited areas and the choice for education was between Orthodox Church schools, where education was in Greek and Ottoman government schools where education was in Turkish.

The Ottoman Empire continued to crumble after the Congress of Berlin and Sultan Abdül Hamid II resorted to repression to maintain order. The authorities strove without success to control the political situation in the empire&#x27;s Albanian-populated lands, arresting suspected nationalist activists. When the sultan refused Albanian demands for unification of the four Albanian-populated vilayets, Albanian leaders reorganized the League of Prizren and incited uprisings that brought the Albanian-populated lands, especially Kosovo, to near anarchy. The imperial authorities disbanded a successor organisation &quot;Besa-Besë&quot; (League of Peja) founded in 1897, executed its president Haxhi Zeka in 1902, and banned Albanian-language books and correspondence. In Macedonia, where Bulgarian-, Greek-, and Serbian-backed guerrillas were fighting Ottoman authorities and one another for control, Muslim Albanians suffered attacks, and Albanian guerrilla groups retaliated. Albanian leaders meeting in Bitola during 1905 established the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania. In 1905, priest Kristo Negovani who had attained Albanian national sentiments abroad returned to his native village of Negovan and introduced the Albanian language for the first time in Orthodox liturgy. For his efforts Negovani was killed by a Greek guerilla band on orders from Bishop Karavangelis of Kastoria that aroused a nationalist response with the Albanian guerilla band of Bajo Topulli killing the Metropolitan of Korçë, Photios.

In 1906 opposition groups in the Ottoman Empire emerged, one of which evolved into the Committee of Union and Progress, more commonly known as the Young Turks, which proposed restoring constitutional government in Constantinople, by revolution if necessary. In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in Kosovo and Macedonia escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abdül Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in Bitola in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abdül Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople&#x27;s control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the &quot;bastinado&quot;, or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians&#x27; unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet.

The Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks&#x27; campaign to &quot;Ottomanise&quot; them by force. New Albanian uprisings began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro held ambitions of future expansion into neighbouring Albanian-populated lands and supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets.

=== Revolts of 1910 and 1911===

In 1910, due to the new centralisation policies of the Young Turk Ottoman government towards Albanians, local Albanian leaders Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi started an uprising against the Ottomans in the Kosovo vilayet. After subduing the Ottoman garrisons in towns such as Prishtina and Ferizaj, the Ottoman government declared martial law and sent a military expedition of 16,000 men led by Shefket Turgut Pasha. Simultaneously, forces under Idriz Seferi captured the Kaçanik pass. They successfully defended the pass from the Ottoman expeditionary force thus, forcing them to send a force of 40,000 men. After two weeks the pass was lost to the Ottomans After fierce fighting, the rebels retreated to Drenica and the Ottomans seized control of Prizren, Gjakova and Peja Afterwards Ottoman forces incurred into Northern Albania and Macedonia. Ottoman forces were stopped for more than 20 days in the Agri Pass, from the Albanian forces of Shalë, Shoshë, Nikaj and Mërtur areas, led by Prel Tuli, Mehmet Shpendi, and Marash Delia. Unable to repress their resistance, this column took another way to Scutari, passing from the Pukë region. On July 24, 1910, Ottoman forces entered the city of Scutari. During this period martial courts were put in action and summary executions took place. A large number of firearms were collected and many villages and properties were burned by the Ottoman army.

In 1911, the Albanian National Committee was formed. In a meeting of the committee held in Podgorica from 2 to 4 February 1911, under the leadership of Nikolla bey Ivanaj and Sokol Baci Ivezaj, it was decided to organise an Albanian uprising. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirditë chieftains on 26/27 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania (according to Robert Elsie it was raised for the first time after Skanderbeg&#x27;s death) and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkodër on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels (except for Malësor chieftains) if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. After months of intense fighting, the rebels were trapped and decided to escape to Montenegro.

On 23 June 1911, in the village of Gerče, in Montenegro, an assembly of the tribal leaders of the revolt was held to adopt the &quot;Greçë Memorandum&quot;. This memorandum was signed by 22 Albanian chieftains, four from each tribe of Hoti, Grudë and Skrel, five from Kastrati, three from Klemendi and two from Shalë.

Requests of the memorandum included:

# general amnesty for all participants in the revolt
# demand for recognition of the Albanian ethnicity
# election of the deputies of Albanian ethnicity for the Ottoman Parliament according to the proportional system
# Albanian language in schools
# governor and other appointed high officials have to know Albanian language and all other positions in the administration have to be reserved only for people of Albanian ethnicity
# men who are ethnic Albanians to serve army only in Albania during the peacetime
# confiscated arms to be returned
# all Albanian property damaged by Ottoman troops to be compensated
The Memorandum was submitted to the representatives of Great Powers in Cetinje, Montenegro.

Ottoman representatives managed to deal with the leaders of Albanian rebels in Kosovo Vilayet and Scutari Vilayet separately, because they were not united and lacked central control. The Ottomans promised to meet most Albanian demands, limited mainly to Catholic highlanders like general amnesty, the opening of Albanian language schools, and the restriction that military service was to be performed only in the territory of the vilayets with substantial Albanian population. Other demands included requiring administrative officers to learn the Albanian language, and that the possession of weapons would be permitted.

=== Revolts of 1912 ===


The Albanian Revolt of 1912 was one of many Albanian revolts in the Ottoman Empire and lasted from January until August 1912. Albanian soldiers and officers deserted the Ottoman military service and joined the insurgents. After a series of successes, Albanian revolutionaries managed to capture the city of Skopje, the administrative centre of Kosovo vilayet within the Ottoman rule.

On August 9, 1912, Albanian rebels presented a new list of demands (the so-called list of &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;), related to the Albanian vilayet, that can be summarized as follows:
* autonomous system of administration and justice of four vilayets populated with Albanians (Albanian vilayet)
* Albanians to perform military service only in territory of four vilayets populated with Albanians, except in time of war
* employing officials who know local language and customs, but not necessarily Albanians,
* establishment of new licees and agricultural schools in the bigger districts
* reorganisation and modernisation of the religious schools and use of Albanian language in secular schools
* freedom to establish private schools and societies
* the development of trade, agriculture and public works
* general amnesty for all Albanians involved in revolt
* court martial for those Ottoman officers who attempted to suppress the revolt

The revolt ended when the Ottoman government agreed to fulfill the rebels&#x27; demands, except of the last one, on September 4, 1912. The autonomous system of administration and justice of the four vilayets with a substantial Albanian population was accepted by the Ottoman Empire, however they avoided granting autonomy to a unitary Albanian vilayet which was part of the Albanian National Awakening agenda during the League of Prizren.

=== Independence ===


The First Balkan War, however, erupted before a final settlement could be worked out. The Balkan allies—Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Greece—quickly drove the Ottomans to the walls of Constantinople. The Montenegrins surrounded Scutari.

An assembly of Muslim and Christian leaders meeting in Vlorë in November 1912 declared Albania an independent country. The complete text of the declaration was:
In Vlora, on the 15th/28th of November. That time the President was Ismail Kemal Bey, in which he spoke of the great perils facing Albania today, the delegates have all decided unanimously that Albania, as of today, should be on her own, free and independent.

A second session of the Assembly of Vlorë was held on December 4, 1912. During that session members of the assembly established the Provisional Government of Albania. It was a government that consisted of ten members, led by Ismail Qemali until his resignation on 22 January 1914. The Assembly established the Senate () with an advisory role to the government, consisting of 18 members of the Assembly. An ambassadorial conference that opened in London in December decided the major questions concerning the Albanians after the First Balkan War in its concluding Treaty of London of May 1913. The Albanian delegation in London was assisted by Aubrey Herbert, MP, a passionate advocate of their cause.

One of Serbia&#x27;s primary war aims was to gain an Adriatic port, preferably Durrës. Austria-Hungary and Italy opposed giving Serbia an outlet to the Adriatic, which they feared would become a Russian port. They instead supported the creation of an autonomous Albania. Russia backed Serbia&#x27;s and Montenegro&#x27;s claims to Albanian-inhabited lands. Britain and Germany remained neutral. Chaired by Britain&#x27;s foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, the ambassadors&#x27; conference initially decided to create an autonomous Albania under continued Ottoman rule, but with the protection of the Great Powers. This solution, as detailed in the Treaty of London, was abandoned in the summer of 1913 when it became obvious that the Ottoman Empire would, in the Second Balkan War, lose Macedonia and hence its overland connection with the Albanian-inhabited lands.

In July 1913, the Great Powers opted to recognise an independent, neutral Albanian state ruled by a constitutional monarchy and under the protection of the Great Powers. The August 1913 Treaty of Bucharest established that independent Albania was a country with borders that gave the new state about 28,000 square kilometres of territory and a population of 800,000. Montenegro had to surrender Scutari after having lost 10,000 men in the process of taking the town. Serbia reluctantly succumbed to an ultimatum from Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy to withdraw from northern Albania. The treaty, however, left large areas with majority Albanian populations, notably Kosovo and western Macedonia, outside the new state and failed to solve the region&#x27;s nationality problems.

== Culture ==

=== Arts ===


The Albanian Renaissance is one of the most valuable periods in Albanian culture, a period characterised by a cultural, economic, political and social flourishing of Albanian consciousness within the Ottoman Empire. The period is directly connected with Jorgji Panariti and Kolë Idromeno, the most renowned representatives of the Albanian Renaissance.
=== Literature ===


Albanian intellectuals in the nineteenth century began devising a single, standard Albanian literary language and making demands that it be used in schools. In Constantinople in 1879, Sami Frashëri founded a cultural and educational organization, the Society for the Printing of Albanian Writings, whose membership comprised Muslim, Catholic, and Orthodox Albanians. Naim Frashëri, the most-renowned Albanian poet, joined the society and wrote and edited textbooks. Albanian émigrés in Bulgaria, Egypt, Italy, Romania, and the United States supported the society&#x27;s work. The Greeks, who dominated the education of Orthodox Albanians, joined the Turks in suppressing the Albanians&#x27; culture, especially Albanian-language education. In 1886 the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople threatened to excommunicate anyone found reading or writing Albanian, and priests taught that God would not understand prayers uttered in Albanian. In 1844-5 however, Albanian intellectual Naum Veqilharxhi published his work &quot;Evëtori Shqip Fort i Shkurtër&quot; (English: The short Albanian Evëtor) which was an alphabet that included thirty three letters which were invented by himself. He avoided the use of Latin, Greek or Arabic alphabets and characters because of their religious associations and divisions. In November 1869, a Commission for the Alphabet of the Albanian Language was gathered in Istanbul.

One of its members was Kostandin Kristoforidhi and the main purpose of the Commission was the creation of a unique alphabet for all the Albanians. In January 1870 the Commission ended its work of the standardization of the alphabet, which was mainly in Latin letters. A plan on the creation of textbooks and spread of Albanian schools was drafted. However this plan was not realized, because the Ottoman Government wouldn&#x27;t finance the expenses for the establishment of such schools. Although this commission had gathered and delivered an alphabet in 1870, the writers from the North still used the Latin-based alphabet, whereas in Southern Albania writers used mostly the Greek letters. The turning point was the aftermath of the League of Prizren (1878) events when in 1879 Sami Frashëri and Naim Frashëri formed the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings. Members of the society Sami Frashëri, Naim Frashëri and Jani Vreto published the &quot;Primer of the Albanian language&quot; and other works in Albanian that dealt with the humanities, natural sciences and so on. After a long time struggling with obstacles coming from the Ottoman authorities, the first secular school of Albanian language was opened on the initiative of individual teachers and other intellectuals on 7 March 1887 in Korce. Diamanti Tërpo, a citizen of the city, offered her house to serve as a school building. The first director and teacher of the school was Pandeli Sotiri.

One year earlier, the Albanian dictionary &quot;(Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe)&quot; by Kostandin Kristoforidhi had been published in 1904. The dictionary had been drafted 25 years before its publication and was written in the Greek alphabet. In 1908, the Congress of Monastir was held by Albanian intellectuals in Bitola (in modern-day North Macedonia). The Congress was hosted by the &quot;Bashkimi&quot; (unity) club, and prominent delegates included Gjergj Fishta, Ndre Mjeda, Mit&#x27;hat Frashëri, Sotir Peçi, Shahin Kolonja, and Gjergj D. Qiriazi. There was much debate and the contending alphabets were &quot;Istanbul&quot;, &quot;Bashkimi&quot; and &quot;Agimi&quot;. However, the Congress was unable to make a clear decision and opted for a compromise solution of using both the widely used &quot;Istanbul&quot;, with minor changes, and a modified version of the Bashkimi alphabet. Usage of the alphabet of Istanbul declined rapidly and it was essentially extinct over the following decades. The Bashkimi alphabet is at the origin of the official alphabet of the Albanian language in use today.

A major role during the Albanian National Awakening was played by literature, which served to many &quot;Rilindas&quot; as a way to express their ideas. It was imbued with the spirit of national liberation, with the nostalgia of the émigré and the rhetorical pathos of past heroic wars. This literary school developed the poetry most. Regarding the motifs and poetical forms, its hero was the ethical man, the fighting Albanian, and to a lesser degree the tragic man. Because its major purpose was to awaken national consciousness it was closely linked with the folklore tradition.

<doc id="291399" wikidata="Q1114821" url="?curid=291399" title="Citizens' assemblies of the Roman Republic">
<text>The legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic were political institutions in the ancient Roman Republic. According to the contemporary historian Polybius, it was the people (and thus the assemblies) who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of Roman laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Under the Constitution of the Roman Republic, the people (and thus the assemblies) held the ultimate source of sovereignty.

Since the Romans used a form of direct democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each assembly. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than to cast a vote. Each assembly was presided over by a single Roman Magistrate, and as such, it was the presiding magistrate who made all decisions on matters of procedure and legality. Ultimately, the presiding magistrate&#x27;s power over the assembly was nearly absolute. The only check on that power came in the form of vetoes handed down by other magistrates.

In the Roman system of direct democracy, two primary types of gatherings were used to vote on legislative, electoral, and judicial matters. The first was the Assembly (&quot;comitia&quot;), which was a gathering that was deemed to represent the entire Roman people, even if it did not contain all of the Roman citizens or, like the &quot;comitia curiata&quot;, excluded a particular class of Roman citizens (the plebs). The second was the Council (&quot;concilium&quot;), which was a gathering of citizens of a specific class. In contrast, the Convention was an unofficial forum for communication. Conventions were simply forums where Romans met for specific unofficial purposes, such as, for example, to hear a political speech. Voters always assembled first into Conventions to hear debates and conduct other business before voting, and then into Assemblies or Councils to actually vote.

== Assembly procedure ==
There were no set dates to hold assemblies, but notice had to be given beforehand if the assembly was to be considered formal. Elections had to be announced 17 days before the election took place. Likewise, 17 days had to pass between the proposal of legislation and its enactment by an assembly. 
In addition to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who would be available to help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a &quot;Plebeian Tribune&quot;. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.

On the day of the vote, the electors first assembled into their conventions for debate and campaigning. In the Conventions, the electors were not sorted into their respective units (&quot;curia&quot;, &quot;centuries&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot;). Speeches from private citizens were only heard if the issue to be voted upon was a legislative or judicial matter. If the purpose of the ultimate vote was for an election, no speeches from private citizens were heard, and instead, the candidates for office used the Convention to campaign. During the Convention, the bill to be voted upon was read to the assembly by an officer known as a &quot;Herald&quot;. Then, if the assembly was composed of Tribes, the order of the vote had to be determined. A Plebeian Tribune could use his veto against pending legislation until the point when the order of the vote was determined.

The electors were then told to break up the Convention and assemble into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.

If a law was passed in violation of proper procedures (such as failing to wait 17 days before voting on a law), the Senate could declare the law nonbinding.

==Assembly of the Curiae==
The &quot;Curiate Assembly&quot; (&quot;comitia curiata&quot;) was the principal assembly during the first two decades of the Roman Republic. The Curiate Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council even though only patricians were members. During these first decades, the People of Rome were organized into thirty units called &quot;Curiae&quot;. The Curiae were ethnic in nature, and thus were organized on the basis of the early Roman family, or, more specifically, on the basis of the thirty original &quot;Patrician&quot; (aristocratic) clans. The Curiae assembled into the Curiate Assembly, for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The Curiate Assembly passed laws, elected &quot;Consuls&quot; (the only elected magistrates at the time), and tried judicial cases. Consuls always presided over the assembly.

Shortly after the founding of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the &quot;Centuriate Assembly&quot; and the &quot;Tribal Assembly&quot;. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the &quot;lex curiata de imperio&quot;. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome&#x27;s regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative. At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly&#x27;s thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized on the basis of the Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar&#x27;s adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, this might not have been the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; but instead the &quot;comitia calata&quot;.

==Assembly of the Centuries==

The &quot;Centuriate Assembly&quot; (&quot;comitia centuriata&quot; or &quot;Army Assembly&quot;) of the Roman Republic was originally the democratic assembly of the Roman soldiers. The Centuriate Assembly organized the Roman citizens into economic classes, defined by a means test. The Roman army was divided into units called &quot;Centuries&quot;, and these gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. However, since the number of centuries in each class was fixed, centuries could contain far more than 100 men. Only this assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking Roman Magistrates: &quot;Consuls&quot;, &quot;Praetors&quot; and &quot;Censors&quot;. The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a statute that granted constitutional command authority to Consuls and Praetors, and Censorial powers to Censors. In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases, and ratified the results of the Census. Although the voters in this assembly wore white undecorated togas and were unarmed, while participating in the Assembly they were classified as soldiers, and as such were not allowed to meet within the physical boundary of the city of Rome. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a Consul (although sometimes a Praetor). Only Consuls (the highest-ranking of all Roman Magistrates) could preside over the Centuriate Assembly during elections because the higher-ranking Consuls were always elected together with the lower-ranking Praetors. Once every five years, after the new Consuls for the year took office, they presided over the Centuriate Assembly as it elected the two Censors.

The Centuriate Assembly was supposedly founded by the legendary Roman King Servius Tullius, less than a century before the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC. As such, the original design of the Centuriate Assembly was known as the &quot;Servian organization&quot;. Under this organization, the assembly was supposedly designed to mirror the Roman army during the time of the Roman Kingdom. Soldiers in the Roman army were classified on the basis of the amount of property that they owned, and as such, soldiers with more property had more influence than soldiers with less property. The 193 Centuries in the assembly under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class, the enlisted class, and a class of unarmed adjuncts. The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries. The enlisted class was grouped into five separate property classes, for a total of 170 Centuries. The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries. Of five enlisted classes, the wealthiest controlled 80 of the votes. During a vote, all of the Centuries of one class had to vote before the Centuries of the next lower class could vote. The first candidate to reach a majority of 97 votes was victorious. When a measure or candidate received 97 votes, a majority of the centuries, the voting ended, and as such, many lower ranking Centuries rarely if ever had a chance to actually vote. Combined the 18 equites and the 80 centuries of the first property class had one more century than needed, and a unanimous vote from the elite would thus elect a candidate.

In 241 BC, the assembly was reorganized, though the exact details are uncertain. Some sources have a new total of 373 Centuries, but Cicero still writes of 193 centuries in his era, and most scholars still use that number. It is known that the first property class was reduced from 80 to 70 centuries, and the order of voting was changed so that the first class would go first, and be followed by the equites.

The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was the fifth Century (called the &quot;proletarii&quot;) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century composed of soldiers who had no property, and since it was always the last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections.

During his dictatorship from 82 BC until 80 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla restored the old Servian Organization to this assembly. Sulla died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus repealed Sulla&#x27;s constitutional reforms, including his restoration of the Servian Organization to this assembly. Thus, they restored the newer organization that had originated in 241 BC. The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.

==Assembly of the Tribes==
The &quot;Tribal Assembly&quot; (&quot;comitia populi tributa&quot;) of the Roman Republic was the democratic assembly of Roman citizens. The Tribal Assembly was organized as an Assembly, and not as a Council. During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of thirty-five Tribes which included patricians and plebeians. The Tribes gathered into the Tribal Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually either a &quot;Consul&quot; (the highest ranking Roman Magistrate) or a &quot;Praetor&quot; (the second-highest ranking Roman Magistrate). The Tribal Assembly elected three different magistrates: &quot;Quaestors&quot;, &quot;Curule Aediles&quot;, and &quot;Military Tribunes&quot;. The Tribal Assembly also had the power to try judicial cases.

In addition to the above-mentioned magistrates, the Tribal Assembly elected the Pontifex Maximus. His was a lifetime appointment, however, and so the Tribal Assembly only elected a new Pontifex Maximus after the previous one died.

The thirty-five Tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather a generic division into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one&#x27;s father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost. The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe had voted, a lot was used to determine which Tribe should vote next. The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods. Once a majority of Tribes had voted the same way, voting ended.

==Plebeian Council==

The &quot;Plebeian Council&quot; (&quot;concilium plebis&quot;) was the principal popular gathering of the Roman Republic. As the name suggests, the Plebeian Council was organized as a Council, and not as an Assembly. It functioned as a gathering through which the Plebeians (commoners) could pass laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. This council had no political power until the offices of &quot;Plebeian Tribune&quot; and &quot;Plebeian Aedile&quot; were created in 494 BC, due to the &quot;Plebeian Secession&quot; that year.

According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius enacted a series of constitutional reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted in the creation of a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the &quot;Tribe&quot;, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the &quot;Curia&quot;. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary &quot;Tribal Assembly&quot; (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.

The Plebeian Council elected two &#x27;Plebeian Magistrates&#x27;, the &quot;Plebeian Tribunes&quot; and the &quot;Plebeian Aediles&quot;. Usually the Plebeian Tribune presided over the assembly, although the Plebeian Aedile sometimes did as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council (&quot;Plebiscites&quot;) only applied to Plebeians. However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites the full force of law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians). It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the Roman Senate to veto acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked. After this point, almost all domestic legislation came out of the Plebeian Council.

<text>Telephone (American English and Canadian English), or Chinese whispers (some Commonwealth English), is an internationally popular children&#x27;s game in which messages are whispered from person to person and then the original and final messages are compared. This sequential modification of information is called transmission chaining in the context of cultural evolution research, and is primarily used to identify the type of information that is more easily passed on from one person to another.

Players form a line or circle, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear of the second person in the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on. When the last player is reached, they announce the message they just heard, to the entire group. The first person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass around the message without it becoming garbled along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless, this usually ends up happening. Errors typically accumulate in the retellings, so the statement announced by the last player differs significantly from that of the first player, usually with amusing or humorous effect. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, or the difficult-to-understand mechanism of whispering.

The game is often played by children as a party game or on the playground. It is often invoked as a metaphor for cumulative error, especially the inaccuracies as rumours or gossip spread, or, more generally, for the unreliability of typical human recollection.

==Etymology==
===United Kingdom, Australian, and New Zealand usage===

In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the game is typically called &quot;Chinese whispers&quot;; in the UK, this is documented from 1964.

Various accounts have been suggested for naming the game after the Chinese, but there is no concrete explanation. One suggested account is a widespread British fascination with Chinese culture in the 18th and 19th centuries during the Enlightenment. Another account posits that the game&#x27;s name stems from the supposed confused messages created when a message was passed verbally from tower to tower along the Great Wall of China.

Critics who focus on Western use of the word &quot;Chinese&quot; as denoting &quot;confusion&quot; and &quot;incomprehensibility&quot; look to the earliest contacts between Europeans and Chinese people in the 17th century, attributing it to a supposed inability on the part of Europeans to understand China&#x27;s culture and worldview. In this view, using the phrase &quot;Chinese whispers&quot; is taken as evidence of a belief that the Chinese language itself is not understandable. Yunte Huang, a professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has said that: &quot;Indicating inaccurately transmitted information, the expression &#x27;Chinese Whispers&#x27; carries with it a sense of paranoia caused by espionage, counterespionage, Red Scare, and other war games, real or imaginary, cold or hot.&quot; Usage of the term has been defended as being similar to other expressions such as &quot;It&#x27;s all Greek to me&quot; and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Double Dutch&quot; as an expression for unintelligibility originated in England as a derogatory smear against Holland, its rival in various wars.

===Alternative names===

As the game is popular among children worldwide, it is also known under various other names depending on locality, such as &quot;Russian scandal&quot;, &quot;Russian Gossip,&quot; &quot;Russian Telephone,&quot; &quot;whisper down the lane&quot;, &quot;broken telephone&quot;, &quot;operator&quot;, &quot;grapevine&quot;, &quot;gossip&quot;, &quot;secret message&quot;, &quot;the messenger game&quot;, and &quot;pass the message&quot;, among others. In Turkey, this game is called &quot;kulaktan kulağa&quot;, which means &quot;from (one) ear to (another) ear&quot;. In France, it is called &quot;téléphone arabe&quot; (&quot;Arabic telephone&quot;) or &quot;téléphone sans fil&quot; (&quot;wireless telephone&quot;). In Germany the game is known as &quot;Stille Post&quot; (&quot;quiet mail&quot;). In Czechia, it is known as &quot;tichá pošta&quot;, also meaning &quot;quiet mail&quot;. In Poland it is called &quot;głuchy telefon&quot;, meaning &quot;deaf telephone&quot;. In Medici-era Florence it was called the &quot;game of the ear&quot;.

In North America, the game is known under the name &quot;telephone&quot;. Alternative names used in the United States include &quot;Broken Telephone&quot;, &quot;Gossip&quot;, and &quot;Rumors&quot;. This North American name is followed in a number of languages where the game is known by the local language&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;broken telephone&quot;, such in Malaysia as &quot;telefon rosak,&quot; in Israel as &quot;&quot;טלפון שבור&quot;&quot; - literally meaning &quot;broken telephone&quot; in Hebrew (&quot;telefon shavur&quot;), in Finland as &quot;rikkinäinen puhelin&quot;, and in Greece as &quot;halasmeno tilefono&quot; (χαλασμένο τηλέφωνο) or &quot;spasmeno tilefono&quot; (σπασμένο τηλέφωνο).

==Game==
The game has no winner: the entertainment comes from comparing the original and final messages. Intermediate messages may also be compared; some messages will become unrecognizable after only a few steps.

As well as providing amusement, the game can have educational value. It shows how easily information can become corrupted by indirect communication. The game has been used in schools to simulate the spread of gossip and its possible harmful effects. It can also be used to teach young children to moderate the volume of their voice, and how to listen attentively; in this case, a game is a success if the message is transmitted accurately with each child whispering rather than shouting. It can also be used for older or adult learners of a foreign language, where the challenge of speaking comprehensibly, and understanding, is more difficult because of the low volume, and hence a greater mastery of the fine points of pronunciation is required.

==Notable games==
In 2008, 1,330 children and celebrities set a world record for the game of Telephone involving the most people. The game was held at the Emirates Stadium in London and lasted two hours and four minutes. Starting with &quot;together we will make a world of difference&quot;, the phrase morphed into &quot;we&#x27;re setting a record&quot; part way down the chain, and by the end had become simply &quot;haaaaa&quot;. The previous record, set in 2006 by the Cycling Club of Chengdu, China, had involved 1,083 people.

In 2017 a new world record was set for the largest game of Telephone in terms of the number of participants by schoolchildren in Tauranga, New Zealand. The chain involved 1,763 school children and other individuals and was held as part of Hearing Week 2017. The starting phrase was &quot;Turn it down&quot;. As of 2022 this remained the world record for the largest game of Telephone by number of participants according to the Guinness Book of Records.

In 2012 a global game of Telephone was played spanning 237 individuals speaking seven different languages. Beginning in St Kilda Library in Melbourne, Australia, the starting phrase &quot;Life must be lived as play&quot; (a paraphrase of Plato) had become &quot;He bites snails&quot; by the time the game reached its end in Alaska 26 hours later. In 2013, the Global Gossip Game had 840 participants and travelled to all 7 continents.

==Variants==
A variant of Telephone is called Rumors. In this version of the game, when players transfer the message, they &quot;deliberately&quot; change one or two words of the phrase (often to something more humorous than the previous message). Intermediate messages can be compared. There is a second derivative variant, no less popular than Rumors, known as Mahjong Secrets (UK), or Broken Telephone (US), where the objective is to receive the message from the whisperer and whisper to the next participant the first word or phrase that comes to mind in association with what was heard. At the end, the final phrase is compared to the first in front of all participants.
The pen-and-paper game Telephone Pictionary (also known as Eat Poop You Cat) is played by alternately writing and illustrating captions, the paper being folded so that each player can only see the previous participant&#x27;s contribution. The game was first implemented online by &quot;Broken Picture Telephone&quot; in early 2007. Following the success of &quot;Broken Picture Telephone&quot;, commercial boardgame versions &quot;Telestrations&quot; and &quot;Cranium Scribblish&quot; were released two years later in 2009. &quot;Drawception&quot;, and other websites, also arrived in 2012.

A translation relay is a variant in which the first player produces a text in a given language, together with a basic guide to understanding, which includes a lexicon, an interlinear gloss, possibly a list of grammatical morphemes, comments on the meaning of difficult words, etc. (everything except an actual translation). The text is passed on to the following player, who tries to make sense of it and casts it into their language of choice, then repeating the procedure, and so on. Each player only knows the translation done by his immediate predecessor, but customarily the relay master or mistress collects all of them. The relay ends when the last player returns the translation to the beginning player.

Another variant of Telephone is shown on &quot;Ellen&#x27;s Game of Games&quot; under the name of &quot;Say Whaaat?&quot;. However, the difference is that the four players will be wearing earmuffs; therefore the players have to read their lips. A similar game, &quot;Shouting One Out&quot;, in which participants wearing noise-canceling headphones had to interpret the lip movements of the preceding player, appeared in multiple editions of the ITV2 panel game series &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;. 

The CBBC game show &quot;Copycats&quot; featured several rounds played in a Telephone format, in which each player on a team in turn had to interpret and recreate the mimed actions, drawing or music performed by the preceding person in line, with the points value awarded based on how far down the line the correct starting prompt had travelled before mutating into something else.

A party game variant of telephone known as &quot;wordpass&quot; involves saying words out loud and saying a related word, until a word is repeated.

==As a metaphor==
The game of Telephone is used in a number of fields as a metaphor for imperfect data transmission over multiple iterations. For example the British zoologist Mark Ridley in his book &quot;Mendel&#x27;s demon&quot; used the game as an analogy for the imperfect transmission of genetic information across multiple generations. In another example, Richard Dawkins used the game as a metaphor for infidelity in memetic replication, referring specifically to children trying to reproduce drawing of a Chinese junk in his essay &quot;Chinese Junk and Chinese Whispers&quot;. It was used in the movie Tár to represent gossip circling within an orchestra.

<doc id="291410" wikidata="Q14341" url="?curid=291410" title="Cozy Powell">
<text>Cozy Powell (born Colin Trevor Flooks; 29 December 1947 – 5 April 1998) was an English drummer who made his name with major rock bands and artists such as The Jeff Beck Group, Rainbow, Michael Schenker Group, Gary Moore, Graham Bonnet, Brian May, Whitesnake, Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell, and Black Sabbath.

Powell appeared on at least 66 albums, with contributions on many other recordings. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential drummers of all time; many rock drummers have cited him as a major influence.

==Early life==
Colin Trevor Flooks (Cozy Powell) was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and was adopted. He never knowingly met his birth parents. He started playing drums aged 11 in the school orchestra, thereafter playing along in his spare time, to popular singles of the time. The first band Powell was in, called the Corals whom he joined in 1963, played each week at the youth club in Cirencester. The Corals also played at a youth club in Latton, a small village from Cirencester. During this time the band broke the world record for non-stop playing without playing the same song twice. Aged 15, Cozy had already worked out an impressive drum solo. 

The stage name Cozy was borrowed from the jazz drummer Cozy Cole, while he took the name Powell, from his adoptive mother&#x27;s maiden name.

==Career==
The semi-professional circuit was next in 1966 with The Sorcerers, a vocal-harmony pop band. The late nights and usual on-the-road exploits began to affect his education, and Powell eventually took an office job, to finance the purchase of his first set of Premier drums. The Sorcerers performed on the German club scene in the mid 1960s.

By 1968 the band had returned to England, basing themselves in the Birmingham area. Powell struck up friendships with notable local musicians, including Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant and John Bonham, future Slade vocalist Noddy Holder, Fairport Convention bassist Dave Pegg and future Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi. The Sorcerers, later renamed Youngblood, released a series of singles in late 1968 and 1969. The group then linked up with The Move&#x27;s former bassist and vocalist Ace Kefford to form The Ace Kefford Stand. Five recorded tracks are available on Ace Kefford&#x27;s album &quot;Ace The Face&quot;, released by Sanctuary Records in 2003. Powell also began session work and, with fellow The Sorcerers members Dave and Denny Ball, formed Big Bertha.

===Isle of Wight 1970 and Jeff Beck===
Powell played with swamp rocker Tony Joe White at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. Powell had landed the highly prestigious drumming job with The Jeff Beck Group in April 1970. Their first project was to record an album of Motown covers in the US. This was never finished and remains unreleased. During the sessions, photographs show Cozy Powell and Jeff Beck present at the recording of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot;, on which Beck appears. Cozy has stated in interviews he plays on the record, but this remains to be confirmed. After the release of two albums, &quot;Rough and Ready&quot; in October 1971 and &quot;Jeff Beck Group&quot; in July 1972, the band disbanded. 

===1972–1974===
In 1972 Powell played drums on two tracks (&quot;Hey Sandy&quot; and &quot;Martha&quot;) on Harvey Andrews&#x27; album &quot;Writer of Songs&quot;. By late 1972 he had joined up once again with the Ball brothers and also singer Frank Aiello to form Bedlam, whose eponymous album produced by Felix Pappalardi, was recorded for Chrysalis and released in August 1973.

With Powell&#x27;s session work at RAK and subsequent solo success (including &quot;Dance with the Devil&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart in January 1974), Bedlam subsequently fell apart. 

&quot;Dance With The Devil&quot; was his only solo hit in North America, reaching No. 48 in Canada for four weeks, and No. 49 in the United States. The track featured Suzi Quatro on bass. Powell&#x27;s second hit during 1974 was with &quot;The Man in Black&quot;, which reached No. 18. Arrows singer Alan Merrill, also a RAK records artist, played bass guitar on &#x27;&quot;The Man in Black&#x27;&quot; and the B-side &#x27;&quot;After Dark&quot;. 

Jeff Beck&#x27;s producer at the time, was Mickie Most and Powell soon found himself drafted into sessions for artists signed to Most&#x27;s RAK label, including Julie Felix, Hot Chocolate, Donovan and Suzi Quatro. To cash in on his chart success, the drummer formed his own band named &quot;Cozy Powell&#x27;s Hammer&quot; in April 1974. The line-up included Bernie Marsden (guitar), Clive Chaman (bass), Don Airey (keyboards) and Frank Aiello (Bedlam) on vocals. Clive Chaman was replaced by bassist Neil Murray in early 1975 for the RAK Rocks Britain Tour. &quot;Na Na Na&quot; was a UK No. 10 hit, and another single &quot;Le Souk&quot; was recorded but ultimately never released.

Sharing a love of the power-trio set up (Cream), Cozy Powell formed a band named Strange Brew in 1974, with guitarist Clem Clempson and bassist Greg Ridley (Humble Pie), but when this fell apart during rehearsals the following year, Cozy temporarily quit the music business to take up motorcycle and car racing. His desire to launch a three-piece band in the vein of Cream remained; recordings with Tipton, Entwistle &amp; Powell are testament to this as are sessions with Cream bassist Jack Bruce and former Scorpions and Electric Sun guitarist Uli Jon Roth, briefly after recording for Cinderella: &quot;to get him (Uli Roth) had been the idea of Larry Mazer (at the time manager of Cinderella), Jack met him, but at the time Uli was busy with a symphony. I don&#x27;t think it would have worked, we had him in mind as well as some other people, like Gary Moore, ideally Jeff Beck really&quot;, followed by Clem Clempson, Pat Travers and Pat Thrall with whom they recorded, shopped for a deal - unsuccessfully—until Powell would join Black Sabbath.

===1975–1980: Rainbow===
In 1975, Powell joined Rainbow after their debut album was released. Over the next five years he and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore were the only constants in the band. Powell played on three studio albums and many live recordings with the band. During this time, Blackmore developed the band&#x27;s sound from neoclassical hard rock-heavy metal to a more commercial AOR sound. Powell grew concerned with the overly commercial direction and decided to leave, although not before Rainbow headlined the first Monsters of Rock show at Castle Donington, England, on 16 August 1980. This was Powell&#x27;s last show with the band. He became the first musician to appear at the Monsters of Rock show with two different bands, when he once again played at the show, with Whitesnake in 1983.

===1980–1983: Graham Bonnet, Michael Schenker, Phenomena===
After leaving Rainbow, Powell again worked with vocalist Graham Bonnet, their most notable song being &quot;Night Games&quot; from Bonnet&#x27;s solo album &quot;Line-Up&quot;, which was released in 1981 as a single and reached number 6 in the UK singles chart. He also played on two tracks on former Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant&#x27;s first solo album Pictures at Eleven in 1982. 

For the rest of the 1980s, Powell assumed short-term journeyman roles with a number of major bands and artists, including Michael Schenker Group with whom he recorded one studio album and one live album. In 1985 he joined Phenomena for their first album, which was released the same year. He also worked in a new supergroup, called Forcefield along with Bonnet and later Tony Martin on vocals, former Ian Gillan Band member Ray Fenwick and former Focus member Jan Akkerman on guitars and bassists Neil Murray and Laurence Cottle. Cottle would eventually join as a session bassist, for the recording of Black Sabbath&#x27;s Headless Cross album in 1988 and was again replaced by Murray, in 1989 for the supporting tour. 

===1982–1985: Whitesnake===
Powell was invited to join Whitesnake in October 1982 after his departure from Michael Schenker Group, to replace Ian Paice for a presumed farewell tour with the band in Europe, but after the success of the &quot;Saints &amp; Sinners&quot; album in the British and Japanese charts, and a successful supporting tour that culminated in a memorable performance at the Monsters of Rock Festival in August 1983, the band signed with the American label Geffen Records. Due to contractual obligations, the band had to release one more album for their previous label Liberty which would be 1984&#x27;s &quot;Slide It In&quot;. 

Now under guidance of A&amp;R executive John Kalodner, the album was remixed with the help of producer Keith Olsen for the American market with Cozy, guitarist Mel Galley and keyboardist Jon Lord the only remaining members of the previous line up along with singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes and returning bassist Neil Murray. Powell&#x27;s tenure with the band ended in January 1985, after a highlight performance at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil. After that he was asked to join Keith Emerson and Greg Lake in a revamped version of ELP, Emerson, Lake and Powell, who released one album in June 1986. 

===1988–1998: Black Sabbath and solo===
Powell briefly played with former Whitesnake guitarist John Sykes in Blue Murder, before working with Gary Moore in 1988, followed by stints with Black Sabbath from 1988 to 1991, and again from 1994 to 1995. 

Between late 1992 and early 1993, Powell put together an occasional touring band using the old band name &#x27;Cozy Powell&#x27;s Hammer&#x27; featuring himself on drums, Mario Parga on guitar and fellow Sabbath members Neil Murray on bass, Tony Martin on vocals, and occasional rhythm guitar/synth module. The band performed throughout Europe and appeared on German television. Powell made headlines in 1986 when he appeared on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Record Breakers&quot;, where he set a world record for the most drums (400) played in under one minute, live on television.

Powell and Murray were members of Brian May&#x27;s band, playing on the &quot;Back to the Light&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; albums. He played with May, opening for Guns N&#x27; Roses on the second American leg of their Use Your Illusion tour in 1993. Powell and Murray also had a spell, with blues guitarist Peter Green between 1996 and 1997. Powell briefly joined Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s band for the album &quot;Facing the Animal&quot; in 1997. 

Powell&#x27;s last recording session was in February 1998 for former The Zombies singer Colin Blunstone and his album &quot;The Light Inside&quot;, alongside Don Airey and Mo Foster, which was released shortly after Powell&#x27;s death. Powell&#x27;s final solo album, &quot;Especially for You&quot; was released in Japan in 1998 after his death, and featured American vocalist John West, Neil Murray, Lonnie Park, Michael Casswell and others. Additionally a tribute album called Cozy Powell Forever, was also released in Japan in September 1998 in Powell&#x27;s memory. The album featured well known Japanese musicians, as well as Powell&#x27;s Blue Murder bandmate, bassist Tony Franklin and drummer Carmine Appice on two tracks. The album featured songs from notable bands that Powell played in, as well as songs from his solo albums. 

==Death==
Powell died on 5 April 1998 following a car crash while driving his Saab 9000 at in bad weather on the M4 motorway near Bristol. He had been dating a married woman who was having problems with her husband. Upset, she phoned him and asked him to come quickly to her house which was approximately away. As he was driving to her house, she phoned him again and asked &quot;Where are you?&quot; He informed her he was on his way and she then heard him say &quot;Oh shit!&quot; followed by a loud bang.

Powell was ejected through the windscreen and died at the scene. According to the BBC report, at the time of the crash Powell&#x27;s blood-alcohol reading was over the legal limit, and he was not wearing a seat belt, in addition to talking with his girlfriend on his mobile phone. The official investigation also found evidence of a slow puncture in a rear tyre that, it was suggested, could well have caused a sudden collapse of the tyre with a consequent loss of control of the car.

He was living in Lambourn in Berkshire at the time and had returned to the studio shortly before his death to record with Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green. At the time of death, Powell had recently pulled out of tour rehearsals with Yngwie Malmsteen, having suffered an injury in a motorcycle accident. 

A memorial plaque at the Corn Hall in Cirencester was unveiled in January 2016 in a ceremony led by Brian May, with Suzi Quatro, Bernie Marsden, Neil Murray, Don Airey and Tony Iommi in attendance.

==Posthumous releases==
In October 2005, Powell made a &quot;new&quot; appearance on an album. Former Black Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin released a studio album (&quot;Scream&quot;), and on it is a track named &quot;Raising Hell&quot;. This was a track Powell had recorded the drum track for when he and Martin were in Hammer in 1992, and gave to Martin for &quot;future use&quot;. There are apparently as many as 19 additional drum tracks also recorded that could turn up in the future. Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton has also released material recorded during the 1997 &quot;Baptizm of Fire&quot; sessions; this 2006 collection, entitled &quot;Edge of the World&quot;, was released under the moniker of Tipton, Entwistle &amp; Powell in memory of John Entwistle and Powell.

<text>Ottoman Albania was a period in Albanian history from the Ottoman conquest in the late 15th century to the Albanian declaration of Independence and official secession from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. The Ottomans first entered Albania in 1385 upon the invitation of the Albanian noble Karl Thopia to suppress the forces of the noble Balša II during the Battle of Savra. They had some previous influence in some Albanian regions after the battle of Savra in 1385 but not direct control. The Ottomans placed garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1420s and established formal jurisdiction in central Albania by 1431. Even though The Ottomans claimed rule of all Albanian lands, most Albanian ethnic territories were still governed by medieval Albanian nobility who were free of Ottoman rule. The Sanjak of Albania was established in 1420 or 1430 controlling mostly central Albania, while Ottoman rule became more consolidated in 1481, after the fall of Shkodra and League of Lezhe with the country (including areas of today&#x27;s Kosovo, Montenegro 
and Macedonia) being mostly free in the period of 1443–1481. Albanians revolted again in 1481 but the Ottomans finally controlled Albania by 1488.

The term used in Ottoman sources for the country was &quot;Arnavudluk&quot; (Ottoman Turkish: آرناوودلق), including areas such as present-day Albania, Kosovo, western North Macedonia, southern Serbia, southern Montenegro and parts of northern Greece.

In 1431, many Albanian princes including Gjergj Arianiti, Zenevisi family, Andrea Thopia and Gjon Kastrioti started a war against the Ottoman Empire which resulted in a defeat of Kastrioti, but victory in four battles for Arianiti and a victory for Thopia. These victories opened the way for the coming of Skanderbeg in 1443 in Krujë. Independence for most of the Albanian regions was maintained during 1443–1479, with the uprising under the lead of Skanderbeg, that together with other Albanian nobles such Gjergj Arianiti, Andrea Thopia and Lekë Dukagjini, achieved remarkable result of more than thirty victories against the Ottoman Empire.

The Albanian resistance and war against the Ottomans continued for 48 years. The last fortresses captured by the Ottomans were Shkodër in 1479, Durrës in 1501 and Himara in 1509. 

Albanians would later on enter in a period of Islamization, starting in the late 14th century and early 15th century, and increasing especially in the 16th and 17th centuries. Albanians, through converting to Islam, would eventually dominate the Ottoman power structures disproportionally to their small population, considering the large territory and huge population of the Ottoman Empire at the time. They would become one of the most important and prestigious nations in the empire, playing an important role in the 15th and 16th centuries, and especially a striking role in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

A period of the semi-independence started for local Albanian rulers in the 1750s with the era of the so called Independent Albanian Pashas. In 1754, the autonomous Albanian Pashalik of the Bushati family would be established, with its center being the city of Shkodër, called Pashalik of Shkodra. Later on, the autonomous Pashalik of Berat would be established, and culminating with the Albanian Pashalik of Ali Pashë Tepelena in 1787. The Albanian Pashaliks would end in 1831 with the last one being the Bushati Pashalik. These &quot;de facto&quot; independent Albanian Pashaliks would extend from Bosnia to south of Morea (Peloponnese) in today&#x27;s southern Greece.

Meanwhile, an Ottoman-Albanian commander called Mehmet Ali of Egypt, would seize power in Egypt in 1805 through his Albanian mercenaries and establish a dynasty that would last up to 1954. He would take over Sudan and many regions of Saudi Arabia by 1824 and would take over Levant later on in 1831, by even defeating the Ottomans in 1833. The conflict would rise again in what is known as Egyptian-Ottoman War (1839-1841) and only European Powers would stop Mehmet Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha from seizing Constantinople and replace the Ottoman dynasty with the Albanian one, by thus resolving the Oriental Crisis of 1840. Albanian communities exist up to this day in Egypt and other areas of Levant such as Syria and Palestine.

The territory which today belongs to the Republic of Albania remained part of the Ottoman Empire until it declared independence in 1912, during the Balkan Wars.

== History ==
=== 14th century ===

The Ottomans expanded their control from Anatolia to the Balkans in the middle of the 14th century. They entered European territory in 1352, and they defeated a Balkan coalition army led by Serbs, that also included some Albanians and Bosnians in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Ottoman pressure lessened in 1402 when the Mongol leader Timur (Tamerlane) attacked Anatolia from the east, killed the Sultan, and sparked a civil war. When order was restored, the Ottomans renewed their westward progress. In 1453, Sultan Mehmed II&#x27;s forces overran Constantinople and killed the last Byzantine emperor.

The division of the Albanian-populated lands into small, quarreling fiefdoms ruled by independent feudal lords and tribal chiefs made them easy prey for the Ottoman armies. In 1385, the Albanian ruler of Durrës, Karl Thopia, appealed to the sultan for support against his rivals, the Balsha noble family. An Ottoman force quickly marched into Albania along the Via Egnatia and routed Balsha II in the Battle of Savra. Some of the Albanian Principalities soon started to become vassals of the Ottoman Empire after 1420. Gjirokastra became the county town of the Sanjak of Albania in 1420. and then Kruja was established as the center of Sanjak of Albania after Gjergj Arianiti defeated the Ottomans between 1431 and 1435.

The Ottomans allowed Albanian clan chiefs to maintain their positions, rule and property, but they had to pay tribute, and sometimes send their sons to the Ottoman court as hostages, and provide the Ottoman army with auxiliary troops. However many Albanian clans and Principalities did not recognize the Ottoman authority and did not pay tribute.

==== Albanian resistance ====


The Albanians&#x27; resistance to the Ottomans in the 14th century and especially in the 15th century won them acclaim all over Europe. Gjon Kastrioti of Krujë was one of the Albanian nobles and clan leaders who submitted to Ottoman suzerainty in 1425. He was compelled to send his four sons to the Ottoman capital to be trained for military service. The youngest, George Kastrioti (1403–68), who would become the Albanians&#x27; national hero, captured the sultan&#x27;s attention. Renamed Iskander when he converted to Islam, the young man participated in military expeditions to Asia Minor and Europe becoming one of the main Ottoman generals. When appointed to administer a Balkan district, Iskander became known as Skanderbeg. After Ottoman forces under Skanderbeg&#x27;s command suffered defeat in a battle near Niš (intentionally by him) present-day Serbia in 1443, Skanderbeg rushed to Krujë and tricked a Turkish pasha into surrendering the Albanian fortress. Skanderbeg then embraced Roman Catholicism and declared a holy war against the Ottoman Empire.

On 1 March 1444, Albanian chieftains gathered in the cathedral of Lezhë with the prince of Montenegro and delegates from Venice and proclaimed Skanderbeg commander of the Albanian resistance. All of Albania accepted his leadership against the Ottomans, but local leaders kept control of their own districts. Under a red flag bearing Skanderbeg&#x27;s heraldic emblem, an Albanian force of about 10,000-15.000 men held off Ottoman campaigns against their lands for twenty-four years when Skanderbeg was commander in chief and for another 11 years after his death.

Three times the Albanians overcame sieges of Krujë. In 1450, the Albanians routed Sultan Murad II himself. Later, they repulsed attacks led by Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 and 1467. In 1461, Skanderbeg went to the aid of his suzerain, King Alfonso I of Naples, against the kings of Sicily by practically defeating all his rivals in southern Italy. Albanians also defeated Venice in 1449 in 3 battles in Albanian–Venetian War.

Sometimes the government under Skanderbeg was unstable, however, and at times local Albanian rulers cooperated with the Ottomans against him.

With political and minor material support from the Kingdom of Naples and the Vatican, resistance to the Ottoman Empire continued for 36 years.

Krujë fell to the Ottomans only in 1478, ten years after the death of Skanderbeg; Shkodër succumbed in 1479 after a failed siege in 1474 and a stronger siege in 1478 that ended with Venice ceding Shkodra to the Ottomans. The Venetians then evacuated Durrës, in 1501. The conquests triggered a great exodus of Albanian nobles to Venice and Italy, especially to the kingdom of Naples, as well as to Sicily, Romania and Egypt. Most of the Albanian refugees belonged to the Orthodox Church. The Albanians of Italy significantly influenced the Albanian national movement in future centuries, and Albanian Franciscan priests, most of whom were descended from émigrés to Italy, played a significant role in the preservation of Catholicism in Albania&#x27;s northern regions.

Skanderbeg&#x27;s long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and national identity. The memory of the mid-15th century resistance under Skanderbeg continues to be important to Albanians, and his family&#x27;s banner, bearing a black two-headed eagle on a red field, became the flag under which the Albanian national movement rallied centuries later. 11 years after the death of Skenderbeg and the fall of Krujë, the Ottoman Empire gained control of the ethnic Albanian territories and made many political changes.

=== 16th–17th centuries ===
The Albanian population gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of Bektashism, which offered considerable material advantages in Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army. Many Albanians were recruited initially into the Janissary and Devşirme (in many cases sons of Albanian nobles) and later on through becoming Muslims they opened their path for very successful military and political carriers, persuading other Albanians to do so

Albanians would enter later on in the 15th and especially 16th and 17th centuries, a period of Islamization. Albanians through converting to Islam would eventually dominate the Ottoman power structures disporportinally to their small population considering the large territory and huge population of the Ottoman Empire. They would become one of the most important and prestigious nations in the Empire playing a stringing role since the 15th century, but especially in the 17th,18th and 19th centuries.

For example, 48 Grand Viziers were of Albanian origin who managed the Ottoman state approximately 190 years. Some of the most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were: George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, Ballaban Badera, Koca Davud Pasha, Hamza Kastrioti, Iljaz Hoxha, Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha, Mimar Sinan, Nezim Frakulla, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, Ali Pasha, Edhem Pasha, Omer Vrioni, Patrona Halil, Haxhi Shehreti, Ali Pasha of Gucia, Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Kara Mahmud Bushati, Kara Murad Pasha, Ahmet Kurt Pasha, Mustafa Bushati, Ibrahim Bushati, Sedefkar Mehmed Agha.

Albanians also played a crucial role during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503), Ottoman–Hungarian Wars and Ottoman–Habsburg wars before gaining Independence.

Ottoman Empire would be heavily dependent on Albanian Mercenaries in its warfare between the early 1600s to middle 1800s until the reforms of Tanzimat.

=== 18th–19th centuries and the Albanian Pashaliks ===

The weakening of Ottoman central authority and the timar system brought anarchy to the Albanian-populated lands. In the 18th century, two Albanian centers of power emerged: Shkodër, under the Bushati family; and Ioannina, under Ali Pasha of Tepelenë. When it suited their goals, both places cooperated with the Sublime Porte, and when it was expedient to defy the central government, each acted independently.
The Bushati family initially dominated the Shkodër region through a network of alliances with various highland tribes and later expanded in huge areas in today&#x27;s Montenegro, Northern Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, southern Serbia. Kara Mahmud Bushati attempted to establish a de juro independent principality and expand the lands under his control by playing off Austria and Russia against the Sublime Porte. In 1785, Kara Mahmud&#x27;s forces attacked and conquered Montenegrin territory, and Austria offered to recognize him as the ruler of all Albania if he would ally himself with Vienna against the Sublime Porte. Seizing an opportunity, Kara Mahmud sent the sultan the heads of an Austrian delegation in 1788, and the Ottomans appointed him governor of Shkodër. When he attempted to wrest the final lands from the last free tribes in Montenegro in 1796, however, he was killed by an ambush in northern Montenegro. Kara Mahmud&#x27;s brother, Ibrahim Bushati, cooperated with the Sublime Porte until his death in 1810, but his successor, Mustafa Pasha Bushati, proved to be recalcitrant despite important participation in Ottoman military campaigns against Greek revolutionaries and rebel pashas. He cooperated with the mountain tribes and brought a large area in Balkans under his control like Kara Mahmud Bushati. Visiting Albania and Ali Pasha in 1814, Charles Robert Cockerell admired Ali Pasha&#x27;s governance, stating: &quot;There is law — for everyone admits his impartiality as compared with that of rulers in other parts of Turkey — and there is commerce. He [Ali Pasha] has made roads, fortified the borders, put down brigandage, and raised Albania into a power of great importance in Europe.&quot;

During the ending of the 1700s century and beginning of the 19th century Albanian Pashaliks extended from Bosnia to the south of today&#x27;s Greece in Peloponnese matching a climax of power which Albanians would never achieve again. 

South of the Shkumbini River, the mostly peasant Tosks lived in compact villages under elected rulers. Some Tosks living in settlements high in the mountains maintained their independence and often escaped payment of taxes. The Tosks of the lowlands, however, were easy for the Ottoman authorities to control. The Albanian tribal system disappeared there, and the Ottomans imposed a system of military fiefs under which the sultan granted soldiers and cavalrymen temporary landholdings, or timars, in exchange for military service. By the 18th century, many military fiefs had effectively become the hereditary landholdings of economically and politically powerful families who squeezed wealth from their hard-strapped Christian and Muslim tenant farmers. The beys, like the clan chiefs of the northern mountains, became virtually independent rulers in their own provinces, had their own military contingents, and often waged war against each other to increase their landholdings and power. The Sublime Porte attempted to press a divide-and-rule policy to keep the local beys from uniting and posing a threat to Ottoman rule itself, but with little success.

Ottoman-Albanian relations worsened in the year 1826 during the reign of Mahmud II, he had instigated the notorious Auspicious Incident and the turmoil that followed caused the violent dissolution of the Janissary, Devşirme and the entire Balkan Muslim leadership in Rumelia causing a new wave of revolts and instability in the gradually weakening Ottoman Empire.

After crushing the Bushatis and Ali Pasha, the Sublime Porte introduced a series of reforms, known as the tanzimat, which were aimed at strengthening the empire by reining in fractious pashas. The &quot;timars&quot; officially became large individual landholdings, especially in the lowlands. In 1835, the Sublime Porte divided the Albanian-populated lands into the &quot;vilayets&quot; of Janina and Rumelia and dispatched officials from Constantinople to administer them. This provoked a series of revolts in 1843–1844, but they were suppressed by the Ottoman army.

After 1865, the central authorities redivided the Albanian lands between the &quot;vilayets&quot; of Scutari, Janina, and Monastir. The reforms angered the highland Albanian chieftains, who found their privileges reduced with no apparent compensation, and the authorities eventually abandoned efforts to control them. Ottoman troops crushed local rebellions in the lowlands, however, and conditions there remained bleak. The religious division of the northern Albanian tribes brought them into opposition. The Muslim northern Albanian tribes participated in the Ottoman campaigns against Christian Albanian tribes, such as in 1876 when they devastated the territory populated by the Mirditë Catholics. Large numbers of Tosks emigrated to join sizable Albanian émigré communities in Romania, Egypt, Bulgaria, Constantinople, southern Italy, and later the United States.

=== 20th century ===

In 1906, opposition groups in the Ottoman Empire emerged, one of which evolved into the Committee of Union and Progress, more commonly known as the Young Turks, which proposed restoring constitutional government in Constantinople, by revolution if necessary. In July 1908, a month after a Young Turk rebellion in Macedonia supported by an Albanian uprising in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia escalated into widespread insurrection and mutiny within the imperial army, Sultan Abdül Hamid II agreed to demands by the Young Turks to restore constitutional rule. Many Albanians participated in the Young Turks uprising, hoping that it would gain their people autonomy within the empire. The Young Turks lifted the Ottoman ban on Albanian-language schools and on writing the Albanian language. As a consequence, Albanian intellectuals meeting in Manastir (present day town of Bitola) in 1908 chose the Latin alphabet as a standard script. The Young Turks, however, were set on maintaining the empire and not interested in making concessions to the myriad nationalist groups within its borders. After securing the abdication of Abdül Hamid II in April 1909, the new authorities levied taxes, outlawed guerrilla groups and nationalist societies, and attempted to extend Constantinople&#x27;s control over the northern Albanian mountain men. In addition, the Young Turks legalized the bastinado, or beating with a stick, even for misdemeanors, banned carrying rifles, and denied the existence of an Albanian nationality. The new government also appealed for Islamic solidarity to break the Albanians&#x27; unity and used the Muslim clergy to try to impose the Arabic alphabet, while also banning the Albanian national flag.

The Albanians refused to submit to the Young Turks&#x27; campaign to &quot;Ottomanize&quot; them by force. New Albanian uprisings began in Kosovo and the northern mountains in early April 1910. Ottoman forces quashed these rebellions after three months, outlawed Albanian organizations, disarmed entire regions, and closed down schools and publications. Montenegro, preparing to grab Albanian-populated lands for itself, supported a 1911 uprising by the mountain tribes against the Young Turks regime that grew into a widespread revolt. Unable to control the Albanians by force, the Ottoman government granted concessions on schools, military recruitment, and taxation and sanctioned the use of the Latin script for the Albanian language. The government refused, however, to unite the four Albanian-inhabited vilayets into one, Albanian vilayet.

== Governance ==

Administratively, the Ottomans divided the Albanian-inhabited lands among a number of districts, or &quot;vilayets&quot;. The Ottoman authorities did not stress conversion to Islam and the conversion was done initially by Albanian nobles in the end of the 14th century and beginning of 15th one and was gradually accepted by the mass. The Ottomans persecuted non Muslim Albanians and murdered their children and women in masses and those whom they did not murder they cut their tongues or eyes, or they burnt their eyes, as mentioned in Meshari of Gjon Buzuku additional by Gjon Buzuku, when he talked of the treatment of the Albanian people by Turk governance.

By 1479, the entire country, except for Durrës, Ulcinj and Bar, was under Ottoman suzerainty. Prominent &quot;viziers&quot; and &quot;pashas&quot; hailed from Albania, and were appointed to their posts long before the majority of Albanians professed Islam.

=== Administrative divisions ===

: &quot;For details of&quot; : State Organization
The Ottoman sultan considered himself God&#x27;s agent on Earth, the leader of a religious—not a national—state whose purpose was to defend and propagate Islam. Non-Muslims paid extra taxes and held an inferior status, but they could retain their old religion and a large measure of local autonomy. By converting to Islam, individuals among the conquered could elevate themselves to the privileged stratum of society. In the early years of the empire, all Ottoman high officials were the sultan&#x27;s bondsmen the children of Christian subjects chosen in childhood for their promise, converted to Islam, and educated to serve. Some were selected from prisoners of war, others sent as gifts, and still others obtained through devshirme, the tribute of children levied in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Balkan lands. Many of the best fighters in the sultan&#x27;s elite guard, the janissaries, were conscripted as young boys from Christian Albanian families, and high-ranking Ottoman officials often had Albanian bodyguards.

=== Taxation ===

According to historian Zija Shkodra, Albania was developed as much as the rest of the Balkans . In the mountains north of the Shkumbini River, Geg herders maintained their self-governing society base on clans. An association of clans was called a bajrak.

Taxes on the northern tribes were difficult if not impossible for the Ottomans to collect because of the rough terrain and fierceness of the Albanian highlanders. Some mountain tribes succeeded in defending their independence through the centuries of Ottoman rule, engaging in intermittent guerrilla warfare with the Ottomans, who never deemed it worthwhile to subjugate them.

Until recent times, Geg clan chiefs, or bajraktars, exercised patriarchal powers, arranged marriages, mediated quarrels, and meted out punishments. The tribesmen of the northern Albanian mountains recognized no law but the Code of Lekë Dukagjini (Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit), a collection of tribal laws transcribed in the 14th century by a Roman Catholic priest. The code regulates a variety of subjects, including blood vengeance. Even today, many Albanian highlanders regard the canon as the supreme law of the land.

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===


Four centuries of Ottoman rule grouped the Albanian people along religious, regional, and tribal lines. In the 16th century and early 17th century, Albanians converted to Islam in large numbers. Within a century, the Muslim Albanian community was the largest religious community in the country, losing their previous entirely Orthodox and Catholic religious identity. Albanians in this time were divided into two distinct tribal and dialectal groupings: the Gegs and Tosks (see Albanian language). In the rugged northern mountains, Geg shepherds lived in a tribal society often completely independent of Ottoman rule. In the south, Muslim and Orthodox Tosks worked the land for Muslim beys, provincial rulers who frequently revolted against the sultan&#x27;s authority.

In the 15th and especially 16th and 17th centuries, many Albanian converts to Islam migrated elsewhere to escape the Ottoman Empire. Some attained powerful positions in the Ottoman administration, which severely disadvantaged the Catholic community since conversion to Islam came with numerous upper-class affiliations. About 48 Albanians rose to the position of grand vizier, chief deputy to the sultan himself. In the second half of the 17th century, the Albanian Köprülü family provided 6 grand viziers, who fought against corruption, temporarily shored up eroding central government control over rapacious local beys, and won several military victories by max expanding the Ottoman states to the gates of Vienna and middle Ukraine..

As early as the 18th century, a mystic Islamic sect, the Bektashi dervishes, spread into the empire&#x27;s Albanian-populated lands. Probably founded in the late 13th century in Anatolia, Bektashism became the janissaries&#x27; official faith in the late 16th century. The Bektashi sect contains features quite distinct from normative Islam and emphasizes man as a reflection of the Divine. Women, veiled, participate in Bektashi ceremonies and the celebrants use wine despite the ban on alcohol in most Islamic interpretations of the Sharia. The Bektashis became a fringe zealous religious group in southern Albania after the sultan disbanded the janissaries in 1826. Bektashi leaders played key roles in the Albanian nationalist movement of the late 19th century.

In the 19th century, the Ottoman sultans tried in vain to shore up their collapsing empire by introducing a series of reforms aimed at reining in recalcitrant local officials and dousing the fires of nationalism among its myriad peoples. The power of nationalism, however, proved too strong to counteract.

Nowadays, Albanians tend to not have strong affiliations to their varied religious identities as a result of about 50 years of Communist rule (especially under the regime of Enver Hoxha) that banned the practice of religion.

<text>Geraldine of Albania (born Countess Géraldine Margit Virginia Olga Mária Apponyi de Nagy-Appony; 6 August 1915 – 22 October 2002) was Queen of the Albanians from her marriage to King Zog I on 27 April 1938 until King Zog was deposed on 7 April of the following year.

Geraldine was born in Austria-Hungary into the noble Apponyi family. Her family fled to Switzerland in 1918, when the monarchy of Austria-Hungary was abolished. They returned to Hungary in 1921. However, after her father Gyula died in 1924, her American-born mother Gladys took Geraldine and her two siblings to live in Southern France. Later Geraldine was educated at a boarding school in Austria. She met King Zog in 1938, and they married shortly afterwards.

The Italian invasion of Albania cut short Zog&#x27;s reign. During World War II, Zog and Geraldine lived first in France and later in England. Later on, they would live in France again and in Egypt. After her husband died in Paris in 1961, Geraldine took the title Queen Mother and asserted the rights of her son Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, to rule. She and Leka fled successively to Spain, Rhodesia, and South Africa. Geraldine was allowed to return to Albania in 2002, and she died that year aged 87.

==Early life==

Geraldine was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, a daughter of Count Gyula Apponyi de Nagy-Appony (1873–1924), Grand Marshal of the Hungarian Court, of the old and noble Apponyi family which had been great landowners in Upper Hungary since the 13th century. Her mother was Gladys Virginia Stewart (1891–1947), an American, daughter of John Henry Stewart, a diplomat who served as US Consul in Antwerp, Belgium, and his wife Mary Virginia Ramsay Harding (later Mrs. Gustaf Stråle af Ekna), who both came from monied families of the New World, specifically Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina. Her parents got married on 29 July 1914, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Geneva, Switzerland.

When Geraldine was three, the Empire of Austria-Hungary collapsed, and the Apponyi family went to live in Switzerland. In 1921 they returned to the Kingdom of Hungary which was stable under Regent Miklós Horthy. However, when Geraldine&#x27;s father died in 1924, her mother and their three children (Geraldine, now nine, Virginia, and Gyula) went to live in the resort of Menton, in the south of France. When the Countess married a French officer, her Hungarian in-laws insisted that the children be returned to Hungary for their schooling. The girls were sent to the Sacred Heart boarding school in Pressbaum, near Vienna. Geraldine&#x27;s happy childhood then continued at the chateau Oponice (Appony) in present-day Slovakia, Apponyi ancestral family possessions in Slovakia; at the time, the part of Czechoslovakia (whose citizenship Geraldine gained). She lived there until 1938. Her family&#x27;s fortune spent, Geraldine earned a living as a shorthand typist. She also worked in the gift shop of the Budapest National Museum, where her uncle was the director.

==Royal life==

Geraldine was introduced in December 1937 to King Zog I of the Albanians, who had seen a photograph of her. She visited the Albanian Kingdom and within days the couple were engaged to be married. Known as the &quot;White Rose of Hungary&quot;, Geraldine was raised to royal status as Princess Geraldine of Albania prior to her wedding.
On 27 April 1938, in Tirana, Albania, Geraldine married the King in a ceremony witnessed by Galeazzo Ciano, envoy and son-in-law of Il Duce and Prime Minister of Italy, Benito Mussolini. She was Roman Catholic and King Zog was Muslim. Geraldine wore a new diamond tiara, specially commissioned from Austrian jewellers, featuring the motifs of the white rose for the bride, and the heraldic goat for the groom. They drove to their honeymoon in an open-top scarlet Mercedes-Benz 540K, a present from Adolf Hitler.

The couple had one son, Crown Prince Leka Zogu (1939–2011).

Zog&#x27;s rule was cut short by the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, and the family fled the country into exile. From April 1939, Geraldine and Zog fled Albania via Greece and Turkey and settled in France, and then in England. They lived in the Ritz Hotel, London, at Ascot and, for most of the war, at Parmoor House, Frieth, Buckinghamshire, England. In 1946 they went to Egypt, and then in 1952 to France. King Zog I died in Hauts-de-Seine, France, in 1961 and their son, Crown Prince Leka, was proclaimed King Leka I by the royalist government in exile on April 5. Following this, the royal family moved to Spain, Saudi Arabia, Rhodesia and then South Africa.

==Later life==
After her husband&#x27;s death, Geraldine preferred to be known as the &quot;Queen Mother of Albania&quot;. In 2001, Geraldine returned from South Africa to live in Albania, after the law was changed to allow her to do so. She continued to assert that her son Leka was the legitimate King of the Albanians.

Queen Geraldine of the Albanians died five months later at the age of 87 in a military hospital in Tirana. After being admitted for treatment for lung disease, she suffered at least three heart attacks, the last of which was fatal, on 22 October 2002. She was buried by the Central House of the Army with full honors, including a funeral oration at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on 26 October 2002, and interred in the Sharra cemetery, Albania, in the &quot;VIP plot&quot;. She was later reburied in the Royal Mausoleum in Tirana.

On 5 April 2004 her grandson, Leka, Crown Prince of Albania, accepted the Mother Teresa Medal awarded to her posthumously by the Albanian government in recognition of her charitable efforts for the people of Albania. Leka&#x27;s daughter Geraldine (born 22 October 2020 at Queen Geraldine Maternity Hospital in Tirana, on the 18th death anniversary of Queen Geraldine) was named in her honor.

<text>Olav Aukrust (21 January 1883 – 3 November 1929) was a Norwegian poet and teacher. He popularized the use of Nynorsk as a literary language and is most commonly associated with his poem &quot;Himmelvarden&quot; (1916).

==Biography==
Aukrust was born in the parish of Lom in Oppland, Norway. He was raised in the traditional region of Gudbrandsdal. His parents Olav Olavsson Aukrust (1851–1931) and Mari Pålsdatter Andvord (1864–1936) were farmers on the Nordgard Aukrust farm in the valley of Bøverdalen. His brother Lars Olsen Aukrust (1886–1965) was a teacher and local official. His nephews Odd Aukrust (1915 –2008) was an economist and Kjell Aukrust (1920–2002) was an author, poet and artist.

Aukrust was a student of the folk college at Romundgard in Sel operated by priest and educator Christopher Bruun (1839–1920). From 1915 to 1917, he worked as a teacher at the folk high school at Dovre where future novelist Ingeborg Møller (1878–1964) was also a teacher. He later taught at Gausdal.

In 1911, he married Gudrun Blekastad (1887–1984), daughter of Haugean businessman Ivar Blekastad (1850–1936). She was the sister of artist Hallvard Blekastad (1883–1966) and sister-in-law of literary historian Milada Blekastad (1917–2003).

He was strongly influenced by priest and author Ivar Mortensson-Egnund (1857–1934) who advocate of the use of Nynorsk. Aukrust wrote poems with a renewed national romantic style and used a characteristically similar form. His use of rural dialect contributed to the growth of Nynorsk as a literary language.
Olav Aukrust joined the Anthroposophical Society in December 1921 after he and his wife, Gudrun Aukrust, traveled through Goetheanum on their way home from Italy. He suffered from tuberculosis, which came to characterize his last year and led to an early death at age 46.

==Legacy==
Nordgard Aukrust is now open to the public. The farm has a large garden and offers the sales of agricultural products during the tourist season. 
Sculptor Dyre Vaa designed the Olav Aukrust statue (bronze, 1952) which was installed at Lom in 1952.

<text>Advanced Placement (AP) is a program in the United States and Canada created by the College Board. AP offers undergraduate university-level curricula and examinations to high school students. Colleges and universities in the US and elsewhere may grant placement and course credit to students who obtain qualifying scores on the examinations.

The AP curriculum for each of the various subjects is created for the College Board by a panel of experts and college-level educators in that academic discipline. For a high school course to have the designation as offering an AP course, the course must be audited by the College Board to ascertain that it satisfies the AP curriculum as specified in the Board&#x27;s Course and Examination Description (CED). If the course is approved, the school may use the AP designation and the course will be publicly listed on the AP Course Ledger.

==History==
===20th century===
After the end of World War II, the Ford Foundation created a fund that supported committees studying education. The program, which was then referred to as the &quot;Kenyon Plan&quot;, was founded and pioneered at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, by the then-college president Gordon Chalmers. The first study was conducted by four prep schools—the Lawrenceville School, Phillips Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy, and St. Paul&#x27;s School —and three universities—Harvard University, Princeton University and Yale University. In 1952 they issued the report &quot;General Education in School and College: A Committee Report&quot; which recommended allowing high school seniors to study college-level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work. The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and implemented the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines. In the 1955–56 school year, it was nationally implemented in ten subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, History, French, German, Spanish, and Latin.

The College Board, a non-profit organization based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955.

From 1965 to 1989, Harlan Hanson was the director of the Advanced Placement Program. It develops and maintains guidelines for the teaching of higher-level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses and supports universities. These activities are funded through fees required to take the AP exams.

===21st century===
In 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations. Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses, though the College Board allows any student to take any examination regardless of participation in its respective course. Therefore, home-schooled students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take AP exams.

In 2007, hedge fund manager and philanthropist Whitney Tilson helped create a $1 million program (called Reach, for Rewarding Achievement) funded by philanthropists to pay students in 25 public schools and six Roman Catholic private schools in New York City who do well on Advanced Placement exams. High school students receiving a top score of five on one of the exams earned $1,000 (a four was worth $750, and a three was worth $500). The schools chosen for the program all had a high proportion of low-income black or Latino students. Tilson approached the Pershing Square Foundation to finance the project, and it agreed to give the project $1 million for its first year.

As of the 2024 testing season, exams cost $98 each, though the cost may be subsidized by local or state programs. Financial aid is available for students who qualify for it; the exam reduction is $36 per exam from College Board plus an additional $9 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further reductions depending on the state.

On April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses—French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture—would be discontinued after the 2008–2009 school year due to lack of funding. However, the Italian Language and Culture test was again offered beginning in 2011.

Starting July 2013 AP allowed students for the first time to both view and send their scores online.

The number of AP exams administered each year has seen a steady increase over the past decade. In 2003, 175,860 English Language and Composition exams were administered. By 2013, this number had risen to 476,277, or an increase of 171%. Such an increase has occurred in nearly all AP exams offered, with the AP Psychology exam seeing a 281% increase over the past decade. In 2022, the most taken AP exam was English Language and Composition with 520,771 students and the least taken AP exam was Italian Language and Culture with 2,194 students.

In the 2022–2023 school year, College Board launched a pilot AP African American Studies course. The course is currently acknowledged credit at about 75 colleges and universities.

AP exams begin on the second Monday in May and last ten school days.

==Scoring==
AP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:

*5 – Extremely well qualified
*4 – Well qualified
*3 – Qualified
*2 – Possibly qualified
*1 – No recommendation
The multiple-choice component of the exam is scored by computer, while the free-response and essay portions are scored by trained Readers at the AP Reading each June. The scores on various components are weighted and combined into a raw Composite Score. The Chief Reader for each exam then decides on the grade cutoffs for that year&#x27;s exam, which determine how the Composite Scores are converted into the final grades. During the process, a number of reviews and statistical analyses are performed to ensure that the grading is reliable. The overall goal is for the grades to reflect an absolute scale of performance which can be compared from year to year.

Some colleges use AP test scores to exempt students from introductory coursework, others use them to place students in higher designated courses, and some do both. Each college&#x27;s policy is different, but most require a minimum score of 3 or 4 to receive college credit. Typically, this appears as a &quot;CR&quot; grade on the college transcript, although some colleges and universities will award an A grade for a 5 score. Some countries, such as Germany, that do not offer general admission to their universities and colleges for holders of an American high school diploma without preparatory courses will directly admit students who have completed a specific set of AP tests, depending on the subject they wish to study there.

In addition, completing AP courses helps students qualify for various types of scholarships. According to the College Board, 31 percent of colleges and universities look at AP experience when making scholarship decisions.

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, the College Board changed the scoring method of AP Exams. Total scores on the multiple-choice section are now based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers and, as was the case before, no points are awarded for unanswered questions. However, scoring requirements have also been increased.

==Score reporting==
Starting with the May 2013 AP Examination Administration, the College Board launched an Internet-based score reporting service. Students can use their 2013 AP Number or Student Number (if one was indicated) along with a College Board Account to access current and previous years&#x27; exam scores. This system can also be used to send scores to colleges and universities for which a four-digit institutional code is assigned.

==Exam subsidies==

Recognizing that the cost could be an impediment to students of limited means, a number of states and municipalities independent of the College Board have partially or fully subsidized the cost. The state of Florida reimburses school districts for the exam costs of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the Montebello Unified School District, the Hawaii Department of Education, New York City Department of Education, and the state of Indiana subsidize Examination fees in subjects of math, science, and English, and the Edmonds School District in suburban Seattle currently subsidizes Advanced Placement fees of students who enroll in the free school lunch program. Some school districts, such as Fairfax County Public Schools, will fully cover the cost of a limited number of exams, after which point the student must pay. In addition, some school districts offer free tests to all students enrolled in any Advanced Placement class.

==Courses==

===Current subjects===
There are currently 40 courses and exams available through the AP Program.

===Courses in development===

In 2024, the College Board announced pilot programs for several new AP exams as part of the AP Career Kickstart program:
*AP Cyber: Networking
*AP Cyber: Security
*AP Business Principles/Personal Finance
*AP Anatomy and Physiology
In the announcement, the College Board additionally noted that &quot;We plan to build out multiple career and technical education (CTE) pathways in information technology (networking, cybersecurity, coding) and additional pathways in business and health sciences.&quot;

In 2018, when the AP World History exam was discontinued, the College Board announced their commitment to developing two replacement courses, AP World History: Ancient and AP World History: Modern, but so far only the Modern course has launched, with the Ancient course still in development.

===Discontinued courses===

Over the decades that the AP program has run, several AP courses and exams have been discontinued or replaced, including
* Computer Science AB (discontinued 2009)
* International English Language (discontinued 2002)
* French Literature (discontinued 2009)
* German Literature (discontinued 1983)

==Recent exam information==
Below are statistics from the 2023 exam cycle showing the number of participants, the percentage who obtained a score of 3 or higher, and the mean score. Students generally need a score of 3 or higher to receive credit or benefit.

The College Board estimates that about 2/3 of students enrolled in an AP course take the course&#x27;s AP test. On the other hand, a study of University of California system students found that only about 55% to 60% of AP students took their course&#x27;s exam.

One 2014 study of math and science AP courses showed that participation rates were 52.7% for AP Chemistry, 53.6% for AP Physics, 57.7% for AP Biology, and 77.4% for AP Calculus. A 2017 study found similar participation rates (49.5% for AP Chemistry, 52.3% for AP Physics, 54.5% for Biology, and 68.9% for Calculus). History exams were found to have slightly higher participation rates (57.9% for AP European History, 58.5% for AP World History, and 62.8% for AP U.S. History), and 65.4% of AP English students took either the AP English Language or AP English Literature exam. This study found that for &quot;core AP subjects (i.e., no arts or language subjects)&quot;, the overall test participation rate was 60.8%.

In February 2014 College Board released data from the previous ten years of AP exams. College Board found that 33.2% of public high school graduates from the class of 2013 had taken an AP exam, compared to 18.9% in 2003. In 2013 20.1% of graduates who had taken an AP test achieved a 3 or higher compared to 12.2% in 2003.

==Criticism==

===Decreasing quality===

Lichten appears to have been the first to question whether AP can maintain high academic standards while experiencing explosive growth. Whether the AP program can serve large numbers of students well is a matter of some concern within the education field.

===Passing scores and university credit===
A 2024 report stated that students who receive scores of 3 and higher are being given college credit at fewer top colleges and universities. Also in 2024, Hess noted that an increasing proportion of students who take and pass AP courses is not ready for college-level work.

===Academic achievement===
A 2010 study of the impact of the Advanced Placement program on students&#x27; academic achievement found that students who took AP courses in the sciences but failed the AP exam performed no better in college science courses than students without any AP course at all. Referring to students who complete the course but fail the exam, the head researcher, Phillip M. Sadler, stated in an interview that &quot;research shows that they don&#x27;t appear to have learned anything during the year, so there is probably a better course for them.&quot;

Two subsequent studies compared non-AP students with AP students who had not taken their course&#x27;s AP exam, had taken the AP exam but did not pass it, or had passed the AP exam. Like Sadler&#x27;s study, both found that AP students who passed their exam scored highest in other measures of academic achievement. The largest study of this sort, with a sample size of over 90,000, replicated these results and also showed that non-AP students performed with equal levels of academic achievement as AP students who did not take their course&#x27;s AP exam—even after controlling for over 70 intervening variables. This led the authors to state that AP participation &quot;is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses...&quot;

Some researchers have questioned the validity of Advanced Placement scores or Advanced Placement as an effective form of positive reinforcement. It is argued that the pursuit of extrinsic reward is not an accurate reflection of intrinsic interest in course material. Many other criteria should also be employed to judge a student including standardized test scores, research experience, breadth and the level of courses taken, and academic-related extracurriculars performance. Writing honors thesis or semi-independent research in a subject may be more signal of interest or academic potential than achieving the label of &quot;Advanced Placement&quot; student.

<doc id="291430" wikidata="Q11157270" url="?curid=291430" title="Hula Hoops">
<text>Hula Hoops are a snack food made out of potatoes and corn in the shape of short, hollow cylinders. They were created by KP Snacks in the United Kingdom in 1973. As well as being sold in the UK, they are also sold in the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa. Hula Hoops are also sold in Belgium under the &quot;Croky&quot; tag, made in the UK but marketed and distributed from Mouscron, Belgium. In France, Hula Hoops are produced by Vico. 

Hula Hoops come in different flavours, and are made by parent company KP Snacks. In 2008, KP started a new variety made with corn called &#x27;Hula Hoops Tortilla&#x27;, which come in Cool Original, Chilli Salsa, and Nacho Cheese flavours.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the distribution of Hula Hoops is limited in Asia and South America. Regular distribution was scheduled to proceed in October 2021.

==Flavours and packet colours ==
Currently available flavours are:
*BBQ Beef (brown)
* Cheese &amp; Onion (green)
* Original (red)
* Roast Chicken (mustard)
* Salt &amp; Vinegar (blue)
* Smoky Bacon (purple)
Other flavours have included:
* Sweet Chilli (pink)
* Tikka (deep purple)
* Crisp Roulette (dark red)
* Tangy Cheese (light orange)

==Former flavours==
The following flavours were available for a short time, either because they tied-in with special promotions, or failed to meet sales expectations:

* Barbecue (brown)
* Beef and Mustard (black &#x27;Big O&#x27;s&#x27; &amp; XL bag)
* Cheese (yellow)
* Prawn Cocktail (purple)
* Sour Cream and Chive (dark green)
* Tomato Ketchup (blue)
* Vanilla Cream (dark pink crisp roulette bag)

==Variations==
===Big O&#x27;s===
In 1998, KP launched &#x27;Big O&#x27;s&#x27; from Hula Hoops, using comedians Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse in their advertising campaign as their characters the Self-Righteous Brothers. Big O&#x27;s were larger-than-normal Hula Hoops, packaged in larger bags and only available in Beef &amp; Mustard flavour. The bag design used a black background featuring a large Big O&#x27;s logo. A smaller Hula Hoops logo featured in the bottom-corner whilst the flavour was in the opposite bottom-corner. Big O&#x27;s are no longer in production, nor available.

===Shoks===
For a short while in the early 2000s, KP produced Hula Hoops Shoks. These were miniature versions of the classic Hula Hoop, but had a much more intense flavour than the bags. They were packaged in either a stiff flexible plastic cube, or in a small resealable pot. The launch was first announced in March 2002, to be available in April, with KP claiming that the product would &quot;revolutionise the snacks market&quot;. The company made a £4m investment in Shoks during the first eight weeks, with marketing controller Clare Robinson saying: &quot;Complacency is not a Hula Hoops value and we wanted to rewrite some of the rules.&quot; According to the &quot;Morning Advertiser&quot;, Robinson said that consumer sampling had been &quot;overwhelmingly successful&quot;. She added: &quot;We&#x27;ve never experienced a reaction like it&quot;. Shoks were aimed at the 12 to 24-year old market, and KP estimated that they could earn over £10m in sales during its first year.

They were available in the following flavours:

* Totally Cheesy (orange, cube)
* Beef (brown, pot)
* Pickled Onion (green, cube)
* Sweet Chilli (pink, cube or pot)
* Salt and Vinegar (blue, cube)
* Rib and Saucy (purple, cube)

===Hula Hoops XL===
In 2001, KP launched Hula Hoops XL, which were larger-than-normal Hula Hoops, much like the previous Big O&#x27;s incarnation. They were packaged in larger bags and were available in a limited range of flavours; however, they recorded poor sales and were soon dropped. Each bag was black with a large XL logo on the front, with the flavour overlaid. They were available in the following flavours:

* Beef &amp; Mustard
* Chilli
* Nacho cheese
* Curry

===Frozen Hula Hoops===
In late 1999, KP produced Hula Hoops that could be cooked at home. Frozen Hula hoops were not a crisp-based snack; instead, they resembled hash browns. They began production again in 2013 as part of a range of frozen versions of crisps, this time exclusive to Iceland stores. , they are available in the following flavours:

* Original Salted (red)
* BBQ Beef (brown)

===Big Hoops===
In 2011, XL had a successor, Big Hoops. Essentially the same design as the XL range, they were targeted towards adults who had memories of placing regular sized hoops onto their fingers, but could no longer do so. , they were available in £1 price marked packs (87.4g) and &#x27;Grab Bag&#x27; impulse packs (50g). 160g bags were once also produced. Big Hoops have been available in the following flavours:

* Salted, formerly Original (red)
* Sour Cream &amp; Chive (dark green) (discontinued)
* Sweet Chilli (pink) (discontinued)
* BBQ Beef (brown)
*Chilli (black) (discontinued)
*Spicy Chilli (magenta)
*Salt &amp; Vinegar (blue)

=== Puft ===
KP Snacks launched Hula Hoops Puft, a &quot;lighter version&quot; of the product, in early 2015. Available in a 20g &quot;handy pack&quot;, the product came in a cheese flavour, which was said to be &quot;a first for the brand&quot;. KP&#x27;s trading controller in convenience Matt Collins commented: &quot;Hula Hoops is an £83million brand and we are extremely excited to grow this further with an all-new concept. Hula Hoops Puft will bring to life the fun element of the brand, whilst engaging with those in search of a lighter snack. Innovation is incredibly important for our future product development and Hula Hoops Puft is a perfect example of this.&quot; Puft is a registered trademark. They are described on the packs as &quot;Light and crispy puffed hoops&quot;.

, Puft is available in four flavours:

* Salted (red)
* Sweet Chili (purple)
* Salt &amp; Vinegar (blue)
* Beef (brown)

===Flavarings===
In May 2018, KP began production of Hula Hoops Flavarings in both Salt and Vinegar and Tangy Cheese flavours. Flavarings are a larger ring than standard Hula Hoops, and are maize-based, rather than potato, leading to a different texture, more akin Monster Munch than traditional Hula Hoops. They are described on the packets as &quot;Big crispy bursts of flavour&quot;.

, the product is available in the following flavours:

* Tangy Cheese (yellow)
* Salt &amp; Vinegar (blue)
* Spicy (red)

==Nutritional information==
Each 24g (formerly 25g) multipack bag of the original Hula Hoops contains around 120 calories. They also contain 0.8g of protein, 15.4g of carbohydrates, 6g of fat, 0.5g of fibre, and 0.2g of sodium. These values vary between flavours.

==Marketing slogans/formula ==
* &quot;Now 55% less Saturated Fat - Same great taste&quot;
* &quot;Cooked with 100% Sunflower Oil&quot;
* &quot;Best ever flavour&quot;
* &quot;Amazing taste and satisfaction&quot;
* &quot;Now no artificial flavours, colours, or MSG. Same great taste!&quot;

==Charity activities==
In 2010, Hula Hoops partnered with Sport Relief to organize mass hula hoop displays. The &quot;Hoopathons&quot; were on Sunday 21 March, and 1,388 people took part to set a Guinness World Record-breaking largest number of people to hula-hoop simultaneously across the United Kingdom for two minutes.

<doc id="291435" wikidata="Q336096" url="?curid=291435" title="Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset">
<text>Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset (c. 158717 July 1645), was a politician, and favourite of King James VI and I.

==Background==

Robert Kerr was born in Wrington, Somerset, England, the younger son of Sir Thomas Kerr (Carr) of Ferniehurst, Scotland, by his second wife, Janet Scott, sister of Walter Scott of Buccleuch. About the year 1601, while an obscure page to Sir George Home, he met Thomas Overbury in Edinburgh. The two became friends and travelled to London together. Overbury soon became Carr&#x27;s secretary. When Carr embarked on his career at court, Overbury became mentor, secretary, and political advisor to his more charismatic friend, the brain behind Carr&#x27;s steady rise to prominence.

==King&#x27;s favourite==

In 1607, Carr happened to break his leg at a tilting match, at which King James VI and I was in attendance. According to Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, the king taught him Latin. The king subsequently knighted the young Carr and took him into favour. Sir Walter Raleigh had, through his attainder, forfeited his life-interest in the manor of Sherborne, even though he had previously executed a conveyance by which the property was to pass on his death to his eldest son (a conveyance which helped to codify many aspects of the English use of primogeniture, still in practice even today). Unfortunately for Raleigh, this document was rendered worthless by a flaw that gave the king eventual possession of the property. Acting on the advice of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, his Secretary of State, James conferred the manor on Carr. The case was argued at law, and in 1609 judgment was given for the Crown. Apparently Lady Raleigh received some inadequate compensation, and Carr at once entered on possession.

Carr&#x27;s influence became such that in 1610 he was instrumental in persuading the king to dissolve Parliament, which had shown signs of attacking the king&#x27;s Scottish favourites. On 24 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester, and subsequently a Privy Councillor.

The royal court was aware by June 1612 that Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry did not hold Robert Carr in such high regard. Thomas Erskine, Viscount Fenton wrote that &quot;Rochester is exceeding great with his Majesty ..., yet can he not find the right way to please either the Queen or the Prince, but they are both in the conceit of this Court not well satisfied with him&quot;.

==Marriage to Frances Howard==

When Salisbury died in 1612, James had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with Carr carrying out many of Salisbury&#x27;s former duties and acting as the king&#x27;s secretary. But James&#x27; inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism. The Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton; Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk; his son-in-law William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Sir Thomas Lake, soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers, fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk.

Overbury mistrusted the Howards and still had Carr&#x27;s ear, and tried to prevent the marriage. In order to remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to Anne of Denmark. They then persuaded the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar Michael of Russia, aware that his refusal would be tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, wishing to remain in England and at his friend&#x27;s side. On 22 April 1613 Overbury was placed in the Tower of London at the king&#x27;s &quot;request&quot;, eventually dying there five months later on 15 September &quot;of natural causes&quot;.

On 25 September 1613, and supported by the king, Lady Essex obtained a decree of nullity of marriage against her husband, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. On 3 November 1613 Carr was advanced to the Earldom of Somerset, on 23 December appointed Treasurer of Scotland. On 26 December, Lady Essex married Carr at Whitehall Palace. King James gave Somerset a sword with a gold hilt and scabbard and jewels said to be worth £10,000 to his bride. Wedding festivities included &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; and the &quot;The Masque of Flowers&quot;, depicting a scene in Virginia. On 4 January 1614, the Lord Mayor&#x27;s masque, Thomas Middleton&#x27;s lost &quot;Masque of Cupids&quot;, was performed at the Merchant Taylor&#x27;s Hall to celebrate the wedding.

==Power, scandal, and downfall==
In 1614 Carr was appointed Lord Chamberlain. He supported the earl of Northampton and the Spanish party in opposition to the old tried advisers of the king, such as the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, who were endeavouring to maintain the union with the Protestants abroad. As the years progressed James showered Somerset with more gifts, until 1615 when the two men had a falling out and Somerset was replaced by George Villiers (whom James made Duke of Buckingham). James wrote a letter that year detailing a list of complaints he then had against Somerset. Somerset still retained some favour, and might possibly have remained in power for some time longer but for the discovery in July of the murder of Overbury by poisoning. At the infamous trial Edward Coke and Francis Bacon were set to unravel the plot.

Eventually, four people had been convicted for taking part in the murder, and hanged at Tyburn at the end of 1615. They were Sir Gervase Helwys, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, Richard Weston, a gaoler, Mrs Anne Turner, a &quot;waiting woman&quot; of Frances Howard, and an apothecary called Franklin. Sir Thomas Monson, 1st Baronet of Carlton was also implicated in the case, but the charges against him were later dropped.

Somerset and Howard were brought to trial in the spring of 1616. The latter confessed, and her guilt is widely accepted. Somerset&#x27;s share is far more difficult to uncover, and probably will never be fully known. The evidence against him rested on mere presumption, and he consistently declared himself innocent. Probabilities are on the whole in favour of the hypothesis that he was no more than an accessory after the fact.

Fearing Somerset might seek to implicate him, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon stating, &quot;It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime&quot;.

The king eventually let matters take their course, and both Somerset and Howard were found guilty and confined to the Tower. The sentence, however, was not carried into effect against either culprit. Howard was pardoned immediately, but both remained in the Tower until 1622. Somerset appears to have refused to buy forgiveness by concessions, and did not obtain his pardon until 1624.

He emerged into public view only once more when, in 1630, he was prosecuted in the Star Chamber for communicating a paper recommending the establishment of arbitrary government by Robert Dudley to John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare.

Somerset died in July 1645, leaving one daughter, Anne, the sole issue of his ill-fated marriage, afterwards wife of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford.

== Material culture ==
An inventory of the Earl of Somerset&#x27;s possessions was made in November 1615 at the request of Sir Edward Coke. The Earl&#x27;s servant Walter James helped make the inventory of the forty rooms of his lodgings at Whitehall Palace. There was a bed with gilt pillars hung with purple velvet curtains and lined with yellow silk damask, tapestries of the Trojan wars and Roman history, and two Irish harps, a theorbo, and a lute. Somerset had over 100 paintings in a picture gallery in a former bowling alley, the subjects included the Adoration of Shepherds, The Wise Men, and Samson and Delilah. Sir George More was given custody of his jewels and plate, including diamond buttons and hatbands. George More returned a diamond-set chain to the goldsmith George Heriot, as Somerset had not paid the £250 bill. Some of Somerset&#x27;s tapestries and paintings were put in the custody of his friend, the Scottish courtier Henry Gibb.

Somerset may have begun collecting paintings to cement his position at court. He gave instructions to the diplomat William Trumbull to buy for him in Brussels. His agents in Venice were Isaac Wake and Dudley Carleton. Carleton worked with Daniel Nys to supply fifteen paintings including works by Tintoretto for the Bowling Alley gallery and twenty-nine cases of antique (ancient Greek and Roman) marbles. The marbles arrived after Somerset&#x27;s disgrace and Carleton had difficulties finding another buyer.

==In popular culture==
The rise and fall of Robert Carr and his relationship to Thomas Overbury are the subject of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;The Minion&quot;, written shortly before Sabatini&#x27;s divorce from his first wife in 1931.

Laurie Davidson portrays him in the miniseries, &quot;Mary &amp; George&quot;.

<doc id="291436" wikidata="Q2931725" url="?curid=291436" title="Chemiluminescence">
<text>Chemiluminescence (also chemoluminescence) is the emission of light (luminescence) as the result of a chemical reaction, i.e. a chemical reaction results in a flash or glow of light. A standard example of chemiluminescence in the laboratory setting is the luminol test. Here, blood is indicated by luminescence upon contact with iron in hemoglobin. When chemiluminescence takes place in living organisms, the phenomenon is called bioluminescence. A light stick emits light by chemiluminescence.
==Physical description==
As in many chemical reactions, chemiluminescence starts with the combining of two compounds, say A and B, to give a product C. Unlike most chemical reactions, the product C converts to a further product, which is produced in an electronically excited state often indicated with an asterisk:
: A + B → C
: C → D*
D* then emits a photon (&quot;h&quot;ν), to give the ground state of D: I
: D* → D + &quot;h&quot;ν
In theory, one photon of light should be given off for each molecule of reactant. In practice, the yield (&quot;quantum efficiency&quot;) is often low owing to side reactions.

For example, A could be luminol and B could be hydrogen peroxide. D would be 3-APA (3-aminophthalate).

Chemiluminescence differs from fluorescence or phosphorescence in that the electronic excited state is the product of a chemical reaction rather than of the absorption of a photon. It is the antithesis of a photochemical reaction, in which light is used to drive an endothermic chemical reaction. Here, light is &quot;generated&quot; from a chemically exothermic reaction. The chemiluminescence might be also induced by an electrochemical stimulus, in this case is called electrochemiluminescence.

== Liquid-phase reactions ==
Chemiluminescence was first observed with lophine (triphenylimidazole). When in basic solution, this compound converts to the imidazolate, which reacts with oxygen to eventually give a dioxetane. Fragmentation of the dioxetane gives the excited state of an anionic diamide. 

Chemiluminescence in aqueous system is mainly caused by redox reactions.

* Luminol in an alkaline solution with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of iron or copper, or an auxiliary oxidant, produces 3-aminophtalate in an excited state, which exhibits chemiluminescence. The luminol reaction is

:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{luminol}{C8H7N3O2} + \underset{hydrogen\ peroxide}{H2O2} -&gt; 3-APA[\lozenge] -&gt; {3-APA} + light&lt;/chem&gt;

== Gas-phase reactions ==

* One of the oldest known chemiluminescent reactions is that of elemental white phosphorus oxidizing in moist air, producing a green glow. This is a gas-phase reaction of phosphorus vapor, above the solid, with oxygen producing excited states of and HPO.
* Another gas phase reaction is the basis of nitric oxide detection in commercial analytic instruments applied to environmental air-quality testing. Ozone () is combined with nitric oxide (NO) to form nitrogen dioxide () in an activated state [◊]:

::&lt;chem&gt;NO{} + O3 -&gt; NO2[\lozenge ]{} + O2&lt;/chem&gt;

:The activated luminesces broadband visible to infrared light as it reverts to a lower energy state. A photomultiplier and associated electronics counts the photons that are proportional to the amount of NO present. To determine the amount of nitrogen dioxide, , in a sample (containing no NO) it must first be converted to nitric oxide, NO, by passing the sample through a converter before the above ozone activation reaction is applied. The ozone reaction produces a photon count proportional to NO that is proportional to before it was converted to NO. In the case of a mixed sample that contains both NO and , the above reaction yields the amount of NO and combined in the air sample, assuming that the sample is passed through the converter. If the mixed sample is not passed through the converter, the ozone reaction produces activated only in proportion to the NO in the sample. The in the sample is not activated by the ozone reaction. Though unactivated is present with the activated , photons are emitted only by the activated species that is proportional to original NO. Final step: Subtract NO from () to yield 

== Infrared chemiluminescence ==
In chemical kinetics, &quot;infrared chemiluminiscence&quot; (IRCL) refers to the emission of infrared photons from vibrationally excited product molecules immediately after their formation. The intensities of infrared emission lines from vibrationally excited molecules are used to measure the populations of vibrational states of product molecules.

The observation of IRCL was developed as a kinetic technique by John Polanyi, who used it to study the attractive or repulsive nature of the potential energy surface for gas-phase reactions. In general the IRCL is much more intense for reactions with an attractive surface, indicating that this type of surface leads to energy deposition in vibrational excitation. In contrast reactions with a repulsive potential energy surface lead to little IRCL, indicating that the energy is primarily deposited as translational energy.

== Enhanced chemiluminescence ==
Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) is a common technique for a variety of detection assays in biology. A horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest. This enzyme complex then catalyzes the conversion of the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate into a sensitized reagent in the vicinity of the molecule of interest, which on further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, produces a triplet (excited) carbonyl, which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl. Enhanced chemiluminescence allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities, well below the detection limit for most assay systems.

== Applications ==
* Gas analysis: for determining small amounts of impurities or poisons in air. Other compounds can also be determined by this method (ozone, &quot;N&quot;-oxides, &quot;S&quot;-compounds). A typical example is NO determination with detection limits down to 1 ppb. Highly specialised chemiluminescence detectors have been used recently to determine concentrations as well as fluxes of NO&quot;x&quot; with detection limits as low as 5 ppt.
* Analysis of inorganic species in liquid phase
* Analysis of organic species: useful with enzymes, where the substrate is not directly involved in the chemiluminescence reaction, but the product is
* Detection and assay of biomolecules in systems such as ELISA and Western blots
* DNA sequencing using pyrosequencing
* Lighting objects. Chemiluminescence kites, emergency lighting, glow sticks (party decorations).
* Combustion analysis: Certain free radical species (such as •CH and •OH) give off radiation at specific wavelengths. The heat release rate is calculated by measuring the amount of light radiated from a flame at those wavelengths.
* Children&#x27;s toys.

== Biological applications ==
Chemiluminescence has been applied by forensic scientists to solve crimes. In this case, they use luminol and hydrogen peroxide. The iron from the blood acts as a catalyst and reacts with the luminol and hydrogen peroxide to produce blue light for about 30 seconds. Because only a small amount of iron is required for chemiluminescence, trace amounts of blood are sufficient.

In biomedical research, the protein that gives fireflies their glow and its co-factor, luciferin, are used to produce red light through the consumption of ATP. This reaction is used in many applications, including the effectiveness of cancer drugs that choke off a tumor&#x27;s blood supply. This form of bioluminescence imaging allows scientists to test drugs in the pre-clinical stages cheaply.
Another protein, aequorin, found in certain jellyfish, produces blue light in the presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions have in common is their use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with luminol.

:&lt;chem&gt;Luciferin{} + O2{} + ATP -&gt;[\text{Luciferase}] Oxyluciferin{} + CO2{} + AMP{} + PPi{} + light&lt;/chem&gt;
Many organisms have evolved to produce light in a range of colors. At the molecular level, the difference in color arises from the degree of conjugation of the molecule, when an electron drops down from the excited state to the ground state. Deep sea organisms have evolved to produce light to lure and catch prey, as camouflage, or to attract others. Some bacteria even use bioluminescence to communicate. The common colors for the light emitted by these animals are blue and green because they have shorter wavelengths than red and can transmit more easily in water.

In April 2020, researchers reported having genetically engineered plants glow much brighter than previously possible by inserting genes of the bioluminescent mushroom &quot;Neonothopanus nambi&quot;. The glow is self-sustained, works by converting plants&#x27; caffeic acid into luciferin and, unlike for bacterial bioluminescence genes used earlier, has a relatively high light output that is visible to the naked eye.

Chemiluminescence is different from fluorescence. Hence, fluorescent proteins such as Green fluorescent protein are not chemiluminescent. However, combining GFP with luciferases allows bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), which increases the quantum yield of light emitted in these systems.

<text>A glow stick, also known as a light stick, chem light, light wand, light rod, and rave light, is a self-contained, short-term light-source. It consists of a translucent plastic tube containing isolated substances that, when combined, make light through chemiluminescence. The light cannot be turned off and can be used only once. The used tube is then thrown away. Glow sticks are often used for recreation, such as for events, camping, outdoor exploration, and concerts. Glow sticks are also used for light in military and emergency services applications. Industrial uses include marine, transportation, and mining.

== History ==
Bis(2,4,5-trichloro-6-(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl)oxalate, trademarked &quot;Cyalume&quot;, was invented in 1971 by Michael M. Rauhut, of American Cyanamid, based on work by Edwin A. Chandross and David Iba Sr. of Bell Labs.

Other early work on chemiluminescence was carried out at the same time, by researchers under Herbert Richter at China Lake Naval Weapons Center.

Several US patents for glow stick-type devices were issued in 1973–74. A later 1976 patent recommended a single glass ampoule that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the signal device so it could be thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single glass ampoule inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today.

In the early 1980s the majority of glow sticks were produced in Novato, California by Omniglow Corp. Omniglow completed a leveraged buyout of American Cyanamid&#x27;s chemical light division in 1994 and became the leading supplier of glow sticks worldwide until going out of business in 2014. Most glow sticks seen today are now made in China.

== Uses ==
Glow sticks are waterproof, do not use batteries, consume no oxygen, generate no or negligible heat, produce neither spark nor flame, can tolerate high pressures such as those found under water, are inexpensive, and are reasonably disposable. This makes them ideal as light sources and light markers by military forces, campers, spelunkers, and recreational divers.

=== Entertainment ===
Glowsticking is the use of glow sticks in dancing (such as in glow poi and wotagei). They are frequently used for entertainment at parties (in particular raves), concerts, and dance clubs. They are used by marching band conductors for evening performances; glow sticks are also used in festivals and celebrations around the world. Glow sticks also serve multiple functions as toys, readily visible night-time warnings to motorists, and luminous markings that enable parents to keep track of their children. Another use is for balloon-carried light effects. Glow sticks are also used to create special effects in low light photography and film.

The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; recorded the world&#x27;s largest glow stick was cracked at tall. It was created by the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater&#x27;s Chemistry Department to celebrate the school&#x27;s sesquicentennial, or 150th birthday in Whitewater, Wisconsin and cracked on 9 September 2018.

=== Recreation and survival ===
Glow sticks are used for outdoor recreation, often used at night for marking. Scuba divers use diving-rated glow sticks to mark themselves during night dives. This is done to enable visibility of bioluminescent marine organisms, which cannot be seen while a bright dive light is illuminated. Glow sticks are used on backpacks, tent pegs, and on jackets during overnight camping expeditions. Often, glow sticks are recommended as an addition to survival kits.

=== Industry ===
There are specific industrial uses of glow sticks, which are often used as a light source in circumstances where electric lighting and LEDs are not best suited. For example, in the mining industry, glow sticks are required for emergency evacuation in the case of a gas leak. Use of an electric light source in this case may cause an unintended explosion. Chemiluminescence, the type of light used in glow sticks, is a &quot;cold-light&quot; and does not use electricity, and will not cause a gas leak to ignite. 

Glow sticks are also used worldwide in the marine industry, often used as fishing lures in long-line, recreational, and commercial fishing, as well as for personnel safety.

=== Military ===
Glow sticks were originally invented by the US Military, and are an essential part of military operations across land and sea, where they are more often referred to as chem lights. Glow sticks are also used within police tactical units, as light sources during night operations or close-quarters combat in dark areas. They are also used to mark secured areas or objects of note. When worn, they can be used to identify friendly soldiers during nighttime operations. 
For search and rescue operations, glow sticks are often used during Man Overboard rescue scenarios to create a glowing trail back to the last known location of someone who is lost at sea.

=== Emergency services ===
Glow sticks are used by police, fire, and emergency medical services as light sources, similar to their military applications. Often, emergency rescue crews will hand out glow sticks in order to keep track of people at night, who may not have access to their own lighting. Glow sticks are sometimes attached to life vests and lifeboats on passenger and commercial vessels, to ensure night time visibility. 

Glow sticks are often part of emergency kits to provide basic lighting and provide ease of identification in dark areas. They can be found in emergency lighting kits in buildings, public transportation vehicles, and subway stations.

== Operation ==
Glow sticks emit light when two chemicals are mixed. The reaction between the two chemicals is catalyzed by a base, usually sodium salicylate. The sticks consist of a tiny, brittle container within a flexible outer container. Each container holds a different solution. When the outer container is flexed, the inner container breaks, allowing the solutions to combine, causing the necessary chemical reaction. After breaking, the tube is shaken to thoroughly mix the components.

The glow stick contains two chemicals, a base catalyst, and a suitable dye (sensitizer, or fluorophor). This creates an exergonic reaction. The chemicals inside the plastic tube are a mixture of the dye, the base catalyst, and diphenyl oxalate. The chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon—the color of the emitted light—depends on the structure of the dye. The reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat. The reason for this is that the reverse [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition (it violates Woodward–Hoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.
By adjusting the concentrations of the two chemicals and the base, manufacturers can produce glow sticks that glow either brightly for a short amount of time or more dimly for an extended length of time. This also allows glow sticks to perform satisfactorily in hot or cold climates, by compensating for the temperature dependence of reaction. At maximum concentration (typically found only in laboratory settings), mixing the chemicals results in a furious reaction, producing large amounts of light for only a few seconds. The same effect can be achieved by adding copious amounts of sodium salicylate or other bases. Heating a glow stick also causes the reaction to proceed faster and the glow stick to glow more brightly for a brief period. Cooling a glow stick slows the reaction a small amount and causes it to last longer, but the light is dimmer. This can be demonstrated by refrigerating or freezing an active glow stick; when it warms up again, it will resume glowing. The dyes used in glow sticks usually exhibit fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet radiation—even a spent glow stick may therefore shine under a black light.

The light intensity is high immediately after activation, then exponentially decays. Leveling of this initial high output is possible by refrigerating the glow stick before activation.

A combination of two fluorophores can be used, with one in the solution and another incorporated to the walls of the container. This is advantageous when the second fluorophore would degrade in solution or be attacked by the chemicals. The emission spectrum of the first fluorophore and the absorption spectrum of the second one have to largely overlap, and the first one has to emit at shorter wavelength than the second one. A downconversion from ultraviolet to visible is possible, as is conversion between visible wavelengths (e.g., green to orange) or visible to near-infrared. The shift can be as much as 200 nm, but usually the range is about 20–100 nm longer than the absorption spectrum. Glow sticks using this approach tend to have colored containers, due to the dye embedded in the plastic. Infrared glow sticks may appear dark-red to black, as the dyes absorb the visible light produced inside the container and reemit near-infrared.

On the other hand, various colors can also be achieved by simply mixing several fluorophores within the solution to achieve the desired effect. These various colors can be achieved due to the principles of additive color. For example, a combination of red, yellow, and green fluorophores is used in orange light sticks, and a combination of several fluorescers is used in white light sticks.

=== Fluorophores used ===
*9,10-Diphenylanthracene (DPA) emits blue light
*9-(2-Phenylethenyl) anthracene emits teal light
*1-Chloro-9,10-diphenylanthracene (1-chloro(DPA)) and 2-chloro-9,10-diphenylanthracene (2-chloro(DPA)) emit blue-green light more efficiently than nonsubstituted DPA
*9,10-Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) emits green light with maximum at 486 nm
*1-Chloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits yellow-green light, used in 30-minute high-intensity Cyalume sticks
*2-Chloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits green light, used in 12-hour low-intensity Cyalume sticks
*1,8-Dichloro-9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene emits yellow light, used in Cyalume sticks

*6-Methylacridinium iodide emits infrared

== Consumer Safety Issues and Warnings ==
=== Toxicity ===
In glow sticks, phenol is produced as a byproduct. It is advisable to keep the mixture away from skin and to prevent accidental ingestion if the glow stick case splits or breaks. If spilled on skin, the chemicals could cause skin irritation, swelling, or, in extreme circumstances, vomiting and nausea. Some of the chemicals used in older glow sticks are carcinogens. The sensitizers used are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, a class of compounds known for their carcinogenic properties.

Dibutyl phthalate, a plasticizer sometimes used in glow sticks (and many plastics), has raised some health concerns. It was put on California&#x27;s list of suspected teratogens in 2006. Glow stick liquid contains ingredients that can act as a plasticizer, softening plastics onto which it leaks. Diphenyl oxalate can sting and burn eyes, irritate and sting skin and can burn the mouth and throat if ingested.

Researchers in Brazil, concerned about waste from glowsticks used in fishing in their country, published a study in 2014 on this topic. It measured the secondary reactions that continue within used glow sticks, toxicity to cells in culture, and chemical reactions with DNA &quot;in vitro.&quot; The authors found high toxicity of light stick solutions, and evidence of reactivity with DNA. They concluded that light stick solutions &quot;are hazardous and that the health risks associated with exposure have not yet been properly evaluated.&quot;

Many glow sticks use the chemical TCPO, or trichlorophenol, which is highly toxic if inhaled or ingested and is toxic to organs if ingested or otherwise exposed 

=== Legal Issues and Consumer Protection Law Violations ===
A Danish Ministry of the Environment report investigated commercially available glow sticks and found evidence of glow sticks containing dibutyl pthalate, and concluded that this is in violation of the law. 
From the report &quot;that substance must not be used in toys or gimmick and gag articles as according to classification it may damage fertility or the unborn
child. The risk arises after repeated or longer exposure.&quot;
In this consumer investigation, it was also observed that certain glow stick packaging featured images of children on the front, while the back carried a warning label stating &quot;not suitable for children.&quot; This inconsistency may lead to consumer confusion and raises questions regarding appropriate product marketing and safety communication. 
Products on amazon can be marketed as child safe and non toxic, but these claims are unvalidated. 
=== Single-use plastics ===
Glow sticks also contribute to the plastic waste problem, as glow sticks are single-use items and made from plastic. Additionally, since the inner vial is often made from glass and the chemicals inside are dangerous if improperly handled, the plastic used for glow sticks is non-recoverable by recycling services, so glow sticks are categorized as non-recyclable waste. 

Safety data sheets for individual components of glow stick formulas recommend absorbing with sawdust or other absorbent material and in particular stress the importance of keeping waste away from water sources. One should not dump used glow stick fluid down the drain.

== Safety improvements ==

By the 2020s, work was being done to create safer glow sticks and alternatives. Canadian company Lux Bio developed glow stick alternatives such as the Light Wand which is biodegradable and powered with bioluminescence, rather than the chemiluminescence and LÜMI, which is a reusable and non-toxic alternative that glows with phosphorescence and is chemically and biologically inert.

<text>Anglo is a prefix indicating a relation to, or descent from England, English culture, the English people or the English language, such as in the term &quot;Anglosphere&quot;. It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of British descent in Anglo-America, the Anglophone Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. It is used in Canada to differentiate between Francophone Canadians, located mainly in Quebec but found across Canada, and Anglophone Canadians, also located across Canada, including in Quebec. It is also used in the United States to distinguish the Hispanic and Latino population from the non-Hispanic white majority.

Anglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote &quot;English-&quot; in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. The word is derived from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, East Anglia. It most likely refers to the Angles, a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln, that is, the region of today&#x27;s Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula. The first recorded use of the word in Latin is in Tactitus&#x27;s Germania, where he mentions the &quot;Angles&quot; as a Suebian tribe living near the Elbe. Bede writes that the Angles came from a place called Angulus &quot;which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons.&quot; Anglia and England both mean &quot;land of the English&quot;. 

It is also often used to refer to &quot;British&quot; in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707, for example such as in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government. Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being &quot;Anglo&quot;.

&quot;Anglo&quot; is not an easily defined term. For traditionalists, there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own. For example, the purpose of the &quot;-o&quot; ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; meaning of English and Saxon origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, Latino and Anglo. However, a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified.

==Specialized usage==

===Africa===

The term &quot;Anglo-African&quot; has been used historically to self-identify by people of mixed British and African ancestry born in the United States and in Africa. &quot;The Anglo-African&quot; and &quot;The Weekly Anglo-African&quot; were the names of newspapers published by African American abolitionist Robert Hamilton (1819–1870) in New York during the American Civil War era. &quot;The Anglo-African&quot; was also the name of a newspaper published in Lagos (now part of Nigeria) from 1863 to 1865. It was founded and edited by Robert Campbell (1829–1884), a Jamaican born son of a Scottish father and Mulatto mother. The term has also been used historically to describe people living in the British Empire in Africa. &quot;The Anglo-African Who&#x27;s Who and Biographical Sketch-Book&quot; published in London in 1905 includes details of prominent British and Afrikaner people in Africa at that time.

===Australia===

In Australia, &quot;Anglo&quot; is used as part of the terms &quot;Anglo-Australian&quot; and &quot;Anglo-Celtic&quot;, which refer to the majority of Australians, who are of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish descent.

===Canada===
In Canada, and especially in Canadian French, &quot;Anglophone&quot; is widely used to designate someone whose mother tongue is English, as opposed to &quot;Francophone&quot;, which describes someone whose mother tongue is French, and to &quot;Allophone&quot;, which describes someone whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French. &quot;Anglo-Métis&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to an ethnic group.

===Israel===
Jewish immigrants making Aliyah to the State of Israel are sometimes referred to as &quot;Anglos&quot;.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, and in related cultures, the term &quot;Anglo-Scot&quot;, sometimes shortened to &quot;Anglo or Anglos&quot;, is used to refer to people with some permutation of mixed Scottish-English ancestry, association and/or birth; such as English people of Scottish descent, Scottish people of English descent, or heavily Anglicised members of the Scottish nobility who are indistinguishable from English members of the British upper class and speak with a Received Pronunciation, or other elite Southern accent. 

A great number of Anglo-Scots have made their mark in the fields of sport, politics, law, diplomacy, the Military history of the United Kingdom, medicine, engineering, technical invention, maritime history, geographical exploration, journalism and on the stage and screen. The London-born writer Ian Fleming being one such example of this mixed ancestry. His James Bond character is the preeminent fictional example of the &quot;Anglo-Scot&quot;. 

At the same time, however, John Lorne Campbell, whose decades long work as a collector alongside his wife, American ethnomusicologist Margaret Fay Shaw, preserved countless works of Canadian Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic literature, Hebridean mythology and folklore, and Scottish traditional music that may otherwise have been lost, was an Anglo-Scot. Campbell was raised to speak only Received Pronunciation English as an Argyllshire landlord at the height of the British Empire, but his decision as a young adult to reject the traditionally pro-English and pro-Empire politics of his family in favor of Scottish nationalism, decolonisation, and fighting for the survival of his threatened ancestral heritage language of Scottish Gaelic, may well be said to have changed the course of modern Scottish history. The modern Gaelic literary and language revivals, as well as the growing use of immersion schools in both Scotland and Nova Scotia are his legacy.

The term &quot;Anglo-Scot&quot; is often used to describe Scottish sports players who are based in England or playing for English teams, or vice versa. This is especially so in football, notably in Rugby union, where the Anglo Scots were a Scottish non-native select provincial District side that competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.

===United States===
In many parts of the United States, especially those with high Latino populations, the term &quot;Anglo&quot; is applied to white Americans who are not of Latino origin. &quot;Anglo&quot;, is short for &quot;Anglo American&quot;, is used as a synonym for non-Latino whites; that is European Americans, most of whom speak the English language, even those who are not necessarily of English or British descent. Some non-Latino whites in the United States who speak English but are not of English or British ancestry do not identify with the term &quot;Anglo&quot; and find the term offensive. For instance, some Cajuns in southern Louisiana use the term to refer to white people who do not have Francophone backgrounds. Irish Americans, the second largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States following German-Americans, also sometimes take umbrage at being called &quot;Anglo&quot;.

<doc id="291453" wikidata="Q1047702" url="?curid=291453" title="Renormalization">
<text>Renormalization is a collection of techniques in quantum field theory, statistical field theory, and the theory of self-similar geometric structures, that are used to treat infinities arising in calculated quantities by altering values of these quantities to compensate for effects of their self-interactions. But even if no infinities arose in loop diagrams in quantum field theory, it could be shown that it would be necessary to renormalize the mass and fields appearing in the original Lagrangian.

For example, an electron theory may begin by postulating an electron with an initial mass and charge. In quantum field theory a cloud of virtual particles, such as photons, positrons, and others surrounds and interacts with the initial electron. Accounting for the interactions of the surrounding particles (e.g. collisions at different energies) shows that the electron-system behaves as if it had a different mass and charge than initially postulated. Renormalization, in this example, mathematically replaces the initially postulated mass and charge of an electron with the experimentally observed mass and charge. Mathematics and experiments prove that positrons and more massive particles such as protons exhibit precisely the same observed charge as the electron – even in the presence of much stronger interactions and more intense clouds of virtual particles.

Renormalization specifies relationships between parameters in the theory when parameters describing large distance scales differ from parameters describing small distance scales. Physically, the pileup of contributions from an infinity of scales involved in a problem may then result in further infinities. When describing spacetime as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not well-defined. To define them, or make them unambiguous, a continuum limit must carefully remove &quot;construction scaffolding&quot; of lattices at various scales. Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values. That is, the experimental value of the physical quantity yields practical applications, but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represents areas of quantum field theory that require deeper derivation from theoretical bases.

Renormalization was first developed in quantum electrodynamics (QED) to make sense of infinite integrals in perturbation theory. Initially viewed as a suspect provisional procedure even by some of its originators, renormalization eventually was embraced as an important and self-consistent actual mechanism of scale physics in several fields of physics and mathematics. Despite his later skepticism, it was Paul Dirac who pioneered renormalization.

Today, the point of view has shifted: on the basis of the breakthrough renormalization group insights of Nikolay Bogolyubov and Kenneth Wilson, the focus is on variation of physical quantities across contiguous scales, while distant scales are related to each other through &quot;effective&quot; descriptions. All scales are linked in a broadly systematic way, and the actual physics pertinent to each is extracted with the suitable specific computational techniques appropriate for each. Wilson clarified which variables of a system are crucial and which are redundant.

Renormalization is distinct from regularization, another technique to control infinities by assuming the existence of new unknown physics at new scales.

== Self-interactions in classical physics ==

The problem of infinities first arose in the classical electrodynamics of point particles in the 19th and early 20th century.

The mass of a charged particle should include the mass–energy in its electrostatic field (electromagnetic mass). Assume that the particle is a charged spherical shell of radius . The mass–energy in the field is

:formula_1

which becomes infinite as . This implies that the point particle would have infinite inertia and thus cannot be accelerated. Incidentally, the value of that makes formula_2 equal to the electron mass is called the classical electron radius, which (setting formula_3 and restoring factors of and formula_4) turns out to be

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the fine-structure constant, and formula_7 is the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron.

Renormalization: The total effective mass of a spherical charged particle includes the actual bare mass of the spherical shell (in addition to the mass mentioned above associated with its electric field). If the shell&#x27;s bare mass is allowed to be negative, it might be possible to take a consistent point limit. This was called &quot;renormalization&quot;, and Lorentz and Abraham attempted to develop a classical theory of the electron this way. This early work was the inspiration for later attempts at regularization and renormalization in quantum field theory.

(See also regularization (physics) for an alternative way to remove infinities from this classical problem, assuming new physics exists at small scales.)

When calculating the electromagnetic interactions of charged particles, it is tempting to ignore the &quot;back-reaction&quot; of a particle&#x27;s own field on itself. (Analogous to the back-EMF of circuit analysis.) But this back-reaction is necessary to explain the friction on charged particles when they emit radiation. If the electron is assumed to be a point, the value of the back-reaction diverges, for the same reason that the mass diverges, because the field is inverse-square.

The Abraham–Lorentz theory had a noncausal &quot;pre-acceleration&quot;. Sometimes an electron would start moving &quot;before&quot; the force is applied. This is a sign that the point limit is inconsistent.

The trouble was worse in classical field theory than in quantum field theory, because in quantum field theory a charged particle experiences Zitterbewegung due to interference with virtual particle–antiparticle pairs, thus effectively smearing out the charge over a region comparable to the Compton wavelength. In quantum electrodynamics at small coupling, the electromagnetic mass only diverges as the logarithm of the radius of the particle.

== Divergences in quantum electrodynamics ==

When developing quantum electrodynamics in the 1930s, Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, and Paul Dirac discovered that in perturbative corrections many integrals were divergent (see The problem of infinities).

One way of describing the perturbation theory corrections&#x27; divergences was discovered in 1947–49 by Hans Kramers, Hans Bethe, 
Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and Shin&#x27;ichiro Tomonaga, and systematized by Freeman Dyson in 1949. The divergences appear in radiative corrections involving Feynman diagrams with closed &quot;loops&quot; of virtual particles in them.

While virtual particles obey conservation of energy and momentum, they can have any energy and momentum, even one that is not allowed by the relativistic energy–momentum relation for the observed mass of that particle (that is, formula_8 is not necessarily the squared mass of the particle in that process, e.g. for a photon it could be nonzero). Such a particle is called off-shell. When there is a loop, the momentum of the particles involved in the loop is not uniquely determined by the energies and momenta of incoming and outgoing particles. A variation in the energy of one particle in the loop can be balanced by an equal and opposite change in the energy of another particle in the loop, without affecting the incoming and outgoing particles. Thus many variations are possible. So to find the amplitude for the loop process, one must integrate over &quot;all&quot; possible combinations of energy and momentum that could travel around the loop.

These integrals are often &quot;divergent&quot;, that is, they give infinite answers. The divergences that are significant are the &quot;ultraviolet&quot; (UV) ones. An ultraviolet divergence can be described as one that comes from
* the region in the integral where all particles in the loop have large energies and momenta,
* very short wavelengths and high-frequencies fluctuations of the fields, in the path integral for the field,
* very short proper-time between particle emission and absorption, if the loop is thought of as a sum over particle paths.

So these divergences are short-distance, short-time phenomena.

Shown in the pictures at the right margin, there are exactly three one-loop divergent loop diagrams in quantum electrodynamics:
:(a) A photon creates a virtual electron–positron pair, which then annihilates. This is a vacuum polarization diagram.
:(b) An electron quickly emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon, called a self-energy.
:(c) An electron emits a photon, emits a second photon, and reabsorbs the first. This process is shown in the section below in figure 2, and it is called a &quot;vertex renormalization&quot;. The Feynman diagram for this is also called a “penguin diagram” due to its shape remotely resembling a penguin.

The three divergences correspond to the three parameters in the theory under consideration:
# The field normalization Z.
# The mass of the electron.
# The charge of the electron.

The second class of divergence called an infrared divergence, is due to massless particles, like the photon. Every process involving charged particles emits infinitely many coherent photons of infinite wavelength, and the amplitude for emitting any finite number of photons is zero. For photons, these divergences are well understood. For example, at the 1-loop order, the vertex function has both ultraviolet and &quot;infrared&quot; divergences. In contrast to the ultraviolet divergence, the infrared divergence does not require the renormalization of a parameter in the theory involved. The infrared divergence of the vertex diagram is removed by including a diagram similar to the vertex diagram with the following important difference: the photon connecting the two legs of the electron is cut and replaced by two on-shell (i.e. real) photons whose wavelengths tend to infinity; this diagram is equivalent to the bremsstrahlung process. This additional diagram must be included because there is no physical way to distinguish a zero-energy photon flowing through a loop as in the vertex diagram and zero-energy photons emitted through bremsstrahlung. From a mathematical point of view, the IR divergences can be regularized by assuming fractional differentiation w.r.t. a parameter, for example:

:formula_9

is well defined at but is UV divergent; if we take the -th fractional derivative with respect to , we obtain the IR divergence

:formula_10

so we can cure IR divergences by turning them into UV divergences.

=== A loop divergence ===

The diagram in Figure 2 shows one of the several one-loop contributions to electron–electron scattering in QED. The electron on the left side of the diagram, represented by the solid line, starts out with 4-momentum and ends up with 4-momentum . It emits a virtual photon carrying to transfer energy and momentum to the other electron. But in this diagram, before that happens, it emits another virtual photon carrying 4-momentum , and it reabsorbs this one after emitting the other virtual photon. Energy and momentum conservation do not determine the 4-momentum uniquely, so all possibilities contribute equally and we must integrate.

This diagram&#x27;s amplitude ends up with, among other things, a factor from the loop of

:formula_11

The various factors in this expression are gamma matrices as in the covariant formulation of the Dirac equation; they have to do with the spin of the electron. The factors of are the electric coupling constant, while the formula_12 provide a heuristic definition of the contour of integration around the poles in the space of momenta. The important part for our purposes is the dependency on of the three big factors in the integrand, which are from the propagators of the two electron lines and the photon line in the loop.

This has a piece with two powers of on top that dominates at large values of (Pokorski 1987, p. 122):

:formula_13

This integral is divergent and infinite, unless we cut it off at finite energy and momentum in some way.

Similar loop divergences occur in other quantum field theories.

== Renormalized and bare quantities ==
The solution was to realize that the quantities initially appearing in the theory&#x27;s formulae (such as the formula for the Lagrangian), representing such things as the electron&#x27;s electric charge and mass, as well as the normalizations of the quantum fields themselves, did &quot;not&quot; actually correspond to the physical constants measured in the laboratory. As written, they were &quot;bare&quot; quantities that did not take into account the contribution of virtual-particle loop effects to &quot;the physical constants themselves&quot;. Among other things, these effects would include the quantum counterpart of the electromagnetic back-reaction that so vexed classical theorists of electromagnetism. In general, these effects would be just as divergent as the amplitudes under consideration in the first place; so finite measured quantities would, in general, imply divergent bare quantities.

To make contact with reality, then, the formulae would have to be rewritten in terms of measurable, &quot;renormalized&quot; quantities. The charge of the electron, say, would be defined in terms of a quantity measured at a specific kinematic &quot;renormalization point&quot; or &quot;subtraction point&quot; (which will generally have a characteristic energy, called the &quot;renormalization scale&quot; or simply the energy scale). The parts of the Lagrangian left over, involving the remaining portions of the bare quantities, could then be reinterpreted as counterterms, involved in divergent diagrams exactly &quot;canceling out&quot; the troublesome divergences for other diagrams.

=== Renormalization in QED ===
For example, in the Lagrangian of QED

:formula_14

the fields and coupling constant are really &quot;bare&quot; quantities, hence the subscript above. Conventionally the bare quantities are written so that the corresponding Lagrangian terms are multiples of the renormalized ones:

:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

Gauge invariance, via a Ward–Takahashi identity, turns out to imply that we can renormalize the two terms of the covariant derivative piece

:formula_18

together (Pokorski 1987, p. 115), which is what happened to ; it is the same as .

A term in this Lagrangian, for example, the electron–photon interaction pictured in Figure 1, can then be written

:formula_19

The physical constant , the electron&#x27;s charge, can then be defined in terms of some specific experiment: we set the renormalization scale equal to the energy characteristic of this experiment, and the first term gives the interaction we see in the laboratory (up to small, finite corrections from loop diagrams, providing such exotica as the high-order corrections to the magnetic moment). The rest is the counterterm. If the theory is &quot;renormalizable&quot; (see below for more on this), as it is in QED, the &quot;divergent&quot; parts of loop diagrams can all be decomposed into pieces with three or fewer legs, with an algebraic form that can be canceled out by the second term (or by the similar counterterms that come from and ).

The diagram with the counterterm&#x27;s interaction vertex placed as in Figure 3 cancels out the divergence from the loop in Figure 2.

Historically, the splitting of the &quot;bare terms&quot; into the original terms and counterterms came before the renormalization group insight due to Kenneth Wilson. According to such renormalization group insights, detailed in the next section, this splitting is unnatural and actually unphysical, as all scales of the problem enter in continuous systematic ways.

=== Running couplings ===
To minimize the contribution of loop diagrams to a given calculation (and therefore make it easier to extract results), one chooses a renormalization point close to the energies and momenta exchanged in the interaction. However, the renormalization point is not itself a physical quantity: the physical predictions of the theory, calculated to all orders, should in principle be &quot;independent&quot; of the choice of renormalization point, as long as it is within the domain of application of the theory. Changes in renormalization scale will simply affect how much of a result comes from Feynman diagrams without loops, and how much comes from the remaining finite parts of loop diagrams. One can exploit this fact to calculate the effective variation of physical constants with changes in scale. This variation is encoded by beta-functions, and the general theory of this kind of scale-dependence is known as the renormalization group.

Colloquially, particle physicists often speak of certain physical &quot;constants&quot; as varying with the energy of interaction, though in fact, it is the renormalization scale that is the independent quantity. This &quot;running&quot; does, however, provide a convenient means of describing changes in the behavior of a field theory under changes in the energies involved in an interaction. For example, since the coupling in quantum chromodynamics becomes small at large energy scales, the theory behaves more like a free theory as the energy exchanged in an interaction becomes large – a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom. Choosing an increasing energy scale and using the renormalization group makes this clear from simple Feynman diagrams; were this not done, the prediction would be the same, but would arise from complicated high-order cancellations.

For example,

:formula_20

is ill-defined.

To eliminate the divergence, simply change lower limit of integral into and :

:formula_21

Making sure , then 

== Regularization ==
Since the quantity is ill-defined, in order to make this notion of canceling divergences precise, the divergences first have to be tamed mathematically using the theory of limits, in a process known as regularization (Weinberg, 1995).

An essentially arbitrary modification to the loop integrands, or &quot;regulator&quot;, can make them drop off faster at high energies and momenta, in such a manner that the integrals converge. A regulator has a characteristic energy scale known as the cutoff; taking this cutoff to infinity (or, equivalently, the corresponding length/time scale to zero) recovers the original integrals.

With the regulator in place, and a finite value for the cutoff, divergent terms in the integrals then turn into finite but cutoff-dependent terms. After canceling out these terms with the contributions from cutoff-dependent counterterms, the cutoff is taken to infinity and finite physical results are recovered. If physics on scales we can measure is independent of what happens at the very shortest distance and time scales, then it should be possible to get cutoff-independent results for calculations.

Many different types of regulator are used in quantum field theory calculations, each with its advantages and disadvantages. One of the most popular in modern use is &quot;dimensional regularization&quot;, invented by Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman, which tames the integrals by carrying them into a space with a fictitious fractional number of dimensions. Another is &quot;Pauli–Villars regularization&quot;, which adds fictitious particles to the theory with very large masses, such that loop integrands involving the massive particles cancel out the existing loops at large momenta.

Yet another regularization scheme is the &quot;lattice regularization&quot;, introduced by Kenneth Wilson, which pretends that hyper-cubical lattice constructs our spacetime with fixed grid size. This size is a natural cutoff for the maximal momentum that a particle could possess when propagating on the lattice. And after doing a calculation on several lattices with different grid size, the physical result is extrapolated to grid size 0, or our natural universe. This presupposes the existence of a scaling limit.

A rigorous mathematical approach to renormalization theory is the so-called causal perturbation theory, where ultraviolet divergences are avoided from the start in calculations by performing well-defined mathematical operations only within the framework of distribution theory. In this approach, divergences are replaced by ambiguity: corresponding to a divergent diagram is a term which now has a finite, but undetermined, coefficient. Other principles, such as gauge symmetry, must then be used to reduce or eliminate the ambiguity.

== Attitudes and interpretation ==
The early formulators of QED and other quantum field theories were, as a rule, dissatisfied with this state of affairs. It seemed illegitimate to do something tantamount to subtracting infinities from infinities to get finite answers.

Freeman Dyson argued that these infinities are of a basic nature and cannot be eliminated by any formal mathematical procedures, such as the renormalization method.

Dirac&#x27;s criticism was the most persistent. As late as 1975, he was saying:

: Most physicists are very satisfied with the situation. They say: &#x27;Quantum electrodynamics is a good theory and we do not have to worry about it any more.&#x27; I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation because this so-called &#x27;good theory&#x27; does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, ignoring them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves disregarding a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!

Another important critic was Feynman. Despite his crucial role in the development of quantum electrodynamics, he wrote the following in 1985:

: The shell game that we play to find &quot;n&quot; and &quot;j&quot; is technically called &#x27;renormalization&#x27;. But no matter how clever the word, it is still what I would call a dippy process! Having to resort to such hocus-pocus has prevented us from proving that the theory of quantum electrodynamics is mathematically self-consistent. It&#x27;s surprising that the theory still hasn&#x27;t been proved self-consistent one way or the other by now; I suspect that renormalization is not mathematically legitimate.

Feynman was concerned that all field theories known in the 1960s had the property that the interactions become infinitely strong at short enough distance scales. This property called a Landau pole, made it plausible that quantum field theories were all inconsistent. In 1974, Gross, Politzer and Wilczek showed that another quantum field theory, quantum chromodynamics, does not have a Landau pole. Feynman, along with most others, accepted that QCD was a fully consistent theory.

The general unease was almost universal in texts up to the 1970s and 1980s. Beginning in the 1970s, however, inspired by work on the renormalization group and effective field theory, and despite the fact that Dirac and various others—all of whom belonged to the older generation—never withdrew their criticisms, attitudes began to change, especially among younger theorists. Kenneth G. Wilson and others demonstrated that the renormalization group is useful in statistical field theory applied to condensed matter physics, where it provides important insights into the behavior of phase transitions. In condensed matter physics, a &quot;physical&quot; short-distance regulator exists: matter ceases to be continuous on the scale of atoms. Short-distance divergences in condensed matter physics do not present a philosophical problem since the field theory is only an effective, smoothed-out representation of the behavior of matter anyway; there are no infinities since the cutoff is always finite, and it makes perfect sense that the bare quantities are cutoff-dependent.

If QFT holds all the way down past the Planck length (where it might yield to string theory, causal set theory or something different), then there may be no real problem with short-distance divergences in particle physics either; &quot;all&quot; field theories could simply be effective field theories. In a sense, this approach echoes the older attitude that the divergences in QFT speak of human ignorance about the workings of nature, but also acknowledges that this ignorance can be quantified and that the resulting effective theories remain useful.

Be that as it may, Salam&#x27;s remark in 1972 seems still relevant

: Field-theoretic infinities – first encountered in Lorentz&#x27;s computation of electron self-mass – have persisted in classical electrodynamics for seventy and in quantum electrodynamics for some thirty-five years. These long years of frustration have left in the subject a curious affection for the infinities and a passionate belief that they are an inevitable part of nature; so much so that even the suggestion of a hope that they may, after all, be circumvented — and finite values for the renormalization constants computed – is considered irrational. Compare Russell&#x27;s postscript to the third volume of his autobiography &quot;The Final Years, 1944–1969&quot; (George Allen and Unwin, Ltd., London 1969), p. 221:

:: In the modern world, if communities are unhappy, it is often because they have ignorances, habits, beliefs, and passions, which are dearer to them than happiness or even life. I find many men in our dangerous age who seem to be in love with misery and death, and who grow angry when hopes are suggested to them. They think hope is irrational and that, in sitting down to lazy despair, they are merely facing facts.

In QFT, the value of a physical constant, in general, depends on the scale that one chooses as the renormalization point, and it becomes very interesting to examine the renormalization group running of physical constants under changes in the energy scale. The coupling constants in the Standard Model of particle physics vary in different ways with increasing energy scale: the coupling of quantum chromodynamics and the weak isospin coupling of the electroweak force tend to decrease, and the weak hypercharge coupling of the electroweak force tends to increase. At the colossal energy scale of 1015 GeV (far beyond the reach of our current particle accelerators), they all become approximately the same size (Grotz and Klapdor 1990, p. 254), a major motivation for speculations about grand unified theory. Instead of being only a worrisome problem, renormalization has become an important theoretical tool for studying the behavior of field theories in different regimes.

If a theory featuring renormalization (e.g. QED) can only be sensibly interpreted as an effective field theory, i.e. as an approximation reflecting human ignorance about the workings of nature, then the problem remains of discovering a more accurate theory that does not have these renormalization problems. As Lewis Ryder has put it, &quot;In the Quantum Theory, these [classical] divergences do not disappear; on the contrary, they appear to get worse. And despite the comparative success of renormalisation theory, the feeling remains that there ought to be a more satisfactory way of doing things.&quot;

== Renormalizability ==
From this philosophical reassessment, a new concept follows naturally: the notion of renormalizability. Not all theories lend themselves to renormalization in the manner described above, with a finite supply of counterterms and all quantities becoming cutoff-independent at the end of the calculation. If the Lagrangian contains combinations of field operators of high enough dimension in energy units, the counterterms required to cancel all divergences proliferate to infinite number, and, at first glance, the theory would seem to gain an infinite number of free parameters and therefore lose all predictive power, becoming scientifically worthless. Such theories are called &quot;nonrenormalizable&quot;.

The Standard Model of particle physics contains only renormalizable operators, but the interactions of general relativity become nonrenormalizable operators if one attempts to construct a field theory of quantum gravity in the most straightforward manner (treating the metric in the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian as a perturbation about the Minkowski metric), suggesting that perturbation theory is not satisfactory in application to quantum gravity.

However, in an effective field theory, &quot;renormalizability&quot; is, strictly speaking, a misnomer. In nonrenormalizable effective field theory, terms in the Lagrangian do multiply to infinity, but have coefficients suppressed by ever-more-extreme inverse powers of the energy cutoff. If the cutoff is a real, physical quantity—that is, if the theory is only an effective description of physics up to some maximum energy or minimum distance scale—then these additional terms could represent real physical interactions. Assuming that the dimensionless constants in the theory do not get too large, one can group calculations by inverse powers of the cutoff, and extract approximate predictions to finite order in the cutoff that still have a finite number of free parameters. It can even be useful to renormalize these &quot;nonrenormalizable&quot; interactions.

Nonrenormalizable interactions in effective field theories rapidly become weaker as the energy scale becomes much smaller than the cutoff. The classic example is the Fermi theory of the weak nuclear force, a nonrenormalizable effective theory whose cutoff is comparable to the mass of the W particle. This fact may also provide a possible explanation for &quot;why&quot; almost all of the particle interactions we see are describable by renormalizable theories. It may be that any others that may exist at the GUT or Planck scale simply become too weak to detect in the realm we can observe, with one exception: gravity, whose exceedingly weak interaction is magnified by the presence of the enormous masses of stars and planets.

== Renormalization schemes ==

In actual calculations, the counterterms introduced to cancel the divergences in Feynman diagram calculations beyond tree level must be &quot;fixed&quot; using a set of &quot; renormalisation conditions&quot;. The common renormalization schemes in use include:
* Minimal subtraction (MS) scheme and the related modified minimal subtraction (MS-bar) scheme
* On-shell scheme
Besides, there exists a &quot;natural&quot; definition of the renormalized coupling (combined with the photon propagator) as a propagator of dual free bosons, which does not explicitly require introducing the counterterms.

== In statistical physics ==

===History===
A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the
renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilatation group of conventional &quot;renormalizable&quot; theories, came from condensed matter physics. Leo P. Kadanoff&#x27;s paper in 1966 proposed the &quot;block-spin&quot; renormalization group. The &quot;blocking idea&quot; is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances.

This approach covered the conceptual point and was given full computational substance in the extensive important contributions of Kenneth Wilson. The power of Wilson&#x27;s ideas was demonstrated by a constructive iterative renormalization solution of a long-standing problem, the Kondo problem, in 1974, as well as the preceding seminal developments of his new method in the theory of second-order phase transitions and critical phenomena in 1971. He was awarded the Nobel prize for these decisive contributions in 1982.

===Principles===
In more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described
by a certain function formula_22 of the state variables
formula_23 and a certain set of coupling constants
formula_24. This function may be a partition function,
an action, a Hamiltonian, etc. It must contain the
whole description of the physics of the system.

Now we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state
variables formula_25,
the number of formula_26 must be lower than the number of
formula_27. Now let us try to rewrite the formula_22
function &quot;only&quot; in terms of the formula_26. If this is achievable by a
certain change in the parameters, formula_30, then the theory is said to be
renormalizable.

The possible
macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this
set of fixed points.

===Renormalization group fixed points===
The most important information in the RG flow is its fixed points. A fixed point is defined by the vanishing of the beta function associated to the flow. Then, fixed points of the renormalization group are by definition scale invariant. In many cases of physical interest scale invariance enlarges to conformal invariance. One then has a conformal field theory at the fixed point.

The ability of several theories to flow to the same fixed point leads to universality.

If these fixed points correspond to free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit quantum triviality. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but the nature of the quantum field theories associated with these remains an open question.
