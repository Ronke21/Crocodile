<text>T&#x27;Pol () is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Portrayed by Jolene Blalock in the series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, she is a Vulcan who serves as the science officer aboard the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01).

==Concept and creation==
Series producer Rick Berman said they originally intended that a younger version of T&#x27;Pau would be the Vulcan officer serving on the titular starship in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. Instead, after determining there were legal difficulties in using the original series character, the producers created T&#x27;Pol. Brannon Braga also said the idea was dropped to avoid having to deal with any legal issues, and also that T&#x27;Pol was simply easier to pronounce. 
Marjorie Monaghan, Blalock and an unnamed actress, were the final three considered for the role. By that time, Berman said they had seen hundreds of actresses, and they struggled to find a &quot;beautiful woman who can act and doesn&#x27;t want to go right into feature films&quot;. Casting director Ron Surma had Blalock in mind from the beginning but her agents said she was not interested. Braga thought Blalock was perfectly cast, &quot;We wanted a sexy Vulcan, a Kim Cattrall-type, and we definitely got that&quot;.

==Overview==
T&#x27;Pol is the first Vulcan officer to serve a prolonged term on a human vessel. T&#x27;Pol served aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for 10 years (2151–2161). To compare, the previous record was just 10 days. As a sub-commander serving the Vulcan High Command, she was stationed aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in April 2151, as an observer to Captain Jonathan Archer and his crew, who the High Command insisted, were not ready for interstellar space exploration. After the success of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s initial mission led to the vessel being given an extended exploration mandate, T&#x27;Pol requested to stay aboard.

T&#x27;Pol remained aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; despite several attempts by her superiors to recall her to Vulcan. T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s decision brought considerable scrutiny upon her from her superiors, and increasing support for her from her captain; she ultimately resigned from the High Command and accepted a field commission from Starfleet in 2154, resulting in her being granted the Starfleet rank of Commander.

Originally viewed by her crew mates with resentment and suspicion, T&#x27;Pol was forced to earn the trust of fellow officers, with Commander Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III being a particular focus of friction with her, due to his perception of her being a spy for the Vulcans and their very different personalities.

T&#x27;Pol is more emotional than many other Vulcans and has always struggled to control her emotions, something that greatly concerned her mother. Her emotions became even more difficult to control following an exposure to trellium ore, a toxic substance which damaged the part of her brain responsible for emotional control. Nonetheless, T&#x27;Pol serves as an icon of Vulcan integrity. Her willingness to question the decisions of her superiors, and her respect for Captain Archer position her at the fulcrum of human/Vulcan relations.

==Biography==

===Before &quot;Enterprise&quot;===
In Season 3, episode 24 &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, while talking with Trip on February 14, 2154, T&#x27;Pol states that she &quot;will only be 66 years old&quot; on her next birthday. This places her birth in 2088 or 2089 (as measured on Earth), making her 62 or 63 years old at &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. T&#x27;Pol was born the only child of T&#x27;Les, an instructor at the Vulcan Science Academy, and her (never named) husband. Per Vulcan tradition, T&#x27;Pol was bonded with a Vulcan named Koss while they were children and expected to marry as adults (&quot;Breaking the Ice&quot;).

As a child, T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s path in life was inspired by Ambassador V&#x27;Lar whom she watched negotiating with the Andorians during the Treaty of 2097 over possession of the planetoid Paan Mokar (&quot;Fallen Hero&quot;).

Approximately 16 years before joining the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, T&#x27;Pol served as an agent for the Vulcan intelligence service. At age 47, she completed her training for the Vulcan Ministry of Security. During an early mission to apprehend a pair of Vulcan criminals, she was forced to shoot and kill one of the fleeing men. She resigned from the service as a result, and the guilt over killing someone face-to-face caused her to suffer a nervous breakdown or emotional collapse which led to her undergoing a procedure, the Fullara, that erased all memory of the incident. This &quot;memory cap&quot; disappeared when she was briefly reactivated as an agent during 2152 in order to capture the criminal Vulcan who eluded her that day, and she experienced another emotional collapse which was alleviated by the support of Captain Archer. Given the option to once again suppress her memory of killing, she chose to live with it instead (&quot;The Seventh&quot;).

While in the Ministry of Security, T&#x27;Pol was also involved in mission operations at Tomed near Romulan space. Serving under her was Major Talok. However, unbeknownst to T&#x27;Pol, Talok was a Romulan spy disguised as a Vulcan working in league with corrupt Administrator V&#x27;Las of the Vulcan High Command. Their goal was to promote the eventual conquest of Vulcan by the Romulan Star Empire (&quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot;).

After her resignation from the Ministry of Security, T&#x27;Pol served for over a year as the deputy science officer aboard the Vulcan cruiser &quot;Seleya&quot;, under the command of Captain Voris (&quot;Impulse&quot;).

In 2149, T&#x27;Pol began her tenure at the High Command&#x27;s Consulate on Earth, assisting Ambassador Soval in his observation of humanity&#x27;s progress toward space exploration (&quot;Fusion&quot;). In 2151, then holding the rank of sub-commander, she was selected by Soval to accompany Captain Jonathan Archer during his initial first mission aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; NX-01 as observer and Vulcan representative. When the mission was successful and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; greenlighted to continue its mission of exploration, T&#x27;Pol elected to remain on board as science officer (&quot;Broken Bow&quot;).

===Pa&#x27;nar, trellium, mind melds, and emotion===
T&#x27;Pol, who is described by her superiors as a maverick and a rebel, became fascinated with Tolaris, a member of a group of emotionally free Vulcans encountered during the first year of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s mission. Tolaris introduced her to the concept of the mind meld, which at the time was considered a taboo activity among Vulcans. She severed her relationship with Tolaris after she asked him to stop the mind meld and he refused, attempting to continue the meld without her consent (essentially a form of mental rape), and causing her to forcefully break the link. She later learned that she had contracted Pa&#x27;nar Syndrome from the encounter. This condition was kept in check with medication. In 2154, T&#x27;Pol, who had been told that Pa&#x27;nar was an incurable virus, learned that the condition was in fact caused by an improperly trained melder, and contrary to what the intolerant (and soon to be overthrown) Vulcan High Command had decreed, it was indeed curable by the touch of an experienced mind – provided to T&#x27;Pol by T&#x27;Pau.

T&#x27;Pol was told that she is genetically incapable of initiating mind melds herself, however following the 2154 overthrow of the Vulcan regime that stigmatized mind-melding she learned otherwise. She performed her first mind meld upon Hoshi Sato, with the assistance of Jonathan Archer, who had learned details about mind melds during a period of time when he held the katra of Surak. In fact, not only is T&#x27;Pol telepathic, but the episode &quot;Affliction&quot; revealed that she is able to communicate with Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III over great distances using her new-found mental abilities. It was established a year later (in &quot;Bound&quot;) that this is because of a mating bond between the two.

During T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s early years aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, she demonstrated an unusual (for a Vulcan) willingness to explore human culture and customs, although she stated that certain human foods do not agree with her. After a discussion with Commander Charles Tucker, she described pecan pie, as a dessert made of &quot;mostly sugar&quot;. She began attending the ship&#x27;s weekly film night social event (with Captain Archer), and expressed particular admiration for the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. She was reportedly less successful at mastering the art of eating with chopsticks, to the amusement of her crew mates.
Prior to her posting aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, T&#x27;Pol on at least one occasion left the Vulcan Compound in San Francisco and visited a jazz music club; the chaotic music generated an emotional response that came back to haunt her during a brief period when she abandoned her nightly meditation ritual (concurrent with her experimentation with mind-melding).

T&#x27;Pol also became adept at &quot;play acting&quot;, which she found was often needed in order to successfully fulfill a mission. For example, she once pretended to be a slave when Ferengi pirates hijacked the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (&quot;Acquisition&quot;), distracted a group of Suliban invaders by acting deranged (&quot;Shockwave (Part II)&quot;), and pretended to be a domineering Vulcan commander preparing for an execution (&quot;Precious Cargo&quot;). In the latter example there is a clear indication that T&#x27;Pol enjoyed taking part in this sort of deception.

On several occasions during her first two years aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, T&#x27;Pol resisted efforts by her family and the Vulcan High Command to get her to leave the ship and return to her Vulcan obligations. When pressed for a reason by Vulcan Ambassador Soval, T&#x27;Pol replied that she found working aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;gratifying&quot;, for which she was chided for engaging in an emotional indulgence.

In 2153, after being ordered to leave the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and return to Vulcan, T&#x27;Pol resigned her commission with the Vulcan High Command in order to accompany the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; into the Delphic Expanse to find the Xindi, a mysterious race accused of killing seven million humans on Earth. Despite being technically a civilian, she remained as first officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the crew continued to refer to her by her High Command rank of Sub-Commander during the mission.

While investigating the Vulcan ship &quot;Seleya&quot; (&quot;Impulse&quot;), which had become trapped in The Expanse, T&#x27;Pol experienced the side effects of Trellium-D, a compound the ship had used to protect itself from anomalies within The Expanse, but which had the side effect of creating psychosis in Vulcans. T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s brief exposure led to her experiencing extreme paranoia and losing control of her emotions. She recovered upon returning to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The compound, which Commander Tucker brought aboard, was necessary to line the ship so that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; could traverse the Expanse. Captain Archer, rather than line the ship with the concoction (lethal to T&#x27;Pol), stored it in a locker in the cargo bay.

T&#x27;Pol found herself wanting to experience more of the emotions the Trellium-D had unlocked. In &quot;Damage&quot;, it is revealed that she discovered how to liquefy small, safe amounts of the compound and began to secretly inject herself with it, beginning approximately three months prior to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arriving at Azati Prime (&quot;Azati Prime&quot;). This led to what she felt was improved relations with her crew mates, in particular chief engineer Trip Tucker, which led to a sexual relationship in &quot;Harbinger&quot; after she understood she was experiencing jealousy when Tucker began making romantic overtures toward a MACO on board. In the same episode, she later attempted to deflect the importance of the act by referring to it as merely an exploration of human sexuality. However, this one-time encounter resulted in the formation of a psychic bond between Trip and T&#x27;Pol which does not manifest until the second half of season 4.

Over time, as T&#x27;Pol became addicted to the Trellium-D injections, her emotions began to flow more freely. This came to a head when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; reached Azati Prime (&quot;Azati Prime&quot;) and Jonathan Archer chose to undertake a suicide mission in order to complete the Xindi mission. T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s emotional reaction toward Archer&#x27;s departure and presumed death incapacitated her as a commanding officer (ending up in crying and an attempt to recover him). She attempted to hide her condition, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was nearly destroyed in a subsequent Xindi attack which may or may not have been made worse by T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s state.

After the attack, T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s supply of Trellium-D became difficult to reach (being located in a heavily damaged part of the ship) and she nearly died during a clandestine attempt to retrieve it. Soon after, she lost her temper with Archer (who had since returned to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;). He indicated he needed her for a difficult (and morally questionable) mission. She was nearly killed while trying to recover more Trellium-D after experiencing an erotic dream involving Tucker. This led her to seek medical help from Dr. Phlox to whom she confessed her addiction.

Although T&#x27;Pol subsequently overcame her addiction, Phlox determined that she had permanently damaged her brain, and as a result might never achieve the same level of emotional control she once had. A subsequent encounter with an elderly version of herself (due to an Expanse-related anomaly seen in the episode &quot;E²&quot;—an alternate universe episode) indicated that she will live with the after effects of her Trellium-D exposure for the rest of her life. The older version of T&#x27;Pol served aboard an alternate time line version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which had been transported into the past. Aboard the alternate &quot;Enterprise&quot;, T&#x27;Pol and Trip Tucker had married and conceived a son, Lorian, who at the time of the encounter was the captain of the alternate &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The older T&#x27;Pol advised her that Trip Tucker could provide a safe outlet for her newfound emotions if she could learn to trust him. She also advised her younger self that she could not imagine what her life would have been like without him. T&#x27;Pol did not choose to pursue a romantic relationship with Trip when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to normal space in the Expanse.

Following the Xindi mission, she continued to experience difficulty controlling her emotions and became particularly emotional following the death of her mother.

T&#x27;Pol, who (at the time) held the record for the longest time spent by a Vulcan serving with humans, has demonstrated her ability to adapt. Originally, she required a form of medication in order to tolerate the odors given off by humans and Captain Archer&#x27;s pet dog Porthos (because of Vulcans having a sensitive sense of smell).

It&#x27;s revealed that she has a sense of humor, one she can demonstrate (as she has in &quot;Future Tense&quot; and other shows, including &quot;Bound&quot;). And, in a case of &quot;when in Rome, do as the Romans do,&quot; she has also begun eating some types of foods (fruit, popcorn) with her hands, breaking a long-standing Vulcan taboo in the process.

Following the death of her mother (see below), the divorce of her husband Koss and the discovery of the Kir&#x27;Shara, T&#x27;Pol began to re-evaluate Surak&#x27;s teachings and what it means to be Vulcan. As a result, she began to distance herself from some of her crew mates, choosing to spend her free time studying the newly found word of Surak. Her decision had an adverse effect on her relationship with Commander Tucker. (In &quot;Bound&quot;, she re-established her romantic relationship with Trip. T&#x27;Pol asked Trip to return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and, when he replied that he &quot;would think about it&quot; she showed her emotional commitment by pursuing him down the corridor and kissing him.)

She has also experienced some success in controlling her emotions to a greater degree than she had over the two years. T&#x27;Pau&#x27;s therapeutic mind-meld cured the Pa&#x27;nar Syndrome and may have helped restore some of her emotional balance as well. This, combined with the fact that T&#x27;Pol no longer has the added stress of living with an incurable, potentially fatal condition, may have calmed her mind sufficiently to maintain control. Despite this, she has admitted to Phlox that she had never before felt so unsure of herself.

In an alternate reality seen in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5, T&#x27;Pol has mastered human emotions due to her being married to Trip Tucker for 63 years.

===Relationship with Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III===
The relationship between T&#x27;Pol and Trip Tucker is a complex one. Initially, the two had a somewhat combative association.

During the third season of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, while the ship was engaged in pursuing the Xindi weapon in the Expanse, T&#x27;Pol and Tucker became increasingly intimate. This process began because Trip had trouble sleeping. Dr. Phlox urged T&#x27;Pol to assist Trip by using Vulcan neuropressure, a system of massage that T&#x27;Pol referred to as &quot;intimate&quot; and which is frequently conducted in a semi-clothed state.

A few episodes after this, starting in &quot;Impulse&quot;, T&#x27;Pol begins to take Trellium-D, which has the result of lowering her barriers and producing greater emotion.

In &quot;Similitude&quot;, when Doctor Phlox grows a mimetic symbiote of Tripcomplete with Trip&#x27;s memoriesthe Sim confessed to T&#x27;Pol that he (they?) had a deep attraction to her. In &quot;Harbinger&quot;, a few months after Trellium-D usage and neuropressure sessions, T&#x27;Pol learns that Trip is attracted to a MACO aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. T&#x27;Pol begins to display signs of jealousy regarding Trip&#x27;s activities with another woman aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and Trip is jealous of Sim for having been the one to admit &quot;their&quot; feelings for herultimately, she and Trip have sex. Afterward, T&#x27;Pol attempts to distance herself from the act by referring to it as an exploration of human sexuality. After they engage in sex in &quot;Harbinger&quot;, they do not engage in the act again in season 3.

In &quot;E²&quot;, an alternate timeline is revealed where Commander Tucker and T&#x27;Pol get married and have at least one child, who they meet, called Lorian. It creates an awkward situation but further illuminates their relationship.

In &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, T&#x27;Pol reveals her age to him, which she indicated Vulcans consider &quot;intimate&quot; information.

In Home, at the end of the Xindi mission, when Trip tells her he has no home left to go to, T&#x27;Pol invites him to accompany her home to Vulcan. After arriving on Vulcan, T&#x27;Pol is blackmailed into marrying her original betrothed, Koss, in order to save her mother&#x27;s career. Her mother, T&#x27;Les, realizes Trip is in love with her daughter and suggests to him he should express his feelings to T&#x27;Pol before the ceremony so that she could have all available information. Trip declines, saying that she is under enough stress and he cares about her too much to make things even more difficult for her. However, T&#x27;Pol was not unaware of his feelings. She paused on her way to marry Koss long enough to give Trip a kiss on the cheek, a scandalous public display of affection for a Vulcan, especially in those circumstances.

In &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara,&quot; following the discovery of the Kir&#x27;Shara in season four, T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s husband divorces her and Trip attempts to reconnect their relationship. T&#x27;Pol is studying the original teachings of Surak, and disregards that request. Hurt, Trip decides to make a new start and transfers to &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s sister ship NX-02 &quot;Columbia&quot;, then working up prior to being commissioned. While he is away on &quot;Columbia&quot;, both he and T&#x27;Pol experience telepathic contact in the form of both waking daydreams as well as dreams while sleeping.

An emergency requires Trip to return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. While he is aboard, an attempted takeover by Orions reveals that Trip is the only human aboard who is immune to the pheromones emitted by the Orion women, which proves to T&#x27;Pol they have bonded. An undetermined amount of time after the two learn of their bond, their relationship undergoes a major shock during the Terra Prime episodes when Trip and T&#x27;Pol learn that they have a child. The baby was a created using stolen DNA samples of the two by a terrorist group headed by a radical separatist, Paxton, who believed Earth should distance itself and defend itself from alien worlds and influences. The baby, a girl, was named Elizabeth after Trip&#x27;s sister. As stated by Phlox, the child has Trip&#x27;s eyes and T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s ears. Elizabeth does not survive due to a flawed procedure during the cloning process. Trip revealed this to T&#x27;Pol when he went to her quarters to try to console her. He further indicated that according to Phlox, a different cloning process performed by gene surgeons who were more highly skilled than those employed by Terra Prime would probably result in a viable child. The two grieved together for Elizabeth, whom they had accepted as theirs.

In an alternate reality seen in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5, T&#x27;Pol is mentioned to have been married to Trip for 63 years, causing her to master human emotions.

===Relationship with Jonathan Archer===
When T&#x27;Pol first reported to duty aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Archer resented her assignment due to his distrust of Vulcans and the fact that the Vulcans had refused to provide starcharts and a copy of the Vulcan database unless T&#x27;Pol was assigned to the crew. T&#x27;Pol would butt heads with Archer about his style of command during the ship&#x27;s early missions, chastising him for taking chances just to be able to explore new planets. As time passed, T&#x27;Pol proved to be a valuable asset to Archer due to her time in space and her past experiences as an officer with command experience. Indeed, her command experience is what secured her position as First Officer. As &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s mission progressed, T&#x27;Pol grew very close to Captain Jonathan Archer whose abilities she had come to respect and to whom she had developed a sense of loyalty after he assisted her in bringing to justice a renegade Vulcan Security agent. Her sense of loyalty went so far as to compel her to resign her position with Vulcan High Command and join &quot;Enterprise&quot; without a commission from either Starfleet or the Vulcans during her mission in the Delphic Expanse. During the Delphic Expanse mission, T&#x27;Pol continued to serve as First Officer despite her not holding a commission. After the Delphic Expanse mission, T&#x27;Pol opted to remain with Starfleet and with Archer&#x27;s assistance, bypassed Starfleet training, was directly commissioned with the rank of Commander, and was formally assigned as Archer&#x27;s First Officer. On the occasions when Archer was thought killed, T&#x27;Pol showed her affection for him to the point of crying during the Xindi mission when she believes he has been killed in &quot;Azati Prime&quot;. She also grieves in &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, when she believes he is dead, by holding close a book of his and pets his dog, Porthos.

In one alternate timeline (depicted in &quot;Twilight&quot;), T&#x27;Pol devoted her life to caring for Archer when parasites robbed him of the ability to store long-term memory (the same ones with which he was infected while saving her life). Dr. Phlox later implied that T&#x27;Pol had fallen in love with Archer during the time that she took care of him.

===Starfleet service===
Near the end of the Xindi mission, T&#x27;Pol revealed to Archer and Tucker that she was considering enlisting in Starfleet. Following the Xindi mission, she accepted the commission and received the rank of Commander. In May 2154, T&#x27;Pol officially assumed duties as a Starfleet officer.

The final episode &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot; reveals that T&#x27;Pol remained Archer&#x27;s first officer aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for a total of ten years. Her relationship with Trip allegedly ended at some point within a year of the death of their cloned child in 2155 (see &quot;Family&quot;, below), although she remained emotionally attached to him and expressed concern that she would never see Trip again after the decommissioning of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 2161. Trip&#x27;s death on a minor mission just prior to the decommissioning affected her deeply, and she expressed a desire to meet his parents.

She also grew comfortable in confiding in the ship&#x27;s chef during the years prior to the finale. Dialog in the finale suggests that T&#x27;Pol was to be assigned to another vessel following the decommissioning of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. 
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels released following the formation of the United Federation of Planets, T&#x27;Pol was promoted to captain and given command of the newly commissioned NX-class starship USS &quot;Endeavour,&quot; NX-06.

==Family==
Little is revealed of T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s family until the fourth-season episode &quot;Home&quot;, in which her mother T&#x27;Les appears. T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s father is deceased. T&#x27;Les was an instructor at the Vulcan Science Academy, but resigned in 2154. In the episode &quot;Awakening&quot;, she died in her daughter&#x27;s arms during an attack on a Syrranite encampment in the desert region known as The Forge. T&#x27;Pol grieved upon her mother&#x27;s death; following the death of Trip in 2161, she confessed to Archer that she missed her mother more as time went by.

T&#x27;Pol has no siblings. As a child, she had a pet sehlat.

T&#x27;Pol was engaged to marry a Vulcan named Koss prior to the start of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s mission, with the marriage scheduled for 2151 (about a week after the events of &quot;Breaking the Ice&quot; to be precise) but elected to delay her marriage indefinitely. The fourth-season episode &quot;Home&quot; saw T&#x27;Pol having to deal with the consequences of her decision, when she chooses to marry Koss in order to save her mother&#x27;s professional reputation. She appears to be unaware that Trip has fallen in love with her (although in &quot;The Augments&quot; it is clear that she is beginning to realize his feelings). Prior to her marriage, she negotiated with Koss&#x27; family to defer the one-year Vulcan residence obligation required of newly-wed Vulcan females, in order to join Starfleet as a commissioned officer and stay aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Only a few months after their marriage, Koss released T&#x27;Pol from their arrangement following the death of her mother, and shortly after the marriage was officially dissolved.

In the episode &quot;Carbon Creek&quot;, T&#x27;Pol tells Captain Archer and Commander Tucker the details of the Vulcans&#x27; real first contact with humanity on Earth in the 1950s. T&#x27;Mir (T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s great grandmother) was involved in a survey mission when her spacecraft crash landed on Earth in 1957. She and two other Vulcan crew members were forced to live among humans for several months in a small American mining town called Carbon Creek, hiding their Vulcan identity. During her stay, T&#x27;Mir provided a patent office with a revolutionary material (Velcro), in order to raise college tuition money for a human teenager whom she had befriended in town. T&#x27;Pol kept her great-grandmother&#x27;s purse.

In the alternate timeline seen in &quot;E²&quot;, T&#x27;Pol marries Trip and they have a son, Lorian, who becomes the captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; upon the death of Captain Archer. In this episode, T&#x27;Pol met an older version of herself (approximately 180 years old).

The fourth-season episode &quot;Demons&quot; revealed that T&#x27;Pol had a six-month-old daughter, the father being Trip. It was later learned that a terrorist group called Terra Prime had created the child by cloning. Samples of T&#x27;Pol and Trip&#x27;s DNA stolen from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were the source of the child&#x27;s genetic material. The cloning procedure, however, was not performed correctly. The child — whom T&#x27;Pol named Elizabeth in honor of Trip&#x27;s deceased sister — died soon after being rescued from the Mars facility where she was being held.

The existence of a psychic bond between T&#x27;Pol and Trip is revealed during the fourth season; no such psychic bond is indicated between T&#x27;Pol and Koss. The final episode, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, mentioned that T&#x27;Pol and Trip ended their relationship within a year of the events of &quot;Terra Prime&quot;.

Outside of established &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, novels have been published based on the series that retconned this, saying that the two are still involved with each other. The book &quot;The Romulan War: To Brave the Storm&quot; states that T&#x27;Pol has two children—a daughter T&#x27;Mir and a son Lorian.

==Mirror Universe==
A two-part episode in the fourth season, &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, introduced a Mirror Universe version of T&#x27;Pol. This version is more cynical and openly emotional than her &quot;real universe&quot; counterpart, and is also openly sexually manipulative, particularly of Commander Tucker.

In the Mirror Universe, T&#x27;Pol underwent pon farr at some point in the recent past, and Trip mated with her in order to get her through it. Physically, she differs from her real universe counterpart in that she has long hair (in reality, Blalock eschewed her wig for her normal hair) and, like other female officers in the Terran Empire, she wears a two-piece uniform with a bare midriff (although after transferring to the captured USS &quot;Defiant&quot; (NCC-1764), she adopts a &quot;TOS&quot;-style miniskirt uniform temporarily until she is able to obtain a more standard Empire uniform).

Mirror-T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s mind meld abilities appear to be somewhat more advanced than those of her counterpart, as she is capable of placing a form of post-hypnotic suggestion into the minds of those with whom she melds; since the real universe T&#x27;Pol had only recently learned how to meld, it is unlikely she had yet achieved this level of melding proficiency. She also appears to be more emotional than her counterpart, showing open sarcasm and contempt for Archer, and is seen to either grin or snarl (depending on one&#x27;s point of view) during a brief bout of hand-to-hand combat with Hoshi Sato.

Eventually, Mirror-T&#x27;Pol is forcibly transferred from the &quot;Defiant&quot; to the ISS &quot;Avenger&quot; when Jonathan Archer attempts to rid his ship of all alien crew members. T&#x27;Pol becomes convinced that Archer will never allow Vulcans to be equals, and tries to stop him from taking over the Empire. Mirror-T&#x27;Pol was inspired by reading the historical logs of our universe&#x27;s Defiant, which revealed a universe where Humans, Vulcans, and other aliens lived as equals in a benevolent Federation. After recruiting the ISS &quot;Avenger&quot;″s alien crew members to the rebellion, T&#x27;Pol is caught and interrogated by Archer. Archer and Hoshi Sato express a desire to have her executed following her interrogation, the &quot;Defiant&quot; immediately enters battle, and Mirror T&#x27;pols fate is not shown.

During the episode&#x27;s stated date of January 2155, T&#x27;Pol foreshadows future events, such as the fall of the Terran Empire after several centuries (which would be chronicled in the Mirror Universe episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.)

==Portrayal==

Blalock turned down the role three times before accepting. The costume and makeup, including ears and wig, took about two hours to apply. Blalock found it helped her get into character: &quot;It&#x27;s really cool. Once I&#x27;m in the outfit, I am T&#x27;Pol.&quot; She describes the character as &quot;feline in movement&quot; and says &quot;she does not look at humans condescendingly, though she is a superior race, so it may seem that way. She&#x27;s just learning about human nature and the positives of feeling emotion.&quot;

Blalock was daunted by the prospect of stepping into the shoes of Spock, to live up to the work of Leonard Nimoy that defined what it meant to be a Vulcan. 
Co-star John Billingsly (Doctor Phlox) said Blalock was very method in her approach to T&#x27;Pol, and that she redecorated her trailer so that she was surrounded by beautiful space images.
Blalock wanted the character to be &quot;more Vulcan&quot;, stating: &quot;I personally believe that T&#x27;Pol should have more of her Vulcan culture. I don&#x27;t believe she should be so desperate to be like everyone else, because the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; which I grew up with, had a very simple message that I took from it, and that is that not everyone is like me, and I&#x27;m not perfect, and nobody&#x27;s perfect, and that&#x27;s okay.&quot;
She felt the character was undermined by inconsistencies and continuity problems. For example: &quot;T&#x27;Pol gets sick, terminally ill, and they never readdress it. There&#x27;s the characteristic where Vulcans don&#x27;t eat food with their hands, and yet they&#x27;ll write scenes where T&#x27;Pol is eating popcorn at a movie or Trip will bring T&#x27;Pol a peach.&quot;

She found T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s relationship with Trip unlikely, not seeing what common ground the characters had: &quot;They write it, I do it. I don&#x27;t see it, personally. T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s a Vulcan—how could she have a relationship? And he&#x27;s so emotional.&quot;

She was critical of how the character ended up, and said, &quot;I wish the best for T&#x27;Pol, and I don&#x27;t wish her to be viewed as everything that they made her—a drug addict, weak woman, confused, lost.&quot;

==Reception==
Peter Schorn of IGN said that Blalock&#x27;s performance and the character itself were fine but was critical of the setup. He said the character immediately stood out as &quot;an obvious retread of Jeri Ryan&#x27;s fanboy-delighting Seven of Nine character from Voyager&quot; and that despite every other Vulcan wearing loose robes, T&#x27;Pol wore a skintight jumpsuit, which &quot;showed how craven the producers could be and how little they thought of the audience as being anything more than hormone-enthralled nerds.&quot; Reviewing the series premiere, Hal Boedeker of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; singled out Blalock for praise: &quot;Star Trek purists might not be amused, but the captivating Blalock energizes the franchise. Enterprise needs every bit of pizazz she can supply.&quot;
The book &quot;Beyond the Final Frontier: An Unauthorised Review of the Trek Universe on Television and Film&quot; stated: &quot;At first glance, she&#x27;s merely eye candy, and indeed during the first season, the writers found little for her to do but smoulder.&quot; They praised Blalock&#x27;s performance saying she &quot;approached the least subtle of roles with a clever understatement&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s easily the funniest, sexiest, smartest regular actor to be cast in Star Trek in 15 years.&quot; 
In his 2022 rewatch, Keith DeCandido of Tor.com praised Blalock, saying she overcame the setup and costume of the character &quot;to give us a magnificently mature and complicated character.&quot;
In 2016, &quot;Wired&quot; ranked T&#x27;Pol as the 10th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe.
In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked T&#x27;Pol the 8th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.
In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranked T&#x27;Pol as the 28th best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. They said her &quot;acting could sometimes be as ridiculous as her fanservice outfits&quot; but that it was fun to watch the Vulcan grapple with their emotions. 
In 2018, CBR ranked Jolene Blalock as the 17th best actor of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Chris Snellgrove said the Blalock was a victim of both bad writing and bad direction. When the show needed ratings they found ways to remove her clothes; he said &quot;this exploitation is desperate and sad, and the actor deserved better.&quot; CBR ranked T&#x27;Pol as the 4th &quot;fiercest&quot; female character of the Star Trek universe. Alexandra August wrote that T&#x27;Pol continues the tradition of &quot;catsuited ice queens started by Seven of Nine&quot; and, similar to her predecessor, &quot;despite the fact that her appearance was gratuitously sexual, the conflicted Vulcan is brought to life beautifully by Blalock.&quot;

===Awards===
For her performance as T&#x27;Pol, Blalock was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category Best Supporting Actress on Television, which she won.
Blalock was again nominated in the same category, three more times.

<text>Saye Zerbo (27 August 1932 – 19 September 2013) was a Burkinabé military officer who was the third President of the Republic of Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) from 25 November 1980 until 7 November 1982. 

He led a coup in 1980, but was resisted by trade unions and was overthrown by Major Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP).

==Biography==
Saye Zerbo was born Tougan, French West Africa, on 27 August 1932. He went to school in Mali and Saint-Louis, Senegal. Then he joined the French military in 1950 and attended the military academy Saint-Cyr. As a paratrooper, Zerbo took part in both the First Indochina War and the Algerian War of Independence. After Upper Volta&#x27;s independence from France in 1960, he transferred to that country&#x27;s army in 1961.

In the military government of Sangoulé Lamizana, who ruled Upper Volta from 1966, Saye Zerbo was minister of foreign affairs from 1974 to 1976. He also held the positions of commander of the regiment in the capital Ouagadougou and director of the military intelligence agency.

On 25 November 1980, Zerbo staged a coup against President Lamizana, who had been re-elected democratically in 1978, and took on the positions of head of state and government. The constitution, which had been introduced in 1977, was suspended and the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress (&quot;Comité Militaire de Redressement pour le Progrès National&quot;; CMPRN) established. The trade unions in the country opposed his seizure of power, although they had supported Zerbo for a long time, and on 7 November 1982, Saye Zerbo was deposed in another coup d&#x27;état. He was succeeded by Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo as the head of the Council of Popular Salvation (&quot;Conseil du Salut du Peuple&quot;; CSP).

After being deposed, Zerbo was also incarcerated. On 4 August 1983, Ouédraogo was deposed by Thomas Sankara. In May 1984, Zerbo and Lamizana were put on trial for various crimes. Zerbo was sentenced to 15 years in prison. During his imprisonment, Zerbo converted from Islam to Christianity. He was released from jail in August 1985. After Blaise Compaoré had deposed Sankara he sought Zerbo&#x27;s advice. Zerbo&#x27;s conviction from 1984 was annulled on 18 February 1997 by the supreme court of Burkina Faso.

Zerbo&#x27;s third daughter Araba Kadidiatou Zerbo is married to the former Prime Minister of Burkina Faso Paramanga Ernest Yonli.

<text>Aboubakar Sangoulé Lamizana (31 January 1916 – 26 May 2005) was an Upper Voltan military officer who served as the President of Upper Volta (since 1984 renamed Burkina Faso), in power from 3 January 1966, to 25 November 1980. He held the additional position of Prime Minister from 8 February 1974, to 7 July 1978.

== Biography ==
After Upper Volta achieved complete independence from the French Union in 1960, opposition parties either merged with the governing party, &quot;Union démocratique voltaïque&quot; (UDV), or were banned, transforming Upper Volta into a single party state, headed by Maurice Yaméogo as President. Yaméogo&#x27;s one-party regime elicited much unrest; student strikes and mass demonstrations by students, labor unions, and civil servants. Yaméogo was forced to resign after a general strike and a military coup on 3 January 1966, giving power to General Sangoulé Lamizana on the demonstrators&#x27; demand.

Lamizana served as nominal head of a &quot;provisional military government&quot; until a new Constitution, ratified on 14 June 1970, provided for a four-year transition to fully civilian elected leadership; he was also foreign minister from 1966 to 1967. Elections under the new Constitution delivered a clear majority of the assembly to the UDV.

In the early 1970s the effect of a five-year drought and increasing desertification in the Sahel brought the threat of famine to several nations including Upper Volta. The resulting economic dislocation encouraged factionalism in the government, headed by Gérard Kango Ouédraogo, the prime minister who had been appointed by Lamizana. Again military intervention and dissolution of the assembly brought Lamizana back in control, essentially now as dictator.

Lamizana&#x27;s regime had international recognition and visited with U.S. President Richard Nixon. On 15 October 1973 Lamizana met with President Nixon and briefed him on the Sahel drought in the Oval Office. Lamizana explained that he represented himself and the other Sahel governments and hoped to secure aid during the famine and drought. Nixon promised to provide as much help as he could.

His personal party following was styled the National Movement for Renewal, although that became a short-lived formation. A new Constitution was written and approved in a referendum in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected in open elections in 1978; this election is generally considered as being among the most democratic ever held in West Africa. Later Lamizana joined UDV.

With the support of unions and civil groups, Col. Saye Zerbo overthrew Lamizana in a bloodless military coup in November 1980.

<doc id="289586" wikidata="Q1195639" url="?curid=289586" title="The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)">
<text>The Man with the Golden Gun is the twelfth and final novel in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; series and the thirteenth Bond book overall. It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 1 April 1965, eight months after the author&#x27;s death. The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series, leading to poor but polite reviews. Despite that, the book was a best-seller.

The story centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond, who had been posted missing, presumed dead, after his last mission in Japan. Bond returns to Britain via the Soviet Union, where he had been brainwashed to attempt to assassinate his superior, M. After being de-programmed by the MI6 doctors, Bond is sent to the Caribbean to find and kill Francisco Scaramanga, the titular &quot;Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

The first draft and part of the editing process was completed before Fleming&#x27;s death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. The publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to the writer and Bond aficionado Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not used.

The novel was serialised in 1965, firstly in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and then in &quot;Playboy&quot;; in 1966 a daily comic strip adaptation was also published in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. In 1974 the book was loosely adapted as the ninth film in the Eon Productions &quot;James Bond&quot; series, with Roger Moore playing Bond and Fleming&#x27;s cousin, Christopher Lee, as Scaramanga.

==Plot==
A year after James Bond&#x27;s final confrontation with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, while on a mission in Japan, a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet M, the head of the Secret Service. Bond&#x27;s identity is confirmed, but during his debriefing interview with M, Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol; the attempt fails. The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld&#x27;s castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled to the Soviet Union to learn his true identity. While there, he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon his return to England.

Now de-programmed, Bond is given a chance to again prove his worth as a member of the 00 section following the assassination attempt. M sends Bond to Jamaica and gives him the seemingly impossible mission of killing Francisco Scaramanga, a Cuban assassin who is believed to have killed several British secret agents. Scaramanga is known as &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; because his weapon of choice is a gold-plated Colt .45 revolver, which fires silver-jacketed, gold-cored dumdum bullets.

Bond locates Scaramanga in a Jamaican bordello and manages to become his temporary personal assistant under the name &quot;Mark Hazard&quot;. He learns that Scaramanga is involved in a hotel development on the island with a group of investors that consists of a syndicate of American gangsters and the KGB. Scaramanga and the other investors are also engaged in a scheme to destabilise Western interests in the Caribbean&#x27;s sugar industry and increase the value of the Cuban sugar crop, running drugs into America, smuggling prostitutes from Mexico into America and operating casinos in Jamaica that will cause friction between tourists and the locals.

Bond discovers that he has an ally who is also working undercover at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up listening devices in Scaramanga&#x27;s meeting room. They learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond&#x27;s true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, with the help of Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a hidden golden derringer. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him.

==Background and writing history==
By January 1964 Ian Fleming had published eleven books of the Bond series in eleven years: ten novels and a collection of short stories. A twelfth book, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, was being edited and prepared for production; it was released on 1 April 1963. Fleming wrote &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica in January and February 1964, completing it by the beginning of March. His declining health affected him badly during the writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words in four hours a day to a little over an hour&#x27;s worth of work a day. Fleming&#x27;s wife, Ann, was concerned about the effect it was having on her husband, and wrote to her brother that &quot;it is painful to see Ian struggle to give birth to Bond&quot;. Fleming based his title on Nelson Algren&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;; he also considered &quot;Goldenrod&quot; and &quot;Number 3½ Love Lane&quot;.

Fleming returned to Britain with a completed first draft of the manuscript in March 1964 and wrote to his friend and copy editor William Plomer saying it needed a lot of rewriting. He also told Plomer &quot;This is, alas, the last Bond and, again alas, I mean it, for I really have run out of puff and zest&quot;. By 10 May 1964 Fleming had been working on proofreading his manuscript and had corrected the first two-thirds of the book; he wrote to Plomer that he had not decided &quot;whether to publish in 1965 or give it another year&#x27;s working over so that we can go out with a bang instead of a whimper&quot;. He said he &quot;would personally like to take it back to Jamaica and paint the lily next year&quot;. He went on that as it was his final Bond novel, he did not want &quot;to short-weight my faithful readers on the dernier service&quot;. He became increasingly unhappy with the book, but was persuaded by Plomer that the novel was fit for publication. Five months after returning from Jamaica, on the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted that he &quot;had completed and was revising a new novel, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;&quot;.

Despite Plomer&#x27;s original thought about the state of the manuscript, Fleming&#x27;s publishers, Jonathan Cape, were concerned enough about the story to pass the manuscript to the writer Kingsley Amis to read on holiday. He was paid £35 15 shillings for his thoughts and advice, although his subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape. Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel was not up to Fleming&#x27;s usual standard. Raymond Benson, the author of the continuation Bond novels, has noted that the novel is missing the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming&#x27;s work; he suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming, but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion. &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was published posthumously, eight months after its author&#x27;s death.

Although Fleming did not date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have identified timelines based on episodes and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in 1963; Griswold is more precise and considers the story to have taken place between November 1963 and the end of February 1964.

==Development==

===Inspirations===
As with his previous novels, Fleming used events from his past as elements in his novel. While in Kitzbühel, Austria, in the 1930s, Fleming&#x27;s car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing, dragging him fifty yards along the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, but also in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;. Chancellor also considers that one of Fleming&#x27;s earlier novels, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, was an influence on &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, with the conference of gangsters from different gangs being used in both stories; in both novels—and in &quot;Moonraker&quot;—Bond, in an undercover capacity, acted as a male secretary to the villain.

As well as using events from his past, Fleming also used names of individuals he knew for some of his characters. The editor of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details about the effects of the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel&#x27;s SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the novel&#x27;s CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the book, was named after a member of 30 AU—the commando unit formed by Fleming during the war—who managed the Tate &amp; Lyle plantations in the West Indies after the war. The book&#x27;s main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming&#x27;s; the pair are said to have fought at school. Fleming also used the surname of his friend, Morris Cargill, a columnist on &quot;The Gleaner&quot;, as the name of the Justice of the Jamaican Supreme Court at the end of the book.

The effects of the two Eon Productions Bond films released before the writing of the novel—&quot;Dr. No&quot; and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;—were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.

===Characters===
The central character of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; is James Bond. He begins the novel having been brainwashed by the Soviets, but is soon de-programmed by the Secret Service. Amis considers that the &quot;brainwashing and de-brainwashing have evidently taken their toll, ... [as] on his last appearance 007 is, sadly, more of a man without qualities than ever before&quot;. Benson considers the character to have a different personality from the previous stories and to be robot-like; Benson also points out that the touches of humour displayed by Bond in the previous novels disappeared and he appeared in the book as cold and emotionless. Benson felt that Bond&#x27;s character had not been developed any further than in the previous books. while Amis thinks Bond&#x27;s personality has regenerated into &quot;a more mature stage&quot;.

The historian Jeremy Black notes that when given the opportunity to kill Scaramanga in cold blood, Bond cannot bring himself to do it. Sitting behind Scaramanga in a car, he considers shooting him in the back of the head (what he describes as &quot;the old Gestapo-KGB point of puncture&quot;) but decides against it for a number of reasons:

the itch of curiosity, an inbuilt dislike of cold murder, the feeling that this was not the predestined moment, the likelihood that he would have to murder the chauffeur also — these, combined with the softness of the night and the fact that the &#x27;Sound System&#x27; was now playing a good recording of one of his favourites, &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;, and that cicadas were singing from the lignum vitae tree, said &#x27;No&#x27;.

Black describes how the mention of the Gestapo serves as a frame of reference to readers, separating Bond from the methods of the Nazis. While Bond is described as a blunt instrument, he is not a cold-blooded killer and he has to rise above the actions of such enemies and act more suitably for a British fictional hero.
With this moral sense on display, Bond is portrayed as a gentleman. Once the mission is completed, Bond is offered the KCMG, but he refuses the honour and reflects on his own name, &quot;a quiet, dull, anonymous name&quot;, which had been Fleming&#x27;s aim when he first named the character.

For the first time in the Bond canon, M&#x27;s full name and title of &quot;Admiral Sir Miles Messervy KCMG&quot; was finally revealed. Despite being the target of the failed assassination attempt, not only does M not press charges against Bond, he sends him out on further missions.

According to Benson, the main adversary of the novel, Francisco Scaramanga, is more a henchman than a major adversary and &quot;a second-rate, smalltime crook who happens to have gotten lucky with his shooting&quot;. The weakness of the villain affects the standard of the novel; according to Chancellor the two weakest books in the Bond canon—&quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;—are the stories that do not have &quot;an older, super-intelligent villain&quot;, while Amis writes &quot;the overall inferiority of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; is typified by the ordinariness of Scaramanga, who entirely lacks the physical presence of Bond-villain at his best and remains a mere trigger-man whatever his (undemonstrated) deadliness&quot;.

The Anglicist Vivian Halloran notes that Scaramanga had the same character profile as Herr von Hammerstein, the former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. Both characters use their criminal expertise in the service of communist Cuba and invest in casinos in Jamaica. The literary critic Meir Sternberg observes that many of the Bond villains are monstrous—a definition in which he includes deformity of one of the parts of their bodies; Scaramanga is one of these, possessing three nipples. The significance is described in the novel as &quot;a sign of invulnerability and great sexual prowess&quot; to local cults. Benson writes that despite the reference in the early chapters—in the Secret Service file on Scaramanga—the characteristic does not feature in the rest of the novel, nor does Scaramanga&#x27;s impotence, which is also on the file.

==Style==
Within the text Benson identifies what he describes as the &quot;Fleming Sweep&quot;, the use of &quot;hooks&quot; at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. In &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, the sweep is used to keep the storyline moving along at pace. Benson comments that it moves the story too quickly in places, and gives the example that Bond&#x27;s deprogramming is missing from the story. 

Fleming later said of his work, &quot;while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as &#x27;thrillers designed to be read as literature&#x27;.&quot; He used well-known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which Amis called &quot;the Fleming effect&quot;. Amis describes it as &quot;the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond&#x27;s world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced&quot;. Amis wrote of that the lack of the effect was one of &quot;the deficiencies of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;—no decent villain, no decent conspiracy, no branded goods except Bond&#x27;s new Hoffritz razor&quot;. Benson highlighted the lack of detail and descriptions; he notes that these were normally added by Fleming in the second draft of the story, which could explain their absence.

==Themes==
&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; is one of three Bond novels to deal with the disruption of markets and the economy. The novel includes sugar price fixing in the Caribbean, and the importance of open markets in world trade. Scaramanga provides the Rastafarians with drugs in return for arson in the sugar plantations to raise sugar prices. This was a return of the theme used in Fleming&#x27;s 1960 short story &quot;Risico&quot;, of drugs being used for political purposes to undermine the West. The arson was part of a wider conspiracy by Scaramanga and his KGB connection, Hendricks, to destabilise the region by a campaign of industrial sabotage against companies based in Jamaica, including Reynolds Metal, Kaiser Bauxite and Aluminia.

The changing fortunes of the British Empire are reflected in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. In contrast to &quot;Live and let Die&quot; (1954) and &quot;Dr No&quot; (1958), in which Jamaica was still part of the Empire and was the Secret Service&#x27;s territory, by the time of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, Jamaica had attained full independence, and the Central Intelligence Agency were operating there without the need for permission from the Secret Service. Parker notes that, despite the independence, neither the UK nor the US informed or involved the Jamaican authorities about their investigations until afterwards. Black notes that the independent inquiry at the end of the novel, conducted in Bond&#x27;s hospital bedroom, was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary and the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting &quot;under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID&quot;; Bond and Leiter are also awarded the Jamaican Police Medal for &quot;Services to the Independent State of Jamaica.&quot; Black observes that this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, underlining the collapse of the British Empire.

==Release and reception==
===Publication history===
&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was published in the UK on 1 April 1965 by Jonathan Cape, was 221 pages long and cost eighteen shillings. Fleming&#x27;s regular cover artist Richard Chopping undertook the cover design again and was paid 300 guineas for the artwork. Chopping&#x27;s design caused him problems, as it was not possible to show the full gun on the front cover at the scale he wanted, so he had to make it a wraparound cover, with the barrel extending onto the back cover. He also incorporated the skull of a snake, which echoed the appearance of a snake at the book&#x27;s climax. The illustration was based on a real gold-plated Colt SAA, which was hired from a gunsmith. Some booksellers did not like the wraparound cover, as it meant they had to display to books open for people to see the full cover.

&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was published in the US in August 1965 by New American Library, was 183 pages long and cost $4.50. Even before the US edition was published, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was ninth place on the best-seller lists, with 80,000 pre-orders for the hardback version.

In July 1966 Pan Books published a paperback version of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in the UK that sold 273,000 copies before the end of the year and 485,000 in 1967. Since its initial publication the book has been re-issued in hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and, as at 2025, has never been out of print.

===Critical reception===
The reviews for &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; provided little praise although much of the criticism was muted, possibly, according to Parker, because of Fleming&#x27;s death. Chancellor considers that the reviews were &quot;polite and rather sad ... recognising that the book had effectively been left half-finished, and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game&quot;. Amis&#x27;s review in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; described the novel as &quot;a sadly empty tale, empty of the interests and effects that for better or worse, Ian Fleming made his own&quot;. Amis pointed to what he considered weaknesses in the novel, and questioned whether these showed that parts of the manuscript could have done with more work. Also observing that there were points, particularly at the beginning of the book, which Fleming did not follow up was the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reviewer, Richard Lister, although he did not indicate which points. Another who questioned the unpolished nature of the book was Maurice Richardson of &quot;The Observer&quot;, who wrote that &quot;perhaps Ian Fleming was very tired when he wrote it. Perhaps ... he left it unrevised. The fact remains that this posthumous Bond is a sadly sub-standard job.&quot; 

Some critics viewed the novel in the light of other Bond books. Richardson&#x27;s review contained some muted praise when he wrote &quot;it isn&#x27;t of course by any means totally unreadable but it&#x27;s depressingly far from the best Bond&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Christopher Wordsworth wrote &quot;the distance between &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Ian Fleming&#x27;s second and best, and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, his last and worst, is a long iron down the Sandwich fairway.&quot; Calling &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; a &quot;farrago&quot;, Wordsworth thought that &quot;since &quot;Goldfinger&quot; 007 has been toiling hopelessly in the wake of the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;&quot;.

Some reviewers viewed &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in the light of other works in the genre. William Trevor, writing in &quot;The Listener&quot;, was dismissive of the work, thinking that &quot;Bond continues to behave with so little originality that neither Templar nor Drummond, Marlowe nor Nick Charles, would have paused to waste a pellet on him&quot;; he continued, saying that &quot;this present work is once again a fantasy for grown-up children, neither as clever nor exciting as the early thrillers of Edgar Wallace or the boys adventure stories of fifty years ago&quot;. D.A.N. Jones, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, thought &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was &quot;an innocuous run-of-the-mill adventure story of 1911 vintage&quot;. Looking at the wider impact of Fleming and his work, Anthony Lejeune, writing in the &quot;National Review&quot;, thought that it &quot;is undeniably slight, but, like everything Fleming wrote, intensely readable ... In a sense Fleming&#x27;s job was finished. He had irrevocably transformed the genre in which he worked&quot;. Lejeune went on to say that &quot;in highbrow novels sex and violence are treated gloomily: in Fleming&#x27;s stories they are presented cheerfully with full enjoyment.&quot;

The critic for &quot;Time&quot; was damning, saying that &quot;It may have been just as well that Fleming died when everybody still thought he could do no wrong&quot;. the critic for &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that &quot;James Bond should have had a better exit. Sadly [it] ... ends not with a bang but a whimper. The world will be a vastly more lacklustre and complicated place with 007 gone.&quot; The novel was generally reviewed more positively in the US than in the UK, Benson opines, and the Associated Press wrote that &quot;Bond and Fleming were fun. They entertained, sometimes mildly, often grandly – but always consistently. Life will be less interesting without them.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Charles Poore wrote that &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was &quot;a gory, glittering saga&quot;. Poore noted that &quot;The Gee-whizzery ... starts early and never flags&quot; and that, despite Fleming&#x27;s death, &quot;the James Bond spirit soars on&quot;. The critic for &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; lamented the fact that &quot;Bond has gone out like a lamb; even the girls are below par, while the villain seems like a refuge from a seedy Western. But we&#x27;ll miss our James&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper in ten daily parts from 22 March 1965 onwards. The novel was also adapted as a daily comic strip which was published in the same newspaper and syndicated around the world. The adaptation, written by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak, ran from 10 January to 10 September 1966. The strip was reprinted by Titan Books in June 1987 and reissued in 2004. Titan reissued the strip again in &quot;The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 002&quot;, published in 2011. The novel was also serialised over four issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; from April to July 1965.

In 1974 Eon Productions made the ninth Bond film, loosely based on the novel. The film starred Roger Moore as Bond and Fleming&#x27;s cousin, Christopher Lee, as Scaramanga. The film moved away from Jamaica to the Far East and borrowed from the martial arts genre that was popular in the 1970s. The plot also changed and used the 1973 energy crisis as a backdrop to the film, allowing the MacGuffin of the &quot;Solex agitator&quot; to be introduced. &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; was dramatised as a 90-minute radio play on BBC Radio 4 in March 2020; Toby Stephens played Bond.

<text>Spy Game is a 2001 action thriller film directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert Redford
and Brad Pitt. The American–French–German–Japanese co-production grossed $62 million in the United States and $143 million worldwide on a $115 million budget and received mostly positive reviews from film critics.

==Plot==
In 1991, the United States and China are close to a major trade agreement, with the President due to visit China to seal the deal. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learns that its asset Tom Bishop has been arrested at a People&#x27;s Liberation Army prison in Suzhou and will be executed in 24 hours unless the U.S. government claims him and bargains for his release. Bishop&#x27;s actions, unsanctioned by the CIA, risk jeopardizing the agreement. A group of CIA executives summon Nathan Muir, a veteran case officer and Bishop&#x27;s mentor, who plans to retire from the Agency at the end of the day. While purportedly interviewing Muir to learn his history with Bishop, the executives seek a pretext for not intervening on Bishop&#x27;s imprisonment. Unknown to them, Muir was tipped off about Bishop&#x27;s capture by fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan, the Hong Kong Station Chief.

Muir leaks the story to CNN through an MI6 contact, Digby &#x27;Digger&#x27; Gibson in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force American intervention. They are stalled briefly before a phone call to the FCC from Deputy Director for Operations Charles Harker results in CNN retracting the story as a hoax. Muir met Bishop in 1975 when Bishop was a United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper during the Vietnam War. Muir gives Bishop a mission to eliminate a high-ranking Laotian Army officer. Bishop and his spotter, Tran, assassinate the target despite being compromised, and Bishop downs a pursuing enemy attack helicopter. Bishop escorts the now wounded Tran to safety, impressing Muir. In 1976, Muir recruited Bishop as a CIA asset in West Berlin, where Bishop was tasked with procuring assets in East Germany. Then he discusses Bishop&#x27;s spy work in Beirut in 1985, during the War of the Camps, which was their last mission together.

In a series of flashbacks, Bishop is troubled by Muir&#x27;s conviction that civilian &quot;assets&quot; who endangered a mission should be sacrificed to preserve the &quot;greater good.&quot; After Bishop attempts to countermand Muir during a mission to save the life of an asset, Muir emphasizes that he will not tolerate dissent, and would not rescue Bishop if he was captured going &quot;off the reservation&quot;. During a mission in Lebanon, Bishop, posing as a photojournalist, meets relief worker Elizabeth Hadley. While using her to connect with an asset for the mission, they became romantically involved. Muir distrusts Hadley and reveals to Bishop that she was exiled from the United Kingdom. Hadley later confesses to Bishop that she was involved in the bombing of a Chinese building in Britain, which was supposed to be empty but contained Chinese nationals. Bishop reveals to Hadley his true identity. Muir elects again to sacrifice a civilian asset for the sake of their mission, and Bishop cuts professional ties with Muir. Muir, fearing that Hadley could threaten the Agency and potentially Bishop, makes a deal with the Chinese, exchanging Hadley in return for an arrested U.S. diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and a Dear John letter is forged and left for Bishop.

In the present, Muir realizes that Bishop went to China for Hadley. In a series of misdirections, he forges a directive signed by the Director of Central Intelligence to begin &quot;Operation Dinner Out&quot;, a rescue mission spearheaded by a SEAL team that Bishop had developed as a &quot;Plan B&quot; for his own attempt at rescuing Hadley. Using $282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan to assist him in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which the SEAL rescue team will retrieve Bishop and Hadley. Harker is suspicious that Muir is working against the CIA, but when he confronts Muir before the gathered executives, Muir &quot;confesses&quot; to unprofessionally using company resources to gather information about his intended retirement home, which he has distorted the evidence to support. Bishop is rescued along with Hadley and surmises that Muir was responsible for saving him when he hears the helicopter pilot refer to &quot;Operation Dinner Out&quot;, which was also the code name for an operation Bishop used to get a birthday gift for Muir while they were in Lebanon. When the CIA officials are belatedly informed of the rescue, Muir has already left the building and is seen driving safely off into the countryside.

==Cast==

In addition, Garrick Hagon appears as CIA Director Cy Wilson. Benedict Wong appears as Tran.

An American–French–German–Japanese co-production, it was shot in Morocco from November 5, 2000 to March 19, 2001, as well as in Budapest. The film was originally to be directed by Mike van Diem. Pitt passed on playing the title role in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; for this project. It made its worldwide premiere at the Mann National Theatre on November 19, 2001.

==Soundtrack==
==Home video==
The film was released by Universal Studios Home Video on DVD and VHS on April 9, 2002.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Spy Game&quot; grossed $62.4million domestically (United States and Canada) and $80.7million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $143million, against a budget of $115million. It peaked at No. 3, in its opening weekend, and spent its first five weeks in the Top10 at the domestic box office.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said, &quot;It is not a bad movie, mind you; it&#x27;s clever and shows great control of craft, but it doesn&#x27;t care, and so it&#x27;s hard for us to care about.&quot;
==Novels==
In 2022, Michael Frost Beckner, the co-screenwriter of &quot;Spy Game&quot;, published a trilogy of novels featuring characters from the film: &quot;Muir’s Gambit&quot;, &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Endgame&quot;, and &quot;Aiken in Check&quot;.

<text>Surface-water hydrology is the sub-field of hydrology concerned with above-earth water (&quot;surface water&quot;), in contrast to groundwater hydrology that deals with water below the surface of the Earth. Its applications include rainfall and runoff, the routes that surface water takes (for example through rivers or reservoirs), and the occurrence of floods and droughts. Surface-water hydrology is used to predict the effects of water constructions such as dams and canals. It considers the layout of the watershed, geology, soils, vegetation, nutrients, energy and wildlife. Modelled aspects include precipitation, the interception of rain water by vegetation or artificial structures, evaporation, the runoff function and the soil-surface system itself.

When surface water seeps into the ground above bedrock, it is categorized as groundwater, and the rate at which this occurs determines baseflow needs for instream flow, as well as subsurface water levels in wells. While groundwater is not part of surface-water hydrology, it must be taken into account for a full understanding of the behaviour of surface water.

Glacial hydrology is a part of surface-water hydrology; some of the runoff from glaciers and snow also involves groundwater hydrology concepts.

<text>Bolton Field is a public airport in Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio, United States. It is a towered airport operated under the Columbus Regional Airport Authority. It is one of 12 general aviation reliever airports in Ohio recognized in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) and is a reliever airport for John Glenn Columbus International Airport.

Most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but Bolton Field is TZR to the FAA and has no IATA code.

==History==
Bolton Field opened on October 24, 1970, a day after Franklin County Common Pleas Court rejected a move by a nearby private airport (located on Darby Dan Farm) to stop it. Major Harry Charles Davidson, a WWII veteran residing in Groveport, Ohio, was the first airport manager at Bolton Field. Major Harry Charles Davidson was appointed by Mayor of Columbus, Jack Sensenbrenner. The airport is named after long-time Port Columbus International Airport Superintendent Francis A. &quot;Jack&quot; Bolton, honored posthumously when the city dedicated the airfield to him at its opening. The airport was built to handle personal and business aviation, freeing Port Columbus for commercial traffic.

In 1980, the operation of John Glenn International Airport (formerly Port Columbus International Airport) and Bolton Field Airport was transferred from the City of Columbus to the Columbus Airport Authority; in 2003, the Columbus Airport Authority and the Rickenbacker Port Authority merged to create the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which manages John Glenn Columbus International (CMH), Rickenbacker International Airport (LCK) and Bolton Field (TZR) airports.

The airport is home to regular events hosted by the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s Young Eagles Program.

== Facilities and aircraft==
Bolton Field covers and has one asphalt runway (4/22), which measures . Fuel is available; planes can use tiedowns or hangars for parking.

Capital City Jet provides flight instruction, fixed-base operations, and air charter services. FBO amenities include a conference room, a crew lounge, snooze rooms, a courtesy car, and more.

Columbus State Community College has an Aviation Maintenance Training Program on the field.

Scioto Valley 99s and Central Ohio Balloon Club are aviation organizations located on the grounds. There is also a barbecue restaurant on the field, which offers dinner and airplane rides each year on Valentine&#x27;s Day.

For the 12-month period ending ending June 7, 2022, the airport had 26,932 aircraft operations, average 74 per day. It was nearly 100% general aviation as well as &lt;1% air taxi and &lt;1% military. For the same time period, 64 aircraft are based at this airport: 57 single-engine and 6 multi-engine airplanes as well as 1 helicopter. This is down from 74,511 aircraft operations and 82 based aircraft in 2011.

== Incidents and accidents ==
* On October 8, 1992, an aircraft veered left and departed the runway while landing at Bolton Field. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain control of the airplane.
* On June 18, 1993, upon approach for landing on grass runway 22, a Glasflügel H-101 glider registered N101AZ, encountered a powered airplane, which had entered the landing pattern. The pilot extended his base leg to the approach to accommodate the aircraft. He then decided that it would be difficult to complete the landing on the planned runway, so he switched to a site he was unfamiliar with. During this landing, the glider impacted a ditch. The ultra-light aircraft suffered damage to its tail section.
* On March 23, 2003, a Piper PA-22 was substantially damaged during takeoff from Bolton Field. A CFI onboard was providing instruction to the private pilot flying, who himself had not flown since 1983. On the accident takeoff, the aircraft was almost at takeoff speed when it began to veer to the right. The CFI took control of the airplane and attempted to correct; however, the airplane departed the right side of the runway, and ground-looped. The left main landing gear collapsed and the left wing struck the ground. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot under instruction&#x27;s failure to maintain directional control, and the flight instructor&#x27;s delayed remedial action.
* On February 14, 2017, a Beech D55 Baron impacted runway 22 at the Bolton Field Airport following a loss of left engine power during takeoff. Just after takeoff, the left engine began to lose power and its rpm began dropping. The left seat pilot transferred control to the right seat passenger, who tried to land the aircraft on the remaining runway. The aircraft landed hard, but the right seat pilot managed to stop the aircraft on the runway surface. The left main gear was found to have collapsed. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the partial loss of left engine power during takeoff and initial climb, which led to a hard landing in gusting crosswind conditions; the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined because postaccident examination of the left engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

<text>A home zone (or play street) is a living street (or group of streets) as implemented in the United Kingdom, which are designed primarily to meet the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, children and residents and where the speeds and dominance of cars is reduced. Quiet lanes are a similar concept in rural areas.

==History==
The Highway Act 1835 banned the playing of football and street games on the highway with a maximum penalty of forty shillings (£ as of 2015). In 1860 Taverner John Miller, MP for Colchester reported to the House of Commons that in the previous year 44 children had been sent to prison in London and Middlesex for failure to pay fines for playing in the street, highlighting the case of a 12-year-old boy sent to prison for 5 days for playing rounders. In 1925 Nancy Astor MP noted in the Commons that &quot;There is no more pitiable sight in life than a child which has been arrested for playing in the street&quot;. By 1935 over 2,000 young people under the age of seventeen are prosecuted for playing in the streets.

In 1934 Leslie Hore-Belisha became Transport Minister and initiated a number of road safety schemes in response the rising number of Road Casualties in Great Britain; these included the zebra crossing and a proposal to introduce play streets to the UK, which had been successfully operating in the USA. Following a trial of 200 Play Streets in Manchester and Salford from 1936, the Street Playground Act 1938 allowed councils to designate streets as playgrounds where games could be played.

In 1957 the Transport Minister was asked in the Commons if he was aware that playground streets regulations were being ignored and were frequently used by through traffic; the Minister responded saying that the size of Playground Streets signs had recently been increased in size to make them more prominent. Play street legislation was included in section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1960.

By 1963 there were 750 such streets around the country, but there was also growing conflict between the needs of children and the needs of motorists. In that year Ernest Marples, the Transport minister, was asked in the Commons if he could make a statement about the issue of car parking in play streets; he responded by indicating that he had only occasionally received complaints about parking issues in play streets. In the same year a petition was presented in the Commons from residents objecting to the illegal use of their playground street in Westminster being used by through-traffic and by people parking cars By contrast, the minister was also questioned in the Commons about a recently approved Playgrounds Street Order for a number of streets in Newcastle which was reported to have been opposed by all residents. In 1976 Trevor Huddleston, the Bishop of Stepney commented that Britain appeared to prefer motor cars to children &#x27;by cluttering up Play Streets with parked cars&#x27;. By the 1980s Playgrounds Streets had been largely forgotten; there were streets which retained the signage and accompanying traffic restrictions, however residents&#x27; parked cars left no space for play.

==Current legislation==
===Home Zone===

The main enabling legislation for home zones is given in section 268 of the Transport Act 2000 which allows the creation of &#x27;use orders&#x27; which are orders that &#x27;permit the use of a road for purposes other than passage&#x27; such as social interaction and children&#x27;s play. In 2002 Farley Bank, a cul-de-sac in Hastings was designated as a Play Street giving children traffic-free space for play between 8am and sunset.

===Quiet Lane===
The same act introduced the concept of the Quiet Lane which allows similar social uses in rural roads, following pilot projects in Kent and Norfolk.

==Principles==

These principles are similar to those of the &quot;shared space&quot; type schemes, which apply also to a wider range of environments and follow closely the pattern of the Dutch woonerf schemes.

Encouraging children&#x27;s play is an important aim of many home zone schemes. Home zones have a very good safety record, but are not primarily designed as road safety schemes.

Home zones are encouraged by the UK Government as part of new residential areas. Although it is not possible for prospective residents to be involved in the design of new streets, steps can be taken to involve them in their maintenance and management. Residents must be need to be consulted by the local Traffic Authority on the precise uses that can take place on the street (specified through a &#x27;Use Order&#x27;) and the appropriate speed of traffic on the street (specified through a &#x27;Speed Order&#x27;) before the home zone can be legally designated and signed.

Home zones often involved the use of shared space, where the street is not strongly divided into exclusive pedestrian and traffic areas. Concerns have been expressed over the inability of blind and partially sighted people to use shared space streets. Providing a clear route for pedestrians that is kept free of traffic, by using street furniture for example, is one way of meeting the needs of the visually impaired.

Well-designed home zones often include features such as benches, tables and play equipment to encourage social interaction. Street trees and areas of planting, ideally maintained by residents, will often feature. On-street parking also forms part of the layout in most schemes.

Traffic speeds are kept low – with a typical target speed being around 20 km/h (10–15 mph) – through the overall design of the street and features such as sharp changes of direction for traffic and narrowings where only one motor vehicle can pass at a time. Traditional traffic calming features such as road humps can also be used, but should be integrated into the design rather than being added as an engineered afterthought.

Examples of UK practice include Staiths South Bank in Gateshead, which at over 600 homes was the largest newbuild home zone development in the UK at the time it received planning consent. Most contemporary UK schemes have involved public realm works to existing streets in older Victorian housing areas, often to meet regeneration or traffic calming objectives.

<text>Arguineguín (Guanche for &quot;quiet water&quot;) is one of the most populated towns along the south coast of Gran Canaria, Spain. A once typical Canarian fishing village, it is now home to both locals and tourists, as the settlement has continued to grow. In 2015 it had 2517 inhabitants. It is part of the municipality of Mogán and is located southwest of Las Palmas.

There are several bars and restaurants, the latter specialising in fresh fish caught the same day. Tuesday is market day (the largest on the island). Arguineguín features a beach and a port. Tourism is not as popular in Arguineguín as in the larger places as Maspalomas and Playa del Ingles. Holiday hotels, however, can be found in Arguineguín; Marino I, Dorado Beach, Club Puerto Atlantico, Sunwing Resort Arguineguín, Green Beach Hotel and Radisson Blu Resort to mention the larger ones.

==Transportation==
The harbour here hosts a ferry service to Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria and Puerto de Mogán whilst another popular way to reach the town from Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria is by trekking over the mountain between the two towns.

The town also lies on several public bus routes offering convenient service to other towns on the island.

Arguineguín is also served by an expressway (GC1) with a nearby interchange and a highway.

<doc id="289607" wikidata="Q2462253" url="?curid=289607" title="Smoking cessation">
<text>Smoking cessation, usually called quitting smoking or stopping smoking, is the process of discontinuing tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult.

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and a global public health concern. Tobacco use leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), emphysema, and various types and subtypes of cancers (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the oropharynx, larynx, and mouth, esophageal and pancreatic cancer). Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases. The risk of heart attack in a smoker decreases by 50% after one year of cessation. Similarly, the risk of lung cancer decreases by 50% in 10 years of cessation 

From 2001 to 2010, about 70% of smokers in the United States expressed a desire to quit smoking, and 50% reported having attempted to do so in the past year. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (&quot;cold turkey&quot;), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. In recent years, especially in Canada and the United Kingdom, many smokers have switched to using electronic cigarettes to quit smoking tobacco. However, a 2022 study found that 20% of smokers who tried to use e-cigarettes to quit smoking succeeded but 66% of them ended as dual users of cigarettes and vape products one year out.

Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. A meta-analysis from 2018, conducted on 61 randomized controlled trials, showed that among people who quit smoking with a cessation medication and some behavioral help, approximately 20% were still nonsmokers a year later, as compared to 12% who did not take medication.

In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction.

==Smoking cessation methods==
===Unassisted===
It often takes several attempts, and potentially utilizing different approaches each time, before achieving long-term abstinence. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as &quot;cold turkey&quot;, or with home remedies. Previous smokers make between an estimated 6 to 30 attempts before successfully quitting. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult. It has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. In the U.S., for example, the rate of unassisted quitting fell from 91.8% in 1986 to 52.1% during 2006 to 2009. The most frequent unassisted methods were &quot;cold turkey&quot;, a term that has been used to mean either unassisted quitting or abrupt quitting and &quot;gradually decreased number&quot; of cigarettes, or &quot;cigarette reduction&quot;.

====Cold turkey====
&quot;Cold turkey&quot; is a colloquial term indicating abrupt withdrawal from an addictive drug. In this context, it indicates sudden and complete cessation of all nicotine use. In three studies, it was the quitting method cited by 76%, 85%, or 88% of long-term successful quitters. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was &quot;not at all difficult&quot; to stop, 27% said it was &quot;fairly difficult&quot;, and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Studies have found that two-thirds of recent quitters reported using the cold turkey method and found it helpful.

==== Cutting down to quit ====
Gradual reduction involves slowly reducing one&#x27;s daily intake of nicotine. This method can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower nicotine levels, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation. There is no significant difference in quit rates between smokers who quit by gradual reduction or abrupt cessation as measured by abstinence from smoking of at least six months from the quit day. The same review also looked at five pharmacological aids for reduction. When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can positively affect quitting for six months or longer.

===Medications===

The American Cancer Society notes that &quot;Studies in medical journals have reported that about 25% of smokers who use medicines can stay smoke-free for over 6 months.&quot; Single medications include:
*Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. High-quality evidence indicates that these forms of NRT improve the success rate of people who attempt to stop smoking. NRTs are meant to be used for a short period of time and should be tapered down to a low dose before stopping. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50 to 60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. Some reported side effects are local slight irritation (inhalers and sprays) and non-ischemic chest pain (rare). Others include mouth soreness and dyspepsia (gum), nausea or heartburn (lozenges), as well as sleep disturbances, insomnia, and a local skin reaction (patches). A study found that 93% of over-the-counter NRT users relapse and return to smoking within six months. There is weak evidence that adding mecamylamine to nicotine is more effective than nicotine alone.
*Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. Although bupropion increases the risk of getting adverse events, there is no clear evidence that the drug has more or less adverse effects when compared to a placebo. Nortriptyline produces significant rates of abstinence versus placebo. Other antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and St. John&#x27;s wort have not been consistently shown to be effective for smoking cessation.
*Varenicline decreases the urge to smoke and reduces withdrawal symptoms and is therefore considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline is higher than with bupropion or NRT. Varenicline more than doubled the chances of quitting compared to placebo, and was also as effective as combining two types of NRT. 2 mg/day of varenicline has been found to lead to the highest abstinence rate (33.2%) of any single therapy, while 1 mg/day leads to an abstinence rate of 25.4%. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded there is no evidence supporting a connection between varenicline and increased cardiovascular events. Concerns arose that varenicline may cause neuropsychiatric side effects, including suicidal thoughts and behavior. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries &quot;did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo&quot;. No link between depressed moods, agitation or suicidal thinking in smokers taking varenicline to decrease the urge to smoke has been identified. For people who have pre-existing mental health difficulties, varenicline may slightly increase the risk of experiencing these neuropsychiatric adverse events.
*Clonidine may reduce withdrawal symptoms and &quot;approximately doubles abstinence rates when compared to a placebo,&quot; but its side effects include dry mouth and sedation, and abruptly stopping the drug can cause high blood pressure and other side effects.
*There is no good evidence anxiolytics are helpful.
*Previously, rimonabant, which is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonist, was used to help in quitting and moderate the expected weight gain. But it is important to know that the manufacturers of rimonabant and taranabant stopped production in 2008 due to serious CNS side effects.

The 2008 US Guideline specifies that three combinations of medications are effective:
*Long-term nicotine patch and &quot;ad libitum&quot; NRT gum or spray
*Nicotine patch and nicotine inhaler
*Nicotine patch and bupropion (the only combination that the US FDA has approved for smoking cessation)

A meta-analysis from 2018, conducted on 61 RCTs, showed that during their first year of trying to quit, approximately 80% of the participants in the studies who got drug assistance (bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) returned to smoking, while 20% continued to not smoke for the entire year (i.e.: remained sustained abstinent). In comparison, 12% the people who got placebo kept from smoking for (at least) an entire year. This makes the net benefit of the drug treatment to be 8% after the first 12 months. In other words, out of 100 people who will take medication, approximately 8 of them would remain non-smoking after one year thanks to the treatment. During one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months.

===Community interventions===
Community interventions using &quot;multiple channels to provide reinforcement, support and norms for not smoking&quot; may have an effect on smoking cessation outcomes among adults. Specific methods used in the community to encourage smoking cessation among adults include:
*Policies making workplaces and public places smoke-free. It is estimated that &quot;comprehensive clean indoor laws&quot; can increase smoking cessation rates by 12%–38%. In 2008, the New York State of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services banned smoking by patients, staff, and volunteers at 1,300 addiction treatment centers.
*Voluntary rules making homes smoke-free, which are thought to promote smoking cessation.
*Initiatives to educate the public regarding the health effects of second-hand smoke, including the significant dangers of secondhand smoke infiltration for residents of multi-unit housing.
*Increasing the price of tobacco products, for example by taxation. The US Task Force on Community Preventive Services found &quot;strong scientific evidence&quot; that this is effective in increasing tobacco use cessation It is estimated that an increase in price of 10% will increase smoking cessation rates by 3–5%.
*Mass media campaigns. There is evidence to suggest that when combined with other types of interventions, mass media campaigns may be of benefit.
*Weak evidence suggests that imposing institutional level smoking bans in hospitals and prisons may reduce smoking rates and second hand smoke exposure.
*Researchers explored whether an opportunistic stop smoking intervention (advice, a vape starter pack and a referral to stop smoking services) was effective for people attending the emergency department. At 6 months, more people who received the intervention had quit smoking compared with people who received advice only.

==== Pharmacist Interventions ====
Pharmacist-led interventions have proven to be effective in helping smoking cessation attempts. Many systematic reviews have looked at the importance of pharmacist involvement. In Malaysia, their study looked at how pharmacist intervention in patients&#x27; overall healthcare showed improvements in screening early stages of disease. This allowed for earlier treatment starts in smoking-caused COPD. In addition, pharmacists in Malaysia could prescribe NRT products, and when they led a smoking cessation service, it was more successful than other smoking cessation trials in Malaysia. It was also shown that pharmacist counselling and NRT products were more effective in smoking cessation than using NRT alone.

In pharmacist-led smoking cessation services in Ethiopia, the study found statistically and clinically significant benefits favouring pharmacist intervention. They found that structured care, and regular visits, easy accessibility to pharmacists helped more people trying to quit than without. However, the study concluded that more research should be done in the area as they found an unknown risk of bias in the studies included

Another systematic review analyzed pharmacist intervention in smoking cessation and alcohol and weight interventions. They found that evidence suggests that the longer the duration of pharmacist-led intervention, the more influential the attempt at quitting was In addition, they found that community pharmacists were beneficial in delivering public health information. Pharmacists have a great reach in the community to help with smoking cessation and have proven to help with lifestyle modifications and proper NRT use.

=== Digital interventions ===

* Interactive web-based and stand-alone computer programs and online communities assist participants in quitting. For example, &quot;quit meters&quot; keep track of statistics such as how long a person has remained abstinent. Computerised and interactive tailored interventions may be promising, however, the evidence base for such interventions is weak.
* A mobile phone-based intervention where automated, supportive text messages are sent alongside other forms of support helps more people quit smoking: &quot;The current evidence supports a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based cessation interventions on six-month cessation outcomes.&quot; A 2011 randomized trial of mobile phone-based smoking cessation support in the UK found that a Txt2Stop cessation program significantly improved cessation rates at six months. A 2013 meta-analysis also noted &quot;modest benefits&quot; of mobile health interventions.
* Interactive web-based programs combined with a Mobile phone: Two RCTs documented long-term treatment effects (abstinence rate: 20-22%) of such interventions.

===Psychosocial approaches===
*The Great American Smokeout is an annual event that invites smokers to quit for one day, hoping they will be able to extend this forever.
*The World Health Organization&#x27;s World No Tobacco Day is held on May 31 each year.
*Smoking-cessation support is often offered over the telephone quitlines (e.g., the US toll-free number 1-800-QUIT-NOW), or in person. Three meta-analyses have concluded that telephone cessation support is effective when compared with minimal or no counselling or self-help and that telephone cessation support with medication is more effective than medication alone, and that intensive individual counselling is more effective than the brief personal counselling intervention. A slight tendency towards better results for more intensive counselling was also observed in another meta-analysis. This analysis distinguished between reactive (smokers calling quitlines) and proactive (smokers receiving calls) interventions. For people who called the quitline themselves, additional calls helped to quit smoking for six months or longer. When proactively initiating contact with a smoker, telephone counselling increased the chances of smoking cessation by 2–4% compared with people who received no calls. There is about 10% to 25% increase in the chance of smoking cessation success with more behavioral support provided in person or via telephone when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy.
*Online social cessation networks attempt to emulate offline group cessation models using purpose built web applications. They are designed to promote online social support and encouragement for smokers when (usually automatically calculated) milestones are reached. Early studies have shown social cessation to be especially effective with smokers aged 19–29.
*Group or individual psychological support can help people who want to quit. Recently, group therapy has been more helpful than self-help and some other individual intervention. The psychological support form of counselling can be effective alone; combining it with medication is more effective, and the number of support sessions with medication correlates with effectiveness. The counselling styles that have been effective in smoking cessation activities include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy, methods based on cognitive behavioral therapy.
*The Freedom From Smoking group clinic includes eight sessions and features a step-by-step plan for quitting smoking. Each session is designed to help smokers gain control over their behavior. The clinic format encourages participants to work on the process and problems of quitting both individually and as part of a group.
*Multiple formats of psychosocial interventions increase quit rates: 10.8% for no intervention, 15.1% for one format, 18.5% for 2 formats, and 23.2% for three or four formats.
*The transtheoretical model, including &quot;stages of change&quot;, has been used in tailoring smoking cessation methods to individuals, however, there is some evidence to suggest that &quot;stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling are neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents.&quot;

==== How to set a quit date ====
Most smoking cessation resources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Mayo Clinic encourage smokers to create a quit plan, including setting a quit date, which helps them anticipate and plan for smoking challenges. A quit plan can improve a smoker&#x27;s chance of a successful quit as can setting Monday, as the quit date, given that research has shown that Monday more than any other day is when smokers are seeking information online to quit smoking and calling state quitlines. In Nepal, smokers are not selfish, a health campaign of two weeks is started on the occasion of Valentine day and Vasant panchami to motiviate individuals to quit smoking as a sacrifice for their loved ones and making it a meaningful decision of life. This campaign is taking public attention.

==== Self-help ====

Self-help materials may produce a small increase in quit rates specially when there is no other supporting intervention form. &quot;The effect of self-help was weak&quot;, and the number of types of self-help did not produce higher abstinence rates. Nevertheless, self-help modalities for smoking cessation include:
*In-person self-help groups such as Nicotine Anonymous, or web-based cessation resources such as Smokefree.gov, which offers various types of assistance including self-help materials.
*WebMD: a resource providing health information, tools for managing health, and support.
*Self-help books such as Allen Carr&#x27;s &quot;Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot;.
*Spirituality: In one survey of adult smokers, 88% reported a history of spiritual practice or belief, and of those more than three-quarters were of the opinion that using spiritual resources may help them quit smoking.
*A review of mindfulness training as a treatment for addiction showed reduction in craving and smoking following training.
*Physical activities help in the maintenance of smoking cessation even if there is no conclusive evidence of the most appropriate exercise intensity.

====Biochemical feedback====
Various methods allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use and the immediate effects of quitting. Using biochemical feedback methods can allow tobacco users to be identified and assessed, and monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit. Evidence-wise, little is known about the effects of using biomechanical tests to determine a person&#x27;s risk related to smoking cessation.

*Breath carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring: carbon monoxide is a significant component of cigarette smoke, and a breath carbon monoxide monitor can be used to detect current cigarette use. Carbon monoxide concentration in breath is directly correlated with the CO concentration in blood, known as percent carboxyhemoglobin. The value of demonstrating blood CO concentration to a smoker through a non-invasive breath sample is that it links the smoking habit with the physiological harm associated with smoking. CO concentrations show a noticeable decrease within hours of quitting, which can encourage someone to work on quitting. Breath CO monitoring has been utilized in smoking cessation as a tool to provide patients with biomarker feedback, similar to how other diagnostic tools such as the stethoscope, the blood pressure cuff, and the cholesterol test have been used by treatment professionals in medicine.
*Cotinine: Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, is present in smokers. Like carbon monoxide, a cotinine test can be a reliable biomarker to determine smoking status. Cotinine levels can be tested through urine, saliva, blood, or hair samples. One of the main concerns of cotinine testing is the invasiveness of typical sampling methods.

While both measures offer high sensitivity and specificity, they differ in usage method and cost. For example, breath CO monitoring is non-invasive, while cotinine testing relies on bodily fluid. For instance, these two methods can be used alone or together when abstinence verification needs additional confirmation.

====Competitions and incentives====
Financial or material incentives to entice people to quit smoking improve smoking cessation while the motivation is in place. Competitions that require participants to deposit their own money, &quot;betting&quot; that they will succeed in quitting smoking, appear to be an effective incentive. However, it is more difficult to recruit participants for this type of contest in head-to-head comparisons with other incentive models, such as giving participants NRT or placing them in a more typical rewards program. Evidence also shows that incentive programs are effective for pregnant mothers who smoke both during pregnancy and post-partum. As of 2019, there is an insufficient number of studies on &quot;quit and win,&quot; and other competition-based interventions and results from the existing studies were inconclusive.

===== Workplace incentives =====
A 2008 Cochrane review of smoking cessation activities in work-places concluded that &quot;interventions directed towards individual smokers increase the likelihood of quitting smoking&quot;. A 2010 systematic review determined that worksite incentives and competitions needed to be combined with additional interventions to produce significant increases in smoking cessation rates.

===Healthcare systems===
Interventions delivered via healthcare providers and healthcare systems have been shown to improve smoking cessation among people who visit those services.
*A clinic screening system (e.g., computer prompts) to identify whether or not a person smokes doubled abstinence rates, from 3.1% to 6.4%. Similarly, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services determined that provider reminders alone or with provider education effectively promote smoking cessation.
*A 2008 Guideline meta-analysis estimated that physician advice to quit smoking led to a quit rate of 10.2%, as opposed to a quit rate of 7.9% among patients who did not receive physician advice to quit smoking. Even brief advice from physicians may have &quot;a small effect on cessation rates&quot;, and there is evidence that the physicians&#x27; probability of giving smoking cessation advice declines with the person who smokes age. There is evidence that only 81% of smokers age 50 or greater received advice on quitting from their physicians in the preceding year.
*For one-to-one or person-to-person counselling sessions, the duration of each session, the total contact time, and the number of sessions all correlated with the effectiveness of smoking cessation. For example, &quot;Higher intensity&quot; interventions (&gt;10 minutes) produced a quit rate of 22.1% as opposed to 10.9% for &quot;no contact&quot; over 300 minutes of contact time made a quit rate of 25.5% as opposed to 11.0% for &quot;no minutes&quot; and more than 8 sessions produced a quit rate of 24.7% as opposed to 12.4% for 0–1 sessions.
*Both physicians and non-physicians increased abstinence rates compared with self-help or no clinicians. For example, a Cochrane review of 58 studies found that nursing interventions increased the likelihood of quitting. Another review found some positive effects when trained community pharmacists support patients in their smoking cessation trials.
*Dental professionals also provide a key component in increasing tobacco abstinence rates in the community through counseling patients on the effects of tobacco on oral health in conjunction with an oral exam.
*According to the 2008 Guideline, based on two studies the training of clinicians in smoking cessation methods may increase abstinence rates; however, a Cochrane review found and measured that such training decreased smoking in patients.
*Reducing or eliminating the costs of cessation therapies for smokers increased quit rates in three meta-analyses.
*In one systematic review and meta-analysis, multi-component interventions increased quit rates in primary care settings. &quot;Multi-component&quot; interventions were defined as those that combined two or more of the following strategies known as the &quot;5 A&#x27;s&quot;:
**Ask — Systematically identify all tobacco users at every visit
**Advise — Strongly urge all tobacco users to quit
**Assess — Determine willingness to make a quit attempt
**Assist — Aid the patient in quitting (provide counselling-style support and medication)
**Arrange — Ensure follow-up contact

===Substitutes for cigarettes===
*Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the general term for using products that contain nicotine but not tobacco to aid smoking cessation. These include nicotine lozenges, nicotine gum and inhalers, nicotine patches, and electronic cigarettes. In a review of 136 NRT-related Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group studies, substantial evidence supported NRT use in increasing the chances of successfully quitting smoking by 50 to 60% in comparison to placebo or a non-NRT control group.
*Electronic cigarettes (ECs): There is high‐certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate‐certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Little is known regarding the long-term harms related to vaping. A 2016 UK Royal College of Physicians report supports using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. A 2015 Public Health England report stated that &quot;Smokers who have tried other methods of quitting without success could be encouraged to try e-cigarettes (EC) to stop smoking and stop smoking services should support smokers using EC to quit by offering them behavioural support.&quot; However, since little is known about long term effects, other regulated options such as nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline or bupropion should be discussed primarily.

===Alternative approaches===

It is important to note that most of the alternative approaches below have minimal evidence to support their use, and their efficacy and safety should be discussed with a healthcare professional before starting. 
*Acupuncture: Acupuncture has been explored as an adjunct treatment method for smoking cessation. A 2014 Cochrane review was unable to make conclusions regarding acupuncture as the evidence is poor. A 2008 guideline found no difference between acupuncture and placebo, found no scientific studies supporting laser therapy based on acupuncture principles but without the needles.
*Hypnosis: Hypnosis often involves the hypnotherapist suggesting the unpleasant outcomes of smoking to the patient. Clinical trials studying hypnosis and hypnotherapy as a method for smoking cessation have been inconclusive. A Cochrane review was unable to find evidence of benefit of hypnosis in smoking cessation, and suggested if there is a beneficial effect, it is small at best. However, a randomized trial published in 2008 found that hypnosis and nicotine patches &quot;compares favorably&quot; with standard behavioral counseling and nicotine patches in 12-month quit rates.
*Herbal medicine: Many herbs have been studied as a method for smoking cessation, including lobelia and St John&#x27;s wort. The results are inconclusive, but St. Johns Wort shows few adverse events, but is a contraindication to many medications. Lobelia has been used to treat respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis, and has been used for smoking cessation because of chemical similarities to tobacco; lobelia is now listed in the FDA&#x27;s Poisonous Plant Database. Lobelia can still be found in many products sold for smoking cessation and should be used with caution. Herbal products should be discussed with healthcare professionals before use to confirm safety with other medications.
*Smokeless tobacco: There is little smoking in Sweden, which is reflected in the very low cancer rates for Swedish men. Use of snus (a form of steam-pasteurized, rather than heat-pasteurized, air-cured smokeless tobacco) is an observed cessation method for Swedish men and even recommended by some Swedish doctors. However, the report by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) concludes &quot;STP (smokeless tobacco products) are addictive and their use is hazardous to health. Evidence on the effectiveness of STP as a smoking cessation aid is insufficient.&quot; A recent national study on the use of alternative tobacco products, including snus, did not show that these products promote cessation.
*Aversion therapy: It is a method of treatment works by pairing the pleasurable stimulus of smoking with other unpleasant stimuli. A Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient evidence of its efficacy.
*Nicotine vaccines: Nicotine vaccines (e.g., NicVAX and TA-NIC) work by reducing the amount of nicotine reaching the brain; however, this method of therapy needs more investigations to establish its role and determine its side effects.
*Technology and machine learning: Research studies using machine learning or artificial intelligence tools to provide feedback and communication with those who are trying to quit smoking are increasing, yet the findings are so far inconclusive.
*Psilocybin has been being investigated as a potential smoking cessation aid for several years. In 2021, Johns Hopkins Medicine has been awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health to explore the potential impacts of psilocybin and talk therapy on tobacco addiction.

== Special populations ==

===Children and adolescents===
Methods used with children and adolescents include:
*Motivational enhancement
*Psychological support
*Youth anti-tobacco activities, including participation in sports
*School-based curricula, like life-skills training
*School-based nurse counseling sessions
*Access reduction to tobacco
*Anti-tobacco media
*Family communication
Cochrane reviews, mainly of studies combining motivational enhancement and psychological support, concluded that &quot;complex approaches&quot; for smoking cessation among young people show promise. The 2008 US Guideline recommends counselling-style support for adolescent smokers on the basis of a meta-analysis of seven studies. Neither the Cochrane review nor the 2008 Guideline recommend medications for adolescents who smoke.

===Pregnant women===
Smoking during pregnancy can cause adverse health effects in both the woman and the fetus. The 2008 US Guideline determined that &quot;person-to-person psychosocial interventions&quot; (typically including &quot;intensive counseling&quot;) increased abstinence rates in pregnant women who smoke to 13.3%, compared with 7.6% in usual care. Mothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater tendency towards premature births. Their babies are often underdeveloped, have smaller organs, and weigh much less than the average baby weight. In addition, these babies have weaker immune systems, making them more susceptible to many diseases such as middle ear inflammations and asthmatic bronchitis, as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, all of which can bring significant morbidity. Additionally, a study published by American Academy of Pediatrics shows that smoking during pregnancy increases the chance of sudden unexpected infant death ((SUID) or (SIDS)). There is also an increased chance that the child will be a smoker in adulthood. A systematic review showed that psychosocial interventions help women quit smoking in late pregnancy and can reduce the incidence of low birth weight infants.

It is a myth that a female smoker can cause harm to a fetus by quitting immediately upon discovering she is pregnant. This idea is not based on any medical study or fact.

In a UK study that included 1140 pregnant women, e-cigarettes were found to be as effective as nicotine patches at helping pregnant women to quit smoking. The safety of the two products was also similar. However, life style modification are the preferred method for pregnant women, and they should discuss smoking cessation techniques with a healthcare professional.

===Schizophrenia===

Studies across 20 countries show a strong association between patients with schizophrenia and smoking. People with schizophrenia are much more likely to smoke than those without the disease. For example, in the United States, 80% or more of people with schizophrenia smoke, compared to 20% of the general population in 2006.

===Hospitalized smokers===

Smokers who are hospitalised may be particularly motivated to quit. A 2012 Cochrane review found that interventions beginning during a hospital stay and continuing for one month or more after discharge were effective in producing abstinence.

Patients undergoing elective surgery may get benefits of preoperative smoking cessation interventions, when starting 4–8 weeks before surgery with weekly counseling for behavioral support and use of nicotine replacement therapy. It is found to reduce the complications and the number of postoperative morbidity.

===Mood disorders===

People with mood disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders have a greater chance to begin smoking and a lower chance of quitting smoking. A higher correlation with smoking has also been seen in people diagnosed with the major depressive disorder at any time throughout their lifetime compared to those without it. Success rates in quitting smoking were lower for those with a major depressive disorder diagnosis versus people without the diagnosis. Exposure to cigarette smoke early on in life, during pregnancy, infancy, or adolescence, may negatively impact a child&#x27;s neurodevelopment and increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders in the future.

===Homeless and poverty===
Homelessness doubles the likelihood of an individual currently being a smoker. Homelessness is independent of other socioeconomic factors and behavioral health conditions. Homeless individuals have the same rates of desire to quit smoking. Still, they are less likely than the general population to attempt to stop successfully.

In the United States, 60–80% of homeless adults are smokers. This is a considerably higher rate than the general adult population of 19%. Many current smokers who are homeless report smoking as a means of coping with &quot;all the pressure of being homeless.&quot; The perception that homeless people smoking being &quot;socially acceptable&quot; can reinforce these trends.

Americans under the poverty line have higher rates of smoking and lower rates of quitting than those over the poverty line. While the homeless population is concerned about short-term effects of smoking, such as shortness of breath or recurrent bronchitis, they are not as concerned with long-term consequences. The homeless population has unique barriers to quitting smoking, such as unstructured days, the stress of finding a job, and immediate survival needs that supersede the desire to quit smoking.

These unique barriers can be combated through pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling for high levels of nicotine dependence. The emphasis of immediate financial benefits to those who concern themselves with the short-term over the long-term, partnering with shelters to reduce the social acceptability of smoking in this population, and increased taxes on cigarettes and alternative tobacco products to further make the addiction more difficult to fund.

=== Concurrent substance use disorders ===
Over three-quarters of people in treatment or recovery from substance misuse issues are current smokers. Providing behavioural interventions (such as counseling and advice) and pharmacotherapy including nicotine replacement therapy (such as the use of patches or gum, varenicline, and/or bupropion) increase tobacco abstinence that is sustainable and also reduces the risk of returning to other substance use.

==Comparison of success rates==
Comparison of success rates across interventions can be difficult because of different definitions of &quot;success&quot; used by the different studies. Robert West and Saul Shiffman, authorities in this field recognized by government health departments in a number of countries, have concluded that, used together, &quot;behavioral support&quot; and &quot;medication&quot; can quadruple the chances that a quit attempt will be successful.

A 2008 systematic review in the &quot;European Journal of Cancer Prevention&quot; found that group behavioural therapy was the most effective intervention strategy for smoking cessation, followed by bupropion, intensive physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual counselling, telephone counselling, nursing interventions, and tailored self-help interventions; the study did not discuss varenicline.

==Factors affecting success==
There is an important social component to smoking. The spread of smoking cessation from person to person contributes to the decrease in smoking among different populations or groups. A 2008 study of a densely interconnected network of over 12,000 individuals found that smoking cessation by any given individual reduced the chances of others around them lighting up by the following amounts: a spouse by 67%, a sibling by 25%, a friend by 36%, and a coworker by 34%. Nevertheless, a Cochrane review determined that interventions to increase social support for a smoker&#x27;s cessation attempt did not improve long-term quit rates.

Smokers trying to quit are faced with social influences that may persuade them to conform and continue smoking. Cravings are easier to detain when one&#x27;s environment does not provoke the habit. Suppose a person who stopped smoking has close relationships with active smokers. In that case, they are often put into situations that make the urge to conform more tempting. However, in a small group with at least one other not smoking, the likelihood of conformity decreases. The social influence of smoking cigarettes has been proven to rely on simple variables. One researched variable depends on whether there is influence from a friend or non-friend. The research shows that individuals are 77% more likely to conform to non-friends, while close friendships decrease conformity. Therefore, if an acquaintance offers a cigarette as a polite gesture, the person who has stopped smoking will be likelier to break his commitment than if a friend had suggested it. Recent research from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey of over 6,000 smokers found that smokers with fewer smoking friends were more likely to intend to quit and to succeed in their quit attempt.

Expectations and attitude are significant factors. A self-perpetuating cycle occurs when a person feels bad for smoking yet smokes to alleviate feeling bad. Breaking that cycle can be a key in changing the sabotaging attitude.

Smokers with major depressive disorder may be less successful at quitting smoking than non-depressed smokers.

Relapse (resuming smoking after quitting) has been related to psychological issues such as low self-efficacy, or non-optimal coping responses; however, psychological approaches to prevent relapse have not been proven to be successful. In contrast, varenicline is suggested to have some effects and nicotine replacement therapy may help the unassisted abstainers.

Although some studies have suggested that increased melanin levels are associated with reduced levels of quitting smoking, other studies have not found this result and overall the literature is inconclusive on the topic. Suggestions that this may be due to a biological cause (melanin levels having an effect on nicotine metabolism) have been questioned, and it has suggested that if an effect is present it may be more attributable to social discrimination as a result of colorism, with further research needed to rule out sociological factors.

==Side effects==
=== Withdrawal symptoms ===
The CDC recognizes seven common nicotine withdrawal symptoms that people often face when stopping smoking: &quot;cravings to smoke, feeling irritated, grouchy, or upset, feeling jumpy and restless, having a hard time concentrating, having trouble sleeping, feeling hungry or gaining weight, or feeling anxious, sad or depressed.&quot; Studies have shown that the use of pharmacotherapies, such as varenicline can be useful in reducing withdrawal symptoms during the quitting process.

===Weight gain===
Giving up smoking is associated with an average weight gain of after 12 months, most of which occurs within the first three months of quitting.

The possible causes of the weight gain include:
*Smoking over-expresses the gene AZGP1 which stimulates lipolysis, so smoking cessation may decrease lipolysis.
*Smoking suppresses appetite, which may be caused by nicotine&#x27;s effect on central autonomic neurons (e.g., via regulation of melanin concentrating hormone neurons in the hypothalamus). Smoking cessation will increase the persons appetite once again, especially as taste buds can return to its normal function. 
*Heavy smokers are reported to burn 200 calories per day more than non-smokers eating the same diet. Possible reasons for this phenomenon include nicotine&#x27;s ability to increase energy metabolism or nicotine&#x27;s effect on peripheral neurons.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guideline suggests that sustained-release bupropion, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge be used &quot;to delay weight gain after quitting.&quot; There is not currently enough evidence to suggest one method of weight loss works better than others in preventing weight gain during the smoking cessation process. It is helpful to reach for healthy snacks, such as celery and carrots, to aid in the increased appetite while also helping to limit weight gain. Regardless of post-cessation weight gain, there is a significant decrease in risk of cardiovascular disease in those who have quit smoking. The risks of rebound weight gain is significantly less than the risks of continued smoking.

===Mental health===
Like other physically addictive drugs, nicotine addiction causes a down-regulation of the production of dopamine and other stimulatory neurotransmitters as the brain attempts to compensate for the artificial stimulation caused by smoking. Some studies from the 1990s found that when people stop smoking, depressive symptoms such as suicidal tendencies or actual depression may result, although a recent international study comparing smokers who had stopped for 3 months with continuing smokers found that stopping smoking did not appear to increase anxiety or depression. A 2021 review found that quitting smoking lessens anxiety and depression.

A 2013 study by &quot;The British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; has found that smokers who successfully quit feel less anxious afterward, with the effect being greater among those who had mood and anxiety disorders than those who smoked for pleasure.

==Health benefits==

Many of tobacco&#x27;s detrimental health effects can be reduced or largely removed through smoking cessation. The health benefits over time of stopping smoking include:

* Within 20 minutes after quitting, blood pressure and heart rate decrease
* Within a few days, carbon monoxide levels in the blood decrease to normal
* Within 48 hours, nerve endings and sense of smell and taste both start recovering
* Within 3 months, circulation and lung function improve
* Within 1 year, there are decreases in cough and shortness of breath
* Within 1–2 years, the risk of coronary heart disease is cut in half
* Within 5–10 years, the risk of stroke falls to the same as a non-smoker, and the risks of many cancers (mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix) decrease significantly
* Within 10 years, the risk of dying from lung cancer is cut in half, and the risks of larynx and pancreas cancers decrease
* Within 15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease drops to the level of a non-smoker; lowered risk for developing COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

The British Doctors Study showed that those who stopped smoking before they reached 30 years old lived almost as long as those who never smoked. Stopping in one&#x27;s sixties can still add three years of healthy life. Randomized U.S. and Canadian trials showed that a ten-week smoking cessation program decreased mortality from all causes over 14 years later. A recent article on mortality in a cohort of 8,645 smokers who were followed up after 43 years determined that &quot;current smoking and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD [cardiovascular disease], COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], and any cancer, and lung cancer mortality.&quot;

The significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality that is present in people who smoke is decreased with long-term smoking cessation. Smoking cessation can improve health status and quality of life at any age. Evidence shows that cessation of smoking reduces risk of lung, laryngeal, oral cavity and pharynx, esophageal, pancreatic, bladder, stomach, colorectal, cervical, and kidney cancer, in addition to reducing the risk of acute myeloid leukemia.

Another published study, &quot;Smoking Cessation Reduces Postoperative Complications: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,&quot; examined six randomized trials and 15 observational studies to examine preoperative smoking cessation&#x27;s effects on postoperative complications. The findings were: 1) taken together, the studies demonstrated a decreased likelihood of postoperative complications in patients who ceased smoking before surgery; 2) overall, each week of cessation before surgery increased the magnitude of the effect by 19%. A significant positive effect was noted in trials where smoking cessation occurred at least four weeks before surgery; 3) For the six randomized trials, they demonstrated, on average, a relative risk reduction of 41% for postoperative complications.

==Cost-effectiveness==

Cost-effectiveness analyses of smoking cessation activities have shown that they increase quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at costs comparable with other types of interventions to treat and prevent disease. Studies of the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation include:
*In a 1997 U.S. analysis, the estimated cost per QALY varied by the type of cessation approach, ranging from group intensive counselling without nicotine replacement at $1108 per QALY to minimal counselling with nicotine gum at $4542 per QALY.
*A study from Erasmus University Rotterdam limited to people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found that the cost-effectiveness of minimal counselling, intensive counselling, and drug therapy were €16,900, €8,200, and €2,400 per QALY gained respectively.
*Among National Health Service smoking cessation clients in Glasgow, pharmacy one-to-one counselling cost £2,600 per QALY gained and group support cost £4,800 per QALY gained.

==Statistical trends==
The frequency of smoking cessation among smokers varies across countries. Smoking cessation increased in Spain between 1965 and 2000, in Scotland between 1998 and 2007, and in Italy after 2000. In contrast, in the U.S. the cessation rate was &quot;stable (or varied little)&quot; between 1998 and 2008, and in China smoking cessation rates declined between 1998 and 2003.

Nevertheless, in a growing number of countries there are now more ex-smokers than smokers. In the United States, 61.7% of adult smokers (55.0 million adults) who had ever smoked had quit by 2018, an increase from 51.7% in 2009. As of 2020, the CDC reports that the number of adults who smoke in the U.S. has fallen to 30.8 million.

<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Melancton Metcalfe (born April 7, 1946) is an American engineer and entrepreneur who contributed to the development of the internet in the 1970s. He co-invented Ethernet, co-founded 3Com, and formulated Metcalfe&#x27;s law, which describes the effect of a telecommunications network. Metcalfe has also made several predictions which failed to come to pass, including forecasting the demise of the internet during the 1990s.

Metcalfe has received various awards, including the IEEE Medal of Honor and National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his work developing Ethernet technology. In 2023, he received the Turing Award, the highest distinction in computer science. From 2011 to 2021, he was professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin.

== Early life and family ==
Robert Metcalfe was born in 1946 in New York, New York, to Ruth and Robert Metcalfe. He is of English, Irish, and Norwegian descent. His father was a test technician who specialized in gyroscopes. His mother was a homemaker who later became a secretary at Bay Shore High School. Metcalfe graduated from that school in 1964.

Metcalfe graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, receiving two Bachelor of Science degrees in electrical engineering and industrial management. He then attended Harvard University and received a Master of Science in applied mathematics in 1970 and a PhD in computer science in 1973.

Metcalfe and his wife Robyn have two children. 

== Career ==
While pursuing his doctorate in computer science, Metcalfe took a job with MIT&#x27;s Project MAC after Harvard refused permission for him to connect the university to the then-new ARPAnet. At MAC, Metcalfe was responsible for building some of the hardware that would link MIT&#x27;s minicomputers with ARPAnet. Metcalfe made ARPAnet the topic of his doctoral thesis, but Harvard initially rejected it. Metcalfe decided how to improve his thesis while working at Xerox PARC, where he read a paper about the ALOHA network at the University of Hawaii. He identified and fixed some of the bugs in the AlohaNet model, then added that work to his revised thesis. It was then accepted by Harvard, which granted his PhD.

Metcalfe was working at PARC in 1973 when he and David Boggs invented Ethernet, initially as a standard for connecting computers over short distances. He later recalled that Ethernet was born on May 22, 1973, the day he circulated a memo titled &quot;Alto Ethernet&quot; which contained a rough schematic of how it would work. &quot;That is the first time Ethernet appears as a word, as does the idea of using coax as ether, where the participating stations, like in AlohaNet or ARPAnet, would inject their packets of data, they&#x27;d travel around at megabits per second, there would be collisions, and retransmissions, and back-off,&quot; Metcalfe explained. Boggs argued that another date was the birth of Ethernet: November 11, 1973, the first day the system actually functioned.

In 1979, Metcalfe departed PARC and co-founded 3Com, a manufacturer of computer networking equipment, in his Palo Alto apartment. 3Com became a leading provider of networking solutions, and Ethernet became the dominant networking standard for local area networks (LANs). In 1980 he received the ACM Grace Hopper Award for his contributions to the development of local networks, specifically Ethernet. In 1990, the 3Com board of directors appointed Éric Benhamou as CEO instead of Metcalfe, who then left the company. He spent 10 years as a publisher and pundit, writing an internet column for InfoWorld. In 1996, he co-founded Pop!Tech, an executive technology conference. He became a venture capitalist in 2001 and subsequently a general partner at Polaris Venture Partners.

From 2011 to 2021, he was a professor at The University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Cockrell School of Engineering, specializing in innovation initiatives. Metcalfe was a keynote speaker at the 2016 Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders and, in 2019, he presented the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture in South Africa. In June 2022, Metcalfe returned to MIT by joining the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory as a research affiliate and computational engineer, working with the MIT Julia Lab.

== Awards ==
In 1996, Metcalfe was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor for &quot;exemplary and sustained leadership in the development, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.&quot; The following year, he was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for the development of Ethernet. He received the National Medal of Technology in 2003 &quot;for leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet&quot;. In October 2003, he received the Marconi Award for &quot;For inventing the Ethernet and promulgating his Law of network utility based on the square of the nodes&quot;.

Metcalfe was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2007, for his work with Ethernet technology. In 2008, he received the Fellow Award from the Computer History Museum &quot;for fundamental contributions to the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet.&quot;

In March 2023, Metcalfe was awarded the 2022 Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s Turing Award for his contributions to the invention of Ethernet technology.

== Predicted Internet collapse ==
In 1995, Metcalfe argued that the Internet would suffer a &quot;catastrophic collapse&quot; in the following year; he promised to eat his words if it did not. During his keynote speech at the sixth International World Wide Web Conference in 1997, he took a printed copy of his column that predicted the collapse, put it in a blender with some liquid and then consumed the pulpy mass. He had suggested having his words printed on a very large cake, but the audience would not accept this form of &quot;eating his words.&quot;

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Arthur Whitten Brown, (23 July 1886 – 4 October 1948) was a British military officer and aviator who flew as navigator of the first successful non-stop transatlantic flight with pilot John Alcock in June 1919.

==Biography==
Arthur Whitten Brown was born in Glasgow to American parents; his father had been sent to Scotland to evaluate the feasibility of siting a Westinghouse factory on Clydeside. His father, Arthur George, was an electrical engineer, After his birth, the family moved to Chorlton, and lived at &#x27;Ellerslie&#x27;, 6 Oswald Rd.

The factory was eventually sited in Trafford Park in Stretford, Manchester, and the family subsequently relocated there.

Both of the Atlantic pilots attended the Central High School for Boys, mostly known as Manchester Central High School. Alcock left at 16.

Brown began his career in engineering before the outbreak of World War I and undertook an apprenticeship with British Westinghouse in Manchester. In 1914, he enlisted in the ranks of the University and Public Schools Brigade (UPS) for which he had to take out British citizenship. The ranks of the UPS were full of potential officers and Brown was one of those who sought a commission to become a Second Lieutenant in the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion of the Manchester Regiment. After service in France, Brown was seconded to 2 Squadron Royal Flying Corps as an observer.

Brown&#x27;s aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Vendin-le-Vieil in France while on artillery observation duties. He was sent back to England to recuperate but returned only to be shot down again, this time with a punctured fuel tank, near Bapaume in B.E.2c (number &quot;2673&quot;) on a reconnaissance flight on 10 November 1915. Brown and his pilot, 2nd Lt. H. W. Medlicott, were captured by the Germans. (In June 1918 Medlicott was shot by the Germans while attempting to escape for the fourteenth time). Later interned in Switzerland, Brown was repatriated in September 1917.

After a period of leave he went to work with Major Kennedy RAF in the Ministry of Munitions. This led Brown to meet Kennedy&#x27;s daughters, one of whom he later married. He married (Marguerite) Kathleen Kennedy, the daughter of Major David Henry Kennedy of &#x27;Norbiggen&#x27; of 26 Oakley Avenue in Ealing on Tuesday 29 July 1919 at the Savoy Chapel, by Rev Hugh Chapman, with the reception at the nearby hotel. Major Kennedy flew with the RFC, and was born at 306 Bensham Rd on 20 August 1869, and died in November 1940.

His wife was born in Gateshead on 6 April 1896, and died on 1 May 1952 in Swansea, and was buried at Tylers Green. Her parents had moved to Sweetthorpe Cottage at Penn, Buckinghamshire in 1919.

After the war Brown sought various appointments that would give him the security to allow him to marry. One of the firms he approached was Vickers, a consequence of which was that he was asked if he would be the navigator for the proposed transatlantic flight, partnering John Alcock, who had already been chosen as pilot.

==Transatlantic flight==
The flight from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, to Clifden, Connemara, Ireland, took place on 14 June 1919. They departed St John&#x27;s at 1.45 pm local time, and landed in Derrygimla bog 16 hours and 12 minutes later after flying 1,980 miles (3,168 km). The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber, and won a £10,000 prize offered by London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. A few days after the flight both Brown and Alcock were honoured with a reception at Windsor Castle during which King George V invested them with their insignia as Knights Commanders of the Order of the British Empire.

==Post flight career==

Later he worked for Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick), the company that had once been British Westinghouse. In 1923 he was appointed chief representative for Metropolitan-Vickers in the Swansea area.

During World War II Brown served in the Home Guard as a Lieutenant-Colonel before resigning his commission in July 1941, rejoining the RAF and working in RAF Training Command as a pilot officer dealing with navigation. His health deteriorated and by mid-1943 he had to resign from the RAFVR and give up his Air Training Corps commitments on medical advice.

Brown&#x27;s only son, Arthur (known as Buster), was killed on the night of 5/6 June 1944, aged 22, while serving with the RAF as a Flight Lieutenant. His aircraft, a de Havilland Mosquito VI &quot;NT122&quot;, of 605 Squadron, crashed in the Netherlands. Buster was buried at the general cemetery in Hoorn, the town closest to the crash. The death of his only son affected Brown badly.

By 1948 Brown&#x27;s health had again deteriorated, although he was allowed to undertake restricted duties as general manager for Metropolitan-Vickers at the Wind Street offices.

Brown died in his sleep on 4 October 1948 from an accidental overdose of Veronal, a sleeping pill, aged 62.

Brown and his wife&#x27;s ashes are interred at St Margaret Churchyard, Tylers Green, Buckinghamshire, England.

<text>Ivar Kreuger (; 2 March 1880 – 12 March 1932) was a Swedish civil engineer, financier, entrepreneur and industrialist. In 1908, he co-founded the construction company Kreuger &amp; Toll Byggnads AB, which specialized in new building techniques. By aggressive investments and innovative financial instruments, he built a global match and financial empire. Between the two world wars, he negotiated match monopolies with European, Central American and South American governments, and finally controlled between two thirds and three quarters of worldwide match production, becoming known as the &quot;Match King&quot;.

Kreuger&#x27;s financial empire has been described by one biographer as a Ponzi scheme, based on the supposedly fantastic profitability of his match monopolies. However, in a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid dividends from their own money or that of subsequent investors. Although Kreuger did this to some extent, he also controlled many legitimate and often very profitable businesses. He owned banks, real estate, a gold mine, and pulp industrial companies. He also owned many match companies. Many of them have survived to this day. Kreuger &amp; Toll, for example, was composed of bona fide businesses, and there were others like it. Another biographer called Kreuger a &quot;genius and swindler&quot;, and John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that he was the &quot;Leonardo of larcenists&quot;. Kreuger&#x27;s financial empire collapsed during the Great Depression. The Price Waterhouse autopsy of his financial empire stated: &quot;The manipulations were so childish that anyone with but a rudimentary knowledge of bookkeeping could see the books were falsified.&quot; In March 1932, he was found dead in the bedroom of his flat in Paris. The police concluded that he had committed suicide, but decades later, his brother Torsten claimed that he had been murdered, which spawned some controversial literature on the subject.

== Early life ==

Kreuger was born in Kalmar, the eldest son of Ernst August Kreuger, an industrialist in the match industry in that city, and his wife Jenny Emelie Kreuger (&quot;née&quot; Forssman). He had five siblings.

At school, Ivar skipped ahead two classes by taking private lessons. At age 16, he began studies at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, from which he graduated with combined master&#x27;s degrees covering both the faculties of mechanical and civil engineering, at the age of 20.

== Personal life ==


Ivar Kreuger never married, but lived for many years in different periods with Ingeborg Eberth ( Hässler), a physical therapist from Stockholm, who first met him there in 1913. According to the book she wrote after Kreuger&#x27;s death in 1932, he was not interested in marriage or children and was very much focused on his business. She broke off their relationship in 1917 and moved to Denmark, where she married a Danish engineer named Eberth. They had a daughter in 1919, Grete Eberth (later to be an actress in Stockholm, married name Mac Laury). After some years she divorced Eberth and moved back to Stockholm with her daughter, reuniting with Kreuger. Mr. Eberth once kidnapped the daughter in Stockholm and brought her back to Denmark. Shortly thereafter Ingeborg, without notifying the authorities or police, went down to Denmark and brought the daughter back to Sweden by hiring a private fishing boat in Denmark that took them over Öresund to Sweden. The new period with Kreuger lasted until around 1928; after that they just met occasionally. The last time they met was in November 1931, just before Kreuger started on his final trip to America. Eberth received the news about his death in Paris on 12 March 1932, from newspaper headlines the day after.
Kreuger had private apartments in Stockholm, New York, Paris, and Warsaw, and a country place used during the summer season on the private island Ängsholmen in the archipelago of Stockholm. On business tours in Europe, he preferred to meet his business associates in Paris and then stayed in his flat at 5, Av. Victor Emanuel III (today named ). He owned several specially designed motor yachts, among them &quot;Elsa&quot; built in 1906, &quot;Loris&quot; (1913), &quot;Tärnan&quot; (1925), and the most famous, &quot;Svalan&quot; (&quot;Swallow&quot;), built at Lidingö in 1928, a 37 ft, 4.9 ton motor yacht, equipped with a V12, 31.9 liter Hispano-Suiza engine from the US company Wright, with 650 HP output, capable of more than 50 knots (≈ 57 mph). A replica of the boat has been built.

He had a large private library in both his apartments in Stockholm and New York and quite a large art collection. The paintings were sold at different auctions held in September 1932, as all of Kreuger&#x27;s private assets were incorporated into the bankruptcy. The collection in Stockholm comprised 88 original paintings, among them 19 by Anders Zorn and a great number of Dutch masters. The New York collection included paintings by Rembrandt and Anthony van Dyck.

Kreuger became the major shareholder when the Swedish film company AB Svensk Filmindustri (SF) was founded in 1919 and because of that, sometimes met celebrities from the film industry. In June 1924, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were invited by SF to Stockholm and were guided around the Stockholm archipelago in Kreuger&#x27;s motor yacht &quot;Loris&quot;. A five-minute film sequence of this occasion is stored in SF&#x27;s film archive. Pickford, Fairbanks, Kreuger, Charles Magnusson (the manager for SF), Greta Garbo and various SF employees appear in the film.

== Early years in the United States ==
After the start of the 20th century, Kreuger spent seven years traveling and working abroad as an engineer in the US, Mexico, South Africa and other countries, but spent most of the time in the US. In South Africa, he ran a restaurant for a short time together with his friend Anders Jordahl, but they soon sold the restaurant. At an early stage, he came in contact with the patented 
Kahn System for concrete-steel constructions that was exploited by Julius Kahn&#x27;s Trussed Concrete Steel Company, when working for different engineering companies, among them The Consolidated Engineering &amp; Construction Co. and Purdy &amp; Henderson in New York. This new technique had not been introduced in Sweden at that time. In 1907, he managed to get the representative rights for the system for both the Swedish and the German markets, and at the end of 1907, he returned to Sweden with the goal of introducing the new methods in both countries at the same time. At that time, one of the experts in Sweden in concrete-steel constructions was his cousin Henrik Kreüger working at KTH in Stockholm.

== The building contractor and his innovations ==
In May 1908, Kreuger formed the construction firm Kreuger &amp; Toll in Sweden with the engineer Paul Toll, at that time working for the construction company Kasper Höglund AB, and his cousin Henrik Kreüger, working at the faculty of civil engineering at KTH, as a consulting engineer for the company. In Germany, he formed the company Deutsche Kahneisengesellschaft together with a colleague from his time in America, Anders Jordahl.

The concrete-steel construction method of constructing buildings was not fully accepted in Sweden at that time and in order to market the new technique, Kreuger held several lectures and wrote an illustrated article on the subject in a leading engineering magazine, &quot;Teknisk Tidskrift&quot;. The new technology was a success and the firm won several prestigious contracts, such as the construction of the Stockholm Olympic Stadium (1911–12); the foundation work for the new Stockholm City Hall (1912–13) and the department store NK (1913–14) in Stockholm. The chief engineer behind these advanced projects was Henrik Kreüger.

Innovation in the construction business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients. Kreuger &amp; Toll was the first firm in Europe to commit to finish projects by a fixed date, thus shifting the risk to the builder, who after all was in the best position to reduce delays. When Kreuger won the contract to build a six-story &quot;skyscraper&quot;, he promised that if construction wasn&#x27;t finished by a particular date Kreuger &amp; Toll would give the client a partial refund of $1,200 (about $18,000 in today&#x27;s currency) for each late day. It is noteworthy that Kreuger &amp; Toll&#x27;s entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger &amp; Toll finished early and subsequently earned completion bonuses for every project. Within a few years, Kreuger &amp; Toll was seen as the best building company in Sweden and one of the top firms in all of Europe.

Within six years after its incorporation, Kreuger &amp; Toll earned annual profits of around $200,000 and was paying a substantial dividend of 15%. In 1917, the company was split into two separate companies: Kreuger &amp; Toll Construction AB, with the majority of shares owned by Paul Toll, and Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding. Ivar Kreuger was not among the board members in the construction company. How much of Paul Toll&#x27;s company Ivar Kreuger owned has not been revealed—just that Paul Toll owned 60% in 1917 and, around 1930, 66% of the construction company. Kreuger &amp; Toll Construction Co. has never shown up in any Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding organisation charts.

Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding became his financial holding company, with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager and major share holder. He controlled it with a tight grip. The board of directors consisted of Ivar, his father, Paul Toll and two very close colleagues.

After Ivar got involved in his father&#x27;s match factories in Kalmar, he became more focused on &quot;constructing&quot; new companies or taking control of other corporations – usually paying with his own securities instead of cash – rather than buildings and bridges. Thus, by 1927, Ivar had bought banks, mining companies, railways, timber and paper firms, film distributors, real estate in several European cities as well as a controlling stake in L.M. Ericsson &amp; Co., Sweden&#x27;s leading phone company. He controlled about 50% of the world market in iron ore and cellulose. He owned mines all over the world including the Boliden mine in Sweden, which had one of the richest gold deposits outside South Africa in addition to other minerals.

Kreuger formed Swedish Match by merging his father&#x27;s business with other match factories he had quietly bought during World War I. Its initial capital was around $10 million ($ in dollars) and Ivar owned about half of it, held all senior positions and controlled the board of directors.

The Swedish banker Oscar Rydbeck became a close associate and an important teacher for Ivar in the financing business. He worked for Kreuger &amp; Toll as a consultant from around 1912 until the Kreuger Crash in 1932 and was a member of its board of directors. For not having carried out his duties as a director he went to jail for 10 months after Ivar&#x27;s death.

== Match business ==

In 1911 and 1912, the Kreuger family match factories in Kalmar, Fredriksdal and Mönsterås, run by his father Ernst Kreuger, uncle Fredrik Kreuger and his brother Torsten Kreuger, encountered financial problems. Kreuger was then advised by his banker Oscar Rydbeck to turn the factories into a stock corporation in order to raise more capital. This was the starting point for the reformation of the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. The goal was to get control of the entire match industry in Scandinavia.

With the family match factories as the base, Kreuger first founded the Swedish corporation &quot;AB Kalmar-Mönsterås Tändsticksfabrik&quot; in 1912. His father, Ernst, and uncle Fredrik, became the major shareholders and his brother Torsten was appointed the general manager. Ivar became a member of the board.

A merger between this company with several other small match companies in Sweden, the company &quot;AB Svenska Förenade Tändsticksfabriker&quot; was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, &quot;AB Jönköping-Vulcan&quot;, Svenska Tändsticks AB (Swedish Match) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince &quot;AB Jönköping-Vulcan&quot; to merge in December 1912, but they had not been interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he could find in and around Sweden and then finally got &quot;AB Jönköping-Vulcan&quot; to accept the merger. He had been so persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed to overvalue his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.

One of the main designers behind this operation, besides Ivar, was his banker Rydbeck. The total number of shares in the new company was 450,000. Ivar Kreuger personally owned 223,000 shares and his new holding company, Kreuger &amp; Toll Holding AB, 60,000.

This company group now covered the entire match industry in Sweden, including all the major companies that manufactured the production machines used in the factories. The total number of employees working in match production in Sweden in 1917 was around 9000. It also had control over major companies supplying the raw material for the match industry. During this time Kreuger also acquired the largest match manufacturing companies in Norway (Bryn and Halden) and in Finland (Wiborgs and Kekkola).

However, Kreuger not only &quot;acquired&quot; companies but also introduced a new way of thinking in the Swedish match industry with large scale production facilities as well as ideas to increase efficiency in production, administration, distribution, and marketing.

He managed to unite the Swedish match industry as well as the major match companies in Norway and Finland. With this new company structure the match industry in Scandinavia became a major competitor to large manufacturers elsewhere. Ivar&#x27;s methods resembled those John D. Rockefeller used in the formation of the Standard Oil Trust transforming dozens of struggling factories into a strong and profitable monopoly. The methods had become illegal in the USA because of anti-trust laws, but were not against the law in Sweden at the time.

A German chemist had invented phosphorus matches in 1832 but they were dangerous because the yellow phosphorus used was poisonous and because it was in the match head and thus could easily light by accident. The Swedes improved on the design by using a safer red phosphorus, which they put on the striking surface of the matchbox. They called them &quot;safety matches&quot;. They made Sweden the leading exporter of matches and made matches the most important Swedish export.

It should be remembered that in the early part of the 20th century matches were a necessity for smoking and the lighting of stoves and gas appliances among other uses, and therefore demand for them was highly inelastic, meaning that a monopolist could raise prices (and hence profits) significantly without much affecting the quantity sold.

By expanding the Swedish Match company through acquisition of government-created monopolies, the Swedish company became the world&#x27;s largest match manufacturer. Kreuger set up an affiliate to Kreuger &amp; Toll AB in the United States, and together with Lee, Higginson &amp; Co. in New York, formed the International Match Corporation. This group eventually came to control almost 75% of the world production in matches.

== Other business ==
From 1925 to 1930, years when many countries in Europe were suffering after the First World War, Kreuger&#x27;s companies gave loans to governments to speed up reconstruction. As a security, the governments would grant him the match monopoly in their country. This means that Kreuger gained a monopoly in match production, sales, or distribution, or a complete monopoly. The monopoly agreements differed from country to country. The capital was raised to a large extent through loans from Swedish and American banks, combined with issuing a large amount of participating debentures. Kreuger also often moved money from one corporation he controlled to another.

Kreuger did not limit himself to matches, but gained control of most of the forestry industry in northern Sweden and planned to become head of a cellulose cartel. He also attempted to create a telephone monopoly in Sweden.

After founding the pulp manufacturer SCA, in 1929 Kreuger was able to acquire the majority shares in the telephone company Ericsson; the mining company Boliden (gold); major interests in the ball bearing manufacturer SKF; the bank Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget and others.

Abroad he acquired Deutsche Unionsbank in Germany and Union de Banques à Paris in France, often with the acquired company&#x27;s own money. These maneuvers were made both necessary and possible by his invention, decades ahead of his time, of Enron-style financial engineering, which reported profits when there were none and paid out ever increasing dividends by attracting new investment and/or looting the treasury of a newly acquired company.

By 1931, Kreuger controlled some 200 companies. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 turned out to be a major factor in exposing his accounting that ultimately proved fatal to both him and his empire.

In the spring of 1930, he visited the United States and gave a lecture about the situation in world economics at the Industrial Club of Chicago with the title &quot;The transfer problem and its importance to the United States&quot;. He was invited by President Hoover to the White House to discuss the subject and in June he was awarded the title Doctor of Business Administration by Syracuse University, where he had worked as a young chief engineer when Archbold Stadium was built there in 1907.

In 1929, at the peak of his career, the Kreuger fortune was thought to be worth 30 billion Swedish kronor, equivalent to approximately US$100 billion in 2000, and consisting of more than 200 companies. In the same year, the total loans made by Swedish banks were barely 4 billion SEK.

== Financial innovations and financial engineering ==
Obtaining a monopoly for the production and/or sale of matches in return for loans to governments was, in its essence, not a new way of doing business. Such schemes had been around for a long time (e.g. the Mississippi Bubble of John Law, and the South Sea Bubble) but Kreuger was very creative inventing new ways of financing business, while making sure that he kept control of his companies.

=== B-shares ===
Kreuger financed his activities by selling shares and bonds of his companies as well as through large bank loans, mainly the last two. The use of debt in addition to equity is called leverage and it magnifies both gains and losses.

With respect to selling shares, he invented dual class ownership shares
since he did not want to lose control of his companies. He called the class of shares with reduced voting power B shares. One of Kreuger&#x27;s biographers, Frank Partnoy, called it &quot;an ingenious piece of financial engineering&quot;. Ivar began with Swedish Match where he divided the common shares into two classes. Each class would have the same claim to dividends and profits, but the B shares would carry only 1/1000 of a vote, compared to one vote for each A share. In this way Ivar could double the size of his capital, while diluting his control by just a fraction of a percent.

Presently such shares are sometimes called A Shares with the B Shares having more voting power, as is the case with Google for instance where they carry ten times more voting power than the A Shares.

As already stated, these types of shares are used to this day although, unlike in Kreuger&#x27;s time, there are often restrictions in some markets and/or jurisdictions nowadays. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, allows companies to list dual-class voting shares. Once shares are listed, however, companies are not allowed to reduce the voting rights of the existing shares or issue a new class of superior voting shares.

There is a wide range of dual-class share structures and their use between countries. In Canada, for example, an estimated 20% to 25% of companies currently listed on the TSX make use of some form of dual-class share structure or special voting rights. In the United States on the other hand, where rules on dual-class shares are much more restrictive and investor opposition is more vocal, just over 2% of companies issue restricted shares.

=== Convertible gold debentures ===
Ivar and Lee Higginson &amp; Co., his investment banker in the US, decided to have International Match issue new securities called convertible gold debentures. &quot;Debenture&quot; is a debt instrument not secured by physical collateral or assets. They were issued to mature in 20 years and they were payable in either dollars or gold, at the holder&#x27;s option. These bonds gave investors the right to receive annual interest payments of 6.5 percent from International Match, which was an attractive rate at the time.

Finally, these debentures were convertible, which meant that they could be converted into shares. If International Match performed well and the value of the shares increased, investors could switch from the debentures to the more valuable shares. The convertible feature made these securities particularly attractive: they have both downside protection (because in the case of bankruptcy the bond holders were paid before the shareholders) and upside potential. In other words, the best of both worlds. &quot;Ivar and Lee Higginson had designed their first financial mousetrap.&quot;

Ivar&#x27;s popularity helped Lee Higginson sell $15 million of International Match gold debentures, at a price of $94.50 for each $100 of principal amount. Investors paid $94.50 in return for the right to receive interest of $6.50 per year for 20 years (6.5 percent of the hundred dollars principal amount.). The deal raised a total of $14,175,000, i.e. 94.5 percent of $15 million.

=== American Certificates ===
Kreuger invented another financial instrument, which continues to be used and is nowadays known as American depositary receipts. That issue was called Kreuger &amp; Toll &quot;American Certificates&quot;. American investors had never seen an investment like this. It was part bond, part preferred stock, and part profit sharing option. The certificates enabled investors to gain exposure to a foreign company that had been paying dividends of 25 percent. It would be backed by the largest private loan to a foreign government (i.e. Germany) ever. Even in the midst of the growing panic investors went crazy for the issue and promised to buy 28 million dollars of the new securities. And this happened two days after Black Monday in 1929.

=== Binary foreign exchange option ===
The second Poland agreement also contained some extraordinary protection for International Match including a binary foreign exchange option, a kind of derivative contract, to protect International Match from any declines in the value of the dollar: &quot;International Match Corporation shall have the right to obtain payment of interest in Dutch guilders or US dollars according to its choice and for all such payments one dollar shall be counted as 2½ guilders.&quot;

To retain control of &quot;Garanta&quot;, a company established to facilitate his deals, Ivar created another innovative financial provision, which meant that during the first four years until 1 October 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to appoint the managing director of Garanta who alone was entitled to sign for the company. On or after 1 October 1929, International Match Corporation had the right to acquire 60 percent of the shares at par. This option term secured both initial control over Garanta and the right to own a majority of Garanta&#x27;s shares in the future.

=== Off balance sheet entities ===
This term means that details of an enterprise do not appear in the parent company&#x27;s financial statements. Some of these entities were more or less secret. The associated debt, called &quot;off balance sheet obligations&quot;, didn&#x27;t appear in any financial statements of the companies Ivar controlled other than in summary form, if at all. Albert D. Berning of the firm Ernst &amp; Ernst, International Match&#x27;s auditor, rationalized it at the shareholder&#x27;s meeting in 1926. He said &quot;it is only customary to consolidate the assets and liabilities of companies in such a balance sheet when a substantial majority of the outstanding shares are owned by the parent company. Where less than such a majority is owned, the shares are included as investments.&quot;
This invention gained rapid acceptance by others, e.g. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. The former issued 250 million dollars&#x27; worth of complex securities (equivalent to about $ in dollars) in 1929. Lehman issued similar obligations, which immediately rose 30 percent. Enron used them extensively and in the financial crisis of 2008 they played a major role in bringing down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.

== Gambling ==
Despite the large number of &quot;bona fide&quot; companies Ivar controlled, he was an avid gambler.

He speculated with his personal funds and, especially, with the money of the corporations he controlled. Kreuger treated most of his companies as if they were exclusively his personal property. He frequently transferred funds from one corporation to another with little formality. A number of dummy corporations and holding companies (e.g. Garanta and Continental Investment Corporation) helped him to hide what he was doing. He also used other people as front men to conceal his actions, for example when he acquired almost half of the outstanding shares of Diamond Match Company so as not to raise anti-trust concerns in the USA. Towards the end, in 1932, when he frantically gambled with the securities of corporations he controlled in the vain attempt to reverse their falling prices, he played the markets himself and had friends help him in the effort to prop up share prices. Between the end of February and early March 1932 he needed to make over $10 million ($ in dollars) for payments, including Kreuger &amp; Toll dividends.

His speculations were in foreign currencies, equities and derivatives and he also signed loan agreements with governments not knowing where the funds would be coming from. For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in Griesheim, Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of I. G. Farben. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger &amp; Toll paid. Therefore, he also had to make sure that he had money to pay those dividends.

It has never been established how much Kreuger lost in these frantic efforts in early 1932, but it has been estimated to be between $50 million and $100 million (c$. and $ in dollars).

His first sovereign loan went to Poland, and when Kreuger signed the agreement he had no idea where the funds would come from.

He made a deal with Germany for a $125 million-dollar loan ($ in dollars) with the conditions that Germany sign the Young Plan and, of course, award him a match monopoly. (He already controlled 70% of German match production before the loan agreement.) When he signed the contract, again he had no idea where he would obtain the huge amount; however, he was lucky. Prime Minister Aristide Briand of France decided to repay a previous $75 million-dollar loan from Ivar before it was due. Incredibly, the French agreed to pay this sum by April 1930, just before Ivar&#x27;s first payment to Germany was due. That payment gave Ivar enough cash to make his first installment. Either he had negotiated a sweetheart rescue deal with Prime Minister Briand, or he was incredibly lucky. He also made $5M (c$. in dollars) due to the way the loan to France was structured. (It had been discounted and although France received only $70 million it was obligated to pay back $75 million.)

== Kreuger group loans to foreign states, 1925–1930 ==
The total loans by Kreuger to foreign states have been estimated to US$387m in 1930, corresponding to about US$7.1 – 10.4 bn in 2013 currency.
* Poland I, 1925: $6m and Poland II, 1930: $32.4m
* Free State Danzig, 1930: $1m
* Greece I, 1926: £1m and Greece II, 1931: £1m
* Ecuador I, 1927: $2m and Ecuador II, 1929: $1m
* France, 1927: $75m
* Yugoslavia, 1928: $22m

* Guatemala, 1930; $2.5m
* Turkey, 1930: $10m
* Part of the &quot;Young-loan&quot; to Germany, 1930: US$15m

Kreuger planned to issue a loan of $75m to Italy, known as the &quot;Italian Bond&quot; in 1930 but the deal was never completed.

== End of the Kreuger empire and death ==
In March 1931, during a meeting at the German Ministry of Finance in Berlin, Swiss banker Felix Somary already warned of a bankruptcy of Kreuger&#x27;s match company. By mid-1931, rumours spread that Kreuger &amp; Toll and other companies in Kreuger&#x27;s empire were financially unstable. In February 1932, Kreuger turned to Sveriges Riksbank for the second time in his life to support him in raising a large increase in his loans. At this time his total loans from Swedish banks were estimated at half of the Swedish reserve currency, which had started to have negative effects on the value of the Swedish currency in the international financial market. In order to grant him more loans, the government required that a complete statement of accounts of Kreuger&#x27;s entire company group be presented, as the bank&#x27;s (Sveriges Riksbank) own calculations showed that Kreuger &amp; Toll finances were far too weak to give him more loans.

At that time, Ivar Kreuger was in the United States and was asked to return to Europe for a meeting with the chairman of the Riksbank, Ivar Rooth. He had left Sweden for the last time on 23 November 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship &quot;Ile de France&quot;, arriving in Paris on 11 March 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on 13 or 14 March in Berlin. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger &amp; Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on 11 March to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But the day after, he was found dead in bed in his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger&#x27;s servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the janitor who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician came to the conclusion that he had shot himself some time between 10:45 a.m. and 12:10 p.m. A 9mm semi-automatic gun was found on the bed beside the body.

He left a sealed envelope in the room, addressed to Krister Littorin, which contained three other sealed envelopes – one addressed to his sister Britta; one to Sune Schéle; and one addressed to Littorin. In the letter to Littorin (for some reason written in English although Littorin was his closest Swedish colleague), he wrote:

I have made such a mess of things that I believe this to be the most satisfactory solution for everybody concerned. Please, take care of these two letters also see that two letters which were sent a couple of days ago by Jordahl to me at 5, Avenue Victor Emanuel are returned to Jordahl. The letters were sent by &quot;Majestic&quot; – Goodbye now and thanks. I K.&quot;

Kreuger was interred in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

== Murder allegations ==
While his family believed Ivar Kreuger to have been murdered, it was only more than 30 years after his death that many previously classified Kreuger &amp; Toll documents and Ivar Kreuger documents were made public. Based on these and his insight in his brother&#x27;s business and life, Ivar&#x27;s brother Torsten Kreuger wrote a book in 1963 (2nd edition) called &quot;Kreuger &amp; Toll&quot;, describing how Kreuger &amp; Toll had been taken over, and how then the other Kreuger companies were taken over too. In 1965, Torsten Kreuger published &quot;Sanningen om Ivar Kreuger&quot; (published in English as: &quot;Ivar Kreuger: The Truth at Last&quot;) arguing that his brother Ivar had been murdered. Recently, more books have been written saying more documents have re-appeared or were finally released to public scrutiny, and supporting Torsten Kreuger&#x27;s assertions that his brother was murdered: &quot;Därför mördades Ivar Kreuger&quot; (&#x27;The Reason for the Murder of Ivar Kreuger&#x27;) () (1990), and &quot;Kreuger-Mordet: En utredning med nya fakta&quot; (&#x27;The Kreuger Murder: An Investigation with New Facts&#x27;) () (2000).

== Kreuger Crash ==
Kreuger&#x27;s death precipitated the &quot;Kreuger Crash&quot; which hit investors and companies worldwide, but particularly hard in the United States and Sweden. In 1933 and 1934, the U.S. Congress passed several security reform legislations that were meant to prevent a repeat of the Kreuger Crash. These bills were largely successful in their mission and the American financial industry did not witness frauds of the same magnitude until the Enron scandal and Bernard Madoff&#x27;s Ponzi scheme.

A &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; report from 1930 had judged that of the $630m worth of assets the company claimed to have, $200m came from the match business, $30m were in the bank, and the other $400m were merely categorized as &quot;other investments&quot;. When the company finally went bankrupt at the end of March 1932, claimed assets of $250m turned out to be non-existent.

Prior to the crash, Kreuger had issued thousands of participating debentures. These were very popular, and a firm public belief in the rising Kreuger empire convinced contemporary Swedes to invest in these &quot;Kreuger papers&quot;. Following the Kreuger crash, both the debentures and shares became worthless, and several thousand Swedes and small banks lost their savings and investments as a result. Large investors and suppliers apart from share holders, received a total of 43% back. The banks related to the Wallenberg family company group, Stenbeck company group, and Handelsbanken took over most of the companies in the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match recovered shortly after the crash as did most of the industrial companies within the Kreuger empire. Swedish Match received a large government guaranteed loan that was fully repaid after several years. IMCO in US however did not survive. The liquidation took nine years and was eventually finished in 1941.

== Legacy ==
One biographer called him a genius and swindler. John Kenneth Galbraith wrote &quot;Boiler-room operators, peddlers of stocks in the imaginary Canadian mines, mutual-fund managers whose genius and imagination are unconstrained by integrity, as well as less exotic larcenists, should read about Kreuger. He was the Leonardo of their craft.&quot; Ivar himself admitted to some extent that not all was above board when he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve built my enterprise on the firmest ground that can be found—the foolishness of people.&quot; Andrew Beattie said: &quot;Ivar Kreuger is still a bit of an enigma in history. ...At times it seemed that he was a solid, if ruthless, businessman, and at other times he appeared every inch a scam artist. Between those times, he either built a match monopoly that overreached or orchestrated one of the biggest pyramid schemes in history.&quot;

Accounting standards and auditors&#x27; responsibility for the accuracy of financial statements evolved over time. Corporations resisted publishing audited financial statements. US Steel defied convention when it published its first audited financial statements in 1903. Indeed, accountants in the early 1900s &quot;fiercely resisted efforts to impose strict accounting standards&quot;. It was not until the US Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934—both heavily influenced by Kreuger&#x27;s actions—that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) began to be established. Only in the 1970s and 1980s were auditors forced to accept more responsibility for the veracity of financial statements, but loopholes continued to exist (and probably still do).

Kreuger got the nickname &quot;Saviour of Europe&quot; by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider him to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed &quot;money as such means nothing to me&quot;. He controlled many legitimate, profitable businesses, some of which still exist to this day. (Examples include Swedish Match, Ericsson, Boliden AB, Europe&#x27;s largest gold mine, Skandinaviska Banken, largest ball-bearing manufacturer in the world SKF, largest iron ore mine in the world LKAB, Swedish Film Industry SF Studios, one of largest forestry companies in the world SCA, Hufvudstaden, Stora Kopparberg AB, Deutsche Bank.) &quot;Kreuger &amp; Toll kept few accounting records despite the fact that it was a multibillion-dollar international conglomerate with over 400 subsidiaries.&quot;

==Influence in popular culture==
Ayn Rand&#x27;s 1934 play &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; features a powerful Scandinavian tycoon recognizably modeled after Kreuger. It was later adapted into a 1941 film of the same name, albeit with numerous script alterations.

Graham Greene&#x27;s novel &quot;England Made Me&quot; (1935) also references the businessman. However, in the 1973 film adaptation of Greene&#x27;s novel, the setting is changed from Sweden to Germany.

The pre-code film &quot;The Match King&quot; (1932) is a fictionalized account of Kreuger&#x27;s life. His rise and subsequent downfall are also mentioned by characters in another pre-code film &quot;Forgotten&quot; (1933).

<doc id="289632" wikidata="Q313706" url="?curid=289632" title="Tommy Dreamer">
<text>Thomas James Laughlin (born February 13, 1971) is an American professional wrestler and promoter better known by the ring name Tommy Dreamer. He is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is a former one-time TNA Digital Media Champion, and was the owner and promoter of the House of Hardcore (HOH) promotion.

Dreamer is best known for his tenures with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the 1990s and early 2000s and with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) (previously the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)), primarily from 2001 to 2010. During this time, he held numerous championships including, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which he held twice, being the only man to capture the title in both the original ECW and WWE&#x27;s ECW brand). He has also held the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E Hardcore Championship. Dubbed the &quot;heart and soul&quot; of ECW, Dreamer regularly featured in prominent storylines for the promotion as well as holding many back office roles.

Dreamer has also appeared in notable promotions such as Impact Wrestling/TNA Wrestling, Ring of Honor (ROH), and AAA. After departing from WWE in 2010, Dreamer joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and was a part of an ECW-inspired stable known as EV 2.0. In 2012, Dreamer started his wrestling promotion called House of Hardcore, named in honor of ECW&#x27;s former wrestling school of the same name. Since then, Dreamer has made sporadic appearances with WWE in 2012, 2015, and 2016, as well as wrestling on the independent circuit.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1989–1993)===
Laughlin was trained in professional wrestling by Johnny Rodz. His first notable foray into the business came when he worked in International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) under the name T.D. Madison. While there, he and his storyline brother, G.Q., held the IWCCW Tag Team Championship three times in 1991. He changed his name to Tommy Dreamer, reportedly after taking his given first name, and adding &quot;Dreamer&quot; in tribute to Dusty Rhodes, in 1992 while working in the New England based Century Wrestling Alliance (CWA). While in the CWA, he became its first Heavyweight Champion by defeating &quot;Mr. USA&quot; Tony Atlas in a tournament final held in Wallingford, Connecticut, on November 5, 1992. He held the title for over four months before losing it to The Iron Sheik in Burlington, Vermont. On August 17, 1993, Tommy Dreamer wrestled a dark match at a WWF Superstars taping in White Plains, NY, losing to The Brooklyn Brawler.

=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–2001) ===

====Early appearances (1993–1994)====
Dreamer joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in October 1993 at NWA Bloodfest. His first major gimmick in the company had him wrestling in matches in garish green suspenders and acting as something of a &quot;pretty boy&quot; – at least about the rest of the ECW roster. This gimmick got him soundly booed by crowds, even when he became the first person in wrestling history to kick out of the pin that follows the &quot;Superfly Splash&quot; of Jimmy &quot;Superfly&quot; Snuka at The Night the Line Was Crossed.

====Feud with the Sandman (1994–1995)====
After Michael Fay was arrested in Singapore and sentenced to a caning, ECW head booker Paul Heyman decided to capitalize on the publicity by holding a Singapore Cane match between Dreamer and the Sandman – with the loser having to take ten lashes. After losing the match, Dreamer took his lashes, then asked the Sandman for another, causing the crowd to feel sympathy for him as he took the extra and another. This was a launching point to an angle that ended up blurring the divide between faces and heels in wrestling, as well as start a new way of working the fans, especially the &quot;smarks&quot; – fans with some amount of inside information. In a later match, Dreamer kayfabe accidentally blinded the Sandman, first by knocking a lit cigarette into his eye, then hitting the other with a Singapore cane. Immediately after, Dreamer seemed to break kayfabe and started aiding the Sandman. He professed that he &quot;didn&#x27;t mean to do it&quot; and that it was &quot;an accident&quot; as other wrestlers – face and heel – swarmed out to help. The feud continued with Sandman planning to announce his retirement at an ECW show, only to attack Dreamer and reveal he was never actually blind. The feud ended when Dreamer defeated the Sandman in a No DQ/No-Holds-Barred match.

====Feud with Raven (1995–1997)====
Though the blind Sandman angle was his first &quot;major&quot; feud in ECW, his later, years-long feud against Raven that started in January 1995 is arguably his most memorable. The two were portrayed as childhood friends who had been competing in different ways their entire lives. Raven&#x27;s entrance into ECW had him accompanied by Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl from their kayfabe childhood who had a crush on Dreamer and was now a Penthouse Pet. Dreamer and Raven (and Raven&#x27;s Nest) feuded for two years, with Dreamer never getting a win over Raven until Raven&#x27;s last match in ECW, and a Loser Leaves Town match at Wrestlepalooza 1997. During the feud, Beulah had left Raven and was Tommy&#x27;s valet.

Throughout 1996, during the feud with Raven, Dreamer was also involved in an additional feud with &quot;Prime Time&quot; Brian Lee, who was brought in as Raven&#x27;s bodyguard. The two had several encounters that ended with Dreamer being chokeslammed through tables. During other fights, the pair brawled outdoors onto the street and into traffic. The feud culminated in a scaffold match at High Incident in October 1996, where Dreamer sent Lee off the scaffolding through several tables in the ring below. On February 24, 1997, Dreamer appeared on WWF Monday Night Raw defeating D-Von Dudley during ECW&#x27;s invasion in WWF.

====Various feuds (1997–2001)====
After Raven went to World Championship Wrestling, Dreamer began a feud with the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler. The feud was largely symbolic, with Dreamer representing Extreme Championship Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;new school&quot; style of wrestling as a concept and Lawler (with James E. Cornette) representing the World Wrestling Federation and United States Wrestling Association&#x27;s more &quot;old school&quot; way of doing things.

In 1998, Dreamer had a short feud with Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von), during which they &quot;broke&quot; Beulah&#x27;s neck. In August 1999 at the Last Show at the Madhouse, on their last night in the company, they cited this incident to get Dreamer to accept a challenge for the ECW Tag Team Championship they had won earlier in the night. He did accept, and got the title, but was paired with the unexpected partner Raven, who slid into the ring at the last second and made the pin. The team only lasted a short time before it dissolved, with Raven taking the title and choosing Mike Awesome as his new partner. He also, begrudgingly, became World Heavyweight Champion in 2000 by beating Tazz at CyberSlam, only to lose it to Justin Credible just 30 minutes later.

When speaking of his title reigns on &quot;The Rise and Fall of ECW&quot; documentary produced by WWE Home Video, Dreamer is quoted as saying:
Dreamer stayed with ECW until it folded in 2001, defeating C. W. Anderson in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Guilty as Charged – the final pay-per-view – and teaming with Danny Doring in a win over Julio Dinero and E. Z. Money in the final independent ECW show.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2004, 2005-2010) ===

====The Alliance (2001–2002)====
After ECW closed its doors, Dreamer spent time in various independent leagues throughout the country, such as Jersey All Pro Wrestling and Combat Zone Wrestling before he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He was introduced to WWF audiences on the July 9, 2001, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as a member of the WCW/ECW Alliance during the Invasion angle. When the angle ended in November, Dreamer was sent to the WWF&#x27;s &quot;farm territory&quot; Heartland Wrestling Association.

====Hardcore Champion and Heat mainstay (2002–2004)====
He was brought back to the main roster of the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment) in March 2002 and placed on the Raw brand. There, he turned face and was given a gimmick that saw him proclaim that he was &quot;Just a Regular Guy&quot;, for which he was featured in vignettes and backstage segments showing him in normal situations that were then augmented by &quot;disgusting&quot; antics such as brushing his teeth and his dog&#x27;s teeth with the same brush and eating food from the floor. However, this angle was short-lived. He soon reverted to his &quot;Innovator of Violence&quot; gimmick in the summer and amassed fourteen reigns as Hardcore Champion. During this time, he was the final person to hold it before it became unified with the Intercontinental Championship in a match with Rob Van Dam at Madison Square Garden. After losing the Hardcore Championship, Dreamer renewed his feud with Raven, defeating him in a Loser Leaves &quot;Raw&quot; match on June 24 to send him to &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; sister show, &quot;Heat&quot;. Dreamer (with a variety of partners) would feud in the fall with Lance Storm and William Regal as he sought revenge for his jaw being broken. Dreamer competed in his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 19, 2003, bringing weapons with him and breaking Bill DeMott&#x27;s hand during the match.

As 2003 and 2004 went on, Dreamer was used less and less on WWE television, and they began allowing him to take independent bookings and work as color commentator for their developmental territories, Ohio Valley Wrestling, Deep South Wrestling and on occasion Heat. He was taken off the main roster in January 2004. When his performer&#x27;s contract expired, he took a succession of office jobs inside World Wrestling Entertainment, including being the number two person in Talent Relations. During this time he continued to work in the independents and Ohio Valley Wrestling.

====ECW Original (2005–2007)====
On June 12, 2005, Dreamer was a major part of the ECW One Night Stand reunion show pay-per-view held under the World Wrestling Entertainment banner. He, along with a number of former ECW stars, took part in promotional hype for the event on episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; and, with The Sandman, he wrestled the Dudley Boyz in the main event. For the second ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, he was placed into an angle that had him and Terry Funk – who had been his &quot;mentor&quot; in the early days of the original ECW – at odds with then-heels, Mick Foley and Edge over the meanings of &quot;extreme&quot;. The angle ended with a six-person-intergender-tag team match at ECW One Night Stand where Dreamer, Funk, and Beulah McGillicutty lost to Edge, Foley, and Lita.

When the ECW brand officially launched on the Sci Fi channel, Dreamer and the Sandman were put into one of the brands first feuds, an &quot;old school versus new school&quot; feud, against Test and Mike Knox. In November and December he engaged in a short feud with Daivari and The Great Khali, but Khali was sent to the Raw brand before it could come to a conclusion. Not long after Khali left ECW, The New Breed stable was established, consisting of wrestlers new to ECW: Elijah Burke, Marcus Cor Von, Matt Striker and Kevin Thorn. In response, a stable of ECW Originals was created, and the teams continued to clash in singles and tag matches, trading wins on the weekly ECW show throughout the spring of 2007, while both sides tried to get CM Punk to side with them. The Originals won a standard-rules four-on-four match at WrestleMania 23 on April 1, which would be Dreamer&#x27;s first and only match ever on the main card of a WrestleMania. The Originals lost an extreme-rules rematch on the following episode of &quot;ECW&quot;. The feud continued until a number of roster moves left both sides nearly barren, with it ending at One Night Stand on June 3 when Dreamer, Sandman, and Punk beat Burke, Cor Von, and Striker in a Tables match.

====ECW Championship pursuits (2007–2008)====
In late 2007, Dreamer took part in the ECW brand&#x27;s elimination chase to name a number one contender to the ECW Championship. During the series of matches, also involving Stevie Richards, Elijah Burke, and Kevin Thorn he added a bandana, worn on his head, to his ring gear. He received the original one from a young boy with a brain tumor, and from then on began wearing one as a sign of solidarity and strength to anyone going through that struggle. Dreamer emerged victorious in the final match against Burke, only to be surprised by ECW&#x27;s general manager Armando Estrada forcing him to face Big Daddy V, who promptly beat him for the number one contenders.

In early 2008, Dreamer would have one of his career highlights. Despite not being featured on television leading up to the Royal Rumble, Dreamer would receive a loud ovation and chants from his hometown MSG crowd even with Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker in the match. In February, Dreamer was paired with ECW brand enhancement talent Colin Delaney as a sort of mentor after Delaney was consistently and easily defeated on the weekly ECW television show. They challenged John Morrison and the Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship after they defeated them in a non-title match, but they lost the title match in an Extreme rules match in March. At WrestleMania XXIV, he participated in a pre-show 24-man battle royal to earn an opportunity for the ECW Championship in the event, a match that was won by Kane. Dreamer qualified for the five-way Singapore cane match at One Night Stand to determine a number one contender for the championship; Big Show would win the match.

Following Mark Henry&#x27;s ECW Championship win at Night of Champions, Dreamer was named his first challenger. At The Great American Bash, Dreamer was defeated by Henry for the championship after Colin Delaney turned on him and cost him the match. On the following &quot;ECW&quot;, Dreamer defeated Delaney and again on August 12, 2008, in an Extreme Rules grudge match which would be Delaney&#x27;s final match in the WWE. Dreamer then turned his attention to the debuting Jack Swagger, who made disparaging remarks about Dreamer and ECW. They first faced off in an amateur wrestling match, which Dreamer was disqualified from for using his DDT on Swagger. Then Swagger defeated Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match, ending the feud.

====ECW Champion and departure (2009–2010)====
On the January 13, 2009 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Dreamer announced that if he failed to win the ECW Championship by June 6, when his WWE contract was to expire, he would no longer wrestle for ECW. The storyline saw Dreamer start a losing streak that ended when he defeated Paul Burchill on the February 24 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;. On the April 28 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Dreamer received a match for the ECW Championship against then-champion Christian, which went to a no-contest when Jack Swagger interfered. On the May 21 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; Dreamer had another title match with Christian which once again went to a no contest when Swagger interfered, believing he ruined Dreamer&#x27;s last title chance. Dreamer was granted a one-day extension on his contract, allowing him one last chance at the ECW Championship, challenging the champion Christian and Jack Swagger in a triple threat match at Extreme Rules, where Dreamer pinned Jack Swagger in a hardcore triple threat match, capturing his second ECW Championship almost a decade after he claimed the title in the original ECW, being the only man to hold the belt in the original ECW and in the ECW brand of WWE.

After successfully defending the title against Christian on the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Dreamer successfully defended the title in a Championship Scramble match at The Bash, before eventually losing the title back to Christian at Night of Champions. On the July 28 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Dreamer announced he would exercise his rematch clause against Christian the following week. The two faced off in an Extreme Rules match, in which Christian retained the championship.

After his championship pursuit had ceased, Dreamer began teaming up with Christian, Yoshi Tatsu and Goldust on various occasions to take on William Regal and his allies Vladimir Kozlov and Ezekiel Jackson, exchanging victories and losses. On the December 29 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Dreamer wrestled Zack Ryder and lost. If Dreamer was to lose the match then he would be (kayfabe) forced to retire from in-ring competition. After the match, Dreamer made a farewell speech in which he thanked the fans before exiting the ring with his two daughters. A few days later on January 4, 2010, Dreamer was officially released by WWE, ending an eight-year tenure with the company.

Dreamer made his TNA in–ring debut on the July 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, losing to Abyss in a No Disqualification match. After the match Raven reignited his old feud with Dreamer by turning on him, laying him out with a DDT on a chair, and licking his face. The following week Raven explained his turn by saying that he had not forgotten how Dreamer had &quot;stolen&quot; his girlfriend Beulah McGillicutty back in 1996; also on that show Dreamer teamed with Van Dam to beat Abyss and Raven. On August 8 at Hardcore Justice, Dreamer was defeated by Raven in a &quot;Final Showdown&quot; (Final Singles match) match refereed by Mick Foley and featuring appearances by Beulah McGillicutty, &quot;Lupus&quot;, The Blue Meanie and Hollywood Nova.

Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they did not deserve to be in TNA. The following week TNA president Dixie Carter gave each member of EV 2.0 TNA contracts in order for them to settle their score with . At No Surrender Dreamer lost an &quot;I Quit&quot; match to A.J.

At Bound for Glory Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Dreamer pinned Styles. After weeks of dissension between Rob Van Dam and the rest of EV 2.0, caused by Van Dam&#x27;s belief that there was a traitor within the group, Dreamer challenged him to a match. At Turning Point Van Dam defeated Dreamer and afterwards made peace with him. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rhino turned heel by attacking Van Dam and Dreamer, revealing himself as the traitor Van Dam had been looking for. The following week Dreamer defeated Rhino in a Street Fight, but he suffered an injured wrist during the match. After spending some time off television, Dreamer returned on the February 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, becoming entangled in the feud between former tag team partners Bully Ray and Brother Devon. On March 13 at Victory Road, Dreamer defeated Ray in a Falls Count Anywhere match, following interference from Devon.

==== Immortal (2011) ====

On the May 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Dreamer was forced to attack A.J. Styles and to join Immortal in order to save his job in TNA. Dreamer was later confronted on his choice by A.J. Styles, which led to a match at Sacrifice, where Dreamer was victorious following interference from Bully Ray. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Dreamer officially turned heel, citing the first time he attacked Styles was due to being forced by Ray, before willingly attacking Styles because he wanted to and proceeding to berate the crowd by calling them &quot;pieces of crap&quot; for not sympathizing with his job situation. This is also the first time that Dreamer has wrestled as a heel since being a member of the Alliance during his WWF/E career. On the May 26 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Christopher Daniels defeated Dreamer and Ray in a no disqualification street fight. On June 6 Dreamer confirmed that TNA&#x27;s house show in Memphis, Tennessee on June 11 would be his final appearance for TNA.

<doc id="289636" wikidata="Q3341881" url="?curid=289636" title="Nilradical of a ring">
<text>In algebra, the nilradical of a commutative ring is the ideal consisting of the nilpotent elements:
:formula_1
It is thus the radical of the zero ideal. If the nilradical is the zero ideal, the ring is called a reduced ring. The nilradical of a commutative ring is the intersection of all prime ideals.

In the non-commutative ring case the same definition does not always work. This has resulted in several radicals generalizing the commutative case in distinct ways; see the article Radical of a ring for more on this.

The nilradical of a Lie algebra is similarly defined for Lie algebras.

== Commutative rings ==

The nilradical of a commutative ring is the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring, or equivalently the radical of the zero ideal. This is an ideal because the sum of any two nilpotent elements is nilpotent (by the binomial formula), and the product of any element with a nilpotent element is nilpotent (by commutativity). It can also be characterized as the intersection of all the prime ideals of the ring (in fact, it is the intersection of all minimal prime ideals).

A ring is called reduced if it has no nonzero nilpotent. Thus, a ring is reduced if and only if its nilradical is zero. If &quot;R&quot; is an arbitrary commutative ring, then the quotient of it by the nilradical is a reduced ring and is denoted by formula_2.

Since every maximal ideal is a prime ideal, the Jacobson radical — which is the intersection of maximal ideals — must contain the nilradical. A ring &quot;R&quot; is called a Jacobson ring if the nilradical and Jacobson radical of &quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot; coincide for all prime ideals &quot;P&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. An Artinian ring is Jacobson, and its nilradical is the maximal nilpotent ideal of the ring. In general, if the nilradical is finitely generated (e.g., the ring is Noetherian), then it is nilpotent.

== Noncommutative rings ==

For noncommutative rings, there are several analogues of the nilradical. The lower nilradical (or Baer–McCoy radical, or prime radical) is the analogue of the radical of the zero ideal and is defined as the intersection of the prime ideals of the ring. The analogue of the set of all nilpotent elements is the upper nilradical and is defined as the ideal generated by all nil ideals of the ring, which is itself a nil ideal. The set of all nilpotent elements itself need not be an ideal (or even a subgroup), so the upper nilradical can be much smaller than this set. The Levitzki radical is in between and is defined as the largest locally nilpotent ideal. As in the commutative case, when the ring is Artinian, the Levitzki radical is nilpotent and so is the unique largest nilpotent ideal. Indeed, if the ring is merely Noetherian, then the lower, upper, and Levitzki radical are nilpotent and coincide, allowing the nilradical of any Noetherian ring to be defined as the unique largest (left, right, or two-sided) nilpotent ideal of the ring.

<text>David William McFadden (October 11, 1940 – June 6, 2018) was a Canadian poet, fiction writer, and travel writer.

==Biography==
McFadden was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and began writing poetry while still in high school, publishing in literary magazines, corresponding with beat writer Jack Kerouac, and becoming a proofreader for the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; newspaper. As he gained success as a poet he quit the newspaper devoting himself full-time to literature in 1976.

McFadden served on the editorial board of Coach House Press, and as a contributing editor for &quot;SwiftCurrent&quot; and &quot;Canadian Art Magazine&quot;. He was a monthly columnist for &quot;Quill and Quire&quot; and &quot;Hamilton This Month&quot;. He taught at David Thompson University Centre for three years and was a member of the production team of the literary journal &quot;Brick&quot;.

McFadden&#x27;s poetry critiques the commercialism and shallowness of modern society. His work, with its overt humour, reflections on contemporary urban life, and interest in the mistakes of the imagination is influenced by Frank O&#x27;Hara, John Ashbery and the New York School of the 1950s, as well as the Beat writers of the 1960s such as Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. His work focuses on Canadian subjects, settings and personalities. His book of 100 Baudelaire-inspired prose poems, &quot;Gypsy Guitar&quot;, was called &quot;everyone&#x27;s favourite book of poems&quot; by George Bowering.

McFadden is a founding member of GOSH (Gentlemen of Sensible Height), and a former member of International PEN, the Writer&#x27;s Union of Canada, the League of Canadian Poets, and the Last Minute Club.

In 2012, McFadden was diagnosed with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, a type of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease that affects a person&#x27;s memory of words, and shortly thereafter he became one of the first participants in a study of the effects of aerobic exercise on people already affected by dementia.

<text>iTromsø (formerly Bladet Tromsø) is a daily (save for Sunday) newspaper published in Tromsø, Norway.

==History and profile==
&quot;Bladet Tromsø&quot; was first published on 24 January 1898 with Erling Gjemsø as the first editor-in-chief. He was followed by Erling Steinbø in the post.

The newspaper initially supported the Liberal Party. Following the party split in 1972, it aligned with the new Liberal People&#x27;s Party for a short time before declaring its support of the Conservative Party.

The newspaper was owned by the company which owns &quot;Verdens Gang&quot; from 1986 to 1992. It is now published by Mediehuset iTromsø A/S, a subsidiary of Polaris Media, which was earlier owned by the Schibsted Group. The editor-in-chief is Stig Jakobsen.

==Lindberg case==
&quot;Bladet Tromsø&quot; became internationally known in 1988 when they published an official report on seal hunting written by Odd F. Lindberg. The report received international attention and led to a discussion about the Norwegian seal hunt and freedom of speech. The newspaper was sued by the seal hunters and sentenced after two court rounds to pay compensation. In May 1999, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg reversed the ruling of the Norwegian court, marking a change in the standards of publication.

<doc id="289655" wikidata="Q1277409" url="?curid=289655" title="Earl of Selkirk">
<text>Earl of Selkirk is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, used since 1646. It has rules of inheritance subject to unusual and unique provisions.

==History==
The title was created on 14 August 1646 for Lord William Douglas, third son of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas, along with the title Lord Daer and Shortcleuch. On 29 April 1656, the first earl married Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. In 1660, after the birth of two sons, he changed his surname from Douglas to &quot;Hamilton&quot;, and was created Duke of Hamilton for life, as was then a not uncommon practice in Scotland when a peeress in her own right married someone of lesser degree.

=== Second earl&#x27;s surrender and novodamus ===
On 6 October 1688, during the reign of James VII, the new Duke of Hamilton surrendered his previous titles to the Crown (except Hamilton). They were reconferred on his third (but second surviving) son Charles, who thereby became second Earl of Selkirk, and who also reverted to his original surname of &quot;Douglas&quot;. Thus, while the eldest son was to inherit the title of Duke of Hamilton and have his mother&#x27;s maiden name for surname, the younger son was to inherit his father&#x27;s dignities and perpetuate the name of Douglas.

This novodamus for this arrangement embodied a unique remainder, the effect of which was that:
# the titles would pass to the heirs male of the 1st earl&#x27;s &quot;younger&quot; sons &quot;before&quot; the heirs male of his &quot;eldest&quot; son (who was heir apparent to his mother&#x27;s Dukedom of Hamilton);
# if the person who would otherwise inherit the title was already duke of Hamilton (or would inherit that dukedom at the same time), the titles would pass instead to that duke&#x27;s next surviving brother;
# if the titles were ever held by a duke of Hamilton (either because an earl of Selkirk succeeded as duke of Hamilton, or because provision 2 was unable to operate because the heir was a duke of Hamilton who had no surviving younger brothers), the titles would pass on that duke&#x27;s death to his second surviving son;
# if the titles had passed to a younger brother or younger son under provisions 2 or 3, they would then pass to his heirs male on his death; but
# if such a younger son or younger brother&#x27;s heirs male died out, the title would not pass to his own younger brothers and their heirs male, but would instead revert to the senior male line, with provisions 2 and 3 operating as before.

This remainder is so unusual that &quot;Hamilton House&quot;, a Scottish country dance, reputedly was created around it.

=== Third earl ===
The second earl died childless in 1739, and his younger brother, John Hamilton, 1st Earl of Ruglen (who had been so created on 14 April 1697), succeeded as the third earl. He outlived his son and heir, and when he died in 1744 the Earldom of Ruglen and its subsidiary titles passed to his daughter Anne Douglas, Countess of March, and on her death in 1748 to William Douglas, 3rd Earl of March (later 4th Duke of Queensberry).

=== Fourth, fifth and sixth earls ===
The earldom of Selkirk and its subsidiary title, being limited to male heirs, passed to Dunbar Hamilton, grandson of Lord Basil Hamilton, sixth son of the first earl. Upon succeeding as fourth earl, he, like the second earl, changed his surname to &quot;Douglas&quot;.

On the fourth earl&#x27;s death in 1799, he was succeeded by his only surviving son, Thomas, as fifth earl, who was then succeeded on his own death in 1820 by his only son, Dunbar, as sixth earl.

=== Seventh earl ===
On his death in 1885, the heirs male of the younger sons of the first earl expired. The heir male of the first earl&#x27;s eldest son was William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, but under the special remainder (provision 2 above) the titles passed instead to his younger brother, Lord Charles Hamilton, who succeeded as seventh earl.

=== Eighth earl ===
When the seventh earl died unmarried in 1886, the titles reverted to his elder brother, who had no further brothers to whom they could pass, and who accordingly succeeded as eighth earl.

=== Ninth earl ===
When the eighth earl died without a son in 1895, the dukedom passed to his fourth cousin, Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, who succeeded as 13th duke of Hamilton. As he also had no brothers, he also succeeded as ninth earl of Selkirk.

=== Tenth earl ===
When the ninth earl died in 1940, his eldest son, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, inherited the dukedom, but the earldom of Selkirk and its subsidiary title passed under the special remainder (provision 3 above) to his second son, Lord George Douglas-Hamilton, who succeeded as 10th earl.

=== Eleventh earl ===
Upon the death of the 10th earl in 1994, married but childless, the titles passed (under provision 5 above) to his nephew, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, second son of the 14th Duke of Hamilton and next brother of Angus Douglas-Hamilton, 15th Duke of Hamilton, who succeeded as 11th earl. This succession was unsuccessfully challenged in the Court of the Lord Lyon by Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, son of Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton, next brother of the 10th Earl. Lord Malcolm had died in 1969 as heir presumptive to the 10th earl and his son was listed thereafter in that position by reference works such as Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack and Debrett&#x27;s but it was the ruling of the court that the death of the 14th duke in 1973 had placed the younger sons of the 14th duke ahead of the younger sons of the 13th duke and their issue in line to the earldom.

The 11th earl was, at the time of his succession, the Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, and he disclaimed the titles in order to remain in the House of Commons, thus preventing a by-election at a very politically sensitive time. He was later elevated to the House of Lords with a life peerage as Baron Selkirk of Douglas, and served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament.

==Earls of Selkirk (1646)==
* William Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Selkirk, &quot;jure uxoris&quot; 3rd Duke of Hamilton (1634–1694)
* Charles Douglas, 2nd Earl of Selkirk (1663–1739) (son of the 1st Earl, younger brother of 4th Duke of Hamilton)
* John Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Selkirk (1664–1744) (brother of 2nd Earl, younger brother of 4th Duke of Hamilton)
* Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk (1722–1799) (great-nephew of the 3rd Earl)
* Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk (1771–1820) (son of the 4th Earl)
* Dunbar James Douglas, 6th Earl of Selkirk (1809–1885) (son of the 5th Earl)
* Charles George Hamilton, 7th Earl of Selkirk (1847–1886) (fourth cousin once removed of the 6th Earl, younger brother of the 12th Duke of Hamilton)
* William Alexander Louis Stephen Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, 8th Earl of Selkirk (1845–1895) (older brother of 7th Earl)
* Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton, 9th Earl of Selkirk (1862–1940) (fourth cousin of the 8th Earl)
* George Nigel Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk (1906–1994) (son of the 9th Earl, brother of the 14th Duke of Hamilton)
* James Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 11th Earl of Selkirk (1942–2023) (nephew of the 10th Earl, brother of the 15th Duke of Hamilton) (disclaimed 1994)
* John Andrew Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Earl of Selkirk () (son of the 11th Earl)

The heir presumptive is the present earl&#x27;s younger brother Charles Douglas Douglas-Hamilton ().

== Line of succession ==
Everyone in the line of succession to the Duke of Hamilton is eligible to succeed to the Earldom, but in the order dictated by its special remainder:
the sons of Lord Selkirk of Douglas, starting with the present earl, come first (with potential male issue of any of them preceding younger brothers of that son), but should any future Earl of Selkirk die without a direct heir, the death of the 15th Duke of Hamilton in 2010 means that the younger son of the 15th Duke would rank ahead of lines from younger sons of the 14th Duke and the death of the 16th Duke would likewise move his younger sons to the head of the line.

<doc id="289658" wikidata="Q283678" url="?curid=289658" title="Xine">
<text>xine is a multimedia playback engine for Unix-like operating systems released under the GNU General Public License. xine is built around a shared library (xine-lib) that supports different frontend player applications. xine uses libraries from other projects such as liba52, libmpeg2, FFmpeg, libmad, FAAD2, and Ogle. xine can also use binary Windows codecs through a wrapper, bundled as the w32codecs, for playback of some media formats that are not handled natively.

== History ==
xine was started in 2000 by Günter Bartsch shortly after LinuxTag. At that time playing DVDs in Linux was described as a tortuous process since one had to manually create audio and video named pipes and start their separated decoder processes.

Günter realized the OMS (Open Media System) or LiViD approach had obvious shortcomings in terms of audio and video synchronization, so xine was born as an experiment trying to get it right. The project evolved into a modern media player multi-threaded architecture.

During xine development, some effort was dedicated to making a clear separation of the player engine (xine-lib) and front-end (xine-ui). Since the 1.0 release (2004-12-25) the API of xine-lib is considered stable and several applications and players rely on it.

Günter left the project in 2003 when he officially announced the new project leaders, Miguel Freitas, Michael Roitzsch, Mike Melanson, and Thibaut Mattern.

== DVD issues ==
Since it is not a member of DVD Forum, the xine project is not contractually obliged to insert user operation prohibition such as disallowing fast-forward or skipping during trailers and ads. However, without membership in the Forum, the project also cannot make xine play DVDs encrypted with CSS except by using reverse-engineered code. xine therefore uses the libdvdcss library, which was created by reverse engineering. The legal status of libdvdcss is questionable in several nations; in the United States, for example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act arguably prohibits reverse-engineering of CSS. Virtually all commercial DVDs are encrypted with CSS.

== Other issues ==
To prevent a screensaver from starting, xine sends a scroll lock key signal to the environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll lock key as normal input. One example is the Konsole terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow keys when scroll lock is used.

== Graphical user interface ==
The xine project offers graphical front-ends for xine, including one based on Xlib and another on GTK+, along with a browser plugin. Other front-ends for xine are available from other projects.

== xine backend ==
The shared library &#x27;xine-lib&#x27; used and developed by xine is also used by other projects. For example, it can be used instead of GStreamer as a backend for the Phonon media framework used by KDE and Qt.

<doc id="289659" wikidata="Q3035848" url="?curid=289659" title="Don McKay (poet)">
<text>Don McKay (born 1942) is a Canadian poet, editor, and educator.

==Life==

McKay was born in Owen Sound, Ontario and raised in Cornwall. McKay was educated at the University of Western Ontario and the University of Wales, where he earned his PhD in 1971, with a dissertation on the poetry of Dylan Thomas. He taught creative writing and English for 27 years in universities including the University of Western Ontario and the University of New Brunswick. In 2008, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. McKay has lived in southwestern Ontario, New Brunswick, Vancouver Island and Newfoundland.

==Poetic career==

McKay is the author of twelve books of poetry, including &quot;Birding, or Desire&quot; (1986), &quot;Apparatus&quot; (1997) and &quot;Paradoxides&quot; (2012). He has twice won the Governor General&#x27;s Award, for &quot;Night Field&quot; (1991) and &quot;Another Gravity&quot; (2000). In June 2007, he won the Griffin Poetry Prize for &quot;Strike/Slip&quot; (2006). Beginning in 2002, he has also published five books of non-fiction prose, mixing nature writing, thoughts on poetics, and philosophical and environmental reflections. Critical discourse has included him in a group of Canadian poets known as the &#x27;thinking and singing poets,&#x27; along with Robert Bringhurst, Dennis Lee, Tim Lilburn and Jan Zwicky. 

McKay, published since 1973, is described as &#x27; a poet with a patient eye, an acute arresting ear, over flowing with details of ornithology, botany, weather, industry, books and music; nuanced descriptions, philosophical phrasing, folksy idiom. madcap humour and elegy&#x27;. Others, consider &#x27;awe, astonishment and wonder to be the keynotes of McKay&#x27;s poems and poetics&#x27; and that his prime subject matter to be &#x27;the workings of the human mind&#x27;.

McKay has also made a wide impression as a teacher and editor. He was the co-founder and a manuscript reader for Brick Books ., one of Canada&#x27;s leading poetry presses, and was editor of the literary journal &quot;The Fiddlehead&quot; from 1991 to 1996. He has participated in the Sage Hill Writing experience in Saskatchewan and was Associate Director for poetry at the Banff Centre for the Arts Writing Studio. He has mentored many fellow poets, including Ken Babstock, Marlene Cookshaw, Barbara Colebrook Peace, Michael Redhill, Richard Kelly Kemick, Anne Simpson, and Sue Sinclair. 

McKay is an avid birdwatcher; and bird themes and flight are dominant topics in his poetry. In &quot;Birding, or Desire&quot; (1983), the quirky protagonist is never far from his &quot;Birds of Canada&quot; hobbyist&#x27;s field guide. McKay&#x27;s passion for birds and nature percolates throughout all of his work, and some consider &#x27;McKay&#x27;s preferred environment is located in the natural world&#x27;. McKay himself sees his writing as &quot;nature poetry in a time of environmental crisis.&quot; McKay&#x27;s poems are ecologically centred, inspired by the conflict between inspiration and spirit, instinct and knowledge.

In his book of poetic philosophy &quot;Vis à Vis: Field Notes on Poetry &amp; Wilderness&quot;, McKay details many of his beliefs on metaphor, wildness, and the homing instinct.
In that book, his definitive 1993 essay &#x27;Baler Twine&#x27; describes those moments &#x27;before wrestling with words and music &#x27;, a &#x27;state of mind &#x27; ,a preparedness, which he labels as &#x27;poetic attention&#x27;; and further describes as a &#x27;sort of readiness &#x27;, a &#x27;form of knowing&#x27;. McKay also touches on his other main poetic themes of &#x27;Wilderness&#x27;, &#x27;Home&#x27;, and &#x27;Matériel&#x27; (material existence).

<doc id="289661" wikidata="Q1798592" url="?curid=289661" title="Cloud Strife">
<text>is a character in the media franchise &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; by Square Enix. He is the protagonist of the role-playing video games &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (1997), &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; (2020) and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot; (2024) and the animated film &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot; (2005), and appears in several other installments in the wider &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&quot;.&quot; He has also appeared in other media, such as the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series by Square Enix and Disney and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series by Nintendo.

Throughout &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and its compilation that expands its universe, Cloud Strife is portrayed as a revolutionary working for an eco-terrorist group called Avalanche against a mega corporation known as SHINRA, who plans to drain the world of its lifestream. Cloud&#x27;s internal struggles, which involve confronting his own traumatic past, including that of his former colleague Sephiroth, are shown as a highlight of the game. 

Cloud was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, a character artist for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, whose role expanded to include supervision over Cloud&#x27;s personality. Yoshinori Kitase, director of &quot;VII&quot;, and Kazushige Nojima, an events planner, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After &quot;VII&quot;, Nomura redesigned Cloud for &quot;Advent Children&quot;, giving him a more realistic appearance alongside new weaponry and a new outfit. For &quot;Remake&quot;, the team aimed to adapt his classic design for a more realistic artstyle. 

Cloud has garnered primarily positive reception from critics, and has been described as one of the most iconic video game protagonists. He has also been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first unreliable narrators and for the game&#x27;s depiction of his mental disorder. Additionally, he is seen as a messiah figure in both the game and film for opposing Sephiroth&#x27;s schemes and supported by his allies.

==Concept==

In contrast to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, which featured multiple &quot;main characters&quot;, Square&#x27;s staff decided in the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; development that the game would follow a single identifiable protagonist. In Hironobu Sakaguchi&#x27;s first plot treatment, a prototype for Cloud&#x27;s character belonged to an organization attempting to destroy New York City&#x27;s &quot;Mako Reactors&quot;. Kitase and Nomura discussed that Cloud would be the lead of three protagonists, but Nomura did not receive character profiles or a completed scenario in advance. Left to imagine the stories behind the characters he designed, Nomura shared these details in discussions with staff or in separately penned notes. Frustrated by the continued popularity of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; characters despite the release of two sequels, Nomura made it his goal to create a memorable cast. The contrast between Cloud, a &quot;young, passionate boy&quot;, and Sephiroth, a &quot;more mature and cool&quot; individual, struck Amano as &quot;intriguing&quot;, though not unusual as a pairing. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura imagined a rivalry mirroring that of Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth representing Musashi and Kojirō, respectively.

Kitase and Nojima developed Cloud&#x27;s backstory and his relationship to Sephiroth. While drafting the game&#x27;s scenario, Nojima saw a standing animation created by event planner Motomu Toriyama that depicted &quot;Cloud showing off&quot;. The animation impressed Nojima and inspired the idea that Cloud had developed a false persona. This later led Nojima to create Zack Fair, a SOLDIER whom Cloud aspired to be like, to expand on the mystery of Cloud&#x27;s past. Nojima left the unfolding of events regarding Cloud&#x27;s identity unwritten, and Kitase was unaware of the significance of Zack&#x27;s addition until playtesting. Kitase reviewed Nojima&#x27;s scenario and felt that Cloud, who was neither single-minded nor righteous, offered a fresh take on a protagonist. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa Lockhart, and Aerith Gainsborough was also viewed as novel for the series. Nojima likened Cloud and Tifa&#x27;s relationship to one of friends since nursery school, and compared Aerith to a transfer student arriving mid-term.

In early scripts, Sephiroth would have deceived Cloud into thinking that he had created him, and he had the ability to exert control over Cloud&#x27;s movements. As in the finished game, Cloud would discover that Shinra&#x27;s experiments and his own insecurities had made him susceptible to Sephiroth&#x27;s manipulation. Cloud would have also somehow injured Tifa prior to the game&#x27;s events, leaving her with memory loss of the event and a large scar on her back. Kitase rejected a proposed scene written by Masato Kato involving Cloud and Tifa walking out of a Chocobo stable the morning before the final battle, with Tifa following only after checking around. Kitase found it &quot;too intense&quot; and Nojima described the proposal as &quot;extreme&quot;; however, Kitase maintained a toned-down scene written by Kato depicting the night before, which has Tifa speak a risqué line of dialogue before a fade to black. According to Nojima, none of the staff expected that the scene, despite &quot;the line in question&quot;, &quot;would be something so important&quot;.

Nojima wanted to write scenes in such a way that players themselves could decide what Cloud was thinking. Nojima used Cloud&#x27;s foggy memories as a device to provide details about the world that would be unknown to the player but considered common knowledge to its inhabitants. To emphasize Cloud&#x27;s personality, event planners repeated elements they found interesting, such as Toriyama&#x27;s standing animation and Cloud&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;not interested&quot;.

In retrospective, Nomura and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; co-director Naoki Hamaguchi have described Cloud as a &quot;dorky character&quot;. According to Nomura, although post-&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; titles featuring Cloud have emphasized his &quot;cool side&quot;, &quot;in the original game, Cloud had many comical or lame moments&quot;. Nomura believes that the reason Cloud became popular with audiences is due to the impact his personality made on Nojima&#x27;s scenario.

===Designs===
In addition to testing models ported from Square&#x27;s 1995 SIGGRAPH demo, Nomura and several other artists created new characters, including an early design of Cloud. Sakaguchi, impressed with Nomura&#x27;s illustrations and detailed handwritten notes for &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;, tasked him with designing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; main characters.

Nomura&#x27;s notes listed Cloud&#x27;s job as . Cloud&#x27;s design underwent several revisions. Nomura&#x27;s first draft of Cloud featured slicked-back black hair to contrast with the long silver hair of the game&#x27;s primary antagonist, Sephiroth, and to minimize the model&#x27;s polygon count. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role as the game&#x27;s lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud&#x27;s design to give him spiky, bright blond hair. Nomura also made Cloud taller than he appeared in the SGI Onyx demo, while a discarded iteration drawn &quot;more on the realistic side&quot; depicted Cloud with a taller head and body and more muscular physique.

Yoshitaka Amano, who handled character illustrations for previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, painted promotional images for the game by taking Nomura&#x27;s &quot;drawings and put[ting his] own spin on them&quot;. According to Amano, because of the hardware limitations of the PlayStation, the platform Square had settled on for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, characters could not be rendered realistically. Amano thought that Cloud&#x27;s baggy pants, which taper at the bottom, reflected a &quot;very ... Japanese style&quot;, resembling the silhouette of a &quot;hakama&quot;.

Early renditions of Cloud&#x27;s weapon, the , depicted a smaller, thinner blade. Variations included additions such as a small chain connected to the pommel, magnets securing the blade to Cloud&#x27;s back, and a more detailed design that resembled a &quot;Western-style sword&quot;. The Buster Sword&#x27;s blade grew in subsequent illustrations, and Nomura called it &quot;the Giant Kitchen Knife&quot;, envisioning it as unrefined steel. Square&#x27;s staff conceived of a minigame involving Cloud driving a motorcycle at the start of the game&#x27;s development, and Nomura&#x27;s illustrations included Cloud riding a , a Shinra motorcycle based on a real-life motorbike, the Yamaha VMAX.

===Further development===
====&quot;Advent Children&quot; characterization====

For &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Nomura agreed to direct the project largely because of his attachment to Cloud&#x27;s character. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; than in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, he did not believe that such an &quot;&#x27;upbeat&#x27; image of him is what stuck in the minds of the fans&quot;, and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind &quot;consistent with the fans&#x27; view of him&quot;. Nomura describes Cloud&#x27;s life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who Nomura sees as typically possessing character defects amounting only to quirks, he believed Cloud&#x27;s weakness to be humanizing.

Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship; by taking up his sword and fighting, Cloud struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud&#x27;s withdrawn personality by depicting him as having a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith&#x27;s name to be the last one displayed in the backlog of ignored messages that appear as Cloud&#x27;s cell phone sinks into the water, but altered the scene because it &quot;sounded too creepy&quot;. The wolf which Cloud imagines &quot;represents the deepest part of Cloud&#x27;s psyche&quot; and &quot;appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart&quot;, vanishing at the film&#x27;s end. Nomura cites one of the film&#x27;s final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud&#x27;s embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; would have had imagining Cloud&#x27;s smile.

Nomura sought to make Cloud&#x27;s design distinctly different from the other characters. About thirty different designs were made for Cloud&#x27;s face, and his hair was altered to give it a more realistic look and illustrate that two years had passed since the game&#x27;s conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game&#x27;s original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which &quot;looked gross&quot;. Further revisions were made to Cloud&#x27;s face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud&#x27;s clothes were difficult to make in the film. After deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of &quot;clothes designed for action&quot;, the staff began with the idea of a black robe, eventually parring it down to a &quot;long apron&quot; shifted to one side.

Cloud&#x27;s weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as during the film&#x27;s development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn&#x27;t &quot;logically thought out&quot; and the staff did not think that they could &quot;make it work physically&quot;, it was believed to provide &quot;an interesting accent to the story&quot;. Cloud&#x27;s new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud&#x27;s &quot;Hardy-Daytona&quot; motorcycle from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The bike got bigger as development continued, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film. In the original game, Cloud&#x27;s strongest technique was the . For his fight against Sephiroth in the film, Nomura proposed a new move, the , a faster version of the original Omnislash. The staff laughed at the name of Cloud&#x27;s move during the making of it, as Nomura was inspired by a sports move from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, whose protagonist, Tidus, explained the addition of a more specific name would make people more excited.

Themes expanded upon in the director&#x27;s cut &quot;Advent Children Complete&quot; include Cloud&#x27;s development with links to other &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; media in which he appeared. To further focus on Cloud&#x27;s growth, Square decided to give him more scenes when he interacts with children. Additionally, the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was expanded by several minutes, and includes a scene in which Sephiroth impales Cloud on his sword and holds him in the air, mirroring the scene in the game where he performs the same action. The decision to feature Cloud suffering from blood loss in the fight was made in order to make his pain feel realistic.

====&quot;Remake&quot; handling====
In the making of the fighting game &quot;Dissidia: Final Fantasy&quot;, Nomura stated that Cloud&#x27;s appearance was slightly slimmer than in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; because of the detail the 3D of the PlayStation Portable could give him. While also retaining his original design and his &quot;Advent Children&quot; appearance, Cloud was given a more distinct look based on his &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; persona.

Cloud&#x27;s initial redesign for &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; was initially more different than the original, but was later altered to more closely resemble Nomura&#x27;s original design. Early on in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Cloud crossdresses in order to find Tifa, and Nomura noted this event was popular with the fans and reassured that the remake would keep this part. On the other hand, the character designer stated that their final design was not decided yet. Kazushige Nojima worked on making Cloud&#x27;s interactions with Tifa and Barret natural. Despite fear of the possible result, Nojima also wanted players to connect with the character once again. Kitase further claimed that in the remake they aimed to make Cloud more inexperienced and informal than in &quot;Advent Children&quot;, due to him not being fully mature.

Co-director Naoki Hamaguchi noted that since the original game offered the option for the player to decide Cloud&#x27;s interest in a female character, he wanted the remake to retain this in the form of an intimate conversation when splitting from the main team.
The theme song &quot;Hollow&quot; is meant to reflect Cloud&#x27;s state of mind, with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals.

===Voice actors===

The original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; did not have voice acting. For the &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; fighting game, Kenyu Horiuchi voiced Cloud in the arcade version and Nozomu Sasaki voiced him in the home console version. Since &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Takahiro Sakurai has been the Japanese voice of Cloud, with Teruaki Sugawara, the voice director at Square, recommending him to Nomura based on prior experience. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of &quot;The Bouncer&quot;, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a character other than Cloud. For &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent&#x27;s voices because of their similar personalities. As a sequel to the highly popular &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than he did when he voiced Cloud for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive him if he did not meet their expectations.

During recording, Sakurai was told that &quot;[n]o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won&#x27;t be shaken&quot;. Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling &quot;deflated&quot;, as the &quot;exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful&quot;, with Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with straight talk. Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes.

According to Sakurai, Cloud&#x27;s silence conveys more about him than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud&#x27;s outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects. A fan of &quot;VII&quot;, Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental. After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans&#x27; response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him. While recording &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud&#x27;s scream over Zack&#x27;s death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending. Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; fan himself, he is happy to contribute.

For the remake of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Sakurai found Cloud more difficult to portray than his previous performances. He re-recorded his lines multiple times, and credited the voice director with guiding him. Nomura elaborated that the remake&#x27;s interpretation of Cloud has a distinct personality; he attempts to act cool, but often fails to do so and instead comes across as awkward, which Nomura asked Sakurai to reflect in his acting. Another challenge for the developers was finding a suitable voice for the teenage Cloud seen during flashbacks. In order to better match Cloud&#x27;s rural upbringing, they decided to hire a child from a rural area rather than an established actor, and ultimately went with 13-year-old Yukihiro Aizawa.

In most English adaptations, Cloud is voiced by Steve Burton, who was first hired to voice Cloud after a Square employee saw his role in the 2001 film &quot;The Last Castle&quot;. Burton&#x27;s work as Cloud in &quot;Advent Children&quot; served as his first feature-length role, an experience he enjoyed. Calling the character a rare opportunity for him as an actor, Burton describes Cloud as having a &quot;heaviness about him&quot;. Burton says he is surprised when fans recognize him for his work as Cloud, whom he has referred to as &quot;[one of the] coolest characters there is&quot;, and considers himself lucky to have voiced him.

Although Burton expressed his desire to voice Cloud for the remake of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, he was replaced by Cody Christian; Burton thanked Square for his work, and wished Christian luck. Christian said that he was honored to portray what he described as an iconic character, and vowed to give his best performance. He also commented on Burton&#x27;s previous work, stating, &quot;Steve, you paved the way. You made this character what it is and have contributed in shaping a legacy&quot;. Christian used Burton&#x27;s works as an inspiration for his portrayal of the character. Teenage Cloud was voiced in English by Major Dodson. For the next installment, Christian said that the character differed from &quot;Remake&quot; as he aimed to explore more his sensitive side like his past or intimate relationships he is often involved.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;===

Cloud is introduced as a mercenary employed by AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group opposed to the Shinra Company, and who claims to be formerly of SOLDIER 1st Class, an elite Shinra fighting unit. Beginning the game with the placeholder name , Cloud assists AVALANCHE&#x27;s leader, Barret Wallace, in bombing a Mako reactor, power plants which drain the planet&#x27;s &quot;Lifestream&quot;. Despite appearing detached and more interested in the pay of his work, Cloud demonstrates moments of camaraderie, such as prioritizing Jesse&#x27;s security over his escape during the Mako Reactor 1&#x27;s explosion. Players can choose to interact in a friendlier manner with AVALANCHE&#x27;s members. After being approached by his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud agrees to continue helping AVALANCHE. Cloud encounters Aerith Gainsborough, a resident of Midgar&#x27;s slums, and agrees to serve as her bodyguard in exchange for a date. He helps her evade Shinra, who are pursuing her because she is the sole survivor of a race known as the Cetra. During the course of their travels, a love triangle develops between Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith.

Following the player&#x27;s departure from Midgar, Cloud narrates his history with Sephiroth, a legendary member of SOLDIER and the game&#x27;s primary antagonist, and the events that led to his disappearance five years prior. Cloud joined SOLDIER to emulate Sephiroth, and explains that he would sign up for a &quot;big mission&quot; whenever they became available, as the conclusion of Shinra&#x27;s war with the people of Wutai ended his chances for military fame. Sephiroth started questioning his humanity after accompanying him on a job to Cloud&#x27;s hometown of Nibelheim and discovering documents concerning Jenova, an extraterrestrial lifeform and Sephiroth&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot;. This ultimately led to Sephiroth burning down Nibelheim, killing Cloud&#x27;s mother. Cloud confronted Sephiroth at Mt Nibel&#x27;s Mako Reactor and was believed to have killed him, but Cloud dismisses this as a lie, as he knows he would be no match for Sephiroth. He is troubled by the fact that although he most likely would have lost the fight, he lived after challenging Sephiroth.

However, numerous visual and audio clues suggest the unreliability of Cloud&#x27;s memory. Cloud will spontaneously remember words or scenes from his past, sometimes collapsing to the ground while cradling his head, and appears not to remember things that he should, such as the existence of a SOLDIER First Class named Zack. As Sephiroth begins manipulating his mind, he takes advantage of his memory by telling him that his past is merely fiction and that Shinra created him in an attempt to clone Sephiroth. Cloud learns he cannot remember things such as how or when he joined SOLDIER and resigns himself as a &quot;failed experiment&quot;, then goes missing. The party later discovers a comatose Cloud suffering from Mako poisoning.

It is revealed that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra&#x27;s army. During the mission to Nibelheim, he served under Sephiroth and Zack and hid his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth&#x27;s defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud managed to ambush him and throw him into the Lifestream, believing him to be dead. Both he and Zack were then imprisoned by Shinra&#x27;s lead scientist, Hojo, for four years of experimentation. Zack later escaped with Cloud to the outskirts of Midgar before Shinra soldiers gunned him down. As a result of exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova&#x27;s cells, Cloud&#x27;s mind created a false personality largely based on Zack&#x27;s, inadvertently erasing the latter from his memory. After piecing together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader and silently expresses his mutual feelings with Tifa the night before the final battle. At the game&#x27;s conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud&#x27;s mind a final time, but is defeated in a one-on-one fight.

===In &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;===
Cloud appears in a minor role in the mobile game &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, a prequel set six years before the events of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The player, a member of the Shinra covert operatives group, the Turks, encounters Cloud during his time as a Shinra infantryman working to join SOLDIER. The game portrays Cloud&#x27;s natural talent for swordsmanship, and recounts his role during Nibelheim&#x27;s destruction.

In the 2005 animated film &quot;Advent Children&quot;, which is set two years after the conclusion of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Cloud lives with Tifa in the city of Edge along with Marlene, Barret&#x27;s adopted daughter, and Denzel, an orphan affected by a rampant and deadly disease called Geostigma. Having given up his life as a mercenary, Cloud now works as a courier for the , which Tifa set up in her new bar. After Tifa confronts him following the disappearance of Denzel and Marlene, it is revealed that he also suffers from the effects of Geostigma, and he responds that he is unfit to protect his friends and new family.

However, after Tifa urges him to let go of the past, Cloud sets out for the Forgotten City in search of the children. There, he confronts Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo, genetic remnants of Sephiroth left behind before he diffused into the Lifestream completely. Cloud&#x27;s battle with Kadaj takes them back to Aerith&#x27;s church, where Cloud recovers from his Geostigma with Aerith&#x27;s help. After merging with the remains of Jenova, Kadaj, resurrects Sephiroth. Cloud, having overcome his doubts, defeats Sephiroth once more, leaving a dying Kadaj in his place. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, Cloud, seeing Aerith and Zack, assures them that he will be fine and reunites with his friends.

Cloud appears in &quot;On the Way to a Smile&quot;, a series of short stories set between &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Advent Children&quot;. &quot;Case of Tifa&quot; serves as an epilogue to &quot;VII&quot;, and portrays Cloud&#x27;s life alongside Tifa, Marlene, and Denzel. &quot;Case of Denzel&quot; relates how Cloud first met Denzel, and was later adapted as a short original video animation for the release of &quot;Advent Children Complete&quot;, &quot;On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel&quot;.

Cloud appears in a supporting role in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot;. A year after the events of &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Cloud, working alongside Barret and Tifa, lends his support to the ground forces of the World Regenesis Organization and his ally Vincent Valentine in their siege of Midgar and counterattack against the rogue Shinra military unit, Deepground.

In the PlayStation Portable game &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, Cloud is presented as a young Shinra infantryman who befriends Zack. During the game&#x27;s conclusion, a dying Zack gives Cloud his Buster Sword, telling him that he is his legacy. The game ends with Cloud heading to Midgar, reprising the start of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Zack and Cloud&#x27;s connection was meant to be expanded upon near the game&#x27;s ending, with both of them planning to flee to Midgar, but due to limitations in the console&#x27;s hardware, these scenes could not be implemented and they instead decided to focus on Zack.

Cloud reprises his role from the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in the 2020 remake, which is part of a planned trilogy of games remaking the original 1997 game. While marketed as a remake to the original 1997 game, Square claims that there are other different meanings in this game. He was featured once more as the protagonist in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;.

===In &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;===
Nomura redesigned Cloud for his appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. He is depicted with a crimson cape and a clawed version of his left-handed glove, while the Buster Sword&#x27;s blade is wrapped in bandages. Nomura stated that Cloud&#x27;s left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, and explained that he wanted to give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura also stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player&#x27;s interpretation. In the first game, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Cloud appears in the Olympus Coliseum world, with Hades hiring him to kill Hercules, and fights Sora as a prerequisite. After the fight, Hades sends Cerberus to attack Cloud and Sora, who Hercules saves. Cloud meets with Sora afterward and explains that he is searching for someone. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix&quot;, there is an additional scene where he battles Sephiroth. During the credits, Cloud is shown reuniting with the residents of Hollow Bastion. A memory-based version of Cloud appears in the Game Boy Advance sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; as a boss in the Olympus Coliseum and later as a summon card for Sora.

Cloud reappears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, depicted with his &quot;Advent Children&quot; design. He is searching for Sephiroth, and in turn Tifa is searching for him. Cloud fights alongside Leon&#x27;s team during the Heartless invasion of Hollow Bastion. Should the player choose to engage Sephiroth and win the battle, Cloud returns and fights Sephiroth, which ends with both of them disappearing in a flash of light after Tifa gives Cloud her support. Sora concludes that Cloud is still fighting with Sephiroth, and will not stop until he is defeated. A digital replica of Cloud also appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts coded&quot; in the Olympus Coliseum, helping Sora and Hercules battle Hades. Cloud also appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; manga adaptations, reprising his original role.

===In other media===
The OVA &quot;Last Order: Final Fantasy VII&quot; serves as an alternate retelling of Nibelheim&#x27;s destruction and Zack and Cloud&#x27;s escape from Shinra imprisonment. Animated and produced by Madhouse, based on a script by Kazuhiko Inukai, several scenes diverge from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; depiction of events, such as reinterpreting Cloud&#x27;s rescue of Tifa by having her view his face. Although it is associated with and makes references to the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Last Order&quot; is considered an outside work.

Cloud has also appeared in various games outside of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; continuity. He is a playable character in the PlayStation version of &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;. In &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, Cloud is a hidden character that rides a motorcycle. Cloud is one of several playable &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters in &quot;Itadaki Street Special&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. &quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot; features Cloud as a downloadable character model. Cloud is a playable character representing &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in the rhythm game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, with his &quot;Advent Children&quot; persona serving as downloadable content. Players in &quot;Final Fantasy Explorers&quot; can briefly transform into Cloud, enabling use of his Omnislash Limit Break from &quot;FFVII&quot;. Cloud is the protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VII G-Bike&quot;, a mobile game for which Nomura designed a new costume for him. This was inspired by Cloud&#x27;s &quot;Advent Children&quot; fights which producer Ichiro Hazama thought was &quot;very cool, and radical&quot;, and influences from the title went into the game. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama sought to improve Cloud&#x27;s popularity with this game.

Cloud appears as a playable guest character in the 2014 Nintendo crossover fighting games &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, sporting his character designs from both &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Advent Children&quot;. According to the games&#x27; director Masahiro Sakurai, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters were heavily requested to appear in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, with Cloud receiving the most support out of all of them. Reflecting on his inclusion in an interview with Tetsuya Nomura, while other characters from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series were considered, Sakurai ultimately felt that none of them could match Cloud&#x27;s popularity and he could not imagine including a different character. His model was primarily based on his appearance in the &quot;Dissidia&quot; series, with slight alterations under Nomura&#x27;s supervision. He was made available as in-game downloadable content alongside a stage based on Midgar in December 2015. A pair of Cloud amiibo figures were released in July 2017. He returns as a playable character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018), and is now playable in the game&#x27;s base roster. As part of the update adding Sephiroth to the game as downloadable content in December 2020, Cloud was given his &quot;Omnislash Ver. 5&quot; to use against opponents, being exclusive to his &quot;Advent Children&quot; costumes.

Cloud was considered for inclusion as a guest character in the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Soulcalibur II&quot;, but this did not come to pass, with Heihachi Mishima from &quot;Tekken&quot; taking the spot instead.

In the PlayStation game &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and its PlayStation Portable update, &quot;The War of the Lions&quot;, Cloud is accidentally pulled into the world of Ivalice by an ancient machine called &quot;the Celestial Globe&quot;, which was activated by Ramza Beoulve. Cloud is disoriented after arriving in Ramza&#x27;s world, and after a short exchange with Ramza and the others, he leaves. He wanders into Zarghidas Trade City, where he encounters a flower girl named Aerith. As Cloud is leaving the area, Aerith is accosted by a man demanding payment. Cloud returns to help Aerith escape, and Ramza and his party catch up to him. After the battle, he joins Ramza&#x27;s party as a playable character. Cloud also appears as an enemy unit in the &quot;Brave Story&quot; series of battles as part of Rendezvous, the unlockable cooperative multiplayer mode in &quot;The War of the Lions&quot;.

Cloud serves as the representative hero of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, a fighting game featuring characters from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He is depicted in his &quot;FFVII&quot; design, while his &quot;Advent Children&quot; design is also available. His fight against Sephiroth in this game is based on their battles from &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;Advent Children&quot;. Along with the entire cast, Cloud reappears in the prequel &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; as a Warrior of Chaos. Concerned for Tifa, who is on the opposing side, Cloud tries to defeat Chaos alone; after nearly being killed, he is saved by the goddess Cosmos, and becomes one of her warriors. Cloud&#x27;s main outfit is based on Yoshitaka Amano&#x27;s original artwork concept, while his &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; outfit is offered as downloadable content. Cloud again appears as a playable character opposite Sephiroth in the series&#x27; third entry, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;, wearing his &quot;Advent Children&quot; outfit. The development staff worked carefully to translate Cloud&#x27;s original moves from his previous role, most notably his swordplay Omnislash which was developed to be his strongest move.

Although Cloud does not appear in &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, his &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; attire appears as an alternative for the main character alongside the Buster Sword. The &quot;Advent Children&quot; outfit is also present in &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;. Cloud&#x27;s original attire is also present in the mobile phone game &quot;Mobius Final Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy Explorers-Force&quot;.

==Legacy==
Cloud has been merchandised extensively, in many different forms, including figurines and jewelry. In commemoration of the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; protagonists. Square Enix&#x27;s manager of merchandise, Kanji Tashiro, said at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con that Cloud&#x27;s likeness has produced some of the company&#x27;s best-selling items, and that fans could look forward to further adaptations of the character in the future. Popular models at the time included Cloud&#x27;s &quot;Advent Children&quot; figurine and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; Hardy-Daytona bike set, both of which sold particularly well in European and North American markets. Square has also released two promotional books primarily focusing on Cloud&#x27;s character: &quot;Cloud vol.1&quot;, which was released in 2007, and &quot;Cloud message&quot;, in 2008. In 2013, a replica of the Buster Sword was created by blacksmith Tony Swatton for the webseries &quot;Man at Arms&quot;.

===Critical reception===

Cloud has been mostly well received by critics. In his review of the PC release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Ron Dulin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that &quot;a simple understatement will have to suffice: Cloud is easily the most interesting and complex character ever presented in a game&quot;. &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Aujang Abadi called Cloud &quot;one of the most complex characters Square has created&quot;, as well as &quot;the first truly complicated main character&quot;. Sharon Packer identifies Cloud as having mental illness in the form of dissociative identity disorder (DID), while Katie Whitlock identifies him as having involuntary memory resulting from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The book &quot;Japanese Culture Through Videogames&quot; addresses Cloud as a complex fictional character, comparing him with &quot;Metal Gear&quot;″s Solid Snake, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s Terra Branford, and &quot;Tekken&quot;″s Jin Kazama due to his identity issues. Kurt Kalata of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; stated that Cloud is &quot;somewhat of a weakling&quot; with grandiose delusions and other psychological issues. He also called Cloud one of the first unreliable narrators in a role-playing video game. According to Patrick Holleman, &quot;no RPG has ever deliberately betrayed the connection between protagonist and player like &quot;FFVII&quot; does&quot;. The game&#x27;s use of the unreliable narrator literary concept has drawn comparisons to films such as &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000), and &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), with Patrick Holleman and Jeremy Parish arguing that the game takes the unreliable narrator concept a step further, by its interactivity establishing a connection between the player and the protagonist. Jack Ridsdale of &quot;PCGamesN&quot; argues that Cloud is a deconstruction of the hero archetype and toxic masculinity, and compares the plot twist about his true identity to that of &quot;Fight Club&quot;. In Alana Hagues from RPGFan said Cloud&#x27;s shock when Sephiroth kills Aertih has a major impact on her as Cloud properly expresses depression over death, something no video game has ever done to her. While Cloud is never addressed as a God, he has to protect the peace as Sephiroth plays the role of Satan and his Shadow, with Cloud having to surpass him in the narrative.

Cloud&#x27;s respective relationships with Aerith and Tifa were also popular with writers. The popularity of both relationships, how they were written and their partial ties to the original game&#x27;s affinity mechanics have led to multiple instances of fan creations, fandom debates and &quot;ship wars&quot;, with many debating and arguing topics ranging from Tifa and Aerith&#x27;s compatibility with Cloud to the canonicity and intent of his feelings towards either heroine through story and character analysis and authorial or supplemental materials (such as the Ultimanias, developer interviews and tie-in novels) across much of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; in the years since the original game&#x27;s release. &quot;RPGamer&quot; writer Marie Freed states that she saw Tifa&#x27;s loyalty and love for Cloud, even in the light of having to relive her own traumas, as admirable, and a welcome contrast to the &quot;destined&quot; romance seen in previous title &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Siliconera writer Cory Dinkel claims that &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; ultimately has no love triangle by the end due to multiple story and character developments and revelations surrounding the characters involved and that
Cloud and Tifa&#x27;s relationship is the truly canonical romance despite the suggested complexity surrounding it in the sequel film &quot;Advent Children&quot;. These particular relationship aspects as well as other facets spanning the entire main cast of the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; franchise were given more prominence within the character writing and story of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, with the latter specifically having a major emphasis on bonds through expanded characterization and more apparent affinity mechanics as well as the revamped Gold Saucer dates tied to them; An aspect that has also sparked further analysis and discourse on the nature of Cloud&#x27;s relationships. 

Cloud&#x27;s redesign in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was praised as being the best in the game by &quot;Animefringe&quot;.
His development in &quot;Advent Children&quot; was praised by &quot;DVD Talk&quot; as one of the best parts from the film. In regards to the remains of Midgar from &quot;Advent Children&quot;, Destructoid noted the message within its writing regarding the characters&#x27; lives in Midgar, as its people are able to move on with their lives, but Cloud is unable to due to past trauma over Aerith&#x27;s death. Kotaku saw the focus on Midgar&#x27;s ruins as a parallel with psychological trauma due to how some of its survivors suffer from Geostigma, a disease that cannot be fought physically. &quot;Joystiq&quot;″s Andrew Yoon opined that the director&#x27;s cut version of the film provides more depth to Cloud&#x27;s development, taking advantage of its longer runtime by better &quot;humanizing [him]&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; stated that while Cloud felt like a &quot;miserable&quot; character in the film, him coming to terms with his past was appealing alongside his new swords stored in his bike. Yoshinori Kitase said that the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was popular enough to make Japanese gamers do a remake of it in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and expected Western fans would also emulate it. Meristation praised Cloud&#x27;s new appearance in &quot;Advent Children&quot; and how it came across appealing in the spin-off &quot;Dirge of Cerberus,&quot; despite him having less screentime due to the narrative focusing on Vincent.

When deciding on using a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; representative for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, Nomura and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series creator and director Masahiro Sakurai quickly agreed with adding Cloud to the cast. This was mostly because of Cloud&#x27;s high popularity within the series in contrast to other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters like Bartz or Terra, and multiple requests from fans of the character. According to Sakurai, he envisioned Cloud as being a relatively easy to play character in anticipation of a large variety of players using him, and stated that the Buster Sword served as a lynchpin in regard to developing his sword swings. Cloud&#x27;s popularity and addition to the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series generated multiple response, most notably in Twitter&#x27;s trends. Although &quot;The Verge&quot; pointed out that the series had featured other third-party characters like Solid Snake, Mega Man, and Sonic the Hedgehog, they nevertheless expressed surprise over Cloud&#x27;s inclusion because of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;″s lack of release on a Nintendo console. Despite that, he was well received.

During anticipation for the remake of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Cloud&#x27;s role in the trailers were the focus of multiple journalists. &quot;IGN&quot; highly praised the design and marketing involving his visual appearance. &quot;TechSpot&quot; noted fans were interested in Cloud&#x27;s love interests but claimed that Cloud&#x27;s relationship with Aerith was subtle in retrospective. Despite noting his antisocial and aloof attitudes in the remake, In a feature article, &quot;GameSpot&quot; compared Cloud with Kazuma Kiryu from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Yakuza&quot; video game series due to both sharing similar features and development across the narrative through Midgar&#x27;s cities as both protagonists have a tendency to help civilians. When it comes to &quot;Rebirth&quot;, Digital Trend saw Cloud&#x27;s failures to save Aerith as a story about dealing with trauma as the returning player find a possible way to stop Aerith&#x27;s death like Cloud attempts and instead ends in tragedy again. Cloud&#x27;s rivalry with Sephiroth was also the subject of praise in &quot;Rebirth&quot; as it allows two characters be allies before the latter becomes the antagonist while the former comes across as a rookie in comparison.

For his performance as Cloud in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, Cody Christian received a nomination for &quot;Performer in a Leading Role&quot; at the 17th British Academy Games Awards. For the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards, Christian won &quot;Best Lead Performer&quot; for his work as Cloud in &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.&quot; 

===Cultural impact===
Cloud set a trend in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series in regards to the characterization of main characters. Following &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Nomura designed Squall Leonhart, the lead of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; giving him a similar anti-hero persona. Tasked with creating a &quot;female version of Cloud&quot; for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, Nomura designed Lightning with Cloud&#x27;s success in mind, stating that he &quot;desired for her to be ... loved for a long time, like Cloud&quot;. After Lightning was voted as the most popular female character in the series by Japanese fans, Mollie Patterson of &quot;EGMNOW&quot; commented: &quot;Some have also brought up that Lightning is kind of the female equivalent to Cloud, which might be why she gets so much love&quot;. However, for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, the staff aimed for a more contrasting hero would act more cheerful in the narrative, Tidus. Similarly, Nomura created Noctis Lucis Caelum from &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; with another different characterization from Cloud and Squall&#x27;s and instead more insecure. When the game &quot;Nier&quot; failed to be a success in North America despite portraying an elder as a protagonist to appeal to Westerns, director Yoko Taro convinced other staff members to use instead a younger type for the English remaster version, using Cloud as an influence.

&quot;IGN&quot; stated that Cloud set a trend for role-playing video game heroes, describing his &quot;spiky blond hair&quot; and &quot;gigantic Buster Sword&quot; as &quot;instantly identifiable icons, recognized by gamers around the world&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; described Cloud as an example of &quot;excellent design and characterization&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; in 2010 published a seven-page tribute to Cloud, showcasing his many appearances throughout the years. He was named best character of all time in &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot;″s 2007 &quot;Den-Play Awards&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; published a video titled &quot;Greatest Game Hero: Cloud Strife&quot; for his inclusion in their 2009 &quot;All Time Greatest Game Hero&quot; poll, showcasing scenes of Cloud as he appears in &quot;Advent Children&quot;.

<doc id="289666" wikidata="Q118084" url="?curid=289666" title="Unit (ring theory)">
<text>In algebra, a unit or invertible element of a ring is an invertible element for the multiplication of the ring. That is, an element of a ring is a unit if there exists in such that
formula_1
where is the multiplicative identity; the element is unique for this property and is called the multiplicative inverse of . The set of units of forms a group under multiplication, called the group of units or unit group of . Other notations for the unit group are , , and (from the German term ).

Less commonly, the term &quot;unit&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the element of the ring, in expressions like &quot;ring with a unit&quot; or &quot;unit ring&quot;, and also unit matrix. Because of this ambiguity, is more commonly called the &quot;unity&quot; or the &quot;identity&quot; of the ring, and the phrases &quot;ring with unity&quot; or a &quot;ring with identity&quot; may be used to emphasize that one is considering a ring instead of a rng.

== Examples ==
The multiplicative identity and its additive inverse are always units. More generally, any root of unity in a ring is a unit: if , then is a multiplicative inverse of .
In a nonzero ring, the element 0 is not a unit, so is not closed under addition.
A nonzero ring in which every nonzero element is a unit (that is, ) is called a division ring (or a skew-field). A commutative division ring is called a field. For example, the unit group of the field of real numbers is .

=== Integer ring ===
In the ring of integers , the only units are and .

In the ring of integers modulo, the units are the congruence classes represented by integers coprime to . They constitute the multiplicative group of integers modulo.

=== Ring of integers of a number field ===
In the ring obtained by adjoining the quadratic integer to , one has , so is a unit, and so are its powers, so has infinitely many units.

More generally, for the ring of integers in a number field , Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem states that is isomorphic to the group 
formula_2
where formula_3 is the (finite, cyclic) group of roots of unity in and , the rank of the unit group, is
formula_4
where formula_5 are the number of real embeddings and the number of pairs of complex embeddings of , respectively.

This recovers the example: The unit group of (the ring of integers of) a real quadratic field is infinite of rank 1, since formula_6.

=== Polynomials and power series ===
For a commutative ring , the units of the polynomial ring are the polynomials
formula_7
such that is a unit in and the remaining coefficients formula_8 are nilpotent, i.e., satisfy formula_9 for some .
In particular, if is a domain (or more generally reduced), then the units of are the units of .
The units of the power series ring formula_10 are the power series
formula_11
such that is a unit in .

=== Matrix rings ===
The unit group of the ring of matrices over a ring is the group of invertible matrices. For a commutative ring , an element of is invertible if and only if the determinant of is invertible in . In that case, can be given explicitly in terms of the adjugate matrix.

=== In general ===
For elements and in a ring , if formula_12 is invertible, then formula_13 is invertible with inverse formula_14; this formula can be guessed, but not proved, by the following calculation in a ring of noncommutative power series:
formula_15
See Hua&#x27;s identity for similar results.

== Group of units ==
A commutative ring is a local ring if is a maximal ideal.

As it turns out, if is an ideal, then it is necessarily a maximal ideal and is local since a maximal ideal is disjoint from .

If is a finite field, then is a cyclic group of order .

Every ring homomorphism induces a group homomorphism , since maps units to units. In fact, the formation of the unit group defines a functor from the category of rings to the category of groups. This functor has a left adjoint which is the integral group ring construction.

The group scheme formula_16 is isomorphic to the multiplicative group scheme formula_17 over any base, so for any commutative ring , the groups formula_18 and formula_19 are canonically isomorphic to . Note that the functor formula_17 (that is, ) is representable in the sense: formula_21 for commutative rings (this for instance follows from the aforementioned adjoint relation with the group ring construction). Explicitly this means that there is a natural bijection between the set of the ring homomorphisms formula_22 and the set of unit elements of (in contrast, formula_23 represents the additive group formula_24, the forgetful functor from the category of commutative rings to the category of abelian groups).

== Associatedness ==
Suppose that is commutative. Elements and of are called &quot;&quot; if there exists a unit in such that ; then write . In any ring, pairs of additive inverse elements and are associate, since any ring includes the unit . For example, 6 and −6 are associate in . In general, is an equivalence relation on .

Associatedness can also be described in terms of the action of on via multiplication: Two elements of are associate if they are in the same -orbit.

In an integral domain, the set of associates of a given nonzero element has the same cardinality as .

The equivalence relation can be viewed as any one of Green&#x27;s semigroup relations specialized to the multiplicative semigroup of a commutative ring .

<text>Anthony of Sourozh (, secular name Andrei Borisovich Bloom, and commonly known as Anthony Bloom; 19 June 1914 – 4 August 2003) was best known as a writer and broadcaster on prayer and the Christian life. He was a monk and bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church. He was founder and for many years bishop - then archbishop, then metropolitan - of the Diocese of Sourozh, the Patriarchate of Moscow&#x27;s diocese for Great Britain and Ireland (the name &#x27;Sourozh&#x27; is that of the historical episcopal see in Sudak in Crimea). As a bishop he became well known as a pastor, preacher, spiritual director and writer on prayer and the Christian life.
==Early life==
Andrei Bloom was born on 19 June 1914, in Lausanne, Switzerland, to Xenia and Boris Edvardovich Bloom. His mother was the half sister of the composer Alexander Scriabin.

He spent his early childhood in Russia and Iran. During the Russian Revolution the family had to leave Iran, and by 1923 they were settled in Paris, where he was educated. He graduated in physics, chemistry and biology, and took his doctorate in medicine at the University of Paris.

By his own words, he met Christ, when he was a teenager:

&quot;I met Christ as a Person at a moment when I needed him in order to live, and at a moment when I was not in search of him. I was found; I did not find him&quot;.

&quot;I was a teenager then. Life had been difficult in the early years and now it had of a sudden become easier. All the years when life had been hard I had found it natural, if not easy, to fight; but when life became easy and happy I was faced quite unexpectedly with a problem: I could not accept aimless happiness. Hardships and suffering had to be overcome, there was something beyond them. Happiness seemed to be stale if it had no further meaning&quot;.

&quot;As it often happens when you are young and when you act with passion, bent to possess either everything or nothing, I decided that I would give myself a year to see whether life had a meaning, and if I discovered it had none I would not live beyond the year...&quot;--

==Career==
In 1939, before leaving for the front as a surgeon in the French Army, he secretly professed monastic vows in the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1943 he was tonsured and received the name of Antony. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany he worked as a doctor, and took part in the French Resistance.

After the war he continued practising as a physician until 1948, when he was ordained to the presbyterate and sent to Britain to serve as Orthodox Christian chaplain of the Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius, a society established to foster understanding and friendship between the Russian Orthodox and Anglican churches. In 1950 he was appointed vicar of the Russian Patriarchal parish in London.

In 1957 he was consecrated as bishop, and as archbishop in 1962 in charge of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh.

In 1963 he was appointed exarch of the Moscow Patriarchate in Western Europe, and in 1966 was assigned the rank of metropolitan bishop.

In 1974 by mutual agreement he was released from the function of exarch, in order to devote himself more fully to the pastoral needs of the growing flock of his diocese. Between 1966 and 1986 he brought out six books on prayer.

In mid 2003, Bloom resigned as diocesan bishop. He died on 4 August 2003. His grave in the Brompton Cemetery, London, is visited by Christians and many others.

==Honours==
Bloom received honorary doctorates from the University of Aberdeen (&quot;for preaching the Word of God and renewing the spiritual life of this country&quot;); from the Moscow Theological Academy for his theological, pastoral and preaching work; from the University of Cambridge; and from the Kiev Theological Academy.

==Writings==
His books were published in English in Britain. His texts were subsequently widely published in Russia as books and in periodicals.

<doc id="289669" wikidata="Q246462" url="?curid=289669" title="Cedar Walton">
<text>Cedar Anthony Walton Jr. (January 17, 1934 – August 19, 2013) was an American hard bop jazz pianist. He came to prominence as a member of drummer Art Blakey&#x27;s band, The Jazz Messengers, before establishing a long career as a bandleader and composer. Several of his compositions have become jazz standards, including &quot;Mosaic&quot;, &quot;Bolivia&quot;, &quot;Holy Land&quot;, &quot;Mode for Joe&quot; and &quot;Ugetsu/Fantasy in D&quot;.

== Early life ==
Walton was born and grew up in Dallas, Texas. His mother Ruth, an aspiring concert pianist, was his first teacher, and took him to jazz performances around Dallas. Walton cited Nat King Cole, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk and Art Tatum as his major influences on piano. He began emulating these artists&#x27; recordings from an early age.

After briefly attending Dillard University in New Orleans, he entered the University of Denver as a composition major, but was encouraged to switch to a music-education program with the goal of a career in the local public school system. This later proved extremely useful, as he learned to play and arrange for various instruments, a talent he honed with Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers.

Walton was tempted by the promise of New York City through his associations with John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Richie Powell, whom he met at after-hours sessions around Denver, Colorado. In 1955, he decided to leave school and drove with a friend to New York City. He quickly got recognition from Johnny Garry, who ran Birdland at the time.

== Later life and career ==
Walton was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed in Germany, cutting short his rising status in the after-hours jazz scene. In the Army he played with musicians Leo Wright, Don Ellis and Eddie Harris. On his discharge after two years, he picked up where he left off, playing as a sideman with Kenny Dorham, on whose 1958 album &quot;This Is the Moment!&quot;, he made his recording debut. He joined the Jazztet led by Benny Golson and Art Farmer and played with them from 1958 to 1961. In April 1959 he recorded an alternate take of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; with John Coltrane, though he did not solo. In the early 1960s Walton joined Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers as a pianist-arranger (on the same day Freddie Hubbard joined the group), where, for the next three years, he wrote and arranged such originals as &quot;Ugetsu&quot; and &quot;Mosaic&quot;.

He left the Messengers in 1964 and by the late 1960s was part of the house rhythm section at Prestige Records. In addition to releasing his own recordings there, he recorded with Sonny Criss, Pat Martino, Eric Kloss, and Charles McPherson. For a year, he was Abbey Lincoln&#x27;s accompanist, and recorded with Lee Morgan from 1966 to 1968. In the mid-1970s he led the funk group Mobius. He arranged and recorded for Etta James from the mid-1990s on, helping her win a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album for &quot;Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday&quot; (RCA Victor) in 1994.

Many of Walton&#x27;s compositions have become jazz standards, including &quot;Firm Roots&quot;, &quot;Bolivia&quot; (perhaps his best known), &quot;Holy Land&quot;, &quot;Mode for Joe&quot; and &quot;Cedar&#x27;s Blues&quot;. One of his oldest compositions is &quot;Fantasy in D&quot;, recorded as &quot;Ugetsu&quot; by Art Blakey in 1963, and as &quot;Polar AC&quot; by Freddie Hubbard, first in 1971.

In January 2010, Walton was inducted as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master.

== Billy Higgins partnership and The Magic Triangle ==
Walton played and recorded with drummer Billy Higgins from the mid-1960s through the 1990s. Higgins and Walton first recorded together in 1965 for Eddie Harris&#x27;s &quot;The In Sound&quot; LP, and Higgins played on Walton&#x27;s first album, Cedar! (1967). They continued to play and record together regularly through the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s, bassist Sam Jones formed a working trio, The Magic Triangle, with Walton and Higgins. They recorded albums under both Walton&#x27;s and Jones&#x27;s leadership, and played on several 1970s albums by Art Farmer and Clifford Jordan (including Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Glass Bead Games&quot; and Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Art Farmer Quintet at Boomers&quot;). Though they did not record as The Magic Triangle, Jordan&#x27;s albums &quot;Clifford Jordan and the Magic Triangle on Stage&quot;, &quot;Firm Roots&quot;, and &quot;The Highest Mountain&quot; cited the trio&#x27;s informal name. They also backed up Hank Mobley, Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, and Idrees Sulieman in the 1970s on live and studio recordings. Drummer Louis Hayes sometimes replaced Higgins during this period for recordings and live performances.

In 1975, The Magic Triangle became the core of the Eastern Rebellion jazz collective, which featured (at different times) saxophonists George Coleman, Bob Berg and Ralph Moore, trombonist Curtis Fuller, and trumpeter Alfredo &quot;Chocolate&quot; Armenteros. Eastern Rebellion released seven albums between 1975 and 1994, all featuring Walton and Higgins.

Sam Jones died in late 1981, and Walton and Higgins carried on with bassist David &quot;Happy&quot; Williams, who also joined them on the four final Eastern Rebellion recordings. Walton, Williams, and Higgins recorded regularly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s under Walton&#x27;s leadership. Walton and Higgins also appeared on recordings by Freddie Hubbard, Stanley Turrentine, Slide Hampton, Junior Cook, Bobby Hutcherson, Frank Morgan, and Jackie McLean (sometimes with other bassists in place of Williams).

With bassist Ron Carter, Walton and Higgins recorded two live albums in 1991 at the Sweet Basil Jazz Club as the Sweet Basil Trio. A third Sweet Basil Trio record, this time with Williams on bass, was recorded in 1993.

Writing of The Magic Triangle&#x27;s collaborations with Clifford Jordan, pianist and essayist Ethan Iverson wrote: &quot;Taken as a collection, the Jordan–Walton canon from the seventies is some of the best jazz ever recorded...If I had to pick only one from that collaboration for a desert isle, it would be Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Mark VII&quot;.&quot;

== Death ==
After a brief illness, Walton died on August 19, 2013, at his home in Brooklyn, New York, at age 79.

<text>The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder, CU, or Colorado) is a public research university in Boulder, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1876, five months before Colorado became a state, it is the flagship university of the University of Colorado system. CU Boulder is a member of the Association of American Universities, considered a Public Ivy and is classified among R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity. 

The university consists of nine colleges and schools and offers over 150 academic programs, enrolling more than 35,000 students as of January 2022. In 2021, the university attracted the support of over $634 million for research and spent $536 million on research and development according to the National Science Foundation, ranking it 50th in the nation. It receives the most NASA astrophysics technology grants of all academic institutions and is the only university in the world that has sent instruments to all planets in the solar system.

The Colorado Buffaloes compete in 17 varsity sports and are members of the NCAA Division I Big 12 Conference. The Buffaloes have won 28 national championships: 20 in skiing, seven total in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, and one in football. The university has produced 10 Olympic medalists. Alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 12 Nobel Prize laureates (of whom 5 were affiliated with the university when the prizes were awarded), 10 Pulitzer Prize winners, 11 MacArthur &quot;Genius Grant&quot; recipients, 1 Turing Award laureate, 20 astronauts and 2 associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

==History==
On March 14, 1876, the Colorado territorial legislature passed an amendment to the state constitution that provided money for the establishment of the University of Colorado in Boulder, the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, and the Colorado Agricultural College in Fort Collins.

Two cities competed for the site of the University of Colorado: Boulder and Cañon City. The consolation prize for the losing city was to be the home to the new Colorado State Prison. Cañon City was at a disadvantage as it was already the home of the Colorado Territorial Prison (there are now six prisons in the Cañon City area).

The cornerstone of the building that became Old Main was laid on September 20, 1875. The doors of the university opened on September 5, 1877. At the time, there were few high schools in the state that could adequately prepare students for university work, so in addition to the university, a preparatory school was formed on campus. In the fall of 1877, the student body consisted of 15 students in the college proper and 50 students in the preparatory school. There were 38 men and 27 women, and their ages ranged from 12 to 23 years.

During World War II, Colorado was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.

CU hired its first female professor, Mary Rippon, in 1878. It hired its first African-American professor, Charles H. Nilon, in 1956, and its first African-American librarian, Mildred Nilon, in 1962. Its first African American female graduate, Lucile Berkeley Buchanan, received her degree in 1918.

==Campus==

The main CU Boulder campus is located south of the Pearl Street Mall and east of Chautauqua Auditorium. It consists of academic and residential buildings as well as research facilities. The East Campus is about a quarter-mile from the main campus and is composed mainly of athletic fields and research buildings.
CU Boulder&#x27;s campus has been ranked as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; and &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;.

===Architecture===
CU Boulder&#x27;s distinctive architecture style, known as Tuscan Vernacular Revival, was designed by architect Charles Klauder. The oldest buildings, such as Old Main (1876) and Macky Auditorium (1923), were in the Collegiate Gothic style of many East Coast schools, and Klauder&#x27;s initial plans for the university&#x27;s new buildings (approved in 1919) were in the same style. A month or so after approval, however, Klauder updated his design by sketching in a new wrap of rough, textured sandstone walls with sloping, multi-leveled red-tiled roofs and Indiana limestone trim. This formed the basis of a unified style, used in the design of fifteen other buildings between 1921 and 1939 and still followed on the campus to this day. The sandstone used in the construction of nearly all the buildings on campus was selected from a variety of Front Range mountain quarries.

===Residence halls===
Currently, freshmen and others attending the University of Colorado Boulder have an option of 24 on- and off-campus residence halls. Residence halls have 17 varieties of room types from singles to four-person rooms and others with apartment-style amenities. There are several communities of residence halls located throughout the campus, as well as in a separate area called Williams Village which is located approximately 1.5 miles off of the main campus. There is a free bus service that transports students to the main campus from Williams Village and vice versa. The university also offers Residential Academic Programs (RAPS) in many of its Residence Halls. RAPs provide students with in-dorm classes tailored to academic interests (international affairs, environmental studies, etc.).

===Engineering Center===
The Engineering Center on the North-East side of campus houses the nation&#x27;s largest geotechnical centrifuge as well as ion-implantation and microwave-propagation facilities, spectrometers, electron and other microscopes, and a structural analysis facility. In 2021, the Rustandy Building joined the Engineering Center to the Koelbel Building, in order to increase collaboration with the School of Business.

===Norlin Library===

Until 1903, the library collection was housed with the rest of the school in Old Main. The growing size of the library required a move, as the weight of the books was causing physical damage to the floor. The cornerstone for the first separate library building was laid in January 1903, and the building was opened in January 1904. When the new Norlin Library opened in 1940, the old library was turned over to the Theatre department and was converted into classrooms and a theatre.

Norlin Library was the last building to be designed by Klauder. There are two inscriptions on the western face of the building, overlooking the Norlin Quadrangle. Both were composed by President Norlin. The larger inscription reads &quot;Who knows only his own generation remains always a child,&quot; based on a Cicero quotation, while the smaller inscription on the marble just over the door reads &quot;Enter here the timeless fellowship of the human spirit.&quot;

===Macky Auditorium===
Macky Auditorium is a large building on the north edge of the University of Colorado campus, near 17th Street and University Avenue, which plays host to various talks, plays, and musical performances. Andrew J. Macky was a prominent businessman involved with the town of Boulder in the late 19th century. Macky served as the president, as well as a stockholder of the First National Bank, an institution founded by another early CU supporter, Lewis Cheney. Macky is credited with a number of landmarks throughout Boulder, where he was a carpenter and involved in politics.

The Auditorium opened its doors in 1923, thirteen years after construction started. Macky&#x27;s adopted daughter, May, sued for a third of Macky&#x27;s estate, a case that took thirteen years to settle. May was angered that her father left her no money in his will while leaving $300,000 to CU for the hall&#x27;s construction. The university eventually won the case, and the majority of critical construction on the building resumed.

The building has a variety of architectural elements from various buildings around the globe that President James Baker, CU&#x27;s president at the turn of the 20th century, admired. The design of the auditorium is primarily Neo-Gothic, with the primary materials being sandstone and red tile, like the rest of campus. The result is a unique building, with two large towers and sprawling ivy, that sets itself apart from the rest of the CU campus. Macky was refurbished in 1986, with improved seating, custom carpeting, modern plumbing, and an elevator. Currently, there is an electronic bell system in the towers of Macky which rings the hours during the day.

Macky is the home of two departments both in the College of Music, the Jazz Studies Department and the Choral Department, and it houses an art gallery that is open Wednesdays, and to patrons during performances. The hall houses almost all performances by the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra, the Artist Series, and the CU Opera. Macky is also the home of many lectures including part of the Conference on World Affairs held at CU each spring.

===University Memorial Center===

In 1947, Colorado Governor Lee Knous issued a proclamation to create a memorial to Colorado&#x27;s servicemen at the University of Colorado Boulder. A proposal to house this memorial in a student union building resulted in a remarkable fundraising effort. The University Memorial Center (UMC) opened its doors in October 1953 with President Robert Stearns presiding over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The UMC quickly became the central landmark of the Boulder campus. A 1964 addition created a new bookstore, conference facilities, additional dining facilities, and offices to house the rapidly growing student activities and organizations. The expansion was financed through bonds granted by student fees.

The 1960s and &#x27;70s put the UMC at the center of student activism as students staged strikes, grape boycotts, love-ins, sit-ins, and walk-outs. The UMC Fountain Court (now the Dalton Trumbo Fountain Court) became a familiar sight to network television news watchers as the famous and notorious promoted their cause at CU Boulder. Entertainers as diverse as Ramsey Lewis and the Grateful Dead have performed in the Glenn Miller Ballroom. The UMC Connection, a student entertainment center in the basement, is a more informal gathering place, featuring pool tables and a small bowling alley. It also features Club 156, which hosts concerts from local and up-and-coming bands. In 1986, students passed another bond issue to remodel the food services area. The Alferd Packer Grill gets its name from Alferd Packer, a Colorado prospector accused of cannibalism.

===Center for Community===
The Center for Community, also known as the C4C by students, follows the distinct architecture guidelines of Charles Klauder and is a facility that is promised to be 20 percent to 25 percent more energy- and water-efficient compared to similar-sized buildings. The facility was completed in September 2010 at a cost of $84.4 million. The building is originally bond-financed through the CU treasurer and will be repaid through a combination of sources. A large portion of the debt, $47.4 million, will be repaid by Housing and Dining Services, through room and board fees. Fees from Permit and Parking Services will contribute as well. The center also relies on $18 million in donations, a goal which has not been achieved, but has become a top fundraising priority for the university.

The building houses offices of Student Services including Campus Card Services, Disability Services, and Career Services among others. These services have been relocated to the C4C from various locations around campus. For example, Career Services was previously housed in the basement of the Willard Dormitory. There is a underground parking structure that contains approximately 365 to 375 parking spaces. Student study areas are located on the upper floors and conference centers are open to campus and non-campus affiliates throughout the building. The dining services offered within the C4C include a CU on the run &quot;grab-n-go&quot;, The Bakery, a late-night dining hub called the Weather Tech Café, open until 2 A.M., and finally a central dining facility. This dining facility seats 900 and offers students up to nine specialty dining choices including Persian, Asian, Latin, sushi, Italian, Kosher, a grill, salad bars, and desserts. Overall the Dining Center is projected to serve around one million meals per year.

===Recreation Center===
In 1973 the student recreation center was built on the CU Boulder&#x27;s main campus, by the architect James Wallace. The funding to build the recreation center came entirely from student fees, which also funded the expansions in 1990 and 2014. The recreation center features strength and cardio space, basketball/volleyball courts, the only ice rink in Boulder proper, lap pool, dive well, fitness studios (cycling, rowing, etc.), climbing gym, turf gym, and an iconic outdoor pool in the shape of the CU Boulder buffalo mascot. It is currently about and operates on a $5 million annual budget. The center is co-managed by the division of student affairs and CUSG, CU Boulder&#x27;s student government. It is located on the northern edge of campus next to Folsom Field. It is open seven days a week and on average 16 hours a day with most of its facilities available for use during those hours.

===Mary Rippon Theatre===

The Mary Rippon Theatre is an outdoor theater and the site of many cultural events, notably the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. The Theatre was named after Professor Mary Rippon, the first female instructor at the university and one of the first female university instructors in the United States. She taught English grammar, German, French and mathematics.

==Academics==

The University of Colorado Boulder is divided into several colleges and schools. While the college of Arts and Sciences is by far the largest, the university also consists of the college of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Program in Environmental Design, Education, Music, Law, and the Leeds School of Business, plus a new College of Media, Communication, and Information that debuted in 2014. Most, if not all, of these colleges and schools, also incorporate master- and doctorate-level degree programs. At the university, there are currently approximately 3,400 courses available in over 150 disciplines making up 85 majors ranging from Accounting to Women&#x27;s Studies.

University of Colorado School of Law is the smallest and most selective of the colleges. The Wolf Law Building, the new home of the Law School, was dedicated on September 8, 2006, by United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer.

The Leeds School of Business has an enrollment of 3,300 students including undergraduates, master&#x27;s candidates, and Ph.D. candidates. The undergraduate program ranks 39th in the country and the undergraduate entrepreneurship program ranks 14th in the nation. The MBA program ranks 26th among all public universities. The faculty are ranked 38th in the nation according to the &quot;Academy of Management Journal&quot;.

CU Boulder adopted an honor code in 2000 following growing concerns about academic dishonesty on campus in the late 1990s. A copy of the code stating &quot;On my honor, as a University of Colorado Boulder student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work&quot; is engraved on a metal plate and posted in every classroom on campus.

Undergraduates who seek an academic challenge may participate in CU&#x27;s Honors Program. Begun in 1931, the Honors Program currently consists of the top ten percent of incoming freshmen and participating undergraduates with a 3.3 GPA or greater (on a 4.0 scale). The program offers over 40 honors classes each semester taught by tenured or tenure-track professors and limited to class sizes of 17 students. Honors students also have the opportunity to graduate with honors, high honors, and highest honors, by writing and defending a thesis during their senior year. The program extends into the residence halls through the Kittredge Honors Program. The Presidents Leadership Class is a program for top scholars at the University of Colorado Boulder. Scholars participate in a four-year leadership development program. The program provides opportunities to the top fifty students at CU from every major and discipline.

One option for students (mostly freshmen and sophomores) living on campus is to join a residential academic program (RAP). Each RAP focuses on a curricular theme and offers courses in the residence hall itself. The programs also include educational activities.

===CU Cycling Club===
Founded in 1983 by Jim Castagneri, the cycling team was taken to the national championships in 1987 by 1992 Olympian John Stenner. The CU cycling team frequently ranks in the top five USA Cycling Collegiate teams in both road cycling and mountain biking disciplines. They have won the national championship on several occasions, including 2005, when they won in both disciplines. Many members of the club have gone on into professional cycling, including Sepp Kuss and Tyler Hamilton.

A founding club member of the Rocky Mountain Collegiate Cycling Conference, the team is open to any student who pays annual dues and meets a minimum amount of credits during the semester. The members include nearly every different type of cyclist, from BMX riders, trials, and bicycle commuters to elite amateur or part-time professional road and mountain riders. Specifically, to qualify for road or mountain nationals, a rider must have enough high race results to upgrade to &quot;A&quot; category in the USA Cycling rankings. A number of &quot;A&quot; riders will be chosen by the coaches to represent CU at the National Championships. The number of riders the team is allowed to send is based on how well the team did overall during the season.

===Program Council===
Established in 1953, Program Council is a student-run group that coordinates concerts and movies played on campus throughout the year. Program Council mainly focuses on organizing concerts around campus. Over the years, this group has brought such acts as The Rolling Stones, The Who, Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., The Ramones, Henry Rollins, and many more to the University of Colorado. Concerts vary in size ranging from large-scale concerts to smaller local acts, some of which are free to attend.

===Greek life===
The Panhellenic sorority community consists of roughly a dozen chapters. The men&#x27;s fraternities at the University of Colorado are not officially affiliated with the school; however, they are still a presence on campus. About 13% of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life. The Multicultural Greek Council acts as a liaison between the member organizations and university administration.

The death of Chi Psi pledge Gordie Bailey from alcohol poisoning during hazing in 2004 caused Boulder fraternities to re-organize and sever legal affiliation to the university. Students gathered for a candlelight vigil for the deceased football player on the Boulder campus on September 20, 2004.

=== Left Right TIM Improv Comedy ===
Started in 2008 by CU-Boulder students, Left Right TIM is the Boulder area&#x27;s premier and longest-running improv comedy team, performing a weekly improvised comedy show every Friday during the university&#x27;s academic year in the Hale Anthropology Building Room 270 of the school&#x27;s campus. The team has performed in cities around the country as well as opening for established stand-up comedians and improv theaters.

==Sports, clubs, and traditions==

Sports teams at the school are called Buffaloes. The varsity athletic teams participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I (FBS for football, see Bowl Championship Series) as a member of the Big 12 Conference. The school rejoined the Big 12 in 2024, ending its affiliation with the Pac-12 Conference. (CU had previously been a member of the former Big Eight Conference, whose members had merged with four schools of the former Southwest Conference to create the new Big 12 Conference in 1996.) The official school colors are silver and gold, as opposed to the common belief of black and gold. Silver and gold were chosen to represent the state&#x27;s mineral wealth, but the colors did not look good together on the uniforms, so black was substituted. There are three official fight songs: &quot;Glory Colorado&quot;, &quot;Go Colorado&quot;, and &quot;Fight CU.&quot; In the early 1980s, the Board of Regents changed the school colors to sky blue and gold; but the changed proved highly unpopular with students and alumni, and the colors were changed back after 1985.

In 1934, the university teams were officially nicknamed the &quot;Buffaloes.&quot; Previous nicknames used by the press included the &quot;Silver Helmets&quot; and &quot;Frontiersmen.&quot; The final game of 1934, against the University of Denver, saw the first running of a buffalo in a Colorado football game. A buffalo calf was rented from a local ranch and ran along the sidelines.

===Varsity athletics===
CU&#x27;s varsity teams have won national championships in skiing, men&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s cross country, and football. Conference championships have also been won in several sports. Several club sports, such as cycling, swimming &amp; diving, and triathlon, have won national championships in addition to the varsity teams.

In football, CU enjoys an in-state rivalry with the Colorado State Rams in the &quot;Rocky Mountain Showdown&quot;, a game that is played at the neutral site Empower Field at Mile High. Additionally, Colorado and former Big Eight and Big 12 rival Nebraska Cornhuskers have played some notable games, often finishing their respective seasons in nationally televised confrontations on the Friday following Thanksgiving since the 1990s. This ended after the 2010 season as a result of CU joining the Pac-12 and Nebraska joining the Big Ten Conference.

Colorado once had rivalries with the Utah Utes and the Air Force Falcons, but these have not been played in recent years. However, the Utah rivalry was renewed in 2011, as the Utes also joined the Pac-10 (which became the Pac-12).

The CU ski team has won 20 national championships at the Division I level. The sport is not sponsored by the Big 12 Conference, however.

===Club sports===

CU also maintains one of the largest club sports departments in the U.S. It supports over 30 club teams with leading clubs such as both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s water polo, crew, cycling, ultimate, swimming &amp; diving, fencing, men&#x27;s lacrosse, baseball, softball, ice hockey, rugby union, and the CU Triathlon Team.

===Mascot &amp; spirit program===

CU also includes a spirit program. The spirit program consists of three teams: two cheerleading squads, and the CU Express Dance Team. The cheerleading program consists of a competitive co-ed squad as well as a competitive all-girl squad. Both the cheerleading squad and the Express Dance Team compete at NCA/NDA College Nationals. In 2007, the cheerleading squad finished sixth at NCA Nationals in Daytona Beach, Florida. All squads support the home games of football, Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men&#x27;s Basketball, and Women&#x27;s Volleyball teams, along with other athletic and social events.

The school&#x27;s live mascot is a female American Bison named Ralphie. The costumed mascot CHIP is also a part of the CU Spirit Program. CHIP is a costumed buffalo that represents the University of Colorado at numerous athletic and social events. Along with the Cheer and Dance Program, CHIP competes on a national level once a year against mascots from around the country, including Bucky Badger, Sparty, Aubie, Goldy Gopher and many other Hall of Fame mascots. Most recently CHIP competed in the 2009 UCA national competition and was crowned #1, and the national champion after performing a skit titled &quot;CHIP&#x27;s Favorite Video Games&quot;.

===Clubs and other organizations===
CU Boulder offers a variety of political student organizations which cover the full spectrum of politics. Among them are Amnesty International, which focuses on human rights worldwide, Model United Nations (MUN), which simulates the UN with a focus on international relations and diplomacy, as well as the College Democrats and the College Republicans. The University of Colorado also offers many clubs promoting diversity and human rights, such as the Gay Straight Alliance. Students can also choose from a plethora of clubs and organizations centered on ethnicities and countries, as well as different religious groups. CU Boulder also maintains one of the nation&#x27;s most competitive student-run parliamentary debate programs. In 2010, CU Boulder became the first fully student-run program to win the National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE).

==Demographics==
As of fall 2021, there were 35,897 students enrolled. 66.2 percent of the student population identified as white. 56.9% were Colorado residents and 10.1% were California residents. A 2014 survey found that 16.3% of the students were registered as members of the Republican Party, along with 10.5% of CU Boulder non-faculty staff and 6% of CU Boulder faculty. Most students are aligned with the political left.

==Notable alumni==

<doc id="289673" wikidata="Q23619" url="?curid=289673" title="Queer as Folk (American TV series)">
<text>Queer as Folk is a drama television series that ran from December 3, 2000, to August 7, 2005. The series was produced for Showtime and Showcase by Cowlip Productions, Tony Jonas Productions, Temple Street Productions, and Showtime Networks, in association with Crowe Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. It was developed and written by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who were the showrunners and also the executive producers along with Tony Jonas, former president of Warner Bros. Television.

It is based on the British series created by Russell T Davies. Although it was set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, much of the series was actually shot in Toronto and employed various Canadian directors known for their independent film work (including Bruce McDonald, David Wellington, Kelly Makin, John Greyson, Jeremy Podeswa and Michael DeCarlo) as well as Australian director Russell Mulcahy, who directed the pilot episode. Additional writers in the later seasons included Michael MacLennan, Efrem Seeger, Brad Fraser, Del Shores, and Shawn Postoff.

==Show premise==
The series follows the lives of five gay men living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Brian (Gale Harold), Justin (Randy Harrison), Michael (Hal Sparks), Emmett (Peter Paige), and Ted (Scott Lowell); a lesbian couple, Lindsay (Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie); and Michael&#x27;s mother Debbie (Sharon Gless) and his uncle Vic (Jack Wetherall). Another main character, Ben (Robert Gant), was added in the second season.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* Gale Harold as Brian Kinney (British version: Aidan Gillen as Stuart Alan Jones)
Brian Kinney: a veritable sex-machine. At 29 years old, he is living life for the now. He is his own man and believes in having sex for the sheer joy of doing it. While he and Justin have an on-and-off-again relationship, Justin is the only one of his sexual encounters that Brian finds himself falling in love with and the only one he continues to have sex with after the first night.
He makes his living as an advertising executive for Vangard, and later on builds his own company, Kinnetik, which was named by Justin. While he purports not to be part of the gay and lesbian community, he will do what he can to protect his fellow gay men and women. His motto when it comes to straight people: &quot;There are two kinds of straight people in the world, those that hate you to your face and those who hate you behind your back.&quot;

* Randy Harrison as Justin Taylor (British version: Charlie Hunnam as Nathan Maloney)
Justin loses his virginity to Brian at the age of seventeen and falls in love with him. He runs away from home after coming out of the closet, primarily because his father is not accepting of his sexuality. Nicknamed &quot;Sunshine&quot; by Debbie because of his bright smile and cheery disposition, Justin is queer-bashed at the end of Season 1, resulting in Brian taking him in during Season 2. A talented artist, Justin briefly contemplates attending business school to appease his father but ultimately decides to attend art school to become a visual artist. He and Brian further their relationship over the five seasons, which eventually ends in a marriage proposal. Justin says yes, but Brian tells him to go to New York to pursue his art because he would be more successful there than he would be in Pittsburgh.

* Hal Sparks as Michael Novotny (British version: Craig Kelly as Vince Tyler)
Brian&#x27;s best friend since adolescence, Michael secretly harbors feelings for him. He enjoys reading comic books, particularly Captain Astro adventures. He starts the series as a manager at a Kmart-like department store, the Big Q, but eventually follows his dream of opening a comic book store. From Season 2, he and Justin create the comic book &quot;Rage&quot;, based on Brian as the character Rage, Justin as JT (Justin Taylor), who is Rage&#x27;s lover/sidekick, and Michael as Zephyr, Rage&#x27;s best friend/sidekick. After a somewhat stormy relationship with older Dr. David Cameron during season 1, Michael finds himself in a long-term relationship with Ben Bruckner, an HIV-positive college professor, beginning in season 2; Michael and Ben eventually marry near the end of season 4.

* Peter Paige as Emmett Honeycutt (British version: Antony Cotton as Alexander Perry)
Originally from Hazlehurst, Mississippi, Emmett is the most flamboyant of the group. He goes through several jobs, including shopkeeper at a clothing store called &quot;Torso&quot;, porn star, naked maid, party planner, and correspondent for a local news station as well as several relationships during the course of the series.

* Scott Lowell as Ted Schmidt (British version: Jason Merrells as Phil Delaney)
An accountant with low self-esteem who envies Brian&#x27;s lavish lifestyle, Ted is constantly rejected by men at gay clubs around Pittsburgh and eventually struggles with an addiction to crystal meth. He is a few years older than Michael, Brian, and Emmett. He has a relationship in Season 3 with Emmett as well as an on-again-off-again relationship with Blake.

* Thea Gill as Lindsay Peterson (British version: Esther Hall as Romey Sullivan)
Brian&#x27;s close friend since college who becomes the mother of his child Gus, Lindsay works as an art teacher but takes time off to care for her son. Lindsay&#x27;s WASP parents are ashamed of her bisexuality and of her same-sex relationship with Melanie.

* Michelle Clunie as Melanie Marcus (British version: Saira Todd as Lisa Levene)
Lindsay&#x27;s Jewish partner who works as a lawyer. Melanie dislikes Brian, partially because Lindsay is very affectionate towards him, but she becomes friendlier towards him in later seasons. She carries her and Lindsay&#x27;s second child, Jenny Rebecca, whose biological father is Michael.

* Robert Gant as Ben Bruckner (seasons 2–5)
A college professor who becomes Michael&#x27;s long-term partner from Season 2 on, Ben also lives with HIV. Michael&#x27;s mother, Debbie, at first disapproves of their relationship because she fears that her son will become infected, but eventually she realizes that Michael loves Ben and so she accepts him.

* Sharon Gless as Debbie Novotny (British version: Denise Black as Hazel Tyler)
An active PFLAG member, Debbie is fiercely proud of her son Michael&#x27;s homosexuality, to the extent of making him embarrassed about it. She treats all the boys as her own family, especially Justin, who briefly lives with her after he runs away from home. She is also one of the people who see past Brian&#x27;s cockiness for what he really is. She works at the Liberty Diner, and at home she takes care of her ill brother Vic.

* Jack Wetherall as Vic Grassi (British version: Andy Devine as Bernard Thomas)
To help Debbie pay the bills, Vic starts working as a chef at her diner. He also works as a caterer for Emmett&#x27;s event planning business. Not long after an altercation with Debbie in Season 4, he dies of AIDS complications.

* Chris Potter as Dr. David Cameron (British version: Peter O&#x27;Brien as Cameron Roberts) (season 1)
Michael&#x27;s boyfriend during Season 1. After falling off a ladder, Michael has therapy with David, a chiropractor. Their relationship evolves quickly, and in a few months Michael moves in with David and meets his son.

===Recurring===

After having difficulty with her son&#x27;s coming out, with Debbie&#x27;s help she embraces the fact that her son is gay, joining PFLAG.

* Peter MacNeill as Carl Horvath (British version: Dave Nicholls as PC Stroud) (seasons 2–5)
Debbie&#x27;s boyfriend. He meets Debbie while working on a case involving the murder of a young gay man named Jason Kemp. He is slightly homophobic when Debbie first meets him, but she teaches him to be more accepting of homosexuals. He asks Debbie to marry him and she accepts, but she later decides that she cannot marry Horvath as long as Michael cannot legally marry. Instead, the couple decides to live together in a common-law relationship.

* Alec McClure as Chris Hobbs (British version: Ben Maguire as Christian Hobbs) (seasons 1, 2, and 4)
Bully from Justin&#x27;s school. Justin gives him a hand job early in the series, but he is then revealed to be homophobic. After assaulting Justin with a baseball bat, he is charged with assault and battery and sentenced to community service and probation. He is later shown working in construction, not expressing remorse for his actions until Justin, at Cody&#x27;s urging, forces him at gunpoint to apologize. Justin plays into Chris&#x27;s homophobia by claiming that Chris will not report them to the police for fear that people would know he was almost killed by &quot;a couple of sissy fags&quot;.

* Stephanie Moore as Cynthia (British version: Alison Burrows as Sandra Docherty)
Brian&#x27;s assistant. Quits Vangard to follow Brian when he starts his own firm, Kinnetic. Charming enough to dazzle clients and firm enough to handle Brian.

* Makyla Smith as Daphne Chanders (British version: Carla Henry as Donna Clark)
Justin&#x27;s best friend since high school and the first-person Justin comes out to (not counting Brian or Michael).

* Nancy Anne Sakovich as Leda (season 2)
Melanie&#x27;s college girlfriend and best friend. She&#x27;s a biker and, although Lindsay is rather hostile towards her, soon warms up to her. Later on in season 2, Leda helps rejuvenate Melanie&#x27;s and Lindsay&#x27;s sex life when it experiences a drought by having a threesome with them but soon grows further attached.

* Fabrizio Filippo as Ethan Gold (British version: Jonathon Natynczyk as Dazz Collinson) (seasons 2–3)
Music student at PIFA who romances Justin. Feeling neglected by Brian, Justin leaves him for Ethan. It is a short-lived relationship, however, as Ethan cheats on Justin with a fan. Justin leaves Ethan, who had vowed to be faithful, and reunites with Brian, since Justin had never expected Brian to be faithful.

* Matt Battaglia as Drew Boyd (seasons 4–5)
A star quarterback who, although engaged, is a closeted homosexual. He has an affair with Emmett and later leaves his wife to be with him, although they do not stay together. Drew comes out to the media with a controversial on-air kiss with Emmett.

* David Gianopoulos as PC Jim Stockwell (season 3)
A mayoral candidate with Brian as head of his ad campaign. Stockwell is a homophobic police officer who abuses his authority. Initially, Brian helps with the campaign, but at a certain point he decides to sabotage the campaign with Justin&#x27;s help, as Stockwell is closing the gay nightclubs. Brian launches a smear campaign, and as a result Stockwell loses the election and is indicted.

* Carlo Rota as Gardner Vance (seasons 2–4)
Brian&#x27;s senior partner at the advertising agency. He buys Ryder&#x27;s from the previous owner and christens it Vangard, firing every single ad exec but Brian—who proves himself indispensable by going after and signing up the Brown Athletics account that Vance had been after for years. Brian becomes a partner after this and continues to be until the Stockwell smear campaign in season 3, which results in his getting fired.

* Robin Thomas as Sam Auerbach (season 4)
A renowned artist who is notoriously difficult to deal with. He is instantly attracted to Lindsay and pursues her even though she is a lesbian. After his Pittsburgh art exhibit (which Lindsay organized), Lindsay gives in and they have a brief tryst at the gallery.

* Mitch Morris as Cody Bell (season 4)
Leads the &quot;pink posse&quot; and convinces Justin to join.

* Lindsey Connell as Tracey (British version: Caroline Pegg as Rosalie Cotter) (seasons 1–3)
Worked with Michael at the Big Q. She had strong feelings for him and was devastated to find out that he was gay but eventually remained his friend. After Michael left the Big Q to start his comic book store, Tracey made several appearances, including when Ted interviews for the store&#x27;s assistant bookkeeper position in season 3.

* Meredith Henderson as Callie Leeson (seasons 4–5)
Hunter&#x27;s high school friend and at one point his girlfriend. When she finds out that he has two fathers and is HIV positive, she is surprisingly not worried. Her parents embarrass Hunter at a swim meet when he hits his head in the pool and begins to bleed. When Callie rushes to the pool to help him, her father shouts that he &quot;has AIDS&quot;. The entire room hears, and soon the entire school knows. Callie remains a friend of Hunter and appears occasionally through the remainder of the series.

* Mike Shara as Brett Keller (seasons 4–5)
Hollywood movie producer who offers to produce a movie version of &quot;Rage&quot;.

* Rosie O&#x27;Donnell as Loretta Pye (season 5)

Loretta applies for the job with no prior experience but convinces Deb to hire her when she tells Deb that she was kicked out of her house by her abusive husband because he caught her making out with her best friend, a woman. After Loretta works at the diner for a couple of weeks, her husband comes to take her home. When she refuses, he tries to drag her out, but Deb comes to the rescue, threatening him with a baseball bat. Afterward, Loretta and Deb become friends, but things go awry when Loretta kisses Deb while they are out for drinks. Deb eventually lets Loretta down gently, and Loretta decides to leave town, saying that she loves Deb too much to be anywhere near her.

==Plot==
The first episode finds the four friends ending a night at Babylon, a popular gay club. Brian picks up and has sex with Justin, who falls in love with him and eventually becomes more than a one-night stand. Brian also becomes a father that night, bearing a son with Lindsay through artificial insemination.

Michael&#x27;s seemingly unrequited love for Brian fuels the story, which he occasionally narrates in voice-over. Justin&#x27;s coming out and the budding relationship with Brian has unexpected effects on Brian and Michael&#x27;s lives, much to Michael&#x27;s dismay, as Justin is only 17 years old. Justin confides in his straight high-school friend Daphne while struggling to deal with homophobic classmates and his dismayed, divorcing parents, Craig and Jennifer. Later in the second season, Justin and Michael co-create the sexually explicit underground comic &quot;Rage&quot;, featuring a &quot;Gay Crusader&quot; superhero based on Brian.

Brian&#x27;s son Gus, being raised by Lindsay and Melanie, becomes the focus of several episodes, as issues of parental rights come to the fore. Ted is Melanie&#x27;s accountant who once harbored a long-standing crush on Michael. He and Emmett begin as best friends but briefly become lovers later in the series. Their relationship ends as Ted, unemployed and with a criminal record earned from running a legitimate porn website that was targeted by a chief of police running for mayor, becomes addicted to crystal meth.

In the fourth season, Brian, who has lost his job by assisting Justin in opposing an anti-gay political client, starts his own agency. He also discovers he has testicular cancer and hides his treatment from his friends. Michael marries Ben Bruckner, an HIV-positive college professor, and the couple adopts a teenage son, James &quot;Hunter&quot; Montgomery, who is also HIV-positive as a result of his experiences as a young hustler.

Ted&#x27;s affair with a handsome crystal meth addict, Blake Wyzecki, sets the pattern for Ted&#x27;s later tragic but ultimately redeeming experiences with drug addiction.

Melanie and Lindsay&#x27;s relationship, while on the surface seeming to be stable, is actually quite tumultuous. Each cheats on the other at various points in the series; both partake in a threesome shortly after they marry but are separated for much of the fourth and fifth seasons. Melanie is impregnated by Michael (through artificial insemination, as Lindsay was) in the third season, and thus best friends Brian and Michael become co-fathers to Lindsay and Melanie&#x27;s children.

Melanie gives birth to a girl, Jenny Rebecca, over whom Melanie, Lindsay, and Michael have a brief legal custody battle following the women&#x27;s transitory breakup. Brian&#x27;s new advertising agency, &quot;Kinnetik&quot;, becomes highly successful, through a combination of Brian&#x27;s customer loyalty and his edgier advertising. As a result, Brian is able to purchase &quot;Club Babylon&quot; from its bankrupt owner.

In the fifth and final season the boys have become men, and the series, perhaps more comfortable in its role in gay entertainment, tackles political issues head-on and with much more fervor.

A political campaign called &quot;Proposition 14&quot; is depicted during much of the final season as a looming threat to the main characters. This proposition, like so many real-life recent legislative moves that have affected many U.S. states, threatens to outlaw same-sex marriage, adoption, and other family civil rights. The many ways in which such a proposition would affect the characters are depicted in nearly every episode.

Debbie, Justin, Jennifer, Daphne, Emmett, Ted, Michael, Ben, Lindsay, Melanie, and the children stand up and fight against this proposition via active canvassing, political contributions, and other democratic processes, but they are met with staunch opposition, discrimination, outright hatred, and political setbacks.

The show climaxes near the end of the series when a benefit to support opposition to Proposition 14 hosted at Brian&#x27;s club &quot;Babylon&quot; (after repeated relocations of the benefit owing to discrimination) is attacked by a bomb that initially kills four people (and eventually another three) and injures 67.

This horrible event sets the bittersweet tone for the final three episodes, in which Brian, frightened by this third possible loss of Justin, finally declares his love for him. The two even plan to marry, but Justin&#x27;s artistic abilities get noticed by a New York art critic and the two decide, for the time being at least, in favor of a more realistic approach to a stormy relationship that nevertheless works for their characters. Melanie and Lindsay, realizing they have more in common than not, resume their relationship but relocate to Canada to &quot;raise [their children] in an environment where they will not be called names, singled out for discrimination, or ever have to fear for their life.&quot;

Emmett becomes a Queer-Eye type TV presenter but is later fired when professional football player Drew Boyd kisses him on the news to signify his coming out. Ted confronts his midlife crisis head-on and finally reunites with Blake. Hunter returns and the Novotny-Bruckner family perseveres.

The series came full circle with the final scenes staged in the restored Babylon nightclub. In the final scene, Brian dances to Heather Small&#x27;s &quot;Proud&quot;, a song that accompanied a pivotal scene between Brian and Michael in the very first episode of the series. It ends with a final narration by Michael:
==Cultural implications==
The American version of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; quickly became the number one show on the Showtime roster. The network&#x27;s initial marketing of the show was primarily targeted at gay male (and to some extent, lesbian) audiences, yet a sizable segment of the viewership turned out to be heterosexual women.

Groundbreaking scenes abounded in &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; beginning with the first episode, which depicts the first sex scene between two men shown on American television (including manual sex, anal sex, and anilingus), though not as graphically as the scene in the UK version that it was based on.

Despite the frank portrayals of drug use and casual sex in the gay club scene, the expected right-wing uproar (aside from some token opposition) never materialized. Cowen and Lipman, however, admitted in 2015 that they were surprised by a backlash from some quarters of the LGBT community, fearing negative implications that may result from the show.

Controversial storylines explored in &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; have included the following: coming out, same-sex marriage, ex-gay ministries, recreational drug use and abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, cannabis); gay adoption, artificial insemination, vigilantism, autoerotic asphyxiation, gay-bashing, safe sex, HIV/AIDS, casual sex, cruising, &quot;the baths&quot;, serodiscordancy in relationships, underage prostitution, actively gay Catholic priests, discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation, the internet pornography industry, and bug chasers (HIV-negative individuals who actively seek to become HIV-positive).

The series at times made humorous references to its image in the gay community. A few episodes featured the show-within-a-show &quot;Gay as Blazes&quot;, a cheesy, dull, badly acted, and abundantly politically correct drama which Brian particularly disagreed with, and which was eventually canceled.

===Cultural implications in the Asian context===
Acting as one of the pioneering dramas depicting gay characters from a complex perspective, alternative media and platforms within Asia had also adopted the drama. In South Korea the Queer film festivals (first labeled as a &quot;scandal&quot; in 1998) were slowly accepted and even popularised across South Korean society. &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; played a significant role when it was screened during the festival in 2000, providing a narrative for an alternative lifestyle, especially with respect to the LGBT community.

===Cast&#x27;s real-life sexual orientation===
The actors&#x27; real-life sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation by the public. In a 2015 &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; reunion, actors Gale Harold and Scott Lowell said they refused to discuss their own sexuality in the press, at least during the show&#x27;s first season, in an effort to lessen distractions, which was corroborated by Lipman, who went on to say that during the show&#x27;s first season, even he did not know their real-life sexuality.

In an interview on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on April 24, 2002, show host Larry King described Randy Harrison and Peter Paige as gay, and Michelle Clunie, Robert Gant, Thea Gill, Gale Harold, Scott Lowell, and Hal Sparks as straight.

Three months after the interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Gant came out as gay in an article on &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

In 2004, Gill, married to director Brian Richmond at the time, came out as a bisexual in an interview with &quot;Windy City Times&quot;.

Meanwhile, Sharon Gless&#x27;s life as a woman married to a man was already well known by the time &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; was in production, as she had married Barney Rosenzweig in 1991. She has been described as a straight woman.

In the years since &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; ended, Harold, Harrison, Lowell, Paige and Sparks have openly discussed their sexual orientation in gay publications.

== Setting ==
The series was set in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is depicted with a good deal of creative license; one example is the numerous references made to the Susquehanna River, which flows in the eastern and central parts of Pennsylvania whereas Pittsburgh is in the west. Pittsburgh was chosen as the closest parallel to the UK series&#x27; industrial setting of Manchester, England. However, since Pittsburgh does not have a large gay district like San Francisco or New York City, almost all of the Liberty Avenue scenes were filmed in and around the Church and Wellesley area of Toronto, which is that city&#x27;s gay village. In fact, not a single shot of the real Liberty Avenue was ever used in the series. Toronto was chosen as the production center of the series because of its lower cost of production and established mature television and film industry. And, as it happens, Toronto&#x27;s gay village had the look the producers needed to bring their vision of Liberty Avenue alive.

Woody&#x27;s, the central bar in this fantasy Pittsburgh, is the name of a leading gay bar in Toronto, whose real exterior was shot with only minor disguise. (In a Season 4 episode in which several characters traveled to Toronto, the real Woody&#x27;s was dubbed &quot;Moosie&#x27;s&quot;.) Babylon was also the name of a real gay bar in Toronto, which was open during the show&#x27;s run but subsequently closed, although the real establishment was a sitdown martini bar; the dance club scenes in the series were actually filmed at a different Toronto nightclub, Fly.

<text>The West Country () is a loosely defined area within southwest England, usually taken to include the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Bristol, with some considering it to extend to all or parts of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The West Country has a distinctive regional English dialect and accent, and is also home to the Cornish language.

==Extent==

The West Country is bounded by the English Channel to the south and the Atlantic Ocean, Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary to the north. The eastern limit is less clearly defined.

Some definitions match that of the official South West England region. In a 2019 YouGov survey, 72% of respondents considered Cornwall and Devon to be in the West Country, while 70% included Somerset, 69% included Bristol, and 55% included Dorset. Other counties received less than 50% agreement, with 28% including Wiltshire, 27% including Gloucestershire, 12% including Herefordshire and 9% including Worcestershire, though those last two counties are officially part of the West Midlands region.

==Specific uses==
The term West Country derby is used to refer to sports matches between such cities as Bristol and Bath or Gloucester and Bath.

West Country Lamb and West Country Beef are EU Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) covering products from animals born and reared in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire or Gloucestershire. &quot;West Country Farmhouse Cheddar&quot; is a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) limited to cheddar cheese made in the traditional way in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset or Somerset.

ITV West Country is an ITV franchise which broadcasts local news, weather and current affairs programmes over two regions; ITV West Country West covering the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, Devon and parts of Dorset and Somerset with ITV West Country East covering the remainder of Somerset and Dorset together with Bristol, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. ITV West Country West was an ITV franchise in its own right (ITV Westcountry) until 2014 when it merged with that of ITV West, formerly HTV West, having been initially launched as Westcountry Television with its main studios in Plymouth in 1993. 

West Country Carnivals are held in many towns in and around Somerset. A government-supported museum, galleries, and major attractions atlas matched the South West Region, save for Gloucestershire. 

A former brewery in Cheltenham traded as West Country Ales; their ceramic plaques can still be seen built into pub walls around Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire and parts of Wales.

==History==

During Jack Cade&#x27;s Rebellion in 1450, English chroniclers described an uprising in Wiltshire being carried out by: &quot;the comenys of the weste contre&quot;, indicating that in the late medieval period the county was certainly considered by contemporaries to be part of the West Country.

A map of the West Country was produced for motorists by Esso in 1932. Bristol and Salisbury form the most northerly and easterly cities on the map respectively, marking the one interpretation of the region at that time.

<doc id="289691" wikidata="Q383389" url="?curid=289691" title="Tahini">
<text>Tahini () ( (past participle of grind), or rashi () is a Middle-Eastern condiment made from ground sesame. Its more commonly eaten variety comes from hulled sesame, but unhulled seeds can also be used for preparing it. The latter variety has been described as slightly bitter, but more nutritious. It is served by itself (as a dip) or as a major ingredient in hummus, baba ghanoush, and halva.

Tahini is used in the cuisines of the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean, the South Caucasus, the Balkans, South Asia, Central Asia, and amongst Ashkenazi Jews as well as parts of Russia and North Africa. Sesame paste (though not called tahini) is also used in some East Asian cuisines.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Tahini&quot; is of Semitic origin and comes from a colloquial Levantine Arabic pronunciation of (), or more accurately (), whence also English &quot;tahina&quot; and Hebrew &quot;ṭḥina&quot; . It is derived from the root , which as a verb means &quot;to grind&quot;, and also produces the word , &quot;flour&quot; in some dialects. The word &quot;tahini&quot; had appeared in English by the late 1930s.

== History ==
The oldest mention of sesame is in a cuneiform document written 4,000 years ago that describes the custom of serving the gods sesame wine. The historian Herodotus writes about the cultivation of sesame 3,500 years ago in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia. It was mainly used as a source of oil.

Tahini is mentioned as an ingredient of &quot;hummus kasa&quot;, a recipe transcribed in an anonymous 13th-century Arabic cookbook, &quot;Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada&quot;.

In his 14th-century work &quot;Kaftor va-Ferach (Hebrew: כפתור ופרח)&quot;, Ishtori Haparchi wrote that the inhabitants of the Land of Israel in his time consumed Tahini, made by grinding sesame seeds and mixing them with date honey.

Sesame paste is an ingredient in some Chinese and Japanese dishes; Sichuan cuisine uses it in some recipes for dandan noodles. Sesame paste is also used in Indian cuisine.

In North America, sesame tahini, along with other raw nut butters, was available by 1940 in health food stores.

== Preparation and storage ==
Tahini is made from sesame seeds that are soaked in water and then crushed to separate the bran from the kernels. The crushed seeds are soaked in salt water, causing the bran to sink. The floating kernels are skimmed off the surface, toasted, and ground to produce an oily paste. It can also be prepared with untoasted seeds and called &quot;raw tahini&quot;.

Because of tahini&#x27;s high oil content, some manufacturers recommend refrigeration to prevent spoilage. Others do not recommend refrigeration, as it makes the product more viscous and more difficult to serve.

== Culinary uses ==
Tahini-based sauces are common in Middle Eastern restaurants as a side dish or as a garnish, usually including lemon juice, salt, and garlic, and thinned with water. Hummus is made of cooked, mashed chickpeas typically blended with tahini, lemon juice and salt. Tahini sauce is also a popular topping for meat and vegetables in Middle Eastern cuisine. A sweet spread, &quot;ḥalawa ṭaḥīniyya&quot; ( &quot;sweet tahini&quot;), is a type of halva sweet. It sometimes has mashed or sliced pistachio pieces sprinkled inside or on top. It is usually spread on bread and eaten as a quick snack.

=== For sweets ===
Tahini is also used in sweet dishes like cakes, cookies, halva, and ice cream.

=== By region ===

==== Armenia ====
In Armenia, tahini can be used as a sauce to put on &quot;lahmajoun&quot;.

==== China ====
In Chinese cuisine, sesame paste ( zhīmájiàng) is used as a condiment in many dishes. Chinese sesame paste differs from the Middle Eastern tahini in that the sesame is roasted; the paste is much darker, and has far less astringency. Often, white sesame paste is used in salty dishes, while black sesame paste is used in desserts (not to be confused with black sesame soup, which is made in a different manner from sesame paste). Sesame paste is a primary condiment in the hot dry noodles of Hubei cuisine and ma jiang mian (sesame paste noodles) of Northeastern Chinese cuisine and Taiwanese cuisine. Sesame paste is also used as a bread or mantou spread, and may be paired with or baked into bing (Chinese flatbread). Sesame paste is used as a seasoning, condiment and dip in cold dishes (such as &quot;liangfen&quot;) and hot pot. 

==== Cyprus ====
In Cyprus, tahini, locally pronounced as &quot;tashi&quot;, is used as a dip for bread and sometimes in &quot;pitta souvlaki&quot; rather than &quot;tzatziki&quot;, which is customary in Greece; it is also used to make &quot;tahinopitta&quot; (tahini pie).

==== Greece ====
In Greece, tahini () is used as a spread on bread either alone or topped with honey or jam. Jars of tahini ready-mixed with honey or cocoa are available in the breakfast food aisles of Greek supermarkets.

==== Iran ====
In Iran, tahini is called &quot;ardeh&quot; () in Persian. It is used to make &quot;ḥalvardeh&quot; (), a kind of halva made of tahini, sugar, egg whites, and other ingredients. It is also eaten during breakfast, usually with an accompanying sweet substance, such as grape syrup, date syrup, honey, or jam. Ardeh and halvardeh are among the souvenirs of the Iranian cities of Yazd and Ardakan.

==== Iraq ====
In Iraq, tahini is known as &quot;rashi&quot; (), and is mixed with date syrup (rub) to make a sweet dessert usually eaten with bread.

==== Israel ====
In Israel, tahini ( &quot;ṭḥina&quot;) is a staple foodstuff. It is served as a dip with flat bread or pita, a topping for many foods such as falafel, sabich, Jerusalem mixed grill and shawarma, and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish, and in sweet desserts like halva, halva ice cream and tahini cookies. It is also served baked in the oven with &quot;kufta&quot; made of lamb or beef with spices and herbs, or with a whole fish in the coastal areas and the Sea of Galilee.

==== Levant ====
In the Levant, tahini (Levantine Arabic: &quot;ṭḥine&quot;) is a staple food and is used in various spreads and culinary preparations. It is the main ingredient of the Ṭaraṭor (sauce) which is used with falafel and shawarma. It is also used as a sauce for meat and fish. It is an ingredient in a seafood dish called &quot;ṣiyadiyeh&quot;.

==== Palestine ====
In the Gaza Strip, a rust-colored variety known as &quot;red tahina&quot; is served in addition to ordinary tahina. It is achieved by a different and lengthier process of roasting the sesame seeds, and has a more intense taste. Red tahina is used in &quot;sumagiyya&quot; (lamb with chard and sumac) and salads native to the falaḥeen from the surrounding villages, as well as southern Gaza. In the West Bank city of Nablus, tahina is mixed with &quot;qizḥa&quot; paste to make &quot;black tahina&quot;, used in baking.

==== Turkey ====
In Turkey, tahini () is mixed with pekmez to make &quot;tahin-pekmez&quot;, which is often served as a breakfast item or after meals as a sweet dip for breads.

<doc id="289696" wikidata="Q2826535" url="?curid=289696" title="Agelenopsis">
<text>Agelenopsis, commonly known as the American grass spiders, is a genus of funnel weavers described by C.G. Giebel in 1869. They weave sheet webs that have a funnel shelter on one edge. The web is not sticky, but these spiders make up for that by running very rapidly. The larger specimens (depending on species) can grow to about 19 mm in body length. They may be recognized by the arrangement of their eight eyes into three rows. The top row has two eyes, the middle row has four eyes, and the bottom row has two eyes (spaced wider than the ones on the top row). They have two prominent hind spinnerets, somewhat indistinct bands on their legs, and two dark bands running down either side of the cephalothorax.

==Name==
The genus name is a combination of &quot;Agelena&quot; (Eurasian grass spiders), a genus of similar spiders, and Greek &quot;-opsis&quot; &quot;to look like&quot;. They are harmless spiders. Although most spiders use their webs to catch prey, the grass spider&#x27;s web lacks adhesive ability. The spiders make up for that with their fast running.

The main distinction between &quot;Agelenopsis&quot; and the related European genus &quot;Agelena&quot; consists of the pattern appearing on the cephalothorax; the former possesses two quasiparallel lines from the eyes to the beginning of the abdomen. The latter genus has curved, irregular lines that often meet at the end. Another difference is the length of the front legs row in females, but in males, the similarities are not as in line.

==Species==
 it contains fourteen species:
*&quot;Agelenopsis actuosa&quot; – common American grass spider - USA, Canada 
*&quot;Agelenopsis aleenae&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis aperta&quot; – desert grass spider - USA, Mexico
*&quot;Agelenopsis emertoni&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis kastoni&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis longistyla&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis naevia&quot; – USA, Canada
*&quot;Agelenopsis oklahoma&quot; – USA, Canada
*&quot;Agelenopsis oregonensis&quot; – USA, Canada
*&quot;Agelenopsis pennsylvanica&quot; – USA, Canada
*&quot;Agelenopsis potteri&quot; – North America. Introduced to Ukraine, Russia (Europe, Far East), Kyrgyzstan
*&quot;Agelenopsis riechertae&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis spatula&quot; – USA
*&quot;Agelenopsis utahana&quot; – USA, Canada

<text>The DARPA Grand Challenge is a prize competition for American autonomous vehicles, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the most prominent research organization of the United States Department of Defense. Congress has authorized DARPA to award cash prizes to further DARPA&#x27;s mission to sponsor revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and military use. The initial DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004 was created to spur the development of technologies needed to create the first fully autonomous ground vehicles capable of completing a substantial off-road course within a limited time. The third event, the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007, extended the initial Challenge to autonomous operation in a mock urban environment. The 2012 DARPA Robotics Challenge, focused on autonomous emergency-maintenance robots, and new Challenges are still being conceived. The DARPA Subterranean Challenge was tasked with building robotic teams to autonomously map, navigate, and search subterranean environments. Such teams could be useful in exploring hazardous areas and in search and rescue.

In addition to the challenges in autonomous technology, DARPA has also conducted prize competitions in other areas of technology.

==History and background==
Fully autonomous vehicles have been an international pursuit for many years, from endeavors in Japan (starting in 1977), Germany (Ernst Dickmanns and VaMP), Italy (the ARGO Project), the European Union (EUREKA Prometheus Project), the United States of America, and other countries. DARPA funded the development of the first fully autonomous robot beginning in 1966 with the Shakey the robot project at Stanford Research Institute, now SRI International. The first autonomous ground vehicle capable of driving on and off roads was developed by DARPA as part of the Strategic Computing Initiative beginning in 1984 leading to demonstrations of autonomous navigation by the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Navlab.

The Grand Challenge was the first long distance competition for driverless cars in the world; other research efforts in the field of driverless cars take a more traditional commercial or academic approach. The U.S. Congress authorized DARPA to offer prize money ($1 million) for the first Grand Challenge to facilitate robotic development, with the ultimate goal of making one-third of ground military forces autonomous by 2015. Following the 2004 event, Dr. Tony Tether, the director of DARPA, announced that the prize money had been increased to $2 million for the next event, which was claimed on October 9, 2005. The first, second and third places in the 2007 Urban Challenge received $2 million, $1 million, and $500,000, respectively. 14 new teams have qualified in year 2015.

The competition was open to teams and organizations from around the world, as long as there was at least one U.S. citizen on the roster. Teams have participated from high schools, universities, businesses and other organizations. More than 100 teams registered in the first year, bringing a wide variety of technological skills to the race. In the second year, 195 teams from 36 U.S. states and 4 foreign countries entered the race.

==2004 Grand Challenge==
The first competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge was held on March 13, 2004 in the Mojave Desert region of the United States, along a route that follows along the path of Interstate 15 from just before Barstow, California to just past the California–Nevada border in Primm.
None of the robot vehicles finished the route. Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Red Team and car Sandstorm (a converted Humvee) traveled the farthest distance, completing of the course before getting hung up on a rock after making a switchback turn. No winner was declared, and the cash prize was not given. Therefore, a second DARPA Grand Challenge event was scheduled for 2005.

==2005 Grand Challenge==
The second competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge began at 6:40 am on October 8, 2005. All but one of the 23 finalists in the 2005 race surpassed the distance completed by the best vehicle in the 2004 race. Five vehicles successfully completed the 212 km (132 mi) course:

Vehicles in the 2005 race passed through three narrow tunnels and negotiated more than 100 sharp left and right turns. The race concluded through Beer Bottle Pass, a winding mountain pass with a sheer drop-off on one side and a rock face on the other. Although the 2004 course required more elevation gain and some very sharp switchbacks (Daggett Ridge) were required near the beginning of the route, the course had far fewer curves and generally wider roads than the 2005 course.

The natural rivalry between the teams from Stanford and Carnegie Mellon (Sebastian Thrun, head of the Stanford team was previously a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon and colleague of Red Whittaker, head of the CMU team) was played out during the race. Mechanical problems plagued H1ghlander before it was passed by Stanley. Gray Team&#x27;s entry was a miracle in itself, as the team from the suburbs of New Orleans was caught in Hurricane Katrina a few short weeks before the race. The fifth finisher, Terramax, a 30,000 pound entry from Oshkosh Truck, finished on the second day. The huge truck spent the night idling on the course, but was particularly nimble in carefully picking its way down the narrow roads of Beer Bottle Pass.

==2007 Urban Challenge==


The third competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge, known as the &quot;Urban Challenge&quot;, took place on November 3, 2007 at the site of the now-closed George Air Force Base (currently used as Southern California Logistics Airport), in Victorville, California (Google map). The course involved a urban area course, to be completed in less than 6 hours. Rules included obeying all traffic regulations while negotiating with other traffic and obstacles and merging into traffic.

Unlike previous challenges, the 2007 Urban Challenge organizers divided competitors into two &quot;tracks&quot;, A and B. All Track A and Track B teams were part of the same competition circuit, but the teams chosen for the Track A program received US $1 million in funding. These 11 teams largely represented major universities and large corporate interests such as CMU teaming with GM as Tartan Racing, Stanford teaming with Volkswagen, Virginia Tech teaming with TORC Robotics as VictorTango, Oshkosh Truck, Honeywell, Raytheon, Caltech, Autonomous Solutions, Cornell University, and MIT. One of the few independent entries in Track A was the Golem Group. DARPA has not publicly explained the rationale behind the selection of Track A teams.

Teams were given maps sparsely charting the waypoints that defined the competition courses. At least one team, Tartan Racing, enhanced the maps through the insertion of additional extrapolated waypoints for improved navigation. A debriefing paper published by Team Jefferson illustrates graphically the contrast between the course map it was given by DARPA and the course map used by Tartan Racing.

Tartan Racing claimed the $2 million prize with their vehicle &quot;Boss&quot;, a Chevy Tahoe. The second-place finisher earning the $1 million prize was the Stanford Racing Team with their entry &quot;Junior&quot;, a 2006 Volkswagen Passat. Coming in third place was team VictorTango, winning the $500,000 prize with their 2005 Ford Escape hybrid, &quot;Odin&quot;. MIT placed 4th, with Cornell University and University of Pennsylvania/Lehigh University also completing the course.

The six teams that successfully finished the entire course:
While the 2004 and 2005 events were more physically challenging for the vehicles, the robots operated in isolation and only encountered other vehicles on the course when attempting to pass. The Urban Challenge required designers to build vehicles able to obey all traffic laws while they detect and avoid other robots on the course. This is a particular challenge for vehicle software, as vehicles must make &quot;intelligent&quot; decisions in real time based on the actions of other vehicles. Other than previous autonomous vehicle efforts that focused on structured situations such as highway driving with little interaction between the vehicles, this competition operated in a more cluttered urban environment and required the cars to perform sophisticated interactions with each other, such as maintaining precedence at a 4-way stop intersection.

==2012 Robotics Challenge==
The DARPA Robotics Challenge is an ongoing competition focusing on humanoid robotics. The primary goal of the program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments. It launched in October 2012, and hosted the Virtual Robotics Competition in June 2013. Two more competitions are planned: the DRC Trials in December 2013, and the DRC Finals in December 2014.

Unlike prior Challenges, the construction of the &quot;vehicles&quot; will not be part of the scope of the Robotics Challenge. In August 2012 DARPA announced Boston Dynamics would act as sole source for the robots to be used in the challenge, awarding them a contract to develop and build 8 identical robots based on the PETMAN project for the software teams to use. The amount contracted was $10,882,438 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract and work is expected to be completed by Aug. 9, 2014.

==2013 FANG Challenge==
On April 22, 2013, DARPA awarded a $1 million prize to &quot;Ground Systems&quot;, a 3-person team with members in Ohio, Texas and California, as the winner of the Fast Adaptable Next-Generation Ground Vehicle (FANG) Mobility/Drivetrain Challenge. Team Ground Systems&#x27; final design submission received the highest score when measured against the established requirements for system performance and manufacturability. Since the beginning of the first FANG Challenge on January 14, 2013, more than 1,000 participants within more than 200 teams used the META design tools and the VehicleFORGE collaboration platform developed by Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, to design and simulate the performance of thousands of potential mobility and drivetrain subsystems. The goal of the FANG program is to test the specially developed META design tools, model libraries and the VehicleFORGE platform, which were created to significantly compress the design-to-production time of a complex defense system.

==2017–2021 Subterranean Challenge==
The DARPA Subterranean Challenge tasked teams, consisting of university and corporate entities from around the world, to build robotic systems and virtual solutions to autonomously map, navigate, and search subterranean environments. Such areas can be difficult and dangerous for humans, making robotic teams a desirable option for exploration and search and rescue operations. These environments pose significant challenges to robots as well, including a lack of lighting, dripping water, thick smoke, cluttered or irregularly shaped environments and potential loss of GPS capabilities and communications with their handlers. The Challenge was meant to help close gaps in four technical areas: autonomy, perception, networking and mobility.

The Challenge started in September 2018 and consisted of a Systems Competition (in which teams compete with physical robots) and a Virtual Competition (in which teams compete in a virtual environment in the ROS Gazebo virtual simulator). The competition was split into three stages (Development Stage, Circuit Stage, and Finals Stage. The SubT Challenge consisted of four events, the Tunnel Circuit (August 2019), which was held at an experimental mine in Pittsburgh, PA; the Urban Circuit (February 2020), which featured an abandoned nuclear power plant in Elma, WA; the Cave Circuit (November 2020), which was held virtual only due to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and the Final Event (September 2021), which featured elements from all three domains (tunnel urban underground, and natural cave networks was held in Louisville, KY.

Teams came from 11 countries (Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, England, Germany, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) and 20 universities. 
On September 24, 2021, Team CERBERUS won the Final Systems Competition using four ANYmal C legged systems. Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) team came in second to Team CERBERUS, with an equal number of points, but a slightly slower time. Team Dynamo won the Final Virtual Competition.

One important strategy was to build a team of robots with diverse capabilities. With a mix of navigational capabilities such as treads, wheels, rotors and legs, robots were able to navigate a variety of spaces. Different types of robots have different capabilities. Walking robots can deal with uneven terrain such as stairs and piles of rubble. Robots with wheels or treads can carry heavier payloads, including large batteries, and operate for a longer time. “Marsupials” can carry other robots, including small flying robots which have short battery lives. Flying robots can be strategically deployed to map large or difficult-to-access spaces. Using diverse detection instruments, such as lights, radar, sonar and thermal imaging, enables a team of robots and their handlers to gather information about air and visibility conditions and respond to a broader range of conditions.

Because conditions can interfere with communications between robots and their handlers, the teams that developed robots with some degree of autonomy were most successful at the challenge task of mapping and searching a complex subterranean space. Such robots could explore on their own, and then return to radio contact with each other and their handlers to exchange information about what they had found.
Australia’s CSIRO team even designed its robots to make cooperative decisions about what tasks to undertake. For example, a robot that was too large to fit into a corridor could notify other robots that it existed, so that a smaller robot could explore there. A robot exploring an area could also for a communications node to be dropped to expand the contact area. A robot deep in a cavern could relay information back to a robot closer to the surface, which could more quickly walk back to a point where it could report the information to the human operators. This changed the way in which humans worked with the robots: the human operator used the control system to set goals and direct overall strategy, leaving the robots to assess on-the-ground conditions and choose how to get the job done.

==2018 Launch Challenge==

In early 2020, three teams were expected to compete by rapidly launching a small satellite payload into orbit, with minimal notification, from two different launch sites (this requirement was later, when there was only one competitor left in the Challenge, relaxed so that the launches should use different launch pads, but could use the same launch site) – one just days after the other – for an opportunity to win prizes. The prizes of the Challenge are: All teams that qualify for the competition would receive $400,000. Each team to successfully carry out an orbital launch gets a prize of $2 million, and is eligible to try to make a second launch in rapid succession. The second launches of the teams are scored (based on combination of time to launch, mass launched and orbital accuracy, etc.); the winning team gets $10 million, second prize is $9 million, and third prize $8 million. The pool of launch sites for the Challenge originally consisted of 8 launch locations; in the end, only Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska was used for an attempted launch.

The Challenge was announced on 18 April 2018, and on 10 April 2019, three finalist teams who would be attempting to launch rockets were announced: Virgin Orbit, Vector Launch and Astra (although at the time it was not published that the third finalist was Astra; the company was referred only as a &quot;stealth startup&quot;). In the autumn of 2019, both Vector and Virgin dropped out of the competition, Vector because of financial problems and Virgin because it wanted to focus on other customers than DARPA. The final remaining team, Astra, attempted to launch their Astra Rocket 3.0 for the Challenge from Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska in late February and early March 2020, but several launch attempts were all called off due to weather and technical difficulties. With the only team left in the competition failing to launch their rocket in the time frame set by DARPA, the Challenge was called off 2 March 2020 with no winner of the DARPA Launch Challenge. The $12 million prize pool went unclaimed. No rocket launch was performed by any contender of the DARPA Launch Challenge.

==Technology==

A technology paper and source code for the computer vision machine learning component of the 2005 Stanford entry has been published.

2007 Urban Challenge teams employed a variety of different software and hardware combinations for interpreting sensor data, planning, and execution. Some examples:

<text>The Zugspitze ( , ; ), at above sea level, is the highest peak of the Wetterstein Mountains and the highest mountain in Germany. It lies south of the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, and the Austria–Germany border is on its western summit. South of the mountain is the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot;, a high karst plateau with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are two glaciers, the largest in Germany: the Northern Schneeferner with an area of 30.7 hectares and Höllentalferner with an area of 24.7 hectares. Shrinking of the Southern Schneeferner led to the loss of glacier status in 2022.

The Zugspitze was first climbed on 27 August 1820 by Josef Naus; his survey assistant, Maier, and mountain guide, Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are three normal routes to the summit: one from the Höllental valley to the northeast; another out of the Reintal valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (&quot;Österreichische Schneekar&quot;). One of the best known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (&quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot;) to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the Hochblassen and the Alpspitze. For mountaineers there is plenty of nearby accommodation. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the Münchner Haus and on the western slopes is the Wiener-Neustädter Hut.

Three cable cars run to the top of the Zugspitze. The first, the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car, was built in 1926 by the German company &quot;Adolf Bleichert &amp; Co&quot; and terminated on an arête below the summit at 2,805 m.a.s.l, the so-called Kammstation, before the terminus was moved to the actual summit at 2,951 m.a.s.l. in 1991. A rack railway, the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot;, from where a second cable car runs a short way down to the &quot;Schneefernerhaus&quot;, formerly a hotel, but since 1999 an environmental research station; a weather station opened there in 1900. The rack railway and the Eibsee Cable Car, the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine ski lifts cover the ski area on the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Zugspitze belongs to the Wetterstein range of the Northern Limestone Alps. The Austria–Germany border goes right over the mountain. There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit but, since Germany and Austria are now both part of the Schengen zone, the border crossing is no longer staffed.

The exact height of the Zugspitze was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from , but it is now generally accepted that the peak is above sea level as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian State Survey Office. The lounge at the new café is named &quot;2962&quot; for this reason.

=== Location ===
At (eastern peak) the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of the Zugspitze massif. This height is referenced to the Amsterdam Gauge and is given by the Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation. The same height is recorded against the Trieste Gauge used in Austria, which is 27 cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three peaks: the east, middle and west summits (&quot;Ost-&quot;, &quot;Mittel-&quot; and &quot;Westgipfel&quot;). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, which is also the only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as .

The mountain rises eleven kilometres southwest of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and just under six kilometres east of Ehrwald. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the west summit; thus the Zugspitze massif belongs to the German state of Bavaria and the Austrian state of Tyrol. The municipalities responsible for it are Grainau and Ehrwald. To the west the Zugspitze massif drops into the valley of the River Loisach, which flows around the massif towards the northeast in a curve whilst, in the east, the streams of &quot;Hammersbach&quot; and Partnach have their source. To the south the &quot;Gaistal&quot; valley and its river, the Leutascher Ache, separate the Wetterstein Mountains from the Mieming Chain. To the north at the foot of the Zugspitze is the lake of Eibsee. The next highest mountain in the area is the Acherkogel () in the Stubai Alps, which gives the Zugspitze a topographic isolation value of 24.6 kilometres. The reference point for the prominence is the Parseierspitze (). In order to climb it from the Zugspitze, a descent to the Fern Pass () is required, so that the prominence is .

==== Zugspitze Massif ====

The massif of the Zugspitze has several other peaks. To the south the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; is surrounded in an arc by the &quot;Zugspitzeck&quot; () and Schneefernerkopf (), the Wetterspitzen (), the Wetterwandeck (), the Plattspitzen () and the &quot;Gatterlköpfen&quot; (). The massif ends in the &quot;Gatterl&quot; (), a wind gap between it and the Hochwanner. Running eastwards away from the Zugspitze is the famous Jubilee Ridge or &quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot; over the Höllentalspitzen towards the Alpspitze and Hochblassen. The short crest of the &quot;Riffelwandkamm&quot; runs northeast over the summits of the Riffelwandspitzen () and the &quot;Riffelköpfe&quot; (), to the Riffel wind gap (&quot;Riffelscharte&quot;, ). From here the ridge of the &quot;Waxensteinkamm&quot; stretches away over the Riffelspitzen to the Waxenstein.

==== Zugspitzplatt ====

The &quot;Platt&quot; or &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; is a plateau below the summit of the Zugspitze to the south and southeast which lies at a height of between . It forms the head of the Reintal valley and has been shaped by a combination of weathering, karstification and glaciation. The area contains roches moutonnées, dolines and limestone pavements as a consequence of the ice ages. In addition moraines have been left behind by various glacial periods. The &quot;Platt&quot; was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today 52 percent of it consists of scree, 32 percent of bedrock and 16 percent of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas.

=== Climate ===
The climate is tundra (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;), maintaining the only glacier present in Germany, which has observed its reduction over the years. From a climatic perspective the Zugspitze lies in the temperate zone and its prevailing winds are Westerlies. As the first high orographic obstacle to these Westerlies in the Alps, the Zugspitze is particularly exposed to the weather. It is effectively the north barrier of the Alps (&quot;Nordstau der Alpen&quot;), against which moist air masses pile up and release heavy precipitation. At the same time the Zugspitze acts as a protective barrier for the Alpine ranges to the south. By contrast, Föhn weather conditions push in the other direction against the massif, affecting the region for about 60 days per year. These warm, dry air masses stream from south to north and can result in unusually high temperatures in winter. Nevertheless, frost dominates the picture on the Zugspitze with an average of 310 days per year.

For the decades from 1961 to 1990 – designated by the World Meteorological Organization as the &quot;normal period&quot; – the average annual precipitation on the Zugspitze was 2,003.1 mm; the wettest month being April with 199 mm, and the driest, October with 108.8 mm. By comparison the values for 2009 were 2,070.8 mm, the wettest month being March with 326.2 mm and the driest, January, with 56.4 mm. The average temperature in the normal period was −4.8 Celsius, with July and August being the warmest at 2.2 °C and February, the coldest, with −11.4 °C. By comparison the average temperature in 2009 was −4.2 °C, the warmest month was August at 5.3 °C and the coldest was February at −13.5 °C. The average sunshine during the normal period was 1,846.3 hours per year, the sunniest month being October with 188.8 hours and the darkest being December with 116.1 hours. In 2009 there were 1,836.3 hours of sunshine, the least occurring in February with just 95.4 hours and the most in April with 219 hours. In 2009, according to the weather survey by the German Met Office, the Zugspitze was the coldest place in Germany with a mean annual temperature of −4.2 °C.

The lowest measured temperature on the Zugspitze was −35.6 °C on 14 February 1940. The highest temperature occurred on 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9 °C. A squall on 12 June 1985 registered 335 km/h, the highest measured wind speed on the Zugspitze. In April 1944 meteorologists recorded a snow depth of 8.3 metres.
Nowadays, snow completely melts during summer, but in the past snow might resist the summer months, the last case when the snow failed to melt during the whole summer season was in 2000.



=== Geology ===

The geological strata composing the mountain are sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid down on the seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800 metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from the foot of the Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze it can be seen that this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.

=== Flora ===

Since the 16th century sheep grazing has been practiced on the Zugsitzplatt. Currently there are about 400 sheep maintained on Zugspitzplatt.

The shaded and moist northern slopes of the massif like, for example, the Wettersteinwald, are some of the most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The mountain pine grows at elevations of up to 1,800 metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of spruce and fir, but honeysuckle, woodruff, poisonous herb paris, meadow-rue and speedwell also occur here. Dark columbine, alpine clematis, blue and yellow monkshood, white corn lily, stemless carline thistle, false aster, golden cinquefoil, round-leaved saxifrage, wall hawkweed, alpine calamint and alpine forget-me-not flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst cinquefoil, sticky sage, butterbur, alpenrose, Turk&#x27;s cap lily and fly orchid thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. Lily of the valley and daphne also occur, especially in the Höllental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.

Bilberry, cranberry and cowberry are restricted to dry places and lady&#x27;s slipper orchid occurs in sheltered spots. Below the Waxenstein are fields with raspberries and occasionally Fragaria vesca too. The alpine poppy and purple mountain saxifrage both thrive up to a very great height. On the scree slopes there are Thlaspi and mouse-ear chickweed as well as Dryas octopetala, alpine toadflax, Lamiaceae and &quot;Saxifraga moschata&quot;. Following snowmelt dark stonecrop and snow gentian are the first to appear, their seeds beginning to germinate as early as August. Other well-known alpine plants like edelweiss, gentians and, more rarely, cyclamen also flower on the Zugspitze.

=== Fauna ===

The rocks around the Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are widespread on the southern side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the hazel dormouse. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, snow finch, alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given its name to the &quot;Schwalbenwand&quot; (&quot;Swallows&#x27; Wall&quot;) at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.

The viviparous lizard inhabits rocky terrain, as does the black alpine salamander known locally as the &quot;Bergmandl&quot;, which can be seen after rain showers as one is climbing. Butterflies like Apollo, Thor&#x27;s fritillary, gossamer-winged butterfly, geometer moth, ringlet and skipper may be seen on the west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August. The woods around the Zugspitze are home to red deer, red squirrel, weasel, capercaillie, hazel grouse and black grouse. On the glaciers live glacier fleas (&quot;Desoria saltans&quot;) and water bears.

=== Glaciers ===
Three of Germany&#x27;s five glaciers are found on the Zugspitze massif: the Höllentalferner the Southern and Northern Schneeferner.

==== Höllentalferner ====

The Höllentalferner lies northeast of the Zugspitze in a cirque below the Jubilee Ridge (&quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot;) to the south and the Riffelwandspitzen peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast aspect. Its accumulation zone is formed by a depression, in which large quantities of avalanche snow collect. To the south the &quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot; shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006. In recent times the Höllentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 hectares. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period between 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and now has an area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203 metres.

==== Schneeferner ====

Southwest of the Zugspitze, between the &quot;Zugspitzeck&quot; and Schneefernerkopf, is the Northern Schneeferner which has an eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 hectares (2006) it is the largest German glacier. Around 1820 the entire &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (&quot;Plattgletscher&quot;) only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable terrain that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season.

At the beginning of the 1990s, ski slope operators began to cover the Northern Schneeferner in summer with artificial sheets in order to protect it from sunshine. The Northern Schneeferner reached its last high point in 1979, when its area grew to 40.9 hectares. By 2006 it had shrunk to 30.7 hectares. The glacier head then lay at 2,789 m and the foot at 2,558 metres.

The Southern Schneeferner was surrounded by the peaks of the Wetterspitzen and the Wetterwandeck. It was also a remnant of the once great &quot;Platt Glacier&quot;. The Southern Schneeferner was declassified as a glacier in 2022. The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2018 to just 1.7 hectares. 

=== Caves ===
Below the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; chemical weathering processes have created a large number of caves and abîmes in the Wetterstein limestone. In the 1930s the number of caves was estimated at 300. By 1955 62 caves were known to exist and by 1960 another 47 had been discovered. The first cave explorations here took place in 1931. Other, largest exploratory expeditions took place in 1935 and 1936 as well as between 1955 and 1968. During one expedition, in 1958, the Finch Shaft (&quot;Finkenschacht&quot;) was discovered. It is 131 metres deep, 260 metres long and has a watercourse. There is a theory that this watercourse could be a link to the source of the River Partnach.

== Name ==

From the early 14th century, geographic names from the Wetterstein Mountains began to be recorded in treaties and on maps, and this trend intensified in the 15th century. In 1536 a border treaty dating to 1500 was refined in that its course was specified as running over a &quot;Schartten&quot; (&quot;wind gap&quot; or &quot;col&quot;). In the 17th century the reference to this landmark in the treaty was further clarified as &quot;now known as the Zugspüz&quot; (&quot;jetzt Zugspüz genant&quot;). The landmark referred to was a wind gap on the summit of the Zugspitze and is used time and again in other sources. During the Middle Ages &quot;Scharte&quot; was a common name for the Zugspitze.

The Zugspitze was first mentioned by name in 1590. In a description of the border between the County of Werdenfels and Austria, it states that the same border runs &quot;from the Zugspitz and over the Derle&quot; (&quot;von dem Zugspitz und über den Derle&quot;&quot;) and continues to a bridge over the River Loisach. Another border treaty in 1656 states: &quot;The highest Wetterstein or Zugspitz&quot; (&quot;Der höchste Wetterstain oder Zugspitz&quot;). There is also a map dating to the second half of the 18th century that shows &quot;the Reintal in the County of Werdenfels&quot;. It covers the Reintal valley from the Reintaler Hof to the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; and shows prominent points in the surrounding area, details of tracks and roads and pasture use. This includes a track over the then much larger Schneeferner glacier to the summit region of the Zugspitze. However the map does not show any obvious route to the summit itself.

The name of the Zugspitze is probably derived from its &quot;Zugbahnen&quot; or avalanche paths. In winter avalanches sweep down from the upper slopes of the massif into the valley and leave behind characteristic avalanche remnants in the shape of rocks and scree.
Near the Eibsee lake there are several plots of land with the same root: &quot;Zug&quot;, &quot;Zuggasse&quot;, &quot;Zugstick&quot;, &quot;Zugmösel&quot; or &quot;Zugwankel&quot;. Until the 19th century the name &quot;der Zugspitz&quot; (male gender) was commonplace. It was described as &quot;die Zugspitze&quot; (female gender) for the first time on a map printed in 1836. The spelling &quot;Zugspitz&quot; is still used in the Bavarian dialect.

== Summit cross ==

Since 1851 there has been a summit cross on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the erection of a cross on the summit was the priest Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the Hoher Peißenberg mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that &quot;the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would see that his head too was crowned with dignity.&quot; 

As a result, he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the Partnachklamm and the Reintal valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610 Gulden and 37 Kreuzer, was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14 foot high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854.

After 37 years the cross had to be taken down after suffering numerous lightning strikes; its support brackets were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881–1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and 15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There it remained for about 111 years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by American soldiers who used the cross as target practice in 1945, at the end of the Second World War. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, a replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot;, from where it was flown to the summit by helicopter. The new cross has a height of 4.88 metres. It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000 euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.

== History ==

The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on 27 August 1820. The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl. However, local people had conquered the peak over 50 years earlier, according to a 1770 map discovered by the Alpenverein.

According to one legend, the northern part of the Zugspitze was given to Bavaria as a present by Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary Franz Joseph I as a marriage present to his wife Princess Elisabeth (&quot;Sisi&quot;) in 1854. This would have made the Zugspitze the highest mountain in Bavaria and later Germany. The Zugspitze however never belonged to Austrian Tirol but rather to the Duchy of Weldenfels, which in turn belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Freising. That is evidenced by a treaty dated 26 October 1656 between Tirol and Freising. From 26 December 1802, the area, including the Zugspitze, belonged to the house of the Elector Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria, who was from 1806 King of Bavaria.

On 7 January 1882, the first successful winter assault on the Zugspitze was accomplished by F. Kilger, H. and J. Zametzer and H. Schwaiger.

Pilot, Frank Hailer, caused a stir on 19 March 1922, when he landed a plane with skids on the Schneeferner glacier. On 29 April 1927 Ernst Udet succeeded in taking off from the Schneeferner with a glider; he landed at Lermoos after a 25-minute flight. The glider had been disassembled into individual parts and transported up the Zugspitze by cable car. In the winter of 1931/32, a post office was set up on the Zugspitze by the German Imperial Post Office or &quot;Reichspost&quot;. It still exists today in the &quot;Sonnalpin&quot; restaurant and has the postal address: &quot;82475 Zugspitze&quot;. In 1931, four years after the first glider flight, the first balloon took off from the Zugspitze.

In April 1933, the mountain was occupied by 24 storm troopers, who hoisted a swastika flag on top the tower on the weather station. A month later, SA and SS deployed on the Schneeferner in the shape of a swastika. On 20 April 1945 the US Air Force dropped bombs on the Zugspitze that destroyed the valley station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway and the hotel on the ridge. After the war the Allies seized the railway and Schneefernerhaus.

Shortly after World War II the US military took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. Room rates, including meals, were US$1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of US$0.25 per hour.

In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (&quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot;) began operating a microwave radio station at the summit. In September of that year, three artistes walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on a tightrope on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (&quot;Gatterlmesse&quot;) has been held on the &quot;Gatterl&quot; mountain to commemorate the four members of the Bavarian Border Police who died in an avalanche in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze.

In 1962, a fire destroyed the ridge hotel by the mountain station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The 1976 Friuli earthquake was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist feared that the observation tower might collapse. In 1981 a chapel was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Joseph Ratzinger, in October on the feast of Visitation. On 25 March, an automated teller machine was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450-square-metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.

Since 2000, the Zugspitze extreme mountain run has been held annually. In July 2008, there were repercussions in the media when, as the result of a sudden drop in temperature, two participants died of exhaustion and hypothermia At the end of August 2009 the Swiss, Freddy Nock, walked along a cable of the Zugspitze Glacier Cable Car from the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; to the summit. He covered the 995-metre-long, up to 56% steep route, which had a height difference of 348 metres, unsecured in 50 minutes.

== Alpinism ==
=== First ascent ===

There are several theories about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th-century map describes the route &quot;along the path to the Zugspitze&quot; (&quot;ybers blath uf Zugspitze&quot;) and gives a realistic duration of 8.5 hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that smugglers used routes over the Zugspitze summit. As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, in the course of this work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von Coulon, had reached the summit. Since Coulon worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.

The first recorded ascent of the Zugspitze was achieved on 27 August 1820 by Lieutenant Josef Naus and mountain guide, Johann Georg Tauschl together with Naus&#x27; survey assistant and batman (servant), Maier. As early as 21 July Naus, an officer in the Bavarian Army, had asked about the route through the Reintal valley to the Northern Schneeferner. The lieutenant was taking part in a survey exercise by the Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau (&quot;Königlich Bairischen Topographischen Bureau&quot;) for the Atlas of Bavaria (&quot;Atlas von Bayern&quot;) in the Werdenfelser Land. On 26 August, the three of them climbed in a group together with Captain Jetze and Lieutenant Antlischek up to the shepherd&#x27;s hut of &quot;Angerhütte&quot;.

On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier set off for the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they attempted to reach the West Summit along the west ridge. Their first attempt failed, but a second was successful and they finally reached the West Summit around 11:45 am, where they left behind a &quot;bergstock&quot; and cloth to mark their success. A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August they returned to the shepherd&#x27;s hut at about 3 in the morning. The mountain guide, Tauschl, was given payment of two gulden and 42 kreuzer.

=== Subsequent ascents ===

In 1823, Simon Resch and the sheep &quot;Toni&quot; became the first to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the mountain guide, Johann Barth. Because Resch&#x27;s first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed for a third time by royal forester&#x27;s assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria&#x27;s Crown Princess Marie. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze.

The first crossing from the West to the East Summit was achieved in 1857 by Dr. Härtringer from Munich and mountain guide, Joseph Ostler. The Irish brother, Trench, and Englishman, Cluster, succeeded in climbing the West Summit on 8 July 1871 through the Austrian Cirque (&quot;Österreichische Schneekar&quot;) under the guidance of brothers, Joseph and Joseph Sonnweber. The route through the Höllental valley to the Zugspitze was first used on 26 September 1876 by Franz Tillmetz and Franz Johannes with guides, Johann and Joseph Dengg. The first winter ascent of the West Summit took place on 7 Januar 1882; the climbers being Ferdinand Kilger, Heinrich Schwaiger, Josef and Heinrich Zametzer and Alois Zott. The Jubilee Arête (&quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot;) was first crossed in its entirety on 2 September 1897 by Ferdinand Henning. The number of climbers on the Zugspitze rose sharply year on year. If the summit had been climbed 22 times in 1854, by 1899 it had received 1,600 ascents. Before the construction of a cable car in 1926 there had already been over 10,000 ascents.

=== Normal routes ===
==== Zugspitzplatt via the Reintal or Gatterl ====

The easiest of the normal routes runs through the Reintal valley and is that followed during the first ascent. At the same time it is also the longest climb. Its start point is the ski stadium () at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The route runs through the gorge of the Partnachklamm and along the Partnach river to the Bock Hut (), where the Reintal begins. Above the Partnach, which has meanwhile sunk underground, the route runs up to the Reintalanger Hut (). From there the climb is relatively gentle to start with, but then becomes steeper. From the hut the track runs through the &quot;Brunntal&quot; up to the Knorr Hut (), which stands on the eastern rim of the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot;. Here it meets the alternative route from Ehrwald via the Gaistal and the &quot;Gatterl&quot; at the Reintal Way. The route now runs over the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; towards the Northern Schneeferner. The protected section of the climb to the Zugspitze summit begins above the &quot;Sonn-Alpin&quot; restaurant at &quot;Point 2815&quot;. The route climbs through a height of 2,232metres and the true duration is between eight and ten hours.

==== Höllental ====

The ascent starts in Hammersbach () through the Höllental along the &quot;Hammersbach&quot; stream. The path runs through the Höllental Gorge (&quot;Höllentalklamm&quot;) and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026 metre long gorge with a total length of 288 metres. Another 569 metres of path was dynamited into the rock in the shape of a half profile, whilst 120 metres was led over footbridges and 49 metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 gold marks. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge. The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the &quot;Stangensteig&quot; path. After the gorge the route heads for the Höllentalanger Hut (), after which it crosses the &quot;Höllentalanger&quot; stream. Above that the &quot;Brett&quot; is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the &quot;Grünen Buckel&quot; the trail runs up to the Höllentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the randkluft because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a &quot;klettersteig&quot; to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of , for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the Höllental route on the &quot;Riffelsteig&quot; path from Eibsee. This path crosses the &quot;Riffelscharte&quot; wind gap and meets the route before the &quot;Brett&quot;.

==== Austrian Cirque ====
A third ascent runs across the Austrian Cirque or &quot;Österreichische Schneekar&quot;. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee () or the village of Ehrwald (). The two trails merge above the cirque of &quot;Gamskar&quot;. Thereafter the route continues to the Wiener-Neustädter Hut () and through the &quot;Österreichische Schneekar&quot;, at the end of which a &quot;klettersteig&quot; begins. During this section the route climbs through the &quot;Stopselzieher&quot;, a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs in height.

=== Jubilee Ridge (&quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot;) ===

One of the best-known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps is the Jubilee Ridge, which runs eastwards from the Zugspitze to the Hochblassen () and crosses the Inner (), Middle () and Outer Höllentalspitze () as well as the Vollkarspitze (). Along the way the route branches off towards &quot;Grießkarscharte&quot; () and to the Alpspitze (). Between 1909 and 1915 the ridge was partially secured with wire cables by the German Alpine Club section at Munich. Originally the route was called the Jubilee Way (&quot;Jubiläumsweg&quot;), but after a tragic rescue attempt in 1979 the rather erroneous and misleading term, which suggested it was just a normal trail, was replaced by the name &quot;Jubiläumsgrat&quot;, a &quot;Grat&quot; being a sharp ridge.

During the crossing, which is not a pure &quot;klettersteig&quot;, several unprotected sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to climbing grade III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty (D). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer Höllentalspitze is the &quot;Höllengrat Hut&quot; (), a bothy where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the &quot;Brunntalgrat&quot; ridge and joins the route in the area of the Inner Höllentalspitze.

=== Accommodation ===

There are numerous mountain huts in the area of the Zugspitze. One base is the Höllentalanger Hut () in the Höllental valley with 88 mattress spaces. Accommodation in the Reintal is provided by the Reintalanger Hut () with 90 bedspaces and on the edge of the &quot;Zugspitzplatt&quot; by the Knorr Hut () with 108 bedspaces. The Knorr Hut was the first hut in the entire Wetterstein Mountains when it was built in 1855. All the huts are open from May to October depending on the weather. On the top of the Zugspitze are three more huts: the Wiener-Neustädter Hut, the Münchner Haus and the Schneefernerhaus.

;Wiener-Neustädter Hut
The first hut on the Zugspitze was the Wiener-Neustädter Hut (&quot;Wiener-Neustädter-Hütte&quot;, ) built in 1884. It acts as a base for the &quot;klettersteig&quot; through the &quot;Österreichische Schneekar&quot; that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is operated by the Austrian Tourist Club and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The winter room is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities.

;Münchner Haus
There has been an accommodation hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the Alpine Club section at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although further development of the summit for tourism was criticised, more and more members supported the construction of a larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the Münchner Haus (). First, in 1896, a 200 square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21 kilometre long telephone cable and a 5.5 kilometre long lightning conductor. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 people stay there each year, in addition to day visitors.

;Schneefernerhaus
The Schneefernerhaus () was built in 1930 as the station of the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway. In June 1931 the attached hotel was opened. After the war, US Forces commandeered the house as a &quot;recreation facility&quot;. It was not released until 1952 and was then renovated, opening in December that same year. On 15 May 1965 it was hit by a serious avalanche. The avalanche had been triggered above the house and swept over the sun terrace. Ten people died and 21 were seriously injured. At the end of the 1980s the station was moved and, in January 1992, the hotel and restaurant closed. Between 1993 and 1997 it was extensively converted into a research station, that opened in 1996. During the building work there was a fire in 1994 that completely destroyed the fifth floor and the roof space.

== Tourism ==
=== Winter sports ===

For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can be followed to the top. Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days, or a few hours for the very fit. Food and lodging is available on some trails. In winter the Zugspitze is a popular skiing and snowboarding destination, with several slopes on both sides. The Zugspitzplatt is Germany&#x27;s highest ski resort, and thus normally has sufficient snow throughout the winter.

=== Climbing ===
At the Zugspitze&#x27;s summit is the &quot;Münchner Haus&quot;, a mountain hut (&quot;Alpenhütte&quot;), a facility built by the German Alpine Club (&quot;Deutscher Alpenverein&quot;). For more than a hundred years, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the Global Atmosphere Watch.
Climbing up the Zugspitze can involve several routes. The large difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is , making the climb a challenge even for trained mountaineers.

On the German side, from Garmisch-Partenkirchen, climbers go either through the Höllental (&quot;Valley of Hell&quot;) or the Reintal. The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours. This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic gorge, then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit. Climbers can stay for the night at two alpine huts, the &quot;Reintalangerhütte&quot; or the &quot;Knorrhütte&quot;.

The more popular, but harder route is through the Höllental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the Höllentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the &quot;Höllentalangerhütte&quot;, where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the Höllentalferner, the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. &quot;Klettersteig&quot; equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours.

From the Austrian village of Ehrwald, there are also two variants. One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard. It includes a &quot;via ferrata&quot;, and there is a hut called &quot;Wiener Neustädter Hütte&quot; by the Austrian Alpine Club. An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called &quot;Gatterl&quot;, joining the Reintal path at the Knorrhütte.

<doc id="289706" wikidata="Q827903" url="?curid=289706" title="New Jersey Route 284">
<text>Route 284 is a 7.03-mile (11.31 km) state highway in New Jersey, United States, running from Route 23 in Sussex north to the New York state line in Wantage Township. From there, New York State Route 284 (NY 284) continues north to U.S. Route 6 (US 6) at Slate Hill. The route is a connector to Unionville, and intersects with an old alignment of its original designation, Route 84. Route 284 was first a part of Route 8 in the 1920s, becoming Route 8N in 1927 and Route 84 in 1942 before being assigned its current number in 1966.

== Route description ==

Route 284 begins at a signaled intersection in Sussex with Route 23. The route proceeds northward, intersecting with County Route 643 (CR 643) at less than a half-mile into the highway. Route 284 leaves the borough of Sussex and enters Wantage Township, intersecting with Layton Road, Janice Drive, and Possum River Road. Route 284 passes to the south of a lake, crosses over a branch of the Wallkill River and intersects with CR 642 (Bassets Bridge Road). Just after the intersection with Route 642, the rural highway crosses over Quarryville Brook. At , Route 284 intersects with an old routing of its original designation, Route 84. The original alignment merges in with Route 284 less than a mile later. After crossing the Wallkill River branch again and the Appalachian Trail, Route 284 leaves New Jersey for New York and becomes NY 284.

==History==

Route 8, one of the routes assigned before the 1927 renumbering, ran largely along the present Route 23 corridor, but at Sussex it turned north rather than continuing northwest through High Point State Park. The section from Sussex north to the state line was taken over by the state in 1919. In the 1927 renumbering, the majority of Route 8 became Route 23. The part north of Sussex was proposed to become part of Route 31, but that was instead moved to the present Route 94 corridor in the final version of the bill. As Route 8 north of Sussex was not assigned a number, the State Highway Commission appended a suffix of N (to distinguish it from new Route 8), forming Route 8N. The connecting route in New York had been numbered New York State Route 8 to match New Jersey, but in the 1930 renumbering it became New York State Route 84, in order to free up the number 8 for a longer route. New Jersey renumbered its Route 8N to Route 84 in March 1942 to match, in part to provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.

The final renumbering was made in 1966, when Interstate 84 (I-84) opened in New York. As the new I-84 was close to the older Route 84, Route 84 was renumbered in both New York and New Jersey to 284.

<doc id="289710" wikidata="Q898574" url="?curid=289710" title="Turbidity">
<text>Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of both water clarity and water quality.

Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.

==Causes and effects==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton. Human activities that disturb land, such as construction, mining and agriculture, can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to storm water runoff. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as urbanized areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater pollution from paved surfaces such as roads, bridges, parking lots and airports. Some industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop gastrointestinal diseases. This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like viruses or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for viruses and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from ultraviolet (UV) sterilization of water.

In water bodies such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.

For many mangrove areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of Australia, in particular Moreton Bay, turbidity levels as high as 600 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper ecosystem health.

==Measurement==

The measurement of turbidity is a key test of both water clarity and water quality. There are two standard units for reporting turbidity: Formazin Nephelometric Units (FNU) from ISO 7027 and Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) from USEPA Method 180.1. ISO 7027 and FNU is mostly widely used in Europe, whereas NTU is mostly widely used in the U.S. The ISO 7027 provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the concentration of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a photodiode, which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. Open source hardware has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an Arduino microcontroller and inexpensive LEDs.

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of attenuation (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or JTU) is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a nephelometer with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are many small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer can be either NTU or FTU, depending on the standard method used. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a Secchi disk. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the euphotic zone with a 3-fold division of the &quot;Secchi depth&quot;, however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube. The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (TL).

==Standards and test methods==
===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, public water systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods must not have a turbidity higher than 1.0 NTU at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU. The European turbidity standard is 4 NTU.

===Ambient water standards===
====United States====
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity. These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop water quality standards for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have promulgated water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* Louisiana: 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.
* Vermont: 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.
* Washington: 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.

===Analytical methods===
Published analytical test methods for turbidity include:
* ISO 7027 &quot;Water Quality: Determination of Turbidity&quot;
* US EPA Method No. 180.1, &quot;Turbidity&quot;
* &quot;Standard Methods&quot;, No. 2130B.

==Treatment==

Turbidity is commonly treated using a settling or filtration process, or both settling and filtration. Depending on the application, flocculants may be dosed into the water stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. Potable water treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of settling tanks, granular media filtration, and clarifiers.

In-situ water treatment or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a flocculant, evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at coal mines and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of chemical reagents that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents that are available for treating turbidity include aluminium sulfate or alum (Al2(SO4)3·nH2O), ferric chloride (FeCl3), gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), poly-aluminium chloride, long chain acrylamide-based polymers and numerous proprietary reagents. The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the pH of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the flocs may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

<text>Kjell Aukrust (19 March 1920 – 24 December 2002) was a Norwegian author, poet, artist and humorist. Aukrust is principally known for his Flåklypa stories and Flåklypa drawings.

==Personal life==
Aukrust was born in Alvdal in Hedmark, Norway as a son of Lars Olsen Aukrust (1886–1965) and Louise Walmsnæss (1887–1973). His father was rector at Storsteigen Agricultural School in Alvdal. He was a nephew of poet Olav Aukrust, brother of Odd Aukrust, a noted economist who was responsible for research at Statistics Norway. He was married to Kari Holter in 1947.
He trained at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry 1938–42. In 1939, one of his drawings was accepted at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo. His memoirs of his childhood in Alvdal appeared in the series of three books: &quot;Simen&quot;, &quot;Bonden&quot; and &quot;Bror Min&quot; published in 1958, 1964 and 1960.

==Career==

He is most famous for his creation of the fictional Norwegian village of Flåklypa populated with a cast of idiosyncratic characters. 
He created the Flåklypa society while being an illustrator and columnist for the magazine &quot;Mannskapsavisa&quot;, with characters such as Reodor Felgen, Solan Gundersen, Ludvig and Emanuel Desperados. His column, which was modelled as a collection of satirical newspaper articles, was eventually renamed &quot;Flåklypa Tidende&quot;. This setting was the basis of the 1975 animated film &quot;Flåklypa Grand Prix&quot;, directed by Ivo Caprino. The film was the first full-length animated feature in Norway, became an international success and has been translated into more than seventy languages. In Britain it is known as &quot;Pinchcliffe Grand Prix&quot;. The protagonist Reodor Felgen (English version: Theodore Rimspoke) has become synonymous in Norway with Rube Goldberg type contraptions.

Some of the characters who populated the village of Pinchcliffe were also the basis for the first full-length hand drawn animated feature in Norway, &quot;Solan, Ludvig og Gurin med reverompa&quot;. Released in 1998, this movie takes place in Oslo and Alvdal. In Britain it is known as &quot;Gurin with the Foxtail&quot;.

==Huset Aukrust==
In 1996, Aukrustsenteret (now Huset Aukrust) was opened in Alvdal. The center was designed by architect Sverre Fehn. In addition to Aukrust&#x27;s drawings, Huset Aukrust contains many of Kjell Aukrust&#x27;s imaginative technical devices, such as a model of Il Tempo Gigante, the car featured in the film &quot;Flåklypa Grand Prix&quot;.

<text>The Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal (C&amp;D Canal) is a -long, -wide and -deep ship canal that connects the Delaware River with the Chesapeake Bay in the states of Delaware and Maryland in the United States.

In the mid-17th century, mapmaker Augustine Herman observed that these great bodies of water were separated only by a narrow strip of land. In 1764, a survey of possible water routes across the Delmarva Peninsula was made, but little action followed. The idea was raised again in 1788 by regional business leaders, including famed Philadelphians Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush.

Despite the beginnings of a commercial venture in 1802 coincident with Canal Mania in England and Wales, it was not until 1829 until the C&amp;D Canal Company could, at last, announce the waterway &quot;open for business&quot;. Its construction cost of $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) made it one of the most expensive canal projects of its time.

In the present era, the C&amp;D Canal is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The project office in Chesapeake City, Maryland, is also the site of the C&amp;D Canal Museum and Bethel Bridge Lighthouse. The canal saves approximately 300 miles on the route between Wilmington or Philadelphia on the Delaware River and Baltimore on Chesapeake Bay, avoiding a course around the Delmarva Peninsula.

The canal is a landmark and cultural boundary for the state of Delaware, considered a divide between the urbanized northern portion of the state and the rural southern portion, known locally as &quot;Lower Delaware&quot;, and demarcates an unofficial northern limit to the Delmarva Peninsula.

== Early years ==

In the mid‑17th century, Augustine Herman, a mapmaker and Prague native who had served as an envoy for the Dutch, observed that two great bodies of water, the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay, were separated only by a narrow strip of land. Herman proposed that a waterway be built to connect the two.

More than a century passed before any action was taken. In 1764, a survey of possible water routes across the Delmarva Peninsula was made. One was proposed by Thomas Gilpin, Sr., a Quaker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who, along with other members of the American Philosophical Society, sought a waterway to shorten the shipping distance from the Chesapeake Bay to Philadelphia. He proposed a canal across the Delmarva Peninsula to connect the Chester River at present-day Millington, Maryland, to the Delaware River. He even bought of land, largely in and around Millington, but the canal would not become a reality for decades.

The idea was raised again in 1788 by regional business leaders, including noted Philadelphians Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush. The canal would reduce, by nearly 300 miles (500 km), the water routes between Philadelphia and Baltimore.

In 1802, following actions by the legislatures of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Company was incorporated, with merchant and banker Joseph Tatnall as president. More surveys followed, and in 1804, construction of the canal began under Benjamin Latrobe. The work included 14 locks to connect the Christina River in Delaware with the Elk River at Welch Point, Maryland, but the project was halted two years later for lack of funds.

== Construction ==
The canal company was reorganized in 1822, and new surveys determined that more than $2 million in capital was needed to resume construction. Eventually, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased $100,000 in stock, the State of Maryland, $50,000; and Delaware, $25,000. The federal government invested $450,000, with the remainder subscribed by the public.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played a vital yet unofficial role for the canal company in 1823 and 1824, providing two senior officers to help determine a canal route. The engineer officers and two civilian engineers recommended a new route with four locks, extending from Newbold&#x27;s Landing Harbor (now Delaware City), westward to the Back Creek branch of the Elk River in Maryland.

Canal construction resumed in April 1824, and within several years some 2,600 men were digging and hauling dirt from the ditch. Laborers toiled with pick and shovel at the immense construction task, working for an average daily wage of 75 cents. The swampy marshlands along the canal&#x27;s planned route proved a great impediment to progress; workers continuously battled slides along the &quot;ditch&#x27;s&quot; soft slopes. It was 1829 before the C&amp;D Canal Company could, at last, announce the waterway &quot;open for business&quot;. Its construction cost of $3.5 million made it one of the most expensive canal projects of its time.

In 1825, due to the efforts of Benjamin Wright, the company fired the canal&#x27;s chief engineer, John Randel Jr., who had surveyed its route and built the difficult eastern section. Randel sued the company for breach of contract, and in 1834 a jury returned an award to Randel of $226,885.84 (), a tremendous amount for the time. The canal company&#x27;s appeals went as high as the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed the award. The company attempted to avoid paying the judgment, but the state legislatures of both Maryland and Delaware passed bills requiring the canal company to pay off its debts within five years. The huge award almost bankrupted the company.

== 1829 to 1919 ==
The Chesapeake Bay and Delaware River were now connected by a navigation channel measuring nearly long, deep, wide at the waterline and wide along the channel bottom. A covered wooden bridge at Summit, Delaware, spanned the canal across the &quot;Deep Cut&quot;, measuring between abutments. The bridge floor was above the channel bottom. Three wooden swing bridges also crossed the canal. Locks to pass vessels through the waterway&#x27;s various levels were constructed at Delaware City, Delaware and St. Georges, Delaware, and two at Chesapeake City. Each measured long and wide and was eventually enlarged to in length and in width.

Teams of mules and horses towed freight and passenger barges, schooners and sloops through the canal. Cargoes included practically every useful item of daily life: lumber, grain, farm products, fish, cotton, coal, iron, and whiskey. Packet ships were eventually established to move freight through the waterway. The Ericsson Line operated between Baltimore and Philadelphia, and continued to carry passengers and freight through the canal into the 1940s. The cargo tonnage peaked in 1872 with more than 1.3 million tons transiting the canal.

Along the route across the top of the Delmarva Peninsula, at least six lighthouses warned barges and other vessels passing through the canal when they were approaching bridges and locks. These small wooden lighthouses had had red lanterns mounted atop them.

The Ericsson Line of steamboats originated as steamers built for freight only; however, the line converted to passenger boats during 1876 at the time of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia as the demand for travel increased. The Baltimore and Philadelphia Steamship Companies, which operated the Ericsson line, built and furnished ships with seventy to eighty staterooms in addition to the freight facilities. In turn, these ships grew from less than one hundred to more than six hundred tons and greatly increased travel from Baltimore to Philadelphia. The Ericsson Line was named after its first ship, Ericsson, which was named after John Ericsson who developed the screw propeller that was installed on the vessel specifically designed for the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal. Ericsson was built at Reanie &amp; Neafie&#x27;s shipyard in Philadelphia by Anthony Groves, Jr. The ship, finished in 1843, was in length and weighed eighty tons. It began operations in 1844 under the direction of Captain Noah F. Ireland. The Ericsson Line operated out of Baltimore&#x27;s No. 1 Light Street Pier for 75 years, serving passenger and freight demands throughout the waterway with thirty registered steamers. The Ericsson Line&#x27;s success brought utility and prosperity to the canal and promoted an expansion of trade by means of its growth and connection to the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal.

Loss of water in the locks was a problem from early on. As boats passed through at Chesapeake City, the equivalent of a full lock of water was lost to the lower-lying portion of the canal. This loss, compounded by leakage through the canal banks and normal evaporation, made it necessary to devise a means of lifting water into the project&#x27;s upper part.

A steam operated pump was purchased in 1837 to raise water from Back Creek, and in 1852 a steam engine and large waterwheel were installed at the pumphouse in Chesapeake City. Measuring in diameter and wide, the iron and wood waterwheel had 12 troughs which filled with water as it turned; the water then spilled over the hub into the raceway and into the uppermost canal level. By 1854 a second steam engine was in use. The two engines consumed eight tons of coal daily while lifting 170 tons of water per minute into the canal. The waterwheel and steam engines remained in continuous use through the mid‑1920s.

Throughout the 19th century, the canal&#x27;s use continued to change with the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike and Rail Road being its only major competitor. Steam power brought larger and deeper-draft vessels that could not pass through the restricting locks. By the turn of the 20th century the decline in canal traffic and cost of operation and repairs reduced canal profits. Clearly a larger, wider, and deeper waterway was needed.
At the time, however, little thought was given to improving the existing canal. New companies were formed instead, considering at least six new canal routes, but committees and commissions appointed to study the issue failed to agree on a plan. In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a new commission to report on the feasibility of converting the canal to a &quot;free and open waterway.&quot;

== 1920s to 1970s ==
In 1919 the federal government bought the canal for $2.5 million and designated it the &quot;Intra-coastal Waterway Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Delaware and Maryland.&quot; The purchase included six bridges and a railroad span owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. These were replaced during the 1920s by four vertical lift spans and a new railroad bridge.

Responsibility for operating, maintaining, and improving the waterway was assigned to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District. In the mid-1920s, work began to move the eastern entrance at Delaware City several miles south to Reedy Point, Delaware. All locks (except the one at Delaware City) were removed, and the waterway was converted to a sea-level operation at deep and wide. These improvements cost $10 million. Two stone jetties at the new eastern entrance were completed in 1926. The sole remaining lock at Delaware City — a stone structure, resting on wooden underpinnings, with a wooden floor — would eventually be preserved and, in 1975, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The &quot;new&quot; canal opened in May 1927 with great celebration, even as plans were underway for further expansion to accommodate ever larger ships. The Philadelphia District assumed operation of the canal in 1933. Between 1935 and 1938, the channel was again improved, deepened to and widened to at a cost of nearly $13 million. The project was also expanded to include a federal navigation channel deep and wide for some in the Upper Chesapeake Bay, from the Elk River to Pooles Island.

Through the years, as the sizes and tonnages of ships using the canal continued to grow, accidents and one‑way traffic restrictions strained the canal&#x27;s capacity. Between 1938 and 1950 alone, eight ships collided with bridges. In 1954, the United States Congress authorized further expansion of the channel to wide and deep. These improvements, begun in the 1960s, were completed in the mid‑1970s.

New bridges to accommodate highway traffic crossing the canal also became necessary as deepening and widening progressed. Two mechanical lift bridges at St. Georges and Chesapeake City were toppled by ship collisions and replaced in the 1940s with high-level highway spans (the former, the St. Georges Bridge, has largely been bypassed by the new Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge, opened in 1995). Two other high-level vehicular traffic bridges, Summit Bridge in 1960 and Reedy Point Bridge in 1968, were constructed as part of the 1954 improvement authorization.

In 1966, a new railroad lift bridge (the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Lift Bridge) was also completed by the Corps and turned over to the Pennsylvania Railroad to carry freight across the canal. The railroad and Summit spans were recognized by the American Institute of Steel Construction as the most beautiful bridges of their types in the years they were completed.

After the modern sea-level canal opened in 1927, pilot boats operated by the Army Corps of Engineers worked at each end of the waterway, one assigned to Reedy Point on the Delaware River and the other stationed at Town Point on the Elk River in Maryland. These patrol boats met incoming ships, checked traffic, did patrols, and sometimes made rescues. But modernization had arrived on Canal as closed circuit televisions, radar, and advanced in radio communications made the work of meeting incoming boats and other tasks obsolete. On Nov. 19, 1968, the work of the patrol boats was retired, and modern, centralized technology took over the tasks.

== Post-1970s ==

Today&#x27;s canal is a modern sea-level, electronically controlled commercial waterway, serving as the northern maritime gateway to the Port of Baltimore.

Since 1933 the Corps&#x27; Philadelphia District has managed canal and highway bridge operations from a two-story white frame building on the canal&#x27;s southern bank at Chesapeake City, Maryland. Cargo ships, tankers, container-carrying vessels (all up to Seawaymax-classification), barges accompanied by tugboats, and countless recreational boats create a steady flow of traffic. Through state-of-the-art fiber optic and microwave links, dispatchers use closed-circuit television and radio systems to monitor and safely move commercial traffic through the waterway.

Navigating oceangoing vessels requires extensive maritime skills, with strong currents or bad weather conditions adding to the risks. A United States Coast Guard certified pilot is required for vessels engaged in foreign trade transiting the canal, the Delaware River and Bay, and Chesapeake Bay. Many shipping firms use pilots from the Delaware River and Bay or Maryland pilots&#x27; associations.

Typically a Delaware River and Bay pilot boards a ship as it passes Lewes, Delaware, entering the Delaware Bay, and guides the vessel up the bay and into the canal to Chesapeake City. A Maryland pilot then takes over and continues the ship&#x27;s transit into the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore or Annapolis, Maryland. The procedure is reversed for eastbound ships. At Chesapeake City a &quot;changing of the pilots&quot; takes place, while the pilot launch maneuvers alongside a vessel as it continues its journey without stopping. The pilots use the ship&#x27;s gangway, pilot ladder, or port entrance to climb aboard or leave the vessel.

==C&amp;D Canal Museum==

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the C&amp;D Canal Museum at Chesapeake City, Maryland, housed in the original canal pumphouse with a waterwheel and pumping engines. The museum illustrates the canal&#x27;s history and operations. Current operations can be viewed through a television monitor affording visitors up-to-the minute locations on ships traveling through the canal. Admission is free, and the museum is open Monday-Friday year round except for government holidays.

A full-sized replica of the Bethel Bridge Lighthouse is located on Corps property, a short walk from the museum. The original lighthouse was used to warn vessels of locks and bridges in the days before the 1927 canal changes made it sea level.

<text>Interplay Entertainment Corp. is an American video game developer and publisher based in Los Angeles. The company was founded in 1983 as Interplay Productions by developers Brian Fargo, Jay Patel, Troy Worrell, and Rebecca Heineman, as well as investor Chris Wells. As a developer, Interplay is best known as the creator of the &quot;Fallout&quot; series and as a publisher for the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot; series.

== History ==

=== Interplay Productions ===

Prior to Interplay, the company&#x27;s founding developers—Brian Fargo, Troy Worrell, Jay Patel, and Rebecca Heineman—worked for Boone Corporation, a video game developer based in California. When Boone eventually folded, the four got together with investor Chris Wells and, believing they could create a company that was better than Boone, founded Interplay in October 1983. The first projects were non-original and consisted of software conversions and even some military work for Loral Corporation. After negotiations with Activision, Interplay entered a US$100,000 contract to produce three illustrated text adventures for them. Published in 1984, &quot;Mindshadow&quot; is loosely based on Robert Ludlum&#x27;s &quot;Bourne Identity&quot; while &quot;The Tracer Sanction&quot; puts the player in the role of an interplanetary secret agent. &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; which features a script by Arnie Katz&#x27;s &quot;Subway Software&quot; followed in 1985. These adventures built upon work previously done by Fargo; his first game was the 1981-published &quot;Demon&#x27;s Forge&quot;.

The same year, Interplay Productions, then contracted out by Electronic Arts, ported EA&#x27;s &quot;Racing Destruction Set&quot; to the Atari 8-bit computers. The conversion, entirely coded by Rebecca Heineman, was released in 1986 via Electronic Arts for the United States and Ariolasoft for the European market.

Interplay&#x27;s parser was developed by Fargo and an associate and in one version understands about 250 nouns and 200 verbs as well as prepositions and indirect objects. In 1986, &quot;Tass Times in Tonetown&quot; followed. Interplay made a name for itself as a quality developer of role-playing video games with the three-part series &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985–1988), critically acclaimed &quot;Wasteland&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dragon Wars&quot; (1989). All of them were published by Electronic Arts.

Interplay started publishing its own games, beginning with &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and &quot;Battle Chess&quot;, in 1988, and then moved on to publish and distribute games from other companies, while continuing internal game development. In 1995, Interplay published the hit game &quot;Descent&quot;, developed by startup Parallax Software. Interplay published several &quot;Star Trek&quot; video games, including &quot;Star Trek: 25th Anniversary&quot; for computers and for Nintendo Entertainment System and &quot;Star Trek: Judgment Rites&quot;. These games had later CD-ROM editions released with the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast providing voices. Interplay also published &quot;Starfleet Academy&quot; and &quot;Klingon Academy&quot; games, and &quot;Starfleet Command&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command&quot;. Another game, &quot;Star Trek: Secret of Vulcan Fury&quot;, was in development in the late 1990s but was never completed and much of its staff laid off due to budgetary cuts prompted by various factors. In 1995, after several years of delays, Interplay finally published its role-playing game &quot;Stonekeep&quot;. Other PC games released during the mid- to late 1990s included &quot;Carmageddon&quot;, &quot;Fragile Allegiance&quot;, &quot;Hardwar&quot; and &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot;.

In 1997, Interplay developed and released &quot;Fallout&quot;, a successful and critically acclaimed role-playing video game set in a retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. Black Isle Studios, a newly created in-house developer, followed with the sequel, &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, in 1998. Another successful subsequent Interplay franchise was &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game that was developed by BioWare and which spawned a successful expansion, sequel and spin-off series. The spin-off series started with &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot;; the game&#x27;s success forged a sequel as well. Aside from &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;, Interplay published a few notable console series such as &quot;Loaded&quot; and the fighting game series &quot;ClayFighter&quot; and the games by Shiny Entertainment, &quot;MDK&quot; and &quot;Wild 9&quot;.

=== Rebranding as Interplay Entertainment, Titus minority acquisition (1998–2002) ===
In 1998, Interplay&#x27;s financial issues became dire. To avert bankruptcy, Interplay went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the name Interplay Entertainment.

By 1999, Interplay continued to endure losses under Brian Fargo due to increased competition, less-than-stellar returns on Interplay&#x27;s sports division, and the lack of console titles. Because of this, the company forced itself to seek additional funding from an outside third party. On February 17, 1999, the company entered into a distribution agreement with British game publisher Virgin Interactive, where Interplay would acquire a 43.9% stake (initially a 49.9% stake) in the company and allow Virgin to exclusively distribute their titles in Europe, effectively replacing Interplay&#x27;s own distribution arm in the region. Interplay also announced that they would distribute Virgin Interactive&#x27;s titles in North America and several other territories including South America and Japan. On March 23, 1999, it was announced that the Paris-based Titus Interactive had invested $10 million in the publisher with a considered chance of purchasing Universal Pictures&#x27; stake in Interplay, which would allow Titus to own 34% of the company&#x27;s shares and allow for Interplay to distribute Titus&#x27; products in North America. By May, $25 million was invested by Titus, which within a few months was increased by another $10 million. By August, Titus owned 57% of Interplay&#x27;s shares.

On 16 April 2001, Titus announced they had expanded their control shares in Interplay to 72.5%. On the same day, they announced they had purchased Interplay&#x27;s stake in Virgin Interactive, effectively making the latter a fully-owned subsidiary of Titus, which was to allow the three companies to simplify their European distribution arms under the singular Virgin Interactive umbrella. On August 28, Titus announced that they had appointed Vivendi Universal Publishing as Interplay&#x27;s North American distributor in order for Interplay to focus more on development. Prior to this, Titus resecured full distribution rights to its titles in North America, which were not counted for as part of the Vivendi Universal deal. On September 27, Interplay announced that &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; and &quot;&quot; would become the first titles under the new agreement. On November 29, 2001, BioWare announced that they had ended their partnership with Interplay, citing unpaid royalties and Titus sublicensing distribution to third-parties for the reason. BioWare took &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; with them, with Infogrames purchasing worldwide publishing rights to the title in January 2002, while BioWare eventually reconsidered with Interplay.

===Continued struggles (2002–2018)===
On January 24, 2002, Interplay founder and CEO Brian Fargo resigned from the company, following Interplay&#x27;s failed move to expand to console gaming as well as conflictions with Titus Interactive. He later went on to found InXile Entertainment. Titus&#x27; co-founder Hervé Caen took over as Interplay&#x27;s new CEO and began a range of several unpopular but arguably necessary decisions to cancel various projects, in order to save the company. In April 2002, the company sold Shiny Entertainment to Infogrames for $47 million, which at turn also included a then-upcoming video game based on &quot;The Matrix&quot; as well as the video game rights to the property transferring over. Due to a low share price, Interplay&#x27;s shares were delisted from the NASDAQ in 2002 and now trade on the over the counter (OTC) market.

The company continued to struggle throughout 2003 following an assortment of poorly-selling console titles. On September 29, 2003, the company was entered into a lawsuit with Vivendi Universal over alleged breaches of their partnership and a failure of payment. This led to Interplay ending their North American distribution deal with Vivendi Universal Games. On December 8, 2003, Interplay closed down Black Isle Studios and laid off their entire staff. The company was also involved in issues including debt. Feargus Urquhart later left Black Isle Studios and Interplay suffered a loss of US$20 million in that year.

By June 2004, Interplay&#x27;s fate was appearing to show, once employees were showing up locked out of the company&#x27;s offices and other events ensuring, although Titus&#x27; co-founder Eric Caen denied that Interplay was closing, deeming them as being &quot;Still There&quot;. However, by June 7, it was reported that several California labor investigators had forcefully shut down Interplay&#x27;s offices over unpaid royalties to developers, unpaid employees and not issuing any health insurance to them. By June 9, Interplay&#x27;s offices had reopened after Herve Caen secured the funds to pay the insurance for Interplay&#x27;s staff. On the same day, Titus Interactive announced they were declaring bankruptcy, which made Interplay&#x27;s future uncertain. In July, they sold the &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; franchise to Vivendi Universal Games for $300,000, and in October, licensed the rights to the &quot;Fallout&quot; franchise to Bethesda Softworks under a three-game deal, while Interplay would retain ownership of the franchise as well as full rights to an MMO title – &quot;Fallout Online&quot;. By then, Interplay&#x27;s financial issues began to worsen.

In January 2005, Titus Interactive was officially declared bankrupt and closed down all its French operations effectively. Interplay soon purchased Titus&#x27; former assets and led to the company being burdened with debt.

In 2006, Interplay was brought up to the bankruptcy court once again in order to avoid the company going out of business.

In April 2007, in order to pay off creditors, the company altered its licensing agreement with Bethesda Softworks and sold the Fallout IP to them.

In September 2008, several games from Interplay&#x27;s catalog were re-released on the digital distribution service GOG.com after being unavailable in retail distribution for years.

In August 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the &quot;FreeSpace&quot; franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.

===Focus on re-releases of IP (2018–present)===

Interplay is co-publishing, with 3D Realms, a remaster of Xatrix Entertainment&#x27;s 1999 game &quot;&quot;, which was originally published by Interplay. Known as &quot;Kingpin: Reloaded&quot;, the game will be developed by Slipgate Ironworks. This was announced on January 17, 2020.

In 2021, Interplay, via Black Isle Studios, re-released &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; on modern consoles, and later that year also released a port of it on PC for the first time.

== Litigation ==
In 2003 and 2004 Snowblind Studios and Interplay Entertainment had a dispute regarding the Dark Alliance Engine for &quot;&quot;, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance II&quot;, and the GameCube version of the original &quot;Dark Alliance&quot;. The resolution allowed Interplay to retain the work they had already done using that engine, but not to use it in new work.

Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay in 2009, seeking an injunction to stop Interplay from developing &quot;Fallout Online&quot; and from selling &quot;Fallout Trilogy&quot;. After several trials spanning almost three years, Interplay gave Bethesda the full rights for &quot;Fallout Online&quot; for $2 million. Interplay&#x27;s rights to sell and merchandise &quot;Fallout&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2,&quot; and &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; expired on December 31, 2013.

In 2010, TopWare Interactive revealed that they were developing &quot;Battle vs. Chess&quot; to be published by SouthPeak Games. Interplay sued them and won an injunction to stop sales in the United States. Interplay won the case by default, and a settlement for $200,000 plus interest was agreed upon on November 15, 2012.

<doc id="289727" wikidata="Q828174" url="?curid=289727" title="New Jersey Route 439">
<text>Route 439 is a short state highway in the communities of Elizabeth, Union and Hillside in Union County, New Jersey. The highway is known as the Bayway, North Avenue and Elmora Avenue from the Goethals Bridge and Interstate 278 (I-278) and does a half-loop around Elizabeth, with the designation terminating at an intersection with Route 27 in Elizabeth. The highway originated as part of Route 28 south of the current intersection with Route 28 and Route S24 (which made up several routes) north of that intersection to Route 82. The current designation of Route 439 was assigned in the 1953 renumbering.

==Route description==

Route 439 begins at an intersection with Union County Route 616 (CR 616) and I-278 near the Goethals Bridge in Elizabeth. The highway progresses westward, passing to the south of the Number 22 Elementary School. The surroundings of the highway are densely populated, with buildings surrounding the highway the entire time. Turning to the northeast, Route 439 intersects with the southern terminus of CR 623 (South Broad Street) and enters the small community of Bayway, for which the highway is named. There, the route intersects with U.S. Routes 1 &amp; 9 (US 1/9) at Bayway Circle, where it changes monikers to South Elmora Avenue and continues deeper into Elizabeth.

After the Bayway Circle, Route 439 continues to the northeast and into Elizabeth, where it intersects with CR 514 (Lidgerwood Avenue) and crosses the New Jersey Transit railroad line nearby. The highway then intersects Fay Avenue. The development around the road becomes more residential for a short time along Route 439, until the first intersection with Route 27 (Rahway Avenue), where the commercial development experienced earlier returns. After Route 27, the route&#x27;s loop begins to turn even further northward, where it enters Elmora. The highway passes to the southwest of Carteret Park and soon leaves Elmora.
North of Elmora, Route 439 intersects with CR 610 (West Gand Street) and Route 28 (Westfield Avenue), both of which parallel each other for several miles. After the intersection with Route 28, the highway begins the turn to the east once again. At an intersection with Chilton Street, the highway changes monikers to North Avenue, which it retains for the remaining length. During the curve, Route 439 enters Union and intersects with the southern terminus of Route 82, where Kean University and Phil Rizzuto Park both surround the highway. After Route 82, the highway enters Hillside and begins the eastward progression, passing to the south of Elizabeth River Park. After the curve completes, Route 439 enters Elizabeth again and intersects with County Route 623 once again and continues a short distance, where it terminates at the second intersection with Route 27. North Avenue continues eastward to an interchange with Route 81.

==History==
Route 439 originates as an alignment of New Jersey State Highway Route 28, assigned in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering from Route 28 to the intersection with US 1/9. The highway was set to serve a new Staten Island crossing, which finally opened on June 29, 1928. The highway that ran north of Route 28 and progressed north to the current intersection with Route 82 was New Jersey State Highway Route S-24, which a spur of Route 24 from Phillipsburg to Elizabeth. The designations remained intact for over two decades, but across the Arthur Kill in Staten Island, New York State Route 439 (NY 439) was assigned onto the Goethals Bridge, and when the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering occurred on January 1, 1953, the highway was redesignated as Route 439 to match up at the state line. The NJ alignment has remained intact since, but the New York alignment was decommissioned in 1968.

<text>Survival horror is a subgenre of horror games. Although combat can be part of the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition or weapons, health, speed, and vision, or through various obstructions of the player&#x27;s interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, such as dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.

The term &quot;survival horror&quot; was first used for the original Japanese release of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in 1996, which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Home&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles. Starting with the release of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; in 2005, the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third-person shooter games. This has led game journalists to question whether long-standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a distinct genre often referred to as &quot;action horror.&quot;

== Definition ==
Survival horror refers to a subgenre of survival video games that include horror game elements. The player character is vulnerable and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than the player taking an offensive strategy. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition. Another major theme throughout the genre is that of isolation. Typically, these games contain relatively few non-player characters and, as a result, frequently tell much of their story second-hand through the usage of journals, texts, or audio logs.

While many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms of enemies in a suspenseful environment, survival horror games are distinct from otherwise horror-themed action games. They tend to de-emphasize combat in favor of challenges such as hiding or running from enemies and solving puzzles. Still, it is not unusual for survival horror games to draw upon elements from first-person shooters, or even role-playing games. According to &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Survival horror is different from typical game genres in that it is not defined strictly by specific mechanics, but subject matter, tone, pacing, and design philosophy.&quot;

== Game design ==

=== De-emphasized combat ===
Survival horror games are a subgenre of horror games, where the player is unable to fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually encounters several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as a limited number of weapons or invulnerable enemies; if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as explosives are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players are more vulnerable than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar. This shifts gameplay away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single-player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero.

The survival horror genre is also known for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, levels are designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with mazelike environments, which test the player&#x27;s navigational skills. Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.

=== Enemy design ===
A survival horror storyline usually involves the investigation and confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases used camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk in areas that are concealed from the player&#x27;s view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.

Games typically feature a variety of monsters with unique behavior patterns. Enemies can appear unexpectedly or suddenly, and levels are often designed with scripted sequences where enemies drop from the ceiling or crash through windows. Survival horror games, like many action-adventure games, are sometimes structured around the boss encounter where the player must confront a formidable opponent in order to advance to the next area. These boss encounters draw elements from antagonists seen in classic horror stories, and defeating the boss will advance the story of the game.

== History ==

=== Origins (1980s–1996) ===
The origins of the survival horror game can be traced back to earlier horror fiction novels. Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft&#x27;s Great Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favoring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.

&quot;AX-2: Uchū Yusōsen Nostromo&quot; was a survival horror game developed by Akira Takiguchi, a Tokyo University student and Taito contractor, for the PET 2001. It was ported to the PC-6001 by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined Game Arts), and published by ASCII in 1981, exclusively for Japan. Inspired by the 1979 Japanese only stealth game &quot;Manbiki Shounen&quot; (Shoplifting Boy) by Hiroshi Suzuki and the 1979 sci-fi horror film &quot;Alien&quot;, the gameplay of &quot;Nostromo&quot; involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding the sight of an invisible alien, which only becomes visible when appearing in front of the player. The gameplay also involved limited resources, where the player needs to collect certain items in order to escape the ship, and if certain required items are not available in the warehouse, the player is unable to escape and eventually has no choice but to be caught and killed by the alien.

Another early example is the 1982 Atari 2600 game &quot;Haunted House&quot;. Gameplay is typical of future survival horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses creatures commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, each of which has unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.

Malcolm Evans&#x27; &quot;3D Monster Maze&quot;, released for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1982, is a first-person game without a weapon; the player cannot fight the enemy, a Tyrannosaurus rex, so they must escape by finding the exit before the monster finds them. The game states its distance and awareness of the player, further raising tension. &quot;Edge&quot; stated it was about &quot;fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who’s going to get you in the end&quot; and considers it &quot;the original survival horror game&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; stated, &quot;Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could’ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans’ massive hit.&quot;

1982 saw the release of another early horror game, Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Terror House&quot;, based on traditional Japanese horror, released as a Bandai LCD Solarpower handheld game. It was a solar-powered game with two LCD panels on top of each other to enable impressive scene changes and early pseudo-3D effects. The amount of ambient light the game received also had an effect on the gaming experience. Another early example of a horror game released that year was Sega&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Monster Bash&quot;, which introduced classic horror-movie monsters, including the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, and werewolves, helping to lay the foundations for future survival horror games. Its 1986 remake &quot;Ghost House&quot; had gameplay specifically designed around the horror theme, featuring haunted house stages full of traps and secrets, and enemies that were fast, powerful, and intimidating, forcing players to learn the intricacies of the house and rely on their wits. Another game that has been cited as one of the first horror-themed games is Quicksilva&#x27;s 1983 maze game &quot;Ant Attack&quot;.

The latter half of the 1980s saw the release of several other horror-themed games, including Konami&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot; in 1986, and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Kenseiden&quot; and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Splatterhouse&quot; in 1988, though despite the macabre imagery of these games, their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time. &quot;Splatterhouse&quot; in particular is notable for its large amount of bloodshed and terror, despite being an arcade beat &#x27;em up with very little emphasis on survival.

&quot;Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead&quot;, a 1987 title developed by Fun Factory and published by Victor Music Industries for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC Engine platforms, is considered the first true survival horror game by Kevin Gifford (of &quot;GamePro&quot; and 1UP) and John Szczepaniak (of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; and &quot;The Escapist&quot;). Designed by Katsuya Iwamoto, the game was a horror action RPG revolving around a female SWAT member Lila rescuing survivors in an isolated monster-infested town and bringing them to safety in a church. It has open environments like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and real-time side-view battles like &quot;Zelda II&quot;, though &quot;War of the Dead&quot; departed from other RPGs with its dark and creepy atmosphere expressed through the storytelling, graphics, and music. The player character has limited ammunition, though the player character can punch or use a knife if out of ammunition. The game also has a limited item inventory and crates to store items, and introduced a day-night cycle; the player can sleep to recover health, and a record is kept of how many days the player has survived. In 1988, &quot;War of the Dead Part 2&quot; for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned the RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted action-adventure elements from &quot;Metal Gear&quot; while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor.

However, the game often considered the first true survival horror, due to having the most influence on &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, was the 1989 release &quot;Sweet Home&quot;, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. &quot;Sweet Home&quot;″s gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, which could lead to permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider &quot;Sweet Home&quot; to be the first true survival horror game.

In 1989, Electronic Arts published &quot;Project Firestart&quot;, developed by Dynamix. Unlike most other early games in the genre, it featured a science fiction setting inspired by the film &quot;Alien&quot;, but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games in many ways. Travis Fahs considers it the first to achieve &quot;the kind of fully formed vision of survival horror as we know it today,&quot; citing its balance of action and adventure, limited ammunition, weak weaponry, vulnerable main character, feeling of isolation, storytelling through journals, graphic violence, and use of dynamically triggered music - all of which are characteristic elements of later games in the survival horror genre. Despite this, it is not likely a direct influence on later games in the genre and the similarities are largely an example of parallel thinking.

In 1992, Infogrames released &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, which has been considered a forefather of the genre. The game featured a lone protagonist against hordes of monsters, and made use of traditional adventure game challenges such as puzzle-solving and finding hidden keys to new areas. Graphically, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; uses static prerendered camera views that were cinematic in nature. Although players had the ability to fight monsters as in action games, players also had the option to evade or block them. Many monsters could not be killed, and thus could only be dealt with using problem-solving abilities. The game also used the mechanism of notes and books as expository devices. Many of these elements were used in later survival horror games, and thus the game is credited with making the survival horror genre possible.

In 1994, Riverhillsoft released &quot;Doctor Hauzer&quot; for the 3DO. Both the player character and the environment are rendered in polygons. The player can switch between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead. In a departure from most survival horror games, &quot;Doctor Hauzer&quot; lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house&#x27;s traps and solve puzzles. The sound of the player character&#x27;s echoing footsteps change depending on the surface.

In 1995, WARP&#x27;s horror adventure game &quot;D&quot; featured a first-person perspective, CGI full-motion video, gameplay that consisted entirely of puzzle-solving, and taboo content such as cannibalism. The same year, Human Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Clock Tower&quot; was a survival horror game that employed point-and-click graphic adventure gameplay and a deadly stalker known as Scissorman that chases players throughout the game. The game introduced stealth game elements, and was unique for its lack of combat, with the player only able to run away or outsmart Scissorman in order to survive. It features up to nine different possible endings.

The term &quot;survival horror&quot; was first used by Capcom to market their 1996 release, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. It began as a remake of &quot;Sweet Home&quot;, borrowing various elements from the game, such as its mansion setting, puzzles, &quot;opening door&quot; load screen, death animations, multiple endings depending on which characters survive, dual character paths, individual character skills, limited item management, story told through diary entries and frescos, emphasis on atmosphere, and horrific imagery. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; also adopted several features seen in &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, notably its cinematic fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backdrops. The control scheme in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; also became a staple of the genre, and future titles imitated its challenge of rationing very limited resources and items. The game&#x27;s commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console, and also led to a series of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films. Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it.

=== Golden age (1996–2004) ===
The success of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in 1996 was responsible for its formula being used as the basis for a wave of successful survival horror games, many of which were referred to as &quot;&quot;Resident Evil&quot; clones.&quot; The golden age of survival horror started by &quot;Resident Evil&quot; reached its peak around the turn of the millennium with &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, followed by a general decline a few years later. Among the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; clones at the time, there were several survival horror titles that stood out, such as &quot;Clock Tower&quot; (1996) and &quot;Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within&quot; (1998) for the PlayStation. These &quot;Clock Tower&quot; games proved to be hits, capitalizing on the success of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; while staying true to the graphic-adventure gameplay of the original &quot;Clock Tower&quot; rather than following the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; formula. Another survival horror title that differentiated itself was &quot;Corpse Party&quot; (1996), an indie, psychological horror adventure game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like &quot;Clock Tower&quot; and later &quot;Haunting Ground&quot; (2005), the player characters in &quot;Corpse Party&quot; lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. Riverhillsoft&#x27;s &quot;Overblood&quot;, released in 1996, is considered the first survival horror game to make use of a fully three-dimensional virtual environment. &quot;The Note&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Hellnight&quot; in 1998 experimented with using a real-time 3D first-person perspective rather than pre-rendered backgrounds like &quot;Resident Evil&quot;.

In 1998, Capcom released the successful sequel &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, which series creator Shinji Mikami intended to tap into the classic notion of horror as &quot;the ordinary made strange&quot;. Rather than setting the game in a creepy mansion no one would visit, he wanted to use familiar urban settings transformed by the chaos of a viral outbreak. The game sold over five million copies, proving the popularity of survival horror. That year saw the release of Square&#x27;s &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, which combined elements from &quot;Resident Evil&quot; with the RPG gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. It was followed by a more action-based sequel, &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot;, in 1999. In 1998, &quot;Galerians&quot; discarded the use of guns in favour of psychic powers that make it difficult to fight more than one enemy at a time. Also in 1998, &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was a fully 3D survival horror game for the Dreamcast incorporating action elements from beat &#x27;em up and shooter games.

Konami&#x27;s &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, released in 1999, drew heavily from &quot;Resident Evil&quot; while using real-time 3D environments in contrast to &quot;Resident Evil&quot;&#x27;s pre-rendered graphics. &quot;Silent Hill&quot; in particular was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game&#x27;s emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. The game also featured stealth elements, making use of the fog to dodge enemies or turning off the flashlight to avoid detection. The original &quot;Silent Hill&quot; is considered one of the scariest games of all time, and the strong narrative from &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; in 2001 has made the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series one of the most influential in the genre. According to IGN, the &quot;golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo&quot; with the release of &quot;Silent Hill&quot;.

A game similar to the &quot;Clock Tower&quot; series of games and &quot;Haunting Ground&quot;, which was also inspired by &quot;Resident Evil&quot;&#x27;s success, is the Korean game known as &quot;White Day: A Labyrinth Named School&quot; (2001). &quot;White Day&quot; was reportedly so scary that the developers had to release several patches adding multiple difficulty options, and the game was originally slated for localization in 2004 but abruptly cancelled. Building on its previous success in Korea and interest, a remake was developed in 2015.

&quot;Fatal Frame&quot; from 2001 was a unique entry into the genre, as the player explores a mansion and takes photographs of ghosts in order to defeat them. The &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; series has since gained a reputation as one of the most distinctive in the genre, with the first game in the series credited as one of the best-written survival horror games ever made, by UGO Networks. Meanwhile, Capcom incorporated shooter elements into several survival horror titles, such as 2000&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil Survivor&quot; which used both light gun shooter and first-person shooter elements, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil: Dead Aim&quot; which used light gun and third-person shooter elements.

Western developers began to return to the survival horror formula. &quot;The Thing&quot; from 2002 has been called a survival horror game, although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action, and the challenge of holding a team together. The 2004 title &quot;Doom 3&quot; is sometimes categorized as survival horror, although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player&#x27;s ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry. Thus, it is usually considered a first-person shooter with survival horror elements. Regardless, the genre&#x27;s increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games, rather than follow the Japanese survival style.

Overall, the traditional survival horror genre continued to be dominated by Japanese designers and aesthetics. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Clock Tower 3&quot; eschewed the graphic adventure game formula seen in the original &quot;Clock Tower&quot;, and embraced full 3D survival horror gameplay. In 2003, &quot;Resident Evil Outbreak&quot; introduced a new gameplay element to the genre: online multiplayer and cooperative gameplay. Sony employed &quot;Silent Hill&quot; director Keiichiro Toyama to develop &quot;Siren&quot;. The game was released in 2004, and added unprecedented challenge to the genre by making the player mostly defenseless, thus making it vital to learn the enemy&#x27;s patrol routes and hide from them. However, reviewers eventually criticized the traditional Japanese survival horror formula for becoming stagnant. As the console market drifted towards Western-style action games, players became impatient with the limited resources and cumbersome controls seen in Japanese titles such as &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill 4: The Room&quot;.

=== Transformation (2005–present) ===
In 2005, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; attempted to redefine the genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre. Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Readers&#x27; Picks Top 99 Games&quot; list. However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as &quot;Silent Hill: Homecoming&quot;, and the 2008 version of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. James Stephanie Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.

The original genre has persisted in one form or another. The 2005 release of &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; was praised for both its atmospheric tension and fast action, successfully combining Japanese horror with cinematic action, while &quot;Dead Space&quot; from 2008 brought survival horror to a science fiction setting. However, critics argue that these titles represent the continuing trend away from pure survival horror and towards general action. The release of &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; in 2008 helped popularize cooperative multiplayer among survival horror games, although it is mostly a first-person shooter at its core. Meanwhile, the &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; series has remained true to the roots of the genre, even as &quot;Fatal Frame IV&quot; transitioned from the use of fixed cameras to an over-the-shoulder viewpoint. Also in 2009, &quot;Silent Hill&quot; made a transition to an over-the-shoulder viewpoint in &quot;Silent Hill: Shattered Memories&quot;. This Wii effort was, however, considered by most reviewers as a return to form for the series due to several developmental decisions taken by Climax Studios. This included the decision to openly break the fourth wall by psychologically profiling the player, and the decision to remove any weapons from the game, forcing the player to run whenever they see an enemy.

Examples of independent survival horror games are the &quot;Penumbra&quot; series and &quot;&quot; by Frictional Games, &quot;&quot; by Zeenoh,&quot; Cry of Fear&quot; by Team Psykskallar and &quot;&quot;, all of which were praised for creating a horrific setting and atmosphere without the overuse of violence or gore. In 2010, the cult game &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot; by Access Games was notable for introducing open world nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the genre. &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; effectively incorporated jump scares into the genre with the first game in the series releasing in 2014. Further evolution of the genre was carried out via platforms such as itch.io that allowed independent creators to distribute games more easily and therefore became hives of experimentation, an example of which is the emergence of games with PS1-style low-poly aesthetics, such as those developed by Puppet Combo, that became a genre unto itself which eventually went on to be published on more mainstream storefronts such as Steam. Overall, game developers have continued to make and release survival horror games, and the genre continues to grow among independent video game developers.

&quot;The Last of Us&quot;, released in 2013 by Naughty Dog, incorporated many survival horror elements into a third-person action-adventure game. Set twenty years after a pandemic plague, the player must use scarce ammo and distraction tactics to evade or kill malformed humans infected by a brain parasite, as well as dangerous survivalists. This was followed by a sequel in 2020.

Shinji Mikami, the creator of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise, released his new survival horror game &quot;The Evil Within&quot;, in 2014. Mikami stated that his goal was to bring survival horror back to its roots as he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action. That same year, &quot;&quot;, developed by Creative Assembly and based on the &quot;Alien&quot; science fiction horror film series, was released. The game updated the concept of a single un-killable villain chasing the protagonist throughout most of the game, requiring the player to use stealth in order to survive.

In 2015, &quot;Until Dawn&quot;, developed by Supermassive Games, was published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. The game is an interactive drama in which the player controls multiple characters and features a butterfly effect system in which the player&#x27;s choices can change the story and may dictate who survives the night. All playable characters can survive or die, depending on the choices made. Players explore the environment from a third-person perspective and find clues that may help solve the mystery. 

Multiplayer asymmetrical survival horror games gained popularity as well. &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, released in 2016, features one player taking on the role of a killer and four others play as survivors. The game is also notable for featuring multiple characters from other survival horror franchises, such as &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. Other examples which use similar one versus four gameplay include &quot;Friday the 13th: The Game&quot;, &quot;VHS&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead: The Game&quot;, and &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. 

The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series abandoned its action-oriented direction beginning with 2017&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.&quot; The game utilizes a first-person perspective and encourages resource management and puzzle-solving, more akin to earlier entries in the franchise. Many of these earlier entries were also remade with modern graphics while retaining their survival horror aspects with the remakes of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;, and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. After these were well received, other games were remade, such as the 2024 remake of &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;.

<text>Shiri () is a 1999 South Korean action spy film, written and directed by Kang Je-gyu. It was the first Hollywood-style big-budget blockbuster to be produced in the new Korean film industry (i.e. after Korea&#x27;s major economic boom in the late 1990s). Created as a deliberate homage to the &quot;high-octane&quot; action film made popular by Hollywood through the 1980s, it also contained a story that draws on strong Korean national sentiment to fuel its drama. Much of the film&#x27;s visual style is shared with that of Asian action cinema, particularly Hong Kong action cinema such as John Woo, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam, and the relentless pace of the second unit directors, like Vic Armstrong and Guy Hamilton, in the James Bond films.

The film was released under the name &quot;Shiri&quot; outside of South Korea; in South Korea the title was spelled &quot;Swiri&quot;. The name refers to &quot;Coreoleuciscus splendidus&quot;, a fish found in Korean fresh-water streams. At one point in the film protagonist Park Mu-young has a monologue wherein he describes how the waters from both North and South Korea flow freely together, and how the fish can be found in either water without knowing to which it belongs. This ties into the film&#x27;s ambitions to be the first major-release film to directly address the still-thorny issue of Korean reunification.

==Plot==

In September 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years.

Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jung-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Jung-won is also engaged to a young woman, Lee Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Myung-hyun symbolically gives Jung-won a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Jung-won is worried that he cannot tell her about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.

Jung-won and Jang-gil are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1 km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.

Mu-young and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Jung-won and Jang-gil suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Bang-hee is ordered to eliminate the &#x27;kissing gourami&#x27; obstacle. Jung-won meets with Police Chief Ho to borrow outside forces, but Ho accidentally stands in the path of a bullet fired by Bang-hee&#x27;s sniper rifle.

Mu-young calls Jung-won and issues an ultimatum: he has concealed several CTX bombs around Seoul, and will give him just enough time to find each one before setting them off. He also mockingly mentions Jung-won&#x27;s fiancé. It is revealed that Mu-young and Jung-won have a history: Mu-young once hijacked a civilian airliner and killed many civilians, but managed to escape by disguising himself as a wounded member of the flight crew.

The first of the CTX bombs is found on top of a department store, but Mu-young lied about the time factor. The bomb explodes just as the bomb disposal team discovers its exact location, resulting in dozens of deaths. Jung-won takes Myung-hyun to hide out at a hotel, and she begins drinking again.

Jung-won suspects Jang-gil as the leak - who suspects the same thing, as Jung-won has twice survived encounters with Bang-hee he should have died in, and bugged Jung-won&#x27;s car and phone to see if he could learn anything. Jung-won sets a trap by telling Jang-gil he has new information - which Mu-young and his fellow agents step into - but the situation quickly escalates into a firefight, resulting in police and civilian casualties. Several of the Northern agents are killed, while others escape. When Mu-young is cornered, Bang-hee comes in to save him. Jung-won, having survived his stand-off with Mu-young and Bang-hee, follows a wounded Bang-hee. He loses her, but notices the light to the aquarium turn on and covertly enters, discovering a bleeding Myung-hyun removing her disguise. Jung-won walks away, shocked, and conducts a solo investigation into her history with the real, sick Myung-hyun. Mu-young confronts Bang-hee about her hesitancy and constant failure to kill Jung-won, reminding her of their primary objective.

Mu-young calls NIS, demanding millions as well as a plane for an escape at 2pm in return for the remaining CTX. Myung-hyun&#x27;s identity is confirmed by the agency later when electronic surveillance devices are discovered in fish decorating the NIS&#x27;s office, supplied by her. Jang-gil confronts her in her shop, and is shot by Mu-young. Jung-won suddenly appears with officers, who engage in a firefight with Mu-young and his agents. Mu-young and Myung-hyun escape, while a dying Jang-gil hands Myung-hyun&#x27;s soccer match ticket to Jung-won, set to start at 2pm.

The terrorists aim to detonate a CTX bomb directly over the Royal Box, housing all senior North and South Korean politicians, at a soccer stadium in the midst of an international friendly match played between North Korea and South Korea. Jung-won attempts to tell NIS of the ruse and the danger in the stadium but is ignored. He defies orders and rushes to the stadium, where Mu-young, Bang-hee, and other terrorists mingle with the crowd. They find a total ban on all liquids, but enter easily as the CTX and weapons were already planted in the stadium beforehand.

Bang-hee retrieves a hidden Steyr AUG from a restroom cubicle, while Mu-young and his agents tail several patrolling South Korean SWAT officers, who later adjourn to the restrooms. There, the policemen are killed, and their bodies quickly dragged away. Myung-hyun advances into the grandstand with her rifle, while Mu-young and three other men, now disguised as SWAT officers in uniforms stolen from the dead policemen, enter the stadium control room, killing all but one there and forcing the remaining staff to switch on the stadium lights to trigger the CTX. Jung-won arrives at the stadium and notices the lights. Jung-won goes to the control room to have them shut off, but is taken captive. Sik, a rookie NIS agent, also notices the lights and soon comes in with backup. A violent confrontation in the control room results in the death of all four terrorists, and the lights are switched off in the nick of time. Myung-hyun notices this, and fires at the VIPs, but misses her target. Chasing after the entourage, she kills several more SWAT officers along the way before being confronted by a large group of officers led by Jung-won. As she makes a last-ditch attempt to complete her mission, she is shot dead by Jung-won.

Jung-won later learns that Bang-hee (whom he knew as Myung-hyun) was pregnant with his child, and had left details of the renegade Northern agents&#x27; plan and her planned location on his answering machine before leaving for the stadium, but had requested he is not confronted her himself, professing her love for him. Jung-won then visits the real Myung-hyun, who is at a hospital for chemotherapy, and Myung-hyun reminisces about Bang-hee with Jung-won. Myung-hyun lets Jung-won listen to that song, and while listening to it, Jung-won is captivated by the lyrics. The scene then fades, while Jung-won, still listening to the song, shuts his eyes.

<text>Daniel Rudge (1840 – 26 June 1880) was a British engineer who built high-end bicycles and velocipedes. Rudge invented the adjustable ball bearing bicycle hub (British Patent No 526) in 1878. 

The French racing cyclist Charles Terront, renowned for winning the first Paris–Brest–Paris event in 1891, used Rudge&#x27;s axles with much success thereby bringing world attention to Rudge. In the years before John Dunlop invented the pneumatic tyre, Rudge addressed the rough ride by producing a four-bladed, spring-suspended fork in 1887.
After Rudge&#x27;s death, his company was merged with &quot;The Tangent &amp; Coventry Tricycle Company&quot; to form &quot;D. Rudge &amp; Co.&quot; which in 1894 became &quot;Rudge Whitworth Cycles&quot;. By 1911, the &quot;Rudge Whitworth Cycle Company&quot; was also manufacturing motorcycles.

After the company fell on hard times in the Great Depression, the music company EMI bought the &quot;Rudge&quot; name. EMI produced bicycles under the Rudge name from 1935 until 1943 when they sold the name to Raleigh.
