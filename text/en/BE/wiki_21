<text>Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite set of objects; that is, determining the size of a set. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term &quot;enumeration&quot; refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.

Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, &quot;counting by twos&quot; (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or &quot;counting by fives&quot; (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).

There is archaeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at least 50,000 years. Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as the number of group members, prey animals, property, or debts (that is, accountancy). Notched bones were also found in the Border Caves in South Africa, which may suggest that the concept of counting was known to humans as far back as 44,000 BCE. The development of counting led to the development of mathematical notation, numeral systems, and writing.

==Forms of counting==

Verbal counting involves speaking sequential numbers aloud or mentally to track progress. Generally such counting is done with base 10 numbers: &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot;, etc. Verbal counting is often used for objects that are currently present rather than for counting things over time, since following an interruption counting must resume from where it was left off, a number that has to be recorded or remembered.

Counting a small set of objects, especially over time, can be accomplished efficiently with tally marks: making a mark for each number and then counting all of the marks when done tallying. Tallying is base 1 counting.

Finger counting is convenient and common for small numbers. Children count on fingers to facilitate tallying and for performing simple mathematical operations. Older finger counting methods used the four fingers and the three bones in each finger (phalanges) to count to twelve. Other hand-gesture systems are also in use, for example the Chinese system by which one can count to 10 using only gestures of one hand. With finger binary it is possible to keep a finger count up to .

Various devices can also be used to facilitate counting, such as tally counters and abacuses.

==Inclusive counting==
Inclusive/exclusive counting are two different methods of counting. For exclusive counting, unit intervals are counted at the end of each interval. For inclusive counting, unit intervals are counted beginning with the start of the first interval and ending with end of the last interval. This results in a count which is always greater by one when using inclusive counting, as compared to using exclusive counting, for the same set. Apparently, the introduction of the number zero to the number line resolved this difficulty; however, inclusive counting is still useful for some things. 

Refer also to the fencepost error, which is a type of off-by-one error. 

Modern mathematical English language usage has introduced another difficulty, however. Because an exclusive counting is generally tacitly assumed, the term &quot;inclusive&quot; is generally used in reference to a set which is actually counted exclusively. For example; How many numbers are included in the set that ranges from 3 to 8, inclusive? The set is counted exclusively, once the range of the set has been made certain by the use of the word &quot;inclusive&quot;. The answer is 6; that is 8-3+1, where the +1 range adjustment makes the adjusted exclusive count numerically equivalent to an inclusive count, even though the range of the inclusive count does not include the number eight unit interval. So, it&#x27;s necessary to discern the difference in usage between the terms &quot;inclusive counting&quot; and &quot;inclusive&quot; or &quot;inclusively&quot;, and one must recognize that it&#x27;s not uncommon for the former term to be loosely used for the latter process. 

Inclusive counting is usually encountered when dealing with time in Roman calendars and the Romance languages. In the ancient Roman calendar, the &quot;nones&quot; (meaning &quot;nine&quot;) is 8 days before the &quot;ides&quot;; more generally, dates are specified as inclusively counted days up to the next named day. 

In the Christian liturgical calendar, Quinquagesima (meaning 50) is 49 days before Easter Sunday. When counting &quot;inclusively&quot;, the Sunday (the start day) will be &quot;day 1&quot; and therefore the following Sunday will be the &quot;eighth day&quot;. For example, the French phrase for &quot;fortnight&quot; is &quot;quinzaine&quot; (15 [days]), and similar words are present in Greek (δεκαπενθήμερο, &quot;dekapenthímero&quot;), Spanish (&quot;quincena&quot;) and Portuguese (&quot;quinzena&quot;). 

In contrast, the English word &quot;fortnight&quot; itself derives from &quot;a fourteen-night&quot;, as the archaic &quot;&quot; does from &quot;a seven-night&quot;; the English words are not examples of inclusive counting. In exclusive counting languages such as English, when counting eight days &quot;from Sunday&quot;, Monday will be &quot;day 1&quot;, Tuesday &quot;day 2&quot;, and the following Monday will be the &quot;eighth day&quot;. For many years it was a standard practice in English law for the phrase &quot;from a date&quot; to mean &quot;beginning on the day after that date&quot;: this practice is now deprecated because of the high risk of misunderstanding.

Similar counting is involved in East Asian age reckoning, in which newborns are considered to be 1 at birth.

Musical terminology also uses inclusive counting of intervals between notes of the standard scale: going up one note is a second interval, going up two notes is a third interval, etc., and going up seven notes is an &quot;octave&quot;.

==Education and development==

Learning to count is an important educational/developmental milestone in most cultures of the world. Learning to count is a child&#x27;s very first step into mathematics, and constitutes the most fundamental idea of that discipline. However, some cultures in Amazonia and the Australian Outback do not count, and their languages do not have number words.

Many children at just 2 years of age have some skill in reciting the count list (that is, saying &quot;one, two, three, ...&quot;). They can also answer questions of ordinality for small numbers, for example, &quot;What comes after &quot;three&quot;?&quot;. They can even be skilled at pointing to each object in a set and reciting the words one after another. This leads many parents and educators to the conclusion that the child knows how to use counting to determine the size of a set. Research suggests that it takes about a year after learning these skills for a child to understand what they mean and why the procedures are performed. In the meantime, children learn how to name cardinalities that they can subitize.

==Counting in mathematics==

In mathematics, the essence of counting a set and finding a result &quot;n&quot;, is that it establishes a one-to-one correspondence (or bijection) of the subject set with the subset of positive integers {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;}. A fundamental fact, which can be proved by mathematical induction, is that no bijection can exist between {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} and {1, 2, ..., &quot;m&quot;} unless ; this fact (together with the fact that two bijections can be composed to give another bijection) ensures that counting the same set in different ways can never result in different numbers (unless an error is made). This is the fundamental mathematical theorem that gives counting its purpose; however you count a (finite) set, the answer is the same. In a broader context, the theorem is an example of a theorem in the mathematical field of (finite) combinatorics—hence (finite) combinatorics is sometimes referred to as &quot;the mathematics of counting.&quot;

Many sets that arise in mathematics do not allow a bijection to be established with {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} for &quot;any&quot; natural number &quot;n&quot;; these are called infinite sets, while those sets for which such a bijection does exist (for some &quot;n&quot;) are called finite sets. Infinite sets cannot be counted in the usual sense; for one thing, the mathematical theorems which underlie this usual sense for finite sets are false for infinite sets. Furthermore, different definitions of the concepts in terms of which these theorems are stated, while equivalent for finite sets, are inequivalent in the context of infinite sets.

The notion of counting may be extended to them in the sense of establishing (the existence of) a bijection with some well-understood set. For instance, if a set can be brought into bijection with the set of all natural numbers, then it is called &quot;countably infinite.&quot; This kind of counting differs in a fundamental way from counting of finite sets, in that adding new elements to a set does not necessarily increase its size, because the possibility of a bijection with the original set is not excluded. For instance, the set of all integers (including negative numbers) can be brought into bijection with the set of natural numbers, and even seemingly much larger sets like that of all finite sequences of rational numbers are still (only) countably infinite. Nevertheless, there are sets, such as the set of real numbers, that can be shown to be &quot;too large&quot; to admit a bijection with the natural numbers, and these sets are called &quot;uncountable.&quot; Sets for which there exists a bijection between them are said to have the same cardinality, and in the most general sense counting a set can be taken to mean determining its cardinality. Beyond the cardinalities given by each of the natural numbers, there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite cardinalities, although only very few such cardinalities occur in ordinary mathematics (that is, outside set theory that explicitly studies possible cardinalities).

Counting, mostly of finite sets, has various applications in mathematics. One important principle is that if two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same finite number of elements, and a function is known to be injective, then it is also surjective, and vice versa. A related fact is known as the pigeonhole principle, which states that if two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have finite numbers of elements &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; with , then any map is &quot;not&quot; injective (so there exist two distinct elements of &quot;X&quot; that &quot;f&quot; sends to the same element of &quot;Y&quot;); this follows from the former principle, since if &quot;f&quot; were injective, then so would its restriction to a strict subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;X&quot; with &quot;m&quot; elements, which restriction would then be surjective, contradicting the fact that for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; outside &quot;S&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) cannot be in the image of the restriction. Similar counting arguments can prove the existence of certain objects without explicitly providing an example. In the case of infinite sets this can even apply in situations where it is impossible to give an example.

The domain of enumerative combinatorics deals with computing the number of elements of finite sets, without actually counting them; the latter usually being impossible because infinite families of finite sets are considered at once, such as the set of permutations of {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} for any natural number &quot;n&quot;.

<text>Harry Ramsden&#x27;s is a fast food restaurant chain based in the United Kingdom which offers fish and chips and assorted themed dishes. Founded by restaurant entrepreneur Harry Ramsden in Guiseley, West Yorkshire, in 1928, it was sold to his partner in 1954. Since then it has a succession of corporate owners: Associated Fisheries, Merryweathers, Granada, Compass, SSP, BVL and Deep Blue. As of 2025, it has about 8 restaurants in the UK.

== Early history ==
The business was started by Harry Ramsden (10 February 1888 – 1963) in 1928 in a wooden hut in White Cross, Guiseley, West Yorkshire, northern England. Three years later, he moved into a new premises, complete with fitted carpets, oak panelled walls, and chandeliers. The original hut was demolished in 2012, as a result of its poor condition and asbestos content. The adjacent main restaurant, which replaced it, once held the Guinness World Record for the largest fish and chip shop in the world, seating 250 people and serving nearly a million customers a year. Harry Corbett of Sooty fame was a nephew of Harry Ramsden&#x27;s, and played the piano in his uncle&#x27;s original restaurant.

In 1954, the business was sold to Harry Ramsden&#x27;s long-term business partner Eddie Stokes for the (then) large sum of £37,500, and subsequently in 1965 to Essex-based Associated Fisheries.

== Expansion ==
In 1988, the company, which still comprised the original Guiseley fish and chips premises, was bought by Merryweathers, led by Chairmen John Barnes and Richard Richardson. Barnes and Richardson led the transition of the business from a single restaurant in Yorkshire to an international chain.

In 1989, following a decision by their bank to withdraw funding, the management floated the company on the London Stock Exchange. The public offer was over-subscribed two and a half times over. The next ten years saw rapid expansion throughout the UK and worldwide, through company-owned and franchised restaurants. Locations outside the UK included Hong Kong, Australia, Epcot and Saudi Arabia.

A franchise deal with Granada motorway services to develop kiosk-style units ultimately led to Granada Ltd buying Harry Ramsden&#x27;s for £20 million in October 1999. When acquired by Granada, Harry Ramsden&#x27;s comprised four company-owned restaurants, twenty-five franchises and sixteen Henry Higgins units. Granada expanded Harry Ramsden&#x27;s into motorway locations. Some franchise territories infringed onto motorways, so Granada bought the franchises back. In 2000, Compass merged with Granada. Under Compass, the business was expanded into motorway service station kiosks, contract catering locations such as schools, Post Office canteens, Little Chef, Butlins, and Haven Holidays. The last Harry Ramsden&#x27;s on the motorway network, at Gretna Green, closed in August 2022.

In 1999, the company began operating a quick-service kiosk in Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot in the United Kingdom pavilion. Branded and operated by Harry Ramsden&#x27;s, the restaurant was added to provide traditional fish and chips in time for the park&#x27;s Millennium celebration. The branding remained until a renovation in 2006, when its name became Yorkshire County Fish Shop, in a nod to the original UK restaurant. Despite the name change, the location was still sponsored and operated by Harry Ramsden&#x27;s until 2010.

While earlier restaurant chains existed in the UK, such as Samuel Isaacs&#x27; chain of 22 fish and chip restaurants, the first of which opened in 1896, Harry Ramsden&#x27;s website claimed their business to be &quot;Britain&#x27;s longest-established restaurant chain&quot;.

== SSP ownership and future ==
By April 2006, Compass had spun off its motorway service stations to Moto, bought by Macquarie Bank of Sydney, Australia. Its specialist airports and railways division, SSP, was sold for to EQT AB of Sweden (who also own Findus). Harry Ramsden&#x27;s was sold with the SSP business. Under the early years of SSP ownership, the business had to compete with other SSP brands for investment.

In 2008, SSP recruited industry turnaround specialist Chris Sullivan as managing director. During 2009, Sullivan led a radical revision of the food on offer, improving quality, reducing wait times and removing menu items which were deemed to be more pub-restaurant than chip shop. The strategy delivered a marked improvement in sales in the food court and seaside restaurant business of Harry Ramsden&#x27;s, prompting parent company SSP to market the business for sale.

On 19 January 2010, SSP sold Harry Ramsden&#x27;s to Boparan Ventures Limited. BVL is the private investment vehicle for Ranjit Boparan.

BVL planned to open another 100 units in the following five years and create 600 new jobs. On 29 November 2011, it was announced that the original Harry Ramsden&#x27;s restaurant in Guiseley would close, amid statements from the owners that it was losing money and that any refurbishment to make it profitable would not be viable. The restaurant closed on Monday 19 December 2011. In February 2012, it was announced that the Guiseley restaurant had been sold to the Wetherby Whaler group. It reopened on 22 May 2012 under the Wetherby Whaler name.

BVL have continued to invest in the Harry Ramsden&#x27;s brand, with their Bournemouth branch briefly holding the title of World&#x27;s Largest Fish and Chip Restaurant, seating 417 across its restaurant, cafe and terrace, before being surpassed in 2017.

During August 2019, Boparan Ventures Limited sold Harry Ramsden&#x27;s to rival Deep Blue Restaurants for an undisclosed sum.

The move saw Reigate-based Deep Blue acquire the Harry Ramsden&#x27;s 34-strong estate, including 15 standalone restaurants, plus a combination of franchises in the UK and in Malaysia.

==&quot;Undercover Boss&quot;==

In 2010, the chain was the focus of an episode of the Channel 4 television series &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;. The then-CEO of the company, Marija Simovic, posed as a new starter in a variety of locations – Swindon, Merry Hill Shopping Centre, Blackpool, Southampton and Great Yarmouth – to try to understand why the company was struggling. At the end of the programme, Simovic promised big changes in a bid to turn around the company&#x27;s fortunes, along with promoting a number of employees who had impressed her. Simovic left the company in 2011.

== Licensing ==
The Harry Ramsden&#x27;s brand is licensed to Princes Group for tinned mushy peas and to Birds Eye for frozen fish.

<doc id="275775" wikidata="Q529775" url="?curid=275775" title="Martha Griffiths">
<text>Martha Wright Griffiths (January 29, 1912 – April 22, 2003) was an American lawyer and judge before being elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1954. Griffiths was the first woman to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means and the first woman elected to the United States Congress from Michigan as a member of the Democratic Party. She was &quot;instrumental&quot; in including the prohibition of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1982, Griffiths was also the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Michigan, as Matilda Dodge Wilson had been appointed the first female lieutenant governor of Michigan in 1939.

== Life and career ==

Martha Edna Wright was born in Pierce City, Missouri. She attended public schools and went on to graduate with a B.A. from the University of Missouri in 1934. She chose to continue her education by studying law and graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1940. She married Hicks George Griffiths (July 9, 1940 – March 4, 1996), a lawyer and a judge as well as chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party from 1949 to 1950.

She worked as a lawyer in private practice, then in the legal department of the American Automobile Insurance Co. in Detroit from 1941 to 1942 and then as the Ordnance District contract negotiator from 1942 to 1946. She was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives, serving from 1949 to 1953 for the Wayne County 1st district. In 1953, she was appointed as recorder and judge of the Recorder&#x27;s Court in Detroit and sat as judge from 1953 to 1954, the first woman to do so.

In 1954, Griffiths was elected as a Democrat from Michigan&#x27;s 17th congressional district to the 84th Congress and was subsequently re-elected to the nine following Congresses, serving from January 3, 1955, to December 31, 1974, in the U.S. House. She sat as a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in 1956 as well as in 1968. She was not a candidate for re-election to the 94th Congress in 1974.

== Equal Rights Amendment ==
During her time in Congress, Griffiths sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment, one of 33 proposed amendments to pass in Congress and be sent to the states for ratification, and among the six that were not ratified.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described her as &quot;the mother of the Equal Rights Amendment&quot;, adding:

The weapons she deployed during her 10-term congressional career included implacable determination, a lawyer&#x27;s grasp of procedural niceties, and a tongue like a blacksmith&#x27;s rasp.
== Quote ==

&quot;I don&#x27;t know really that I have so much perseverance as I do a sense of indignity at the fact that women are not justly treated. I have the same sort of feeling for Blacks, Latinos and the Asiatics. If we are America, then we ought to be what we say we are. We ought to be the land of the free and the brave. What people sought in this land was justice.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Some of that I get from my father. I adored my father. My father thought that girls were smarter than boys, which was unusual in my day and age.&quot;
== Post-Congressional career as lieutenant governor==
After her congressional service, Griffiths returned to the practice of law and then served as the 59th lieutenant governor of Michigan from 1983 to 1991 on the ticket of Governor James Blanchard. She was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1983 and to the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame a decade later in 1993. She retired to her home in Armada, Michigan, where she lived until her death in 2003 at age 91.

Martha Griffiths was a member of the American Association of University Women. The AAUW of Michigan named its &quot;Martha Griffiths Equity Award&quot; in her honor.

<doc id="275783" wikidata="Q5153640" url="?curid=275783" title="Common whipping">
<text>The common whipping is the simplest type of whipping knot, a series of knots intended to stop a rope from unravelling. As it can slip off the rope easily, the common whipping should not be used for rope ends that will be handled. This whipping knot is also called &#x27;wolf&#x27; whipping in some parts of the world. The &#x27;Hangman&#x27;s knot&#x27; is a variation of this whipping knot.

The benefit of a common whipping is that no tools are necessary and the rope does not need to be unlaid. The problem is that it will slide off the end of the rope with little provocation. Other whippings avoid this by interleaving the whipping with the strands of the rope and creating friction with the strands to avoid slipping.

Normally a natural fibre rope is whipped with twine. The size of the rope dictates the size of the twine. Any twine can be used, but tarred two strand hemp (marline) is preferred. Artificial-fibre ropes should have their ends fused by heat rather than whipped to prevent unravelling.

<doc id="275784" wikidata="Q12622609" url="?curid=275784" title="Officer candidate school">
<text>An officer candidate school (OCS) is a military school which trains civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as officers in the armed forces of a country. How OCS is run differs between countries and services. Typically, officer candidates have already attained post-secondary education, and sometimes a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and undergo a short duration of training (not more than a year) which focuses primarily on military skills and leadership. This is in contrast with a military academy which includes academic instruction leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Australia==

Officer Cadet School of Australia – Portsea (OCS Portsea) commenced training officers for the Australian Army in 1951 and continued through to the end of 1985. Since OCS Portsea&#x27;s closure in 1985, all Australian Army Officer training has been conducted at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra. During the Vietnam War, the Officer Training Unit, Scheyville was used to train and commission National Servicemen as 2nd Lieutenants between 1965 and 1972.
== France==
In France training for officers is at:
École polytechnique, École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, École des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale, École navale, École de l&#x27;air, École militaire interarmes, École militaire supérieure d&#x27;administration et de management and École de santé des armées.

== Germany ==
In Germany training for officers is at:
* &quot;Offizierschule des Heeres&quot; in Dresden
* &quot;Offizierschule der Luftwaffe&quot; at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base in Fürstenfeldbruck near Munich
* &quot;Mürwik Naval School&quot; in Flensburg

== Myanmar ==
In Myanmar, the primary officer training school is Officers Training School, Bahtoo.

==Philippines==

In the Philippines, the Armed Forces of the Philippines Officer Candidate School was originally formed out from the defunct School for Reserve Commission or SRC that was established in the 1930s pursuant to the provisions of then Philippine Commonwealth Act Number 1, otherwise known as &quot;The National Defense Act of the Philippines&quot;. This was created in preparation for the defense of the Philippines, establishing a 10-year program of training for Filipino Servicemen and Civilian Volunteers (Reserve), and forming the Philippine Army as the main ground forces of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. A transfiguration took place with some military personnel from the Philippine Constabulary being transferred to form the nucleus of the Philippine Army. However, the 10-year program was incomplete by the time World War II broke out in the Pacific and ROSS training was subsequently stopped. Nevertheless, many of its trainees were called to active duty to serve throughout the war mainly with the U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE).

The need for commissioned officers after the U.S. liberation of the Philippines in the 1940s prompted the establishment of the School for Reserve Commission, which later became the Officer Candidate School. Early training was held at Camp Tinio, Bangad, Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, Nichols Air Base in Pasay and Fort Bonifacio in Metro Manila. Some graduates of these classes were sent to conflicts in both Korea and Vietnam. Later, the OCS training location was moved to Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal from where 27 classes graduated between 1987 and 2005. Officer candidates with the rank of Probationary Second Lieutenant and Probationary Ensign have to undergo and pass the 12-month Officer Candidate Course before they can be commissioned as Regular and Reserve Officers in the Philippine Army, the Philippine Constabulary, the Philippine Air Force, the Philippine Navy and the Technical Service (Medical Administrative Corps and Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Corps).

In 1993, OCS started accepting two foreign officer candidates from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces who joined the Officer Candidate Course &quot;Balikatan&quot; Class 12-94. In 1994, five female OCs belonging to AFPOCS &quot;Balikatan&quot; Class 12-94 graduated to become the first female officers of the AFP and were not included anymore as Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Corps officers. Some Filipino officer candidates were also sent to train in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Today, each of the three armed services of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) – Army, Air Force and Navy – run their own officer training in separate locations such as Philippine Air Force Aviation OCS in Fernando Air Base, Pampanga; Philippine Army OCS in Camp O&#x27;Donnell, Capas, Tarlac; and Philippine Navy OCS in San Antonio, Zambales.

==Singapore==

In Singapore, Officer Cadet School (OCS) is a school within SAFTI Military Institute, which serves as the main center for training officers of all ranks. OCS is a quad-service institution which trains officers of the Army, Air Force, Digital and Intelligence Service, and Navy. Unlike other countries, OCS is the only route to a commission in the SAF. Even selected cadets who hold scholarships to train in friendly service academies must complete two thirds of OCS and receive their commission before undergoing further training overseas.

OCS in Singapore lasts approximately 38 weeks. The first term consists of military knowledge applicable to all services, including military history and military law. Subsequently, Officer Cadets are streamed into their services based on aptitude and personal preference, and receive training specific to their service.

==South Korea==
In South Korea, Officer Candidate School (학사사관) were modeled on OCS programs of the United States Armed Forces. Qualified persons may earn a commission by passing rigorous basic combat training lasting 3 to 4 months.

The Republic of Korea Army has the highest number of officer candidates each year. All applicants must hold bachelor&#x27;s degree, unless they are currently non-commissioned officers in active duty, or hold specialized certifications or licenses, such as doctors and attorneys. Most applicants will take a written exam, physical tests, and several interviews for consideration. Admitted applicants are ordered enlistment in the Army Cadet Military School in Goesan. At graduation, candidates earn a commission with the rank of Second Lieutenant.

The Republic of Korea Navy and the Republic of Korea Marine Corps have maintained the most rigorous candidate school program in South Korea. Both ROKN and ROKMC officer candidates earn commissions together at Republic of Korea Naval Academy in Changwon, while their training programs are distinct. ROKMC candidates will be sent to Marine Corps School in Pohang, while ROKN candidates remain in Changwon. Petty officers in active duty who have earned the bachelor&#x27;s degree may also apply to the OCS program.

The Republic of Korea Air Force&#x27;s Officer Training School (OTS) is a popular and competitive officer training program in South Korea. ROKAF OTS trains the majority of its candidates for air defense forces and military police. While OTS also trains pilots, the majority of ROKAF pilots come from the Air Force Academy or ROKAF ROTC programs.

==United Kingdom==
Initial officer training (IOT) for commissioned officers in the British Armed Forces is undertaken at one of three military academies in the United Kingdom, specific to service branch.

For the British Army, IOT is undertaken at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMA Sandhurst, or RMAS), commonly known merely as Sandhurst, located in the town of Camberley, near the village of Sandhurst, Berkshire, England, about south-west of London. The stated aim of RMAS is to be &quot;the national centre of excellence for leadership&quot;. All British Army officers, including late-entry officers who were previously Warrant Officers, as well as many other men and women from overseas militaries, are trained at Sandhurst. Standard duration of training for regular officers at Sandhurst lasts 44 weeks.

For the Royal Navy (RN), its IOT is undertaken at the Britannia Royal Naval College (Britannia RNC, or BRNC), also known as HMS &quot;Dartmouth&quot; (a stone frigate), at Dartmouth in Devon, whilst IOT for the Royal Marines (RM) is carried out at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM). For Royal Air Force (RAF) IOT, that is undertaken the Royal Air Force College Cranwell (RAFC Cranwell, or RAFC), located within the RAF Cranwell airbase. In a similar vein to Sandhurst, Dartmouth and Cranwell also train future officers of many different foreign and Commonwealth militaries. The Royal Navy commissioning course at Dartmouth is 30 weeks, whilst the Royal Marines course lasts 15 months and is split between CTCRM and BRNC. Royal Air Force officer cadets undergo a 24 week course at RAFC.

Once graduated and commissioned, officers of all services may undertake further specialist post-graduate training appropriate to their military profession, such as flying training, engineering, logistics; and these will invariably multi-service training establishments. One example being Amport House, where military chaplains for all service branches receive their military theology training until it closed in 2020; it has since been relocated to the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre at Shirivenham.

==United States==

In the United States Armed Forces, Officer Candidate School (OCS) or the equivalent is a training program for college graduates and non-commissioned officers, soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and coast guardsmen to earn commissions as officers. The courses generally last from six to seventeen weeks and include classroom instruction in military subjects, physical training, and leadership.

People may earn a commission in the United States Armed Forces through OCS or OTS, by staff appointment, through Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), or through one of the five federal service academies.
* The Officer Candidate School of the United States Army is a 12-week-long program held at Fort Moore, Georgia for both prior service and non-prior service candidates. The Army is the only U.S. branch in which those with no prior military service must first attend Basic Combat Training. There are also Army National Guard Officer Candidate Schools that allow an Army National Guard soldier to train within the &quot;one weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot; training program; this is called &quot;Traditional&quot;, as it is the original method for the Army National Guard, and takes 18 months to complete. In addition, Army National Guard soldiers have the option to attend the federal course or to attend a 7-day-per-week accelerated eight-week program in conjunction with other states. Both federal and state programs are accredited by the U.S. Army Infantry School. Upon completion of either OCS programs, graduates are commissioned as Second Lieutenants (2LT) and then attend the rest of their Basic Officer Leadership courses. In 2006, the officer commissioning programs changed, making the entire process, &quot;Basic Officer Leadership Course&quot;, occurring in two phases (BOLC-A and BOLC-B). Phase A is the original commissioning source (OCS, ROTC, USMA, Direct). BOLC B is the Officer Basic Course which trains the new officers into their Basic Branch skills and includes three weeks of basic soldiering skills.
* The Officer Candidates School of the United States Marine Corps is at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. All Marine officers are initially trained at OCS, with the exception of those who come from the United States Naval Academy. Entrance to OCS is obtained through the Platoon Leaders Class and Officer Candidates Course programs. Candidates who enter the Platoon Leaders Class attend either two six-week sessions or one ten-week session during college. Those who enter the Officer Candidates Course attend one ten-week session after graduation from college. Naval ROTC midshipmen in the Marine Option also attend for one six-week session prior to commissioning. Graduates are commissioned as Second Lieutenants (2ndLt) in the U.S. Marine Corps. Regardless of commissioning source, all Marine Corps officers attend The Basic School (TBS) prior to beginning training for their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS).
* The Officer Candidate School of the United States Navy is a 13 week course located at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. It has been based there since the fall of 2007 after relocating from NAS Pensacola, Florida. In the 1990s, OCS had departed Newport to combine with Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) at Naval Air Station Pensacola. On its return, it brought the tradition of USMC drill instructors (a la &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;) from NAS Pensacola. Upon completion, graduates are commissioned in the rank of ensign (ENS) in the U.S. Navy.
* The Officer Training School of the United States Air Force is located at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. There are three programs offered at OTS. The first is Basic Officer Training (BOT), for those seeking a commission to the active duty USAF. It is a 9-week-long program consisting of two parts. In the first part, officer trainees learn military skills, USAF history, and other classroom and skill courses needed for serving in the Air Force. In the second part, they are given ranks from Officer Trainee O-1 (2d Lt) to Officer Trainee O-6 (Col), and learn how to be a leader, including the opportunity to lead other Officer Trainees. Graduates are commissioned as Second Lieutenants (2d Lt) in the U.S. Air Force. The second program is Commissioned Officer Training (COT), a five-week introductory program to the USAF for those who have been directly commissioned in the USAF, primarily as chaplains, doctors, and lawyers. Trainees in COT range in rank from O-1 to O-5 and will report directly to their respective units after training. The third program is the Academy of Military Science (AMS), a detachment of the Air National Guard Readiness Center that is embedded at OTS. AMS is a six-week program designed to train and commission officer candidates to fulfill USAF and Air National Guard (ANG) requirements. The AMS program covers the same subject areas as BOT and COT, but also provides education in ANG heritage and the role of the &quot;Citizen Airman&quot;. The majority of AMS students are prior-enlisted and many may also have civilian careers. Once AMS candidates successfully complete all OTS graduation requirements, they receive the oath of office and receive state and federal commissions as second lieutenants in the ANG with both state and federal responsibilities.
* The Officer Candidate School of the United States Coast Guard is at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, where it has been located since August 1998. Prior to August 1998, Coast Guard OCS was located at the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center (RESTRACEN) in Yorktown, Virginia. OCS is a 17-week-long program, the longest of the 5 military services. Graduates are commissioned in the rank of ensign (ENS) in the U.S. Coast Guard and may report to Coast Guard cutters, sectors, or directly to flight training.
* Officer Candidate Schools are also maintained by the active State Defense Forces of the United States by direction of their respective state military departments and by the state&#x27;s National Guard Adjutant General. Similar to their state&#x27;s National Guard counterparts who take a dual federal and state military commission, military officers who are commissioned through a SDF Officer Candidate School take a sole military commission to the state that they support, recognized by their state&#x27;s military code and . In states with full integration of state military resources (SDF and National Guard counterparts) the curriculum is often similar, with the National Guard curriculum taking on additional requirements to meet federal recognition (referred to as FEDREC). For example, California maintains both Officer Candidate Schools at Camp San Luis Obispo, with the State Guard OCS being 11-12 months and the National Guard OCS being 16-18 months, both celebrate a joint graduation.
* During WWII, the U.S. Army Signal Corps ran an Officer Candidate School located in the war zone labeled as the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), at Camp Columbia, Brisbane, Australia. From photographs taken by the U.S. Army, it is apparent that this course was integrated with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Signal Corps OCS program at Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey. Contemporary records indicate that the course was branch immaterial – perhaps the first branch immaterial course in the Army. Unfortunately, there is little information about the particulars of how SWPA OCS was operated, such as its length, subject matter content, training routine, etc. In particular, its years of operation and other reliable statistical information are not readily available.

<text>Grand Valley State University (GVSU, GV, or Grand Valley) is a public university in Allendale, Michigan, United States. It was established in 1960 as Grand Valley State College. Its main campus is situated on approximately west of Grand Rapids. The university also features campuses in Grand Rapids and Holland and regional centers in Battle Creek, Detroit, Muskegon, and Traverse City.

GVSU enrolled more than 24,000 students as of fall 2021 from all 83 Michigan counties and dozens of other states and foreign countries. It employed nearly 4,000 people, with about 1,800 faculty and 2,000 staff. The university has alumni from 50 U.S. states, Canada, and 25 other countries.

GVSU&#x27;s NCAA Division II sports teams are the Lakers and they compete in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC) in all 20 intercollegiate varsity sports. They have won 28 NCAA Division II National Championships.

==History==
===Formation, planning and construction===
In 1958 the Michigan Legislature commissioned a study that demonstrated a need for a four-year college in the Grand Rapids area, Michigan&#x27;s second largest metropolitan region. Local businessman Bill Seidman created a committee to study the report and spearhead the planning and promotion to create such an institution. In the following year the Michigan Legislature established the college. A naming contest was held, and out of 2500 submissions, &quot;Grand Valley State College&quot; was chosen. Private donations, including $350,000 to purchase land and $1,000,000 for construction, were secured from 5,000 individuals, organizations, and business throughout West Michigan. In 1961, the Grand Valley State College Board of Control chose a site in Ottawa County near the Grand River for the new campus, and construction of academic buildings began the following year.
===Early years===
Grand Valley State College accepted its first class of 225 students in 1963, Diane (Hatch) Paton was the first student, and was among the first graduation of 138 students on June 18, 1967. The middle-late 1960s saw the addition of the first dormitories and construction of new academic buildings, including the Zumberge Library, named for the university&#x27;s first president, James Zumberge.

In 1969, the &quot;Grand Valley Lanthorn&quot; printed an issue containing several vulgarities and obscenities. After complaints from some at Grand Valley State College and the surrounding communities, the Ottawa County, Michigan, sheriff arrested the editor, and the prosecutor closed down the newspaper office. The university, then a co-ed college, sued the sheriff and prosecutor for closing the Lanthorn offices. Eventually, Michigan&#x27;s Attorney General settled the case out of court, siding with the college because the Lanthorn&#x27;s content was considered covered by Freedom of Speech.

During the 1970s Grand Valley organized its academic units into several colleges: College of Arts and Sciences, Thomas Jefferson College, William James College, Seidman College of Business, and College IV. Michigan Governor William Milliken signed the law changing the institution&#x27;s name to Grand Valley State Colleges in 1973. However, the &quot;s&quot; was dropped and the name was reverted to Grand Valley State College in 1983 when the academic programs were reorganized into divisions.

===College to comprehensive university===
In 1987 the Michigan Legislature passed a law renaming the college to Grand Valley State University. The 1980s and 1990s saw addition of satellite campuses or centers in downtown Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Holland, and Traverse City. In 2004, the university&#x27;s board reorganized the university structure again into a college system consisting of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Interdisciplinary Studies, College of Community and Public Service, College of Education, College of Health Professions, Kirkhof College of Nursing, Seidman College of Business, and Seymour and Esther Padnos College of Engineering and Computing. Grand Valley completed its first 50 years with a comprehensive campaign that raised almost $100 million from over 17,000 donors, making it the university&#x27;s largest campaign to date. Money raised during the campaign has helped fund many construction projects on campus, including the Mary Idema Pew Library and the L. William Seidman Center.

===Continued growth beyond 50th anniversary===
In 2012, GVSU announced several more construction projects and land purchases. Future buildings to be constructed include a new biology laboratory building and an addition and renovation to the Zumberge Library on the Allendale campus. Land purchases in 2012 included property in downtown Grand Rapids adjacent to the medical mile for healthcare program expansion. In 2013, GVSU announced it would add on to Au Sable Hall and construct a building to house the GVSU Laker Store (known as University Bookstore prior to April 2015), with expanded dining facilities.

==Campuses==

Grand Valley has three primary campuses. The main campus is located in Allendale Charter Township, Michigan, about west of Grand Rapids, Michigan; two satellite campuses are located in Grand Rapids. The university has regional academic centers in Detroit, Holland, Muskegon, and Traverse City.

The Rapid operates bus service between the three primary campuses, funded by the university. The Laker Line, named for GVSU&#x27;s sports teams, connects all three campuses via Lake Michigan Drive, and additional shuttle services operate on the Allendale campus. These bus services are open to the public, and rides on all The Rapid services are free for Grand Valley students, faculty and staff on all Rapid routes with a valid I.D. card.

===Allendale campus===

The university&#x27;s main and original campus in Allendale is the site of most of the university&#x27;s programs. The Allendale campus is composed of 1,322 acres perched above the Grand River next to a system of ravines and is divided into two areas, north and south campus, separated by West Campus Drive. State highway M-45 links the campus in suburban Allendale to US Highway 31/Lake Michigan to the west and Grand Rapids, Michigan to the east. Lubbers Stadium, the GVSU Fieldhouse and all other athletic facilities for the school&#x27;s 20 varsity sports are also on the Allendale campus. The campus is dotted with many sculptures, including works by Dale Eldred and James Clover. Academic facilities on the Allendale campus includes at least 122 classrooms, 144 research laboratories, 20 lab prep rooms, 21 computer labs, and the Mary Idema Pew Library Learning and Information Commons. The Allendale campus is also home to the Kindschi Hall of Science, a science facility that opened in the fall of 2015.

The Holton-Hooker Learning and Living Center, with space for 490 students, opened in August 2016. The building is LEED silver-certified.

===Robert C. Pew Grand Rapids campus===

The Robert C. Pew Grand Rapids campus is in the heart of downtown Grand Rapids on the banks of the Grand River. It consists of 11 buildings and three leased spaces and includes the Richard DeVos Center, L.V. Eberhard Center, L. William Seidman Center, Beckering Family Carillon Tower, The Depot (houses the Michigan Small Business and Technology Development headquarters), Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies, Keller Engineering Laboratories, John C. Kennedy Hall of Engineering, Peter F. Secchia Hall (housing), Winter Hall (housing), and the Van Andel Global Trade Center. Winter Hall is typically occupied by graduate students and is fully furnished along with appliances. These facilities include 57 classrooms, 78 research laboratories, 23 lab prep rooms, 11 computer labs, and the Steelcase Library.

===Health campus===

The Health Campus is a part of the Grand Rapids Medical Mile area and houses many of GVSU&#x27;s health programs. The Cook-DeVos Center for Health Sciences (CHS), which opened in 2003, reached capacity in 2011. To accommodate the growth in the health sciences, GVSU completed the $37.5 million Raleigh J. Finkelstein Hall north of the Cook-DeVos Center for Health Sciences, and in 2018 broke ground on the next phase, the Daniel and Pamella DeVos Center for Interprofessional Health, a $70 million building that is attached to the Cook-DeVos Center for Health Sciences and includes a parking structure shared with nearby Spectrum Health.

===Regional centers===
GVSU has three locations in Muskegon, Michigan. The James L. Stevenson Center for Higher Education at Muskegon Community College was established in the fall of 1995 as a joint venture between GVSU, Ferris State University, and Western Michigan University. The center offers several GVSU graduate and undergraduate programs. Lake Michigan Center houses the Annis Water Resources Institute (AWRI). The Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC), which is the first fully integrated demonstration facility for distributed generation of electricity using alternative and renewable energy technologies in the United States.

The Traverse City Regional Center was established in the fall of 1995 in Traverse City, Michigan, and is at the NMC University Center in partnership with Northwestern Michigan College. The center offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in education, social work, and liberal studies.
The GVSU Physician Assistant program enrolls 10-14 students at the TC campus.

The Meijer campus, just outside downtown Holland, Michigan, was opened in 1998 and was named for the Meijer family for their donation of land. The campus houses continuing education programs in of building space and contains 12 classrooms, 2 conference rooms, 3 labs and 11 offices.

The Detroit Center was established in 2012 when GVSU purchased the Barden Building adjacent to Comerica Park in downtown Detroit to house its charter school offices. The center also houses the Southeast Michigan Region of the Michigan Small Business &amp; Technology Development Center, of which GVSU is the supervisor.

==Organization and administration==

Grand Valley State University is governed by an eight-member board of trustees, whose members are appointed by the Governor of Michigan and confirmed by the Michigan Senate for terms of eight years. This setup is provided for by the constitution of the state of Michigan of 1963. Members of the board serve without compensation. The board appoints the president of the university, formulates university policies, controls university finances, and acts as the supreme governing body of the institution. The president of the university administers the policies of the board of trustees.

===Finance===
GVSU&#x27;s general fund budget is $351 million, of which $275 million is from tuition and $72 million is from state appropriations. As of 2019, Grand Valley&#x27;s amount of university-based student financial aid was $289 million, including $90 million of that in scholarships and grants. During the 2013–2014 academic year, full-time dependent students received an average award of $13,276.

===Public safety===
The Grand Valley Police Department provides law enforcement services for the Allendale Campus. While the department is self-empowered to enforce its jurisdiction, officers are also deputized by the Ottawa County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Because Allendale doesn&#x27;t have a police department, the Grand Valley State University Police can handle cases anywhere in Ottawa County, mainly in Allendale and the area surrounding the campus. The department handles other security issues, such as parking and driving violations, community policing, as well lost and found. Allendale Fire Department serves the campus. The Department of Public Safety also employs several students who assist the department by performing a variety of clerical and security based duties and services.
The Pew Campus Security and Regional Centers is an entity distinct from the Department of Public safety, and handles security and public safety issues for the Grand Rapids Pew Campus and all Regional Centers including the Holland (MI) Meijer Campus, the Muskegon (MI) campus and the Traverse City (MI) campus. This department is not sworn or certified and relies on the Grand Rapids Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies for official law enforcement when necessary.

GVSU&#x27;s Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC) recently received funding for its $3.7 million Lake Michigan Offshore Wind Assessment Project to test wind energy on Lake Michigan. The research should take three years as a floating buoy will be used and moved to collect data from different locations on the lake.

===Michigan State University partnerships===
The Michigan State University College of Human Medicine maintains the Secchia Center, a medical campus in downtown Grand Rapids. Along with GVSU and two Grand Rapids hospitals, it is a founding member of the Grand Rapids Medical Education Partners. This partnership allows &quot;educational opportunities for residents, fellows, practicing physicians, physician assistants, nurses and students in other health professions.&quot;

The Early Assurance Program reserves spaces in MSU&#x27;s medical program for top-performing GVSU pre-medical graduates. One of the program&#x27;s goals is to select first-generation college students, students from underprivileged areas, and students who have expressed a desire to work in high-demand medical specialties. Students entering the program must agree to work in under-served areas after they complete their medical degrees. The first group of six students entered this program during the fall 2010 semester.

The two universities have announced a joint program specializing in clinical trial management, aimed at providing the foundations for carrying out clinical drug trials in West Michigan.

As of 2019 there have been 25 LEED-certified projects completed at Grand Valley. $2.2 million is saved annually on Grand Valley&#x27;s energy bill through a combination of energy conservation efforts and LEED construction projects.

The Student Environmental Coalition or SEC, is the student-run sustainability organization on campus. The mission of the group is &quot;Helping to engage students at Grand Valley&#x27;s campus to be conscious citizens by promotion of environmental awareness.&quot;

Additionally, several academic programs offer the study of sustainability. Those housed in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences include Geography and Sustainable Planning (major and minor) and Natural Resource Management (major and minor). Those housed in the Brooks College of Interdisciplinary Studies include the Liberal Studies major and the Environmental Studies minor.

Grand Valley hosted meetings relating to sustainability, including a summit in which various sustainability issues were explored by university officials and local experts in April 2010, and a meeting of the Michigan Great Lakes Wind Council in July 2010 to discuss offshore wind energy generation.

<doc id="275788" wikidata="Q16827352" url="?curid=275788" title="Old King Cole">
<text>&quot;Old King Cole&quot; is a British nursery rhyme first attested in 1709. Though there is much speculation about the identity of King Cole, it is unlikely that he can be identified reliably as any historical figure. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 1164. The poem describes a merry king who called for his pipe, bowl, and musicians, with the details varying among versions.

The &quot;bowl&quot; is a drinking vessel, while it is unclear whether the &quot;pipe&quot; is a musical instrument or a tobacco pipe.

The most common modern version of the rhyme is:

&lt;poem&gt;
Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
And a merry old soul was he;
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl,
And he called for his fiddlers three.
Every fiddler he had a fiddle,
And a very fine fiddle had he;
Oh, there&#x27;s none so rare, as can compare,
With King Cole and his fiddlers three.&lt;/poem&gt;

The song is first attested in William King&#x27;s &quot;Useful Transactions in Philosophy&quot; for January and February 1709. King&#x27;s version has the following lyrics:
&lt;poem&gt;
Good King Cole,
And he call&#x27;d for his Bowle,
And he call&#x27;d for Fidlers three;
And there was Fiddle Fiddle,
And twice Fiddle Fiddle,
For &#x27;twas my Lady&#x27;s Birth-day,
Therefore we keep Holy-day,
And come to be merry.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Identity of King Cole==

There is much speculation about the identity of King Cole, but it is unlikely that he can be identified reliably given the centuries between the attestation of the rhyme and the putative identities; none of the extant theories is well supported.

William King mentions two possibilities: the &quot;Prince that Built Colchester&quot; and a 12th-century cloth merchant from Reading named Cole-brook. Sir Walter Scott thought that &quot;Auld King Coul&quot; was Cumhall, the father of the giant Fyn M&#x27;Coule (Finn McCool). Other modern sources suggest (without much justification) that he was Richard Cole (1568–1614) of Bucks in the parish of Woolfardisworthy on the north coast of Devon, whose monument and effigy survive in All Hallows Church, Woolfardisworthy.

===Coel Hen theory===
It is often noted that the name of the legendary Welsh king Coel Hen can be translated &#x27;Old Cole&#x27; or &#x27;Old King Cole&#x27;. This sometimes leads to speculation that he, or some other Coel in Roman Britain, is the model for Old King Cole of the nursery rhyme. However, there is no documentation of a connection between the fourth-century figures and the eighteenth-century nursery rhyme. There is also a dubious connection of Old King Cole to Cornwall and King Arthur found at Tintagel Castle that there was a Cornish King or Lord Coel.

Further speculation connects Old King Cole and thus Coel Hen to Colchester, but in fact Colchester was not named after Coel Hen. Connecting with the musical theme of the nursery rhyme, according to a much later source, Coel Hen supposedly had a daughter who was skilled in music, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, writing in the 12th century.

A legend that King Coel of Colchester was the father of the Empress Saint Helena, and therefore the grandfather of Constantine the Great, appeared in Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. The passages are clearly related, even using some of the same words, but it is not clear which version was first. Henry appears to have written the relevant part of the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; before he knew about Geoffrey&#x27;s work, leading J. S. P. Tatlock and other scholars to conclude that Geoffrey borrowed the passage from Henry, rather than the other way around. The source of the claim is unknown, but may have predated both Henry and Geoffrey. Diana Greenway proposes it came from a lost hagiography of Helena; Antonia Harbus suggests it came instead from oral tradition.

===&quot;Old Cole&quot; theory===
In the 19th century William Chappell, an expert on popular music, suggested that &quot;Old King Cole&quot; was probably derived from &quot;Old Cole&quot;, a nickname that was used many times in Elizabethan theatre, though its meaning is now unclear.

&quot;Old Cole&quot; probably originated from Thomas Deloney&#x27;s &quot;Pleasant History of Thomas of Reading&quot; (c. 1598), about Thomas Cole, a fictional cloth merchant during the reign of Henry I from Reading, who was known as Old Cole throughout the book. In the story, Cole became extremely wealthy, but was killed by an innkeeper at Colnbrook who disposed of Cole&#x27;s body in the Colne Brook river – the story concludes with the lines &quot;And some say, that the river whereinto Cole was cast, did ever since carry the name of Cole, being called The river of Cole, and the Towne of Colebrooke&quot;.

== &quot;Old King Coal&quot; ==
In political cartoons and similar material, especially in Great Britain, sometimes Old King &quot;Coal&quot; (note the spelling difference) has been used to symbolize the coal industry. One such instance is the folk song &quot;Old King Coal&quot; (different than &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, Roud 1164), which was written by English folk musician John Kirkpatrick in 1994. It presents Old King Coal as &quot;a kind of modernization of John Barleycorn&quot;, with the chorus being:&lt;poem&gt;
There&#x27;s fire in the heart of Old King Coal
There&#x27;s the strength of centuries in his soul
There&#x27;s a power that grows where his black blood flows
So here&#x27;s to Old King Coal&lt;/poem&gt;

==Modern usage==
&quot;Old King Cole&quot; is often referred to in popular culture.

===In art===

The Maxfield Parrish mural &quot;Old King Cole&quot; (1894) for the Mask and Wig Club was sold by Christie&#x27;s for $662,500 in 1996. Parrish executed a second &quot;Old King Cole&quot; (1906) for The Knickerbocker Hotel, which was moved to the St. Regis New York in 1948, and is the centerpiece of its King Cole Bar.

====As a marching cadence====
The United States military has used versions of the traditional rhyme in the form of marching cadences since at least the 1920s.

==== In music ====
&quot;Old King Cole&quot; was the subject of a 1923 one-act ballet by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

In 1960, a variation of the song was released on Harry Belafonte&#x27;s live album &quot;Belafonte Returns to Carnegie Hall&quot;.

The first four lines of &quot;Old King Cole&quot; are quoted in the song &quot;The Musical Box&quot; by Genesis, on their third album, &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, released in 1971.

The melody is also used in the song &quot;Great King Rat&quot; by Queen on their eponymous debut album &quot;Queen&quot; (1973), with the lyrics adapted to:
&quot;Great King Rat was a dirty old man,
And a dirty old man was he,
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?&quot;

The jazz musician Nathaniel Coles took the name Nat King Cole.

&quot;Old Queen Cole&quot; was the name of a song by Ween that appears on their album &quot;&quot;. The title and lyrics suggest a reference to the nursery rhyme.

=== In fiction ===
In his 1897 collection &quot;Mother Goose in Prose&quot;, L. Frank Baum included a story explaining the background to the nursery rhyme. In this version, Cole is a donkey-riding commoner who is selected at random to succeed the King of Whatland when the latter dies without heir.

In P. L. Travers&#x27; &quot;Mary Poppins Opens the Door&quot;, the titular character tells her charges a story about how King Cole remembered that he was a merry old soul.

James Joyce made reference to the rhyme in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (619.27f): &quot;With pipe on bowl. Terce for a fiddler, sixt for makmerriers, none for a Cole.&quot; Joyce is also punning on the canonical hours &#x27; (3), &#x27; (6), and &quot;&quot; (9), in &quot;Terce ... sixt ... none&quot;, and on Fionn MacCool and his Fianna, in &quot;fiddlers ... makmerriers ... Cole&quot;.

The Old King Cole theme appeared twice in two cartoons released in 1933. Walt Disney made a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoon, &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, in which the character holds a huge party where various nursery rhyme characters are invited. Walter Lantz produced an Oswald cartoon the same year, &quot;The Merry Old Soul&quot;, which refers to the nursery rhyme.

Old King Cole makes an appearance in the 1938 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short film &quot;Have You Got Any Castles&quot;.

The Three Stooges&#x27; 1948 short film &quot;Fiddlers Three&quot; features Larry, Moe and Shemp as musicians in King Cole&#x27;s court, who must stop an evil wizard from stealing the king&#x27;s daughter.

In the &quot;Fables&quot; comic book series, King Cole is depicted as the long-time mayor of Fabletown.

In the fifteenth season of Dropout&#x27;s tabletop role-playing game show &quot;Dimension 20&quot;, Old King Cole is a character who was once the king of the kingdom of Jubilee.

===In humour and satire===
G. K. Chesterton wrote a poem, &quot;Old King Cole: A Parody&quot;, which presented the nursery rhyme successively in the styles of several poets: Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W. B. Yeats, Robert Browning, Walt Whitman, and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Much later, &quot;Mad&quot; ran a feature similarly postulating classical writers&#x27; treatments of fairy tales. The magazine had Edgar Allan Poe tackle &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, resulting in a cadence similar to that of &quot;The Bells&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;Old King Cole was a merry old soul
Old King Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole, Cole.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="275790" wikidata="Q2304442" url="?curid=275790" title="Coel Hen">
<text>Coel (Old Welsh: &quot;Coil&quot;), also called Coel Hen (Coel the Old) and King Cole, is a figure prominent in Welsh literature and legend since the Middle Ages. Early Welsh tradition knew of a Coel Hen, a 4th-century leader in Roman or Sub-Roman Britain and the progenitor of several kingly lines in Yr Hen Ogledd (the Old North), a region of the Brittonic-speaking area of what is now northern England and southern Scotland.

Later medieval legend told of a Coel, apparently derived from Coel Hen. He was said to be the father of Saint Helena and through her the grandfather of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great.

Other similarly named characters may be confused or conflated with the Welsh Coel. The legendary &quot;King Coel&quot; is sometimes supposed to be the historical basis for the popular nursery rhyme &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, but this has been said to be unlikely.

==Name==
Coel&#x27;s name was rendered &quot;Coil&quot; in Old Welsh. Rare or unique as a Welsh name, its origin has long been seen as uncertain. John T. Koch has argued that it is simply the common noun which in Modern Welsh has the form &quot;coel&quot;, meaning &quot;belief, credence; confidence, reliance, trust, faith&quot; (and the secondary meaning &quot;omen&quot;), derived from Proto-Celtic &quot;omen&quot; and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*keh2ilo-&quot; &quot;whole, healthy; blessed with good omen&quot;. In Koch&#x27;s view, &quot;these semantic and etymological aspects allow that Coil could be a legendary, or even a mythological, founder&quot; of the dynasties that bear his name rather than a historical figure.

It may be the same as the Coel is often named as &quot;Coel Hen&quot;, &quot;Hen&quot; being an epithet meaning &quot;old&quot; (i.e., &quot;Coel the Old&quot;). The genealogies give him an additional epithet or patronym, &quot;Godebog&quot; (Old Welsh: &quot;Guotepauc&quot;), meaning &quot;Protector&quot; or &quot;Shelterer&quot;. His name is thus sometimes given as &quot;Coel Godebog&quot; or &quot;Coel Hen Godebog&quot;. However, some of the Harleian genealogies list Godebog as Coel&#x27;s father&#x27;s name. Geoffrey of Monmouth rendered the name as both &quot;Coel&quot; and &quot;Coillus&quot; in his &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Some modern authors render it as &quot;Cole&quot;.

==Context and evidence==
The historian Ben Guy has commented that &quot;Coel Hen&#x27;s role in medieval texts is solely legendary; there is no merit whatsoever in any attempt to assign him some historically significant role in late Roman Britain, as many over the years [...] have fruitlessly attempted to do&quot;. Coel Hen appears in the Harleian genealogies and the later pedigrees known as the &quot;Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd&quot; (&quot;The Descent of the Men of the North&quot;) at the progenitor of several post-Roman royal families of the Hen Ogledd. His line, collectively called the Coeling, included such noted figures as Urien, king of Rheged; Gwallog, perhaps king of Elmet; the brothers Gwrgi and Peredur; and Clydno Eiddin, king of Eidyn or Edinburgh. The poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; mentions some enmity between the &quot;Sons of Godebog&quot;, possibly a reference to the Coiling, and the heroes who fought for the Gododdin at the Battle of Catraeth.

As an ancestor figure, he compares to Dyfnwal Hen, who is likewise attributed with founding kingly lines in the Hen Ogledd. Hector Boece and Ayrshire folklore both state that Coel and his entire army perished in the Battle of Coilsfield. According to Welsh tradition the region of Kyle was named for Coel, and a mound at Coylton in Ayrshire was regarded as his tomb. Projections back from dated individuals suggest that Coel Hen would have lived around AD 350–420, during the time of the Roman departure from Britain. In his book &quot;The Age of Arthur&quot;, historian John Morris suggested Coel may have been the last of the Roman &quot;Duces Brittanniarum&quot; (Dukes of the Britons) who commanded the Roman army in northern Britain, and split his lands among his heirs after his death. However, Morris&#x27;s book has been widely criticized. It has been suggested that Coel was appointed governor of northern Britain, ruling from Eburacum (York), by Magnus Maximus.

==Colchester legend==
In the twelfth century, a story arose claiming that Colchester in Essex was named after a man called Coel, who was the father of Saint Helena, and therefore the grandfather of Constantine the Great. Though not initially associated with Coel Hen, the two Coels began to be conflated in Welsh scholarship from the fifteenth century. The legend originated from a folk etymology indicating that Colchester was named for Coel (supposedly from &quot;Coel&quot; and &quot;castrum&quot;, producing &quot;fortress of Coel&quot;). However, the city was actually known as &quot;Colneceaster&quot; until the &quot;n&quot; was dropped in around the 10th century; its name likely comes from the local River Colne.

Around the same time, a further development of this legend that King Coel of Colchester was the father of Empress Saint Helena, and therefore the grandfather of Constantine the Great, appeared in Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; and Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. The passages are clearly related, even using some of the same words, but it is not clear which version was first. Henry appears to have written the relevant part of the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; before he knew about Geoffrey&#x27;s work, leading J. S. P. Tatlock and other scholars to conclude that Geoffrey borrowed the passage from Henry, rather than the other way around. The source of the claim is unknown, but may have predated both Henry and Geoffrey. Diana Greenway proposes it came from a lost hagiography of Helena; Antonia Harbus suggests it came instead from oral tradition.

Geoffrey&#x27;s largely legendary &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; expands upon Henry&#x27;s brief mention, listing Coel as a King of the Britons following the reign of King Asclepiodotus. In the &quot;Historia&quot;, Coel grows upset with Asclepiodotus&#x27;s handling of the Diocletianic Persecution and begins a rebellion in his duchy of Caer Colun (Colchester). He meets Asclepiodotus in battle and kills him, thus taking the kingship of Britain upon himself. Rome, apparently, is pleased that Britain has a new king, and sends senator Constantius Chlorus to negotiate with him. Afraid of the Romans, Coel meets Constantius and agrees to pay tribute and submit to Roman laws as long as he is allowed to retain the kingship. Constantius agrees to these terms, but Coel dies one month later. Constantius marries Coel&#x27;s daughter, Helena, and crowns himself as Coel&#x27;s successor. Helena subsequently gives birth to a son who becomes the Emperor Constantine the Great, giving a British pedigree to the Roman imperial line.

Local tradition came to suggest that Coel was responsible for some of the ancient buildings in Colchester; a public conduit in the High Street was named &quot;King Coel&#x27;s Pump&quot;, the Balkerne Gate in the Roman town walls was known as &quot;King Coel&#x27;s Castle&quot; and the remains of the Temple of Claudius over which Colchester Castle was built were called &quot;King Coel&#x27;s Palace&quot;.

== Other stories ==
There is an old story told in the North about Coel&#x27;s last campaign. What is now Scotland was originally inhabited by both Brythonic and Pictish tribes. It was during Coel&#x27;s time that the Scotti tribe began to settle the Western coast around Argyle. Coel, fearing that these Northern peoples would unite against his domain south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, sent raiding parties across his northern border to stir up discord between them. The plan, however, backfired for the Picts and the Scots were not taken in. Coel merely succeeded in pushing the two even closer together, and they began to attack the Brittonic Kingdom of Strathclyde. Coel declared all out war and moved north to expel the invaders. The Picts and Scots fled to the hills ahead of Coel&#x27;s army, who eventually set up camp at what became Coylton alongside the Water of Coyle (Ayrshire). For a long time, the British were triumphant, while the Scots and Picts starved. Desperate for some relief, however, the enemy advanced an all-or-nothing attack on Coel&#x27;s stronghold. Coel and his men were taken by surprise, overrun and scattered to the winds. It is said that Coel wandered the unknown countryside until he eventually got caught in a bog at Coilsfield (in Tarbolton, Ayrshire) and drowned. Coel was first buried in a mound there before being removed to the church at Coylton. The year was about AD 420. After his death, tradition says that Coel&#x27;s Northern kingdom was divided between two of his sons, Ceneu and Gorbanian.

<doc id="275797" wikidata="Q736934" url="?curid=275797" title="Oliver Otis Howard">
<text>Oliver Otis Howard (November 8, 1830 – October 26, 1909) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the Civil War. As a brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac, Howard lost his right arm while leading his men against Confederate forces at the Battle of Fair Oaks/Seven Pines in June 1862, an action which later earned him the Medal of Honor. As a corps commander, he suffered a major defeat at Chancellorsville and his performance was of question at Gettysburg in May and July 1863. However, he recovered from possible career setbacks as a successful corps and later army commander, commanding the Army of the Tennessee from July 27, 1864, until May 19, 1865, leading the army in the battles of Ezra Church, Battle of Jonesborough, Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, and the Carolinas campaign in the Western Theater.

Known as the &quot;Christian General&quot; because he tried to base his policy decisions on his deep, evangelical piety, he was given charge of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in mid-1865, with the mission of integrating the former slaves into Southern society and politics during the second phase of the Reconstruction Era. Howard took charge of labor policy, setting up a system that required freed people to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau, on terms negotiated by the Bureau with white land owners. Howard&#x27;s Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen. He attempted to protect freed blacks from hostile conditions, but lacked adequate power, and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson.

Howard&#x27;s allies, the Radical Republicans, won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction, with the result that freedmen were given the vote. With the help and advice of the Bureau, freedmen joined Republican coalitions and won at the ballot boxes of most of the southern states. Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen, most notably in founding Howard University in Washington, D.C., and serving as its president 1867–73; and aided in the charter of Howard University and Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University) in 1867.

After 1874, Howard commanded troops in the West, conducting a famous campaign against the Nez Perce tribe, led by Chief Joseph. Utley (1987) concludes that his leadership against the Apaches in 1872, Nez Perce in 1877, Bannocks and Paiutes in 1878, and the Sheepeaters in 1879 all add up to a lengthy record, although he did not fight as much as George Custer or Nelson Miles.

==Early years==
Oliver Howard was born in Leeds, Maine, the son of Rowland Bailey Howard and Eliza Otis Howard. His great-grandfather, Rogers Stinchfield and great-granduncle Thomas Stinchfield founded Leeds. Rowland, a farmer, died when Oliver was 9 years old. Oliver attended Monmouth Academy in Monmouth, North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth, Kents Hill School in Readfield, and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1850 at the age of 19. He then attended the United States Military Academy, graduating in 1854, fourth in his class of 46 cadets, as a brevet second lieutenant of ordnance. He served at the Watervliet Arsenal near Troy, New York, and was the temporary commander of the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta, Maine. In 1855, he married Elizabeth Anne Waite, with whom he would have seven children. In 1857 he was transferred to Florida for the Seminole Wars. It was in Florida that he experienced a conversion to evangelical Christianity and considered resigning from the Army to become a minister. His religious proclivities would later earn him the nickname &quot;the Christian general.&quot; Howard was promoted first lieutenant in July 1857, and returned to West Point the following September to become an instructor of mathematics. As the Civil War began with the surrender of Fort Sumter, thoughts of the ministry were put aside and he decided to remain in the service of his country.

==Civil War==
Howard was appointed colonel of the 3rd Maine Infantry regiment and temporarily commanded a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run. He was promoted to brigadier general effective September 3, 1861, and given permanent command of his brigade. He then joined Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac for the Peninsula Campaign.

On June 1, 1862, while commanding a Union brigade in the Fair Oaks, Howard was wounded twice in his right arm, which was subsequently amputated. (He received the Medal of Honor in 1893 for his heroism at Fair Oaks.) Brig. Gen. Philip Kearny, who had lost his left arm, visited Howard and joked that they would be able to shop for gloves together. Howard recovered quickly enough to rejoin the army for the Battle of Antietam, in which he rose to division command in the II Corps. He was promoted to major general in November 1862 and assumed command of the XI Corps the following April, replacing Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel. Since the corps was composed largely of German immigrants, many of whom spoke no English, the soldiers were resentful of their new leader and openly called for Sigel&#x27;s reinstatement.

===Failure at Chancellorsville===
At the Battle of Chancellorsville, Howard suffered the first of two significant military setbacks. On May 2, 1863, his corps was on the right flank of the Union line, northwest of the crossroads of Chancellorsville. Robert E. Lee and Lt. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson devised an audacious plan in which Jackson&#x27;s entire corps would march secretly around the Union flank and attack it. Howard was warned by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, that his flank was &quot;in the air&quot;, not anchored by a natural obstacle, such as a river, and that Confederate forces might be on the move in his direction. Howard failed to heed the warning and Jackson struck before dark, routing the XI Corps and causing a serious disruption to the Union plans.

===Gettysburg===
At the Battle of Gettysburg, the XI Corps, still chastened by its humiliation in May, arrived on the field in the afternoon of July 1, 1863. Poor positioning of the defensive line by one of Howard&#x27;s subordinate division commanders, Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, was exploited by the Confederate corps of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell and once again the XI Corps collapsed, forcing it to retreat through the streets of Gettysburg, leaving many men behind to be taken prisoner. On Cemetery Hill, south of town, Howard quarreled with Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock about who was in command of the defense. Hancock had been sent by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade with written orders to take command, but Howard insisted that he was the ranking general present. Eventually he relented. Controversy centers on three points: 1) Howard&#x27;s choice of Cemetery Hill as the key to defense; 2) the timing of Howard&#x27;s mid-afternoon order to abandon positions north and west of town; and 3) Howard&#x27;s reluctance to recognize that Hancock, his junior, had superseded him. Historian John A. Carpenter holds that Howard alone had wisely selected Cemetery Hill, that the order to withdraw was probably a sound one, and that the conflict between Howard and Hancock might have been avoided had Meade himself gotten onto the field.

Howard started circulating the story that his corps&#x27; failure had actually been triggered by the collapse of Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday&#x27;s I Corps to the west, and this was a partial reason for Doubleday&#x27;s removal from command of the corps. However, this excuse was not accepted by history—the reverse was actually true—and the reputation of the XI Corps was ruined. Some argue that Howard should get some credit for the eventual success at Gettysburg because he wisely stationed one of his divisions (Maj. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr&#x27;s) on Cemetery Hill as a reserve and critical subsequent defensive line. For the remainder of the three-day battle, the corps remained on the defensive around Cemetery Hill, withstanding assaults by Maj. Gen. Jubal Early on July 2 and participating at the margin of the defense against Pickett&#x27;s Charge on July 3. Also at Gettysburg, Howard&#x27;s younger brother, Major Charles Henry Howard, served as his aide-de-camp.

===Western theater===
Howard and XI Corps were transferred to the Western Theater with fellow general Henry Slocum&#x27;s XII Corps to become part of the Army of the Cumberland in Tennessee; they were commanded once again by &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker. In the Battles for Chattanooga, the corps joined the impulsive assault that captured Missionary Ridge and forced the retreat of Gen. Braxton Bragg. In July 1864, following the death of Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, temporary command of the Army of the Tennessee was given by order of William Tecumseh Sherman to the ranking officer on the field that day, Major General John A. Logan. Shortly after the success at the Battle of Atlanta, Sherman (who favored granting command to a West Point graduate) appointed Howard to permanent command of the Army of the Tennessee. At the closing of his &quot;After Action Report&quot; filed by Major General John A. Logan on September 10, 1864, Logan referred to his having served as Commander of the Army of the Tennessee for a scant four days. Logan&#x27;s detailed report ended with: &quot;I withdrew the Army of the Tennessee the night of the 26th, and moved it along the rear of the center and right of the army to a position across Proctor&#x27;s Creek. After putting the army in position that night I was relieved by Maj. Gen. Howard.&quot; Howard subsequently led the right wing of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s famous March to the Sea, through Georgia and then the Carolinas. Sherman, having favored Howard over Logan for permanent command of the Army of the Tennessee, recognized Logan&#x27;s success at Atlanta. In recognition of the outstanding leadership Logan displayed at Atlanta, Sherman asked Howard to allow Logan to ceremonially lead the Army in the May 1865 Grand Review in Washington. Howard agreed when Sherman appealed to him as a Christian gentleman. Ultimately, by the war&#x27;s end, Gen. Sherman would commend Howard as a corps commander of &quot;the utmost skill, nicety and precision&quot;.

==Postwar career==
===Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau===
From May 1865 to July 1874, General Howard was commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau (the Army&#x27;s Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands), where he played a major role in the Reconstruction era, and had charge of integrating freedmen (former slaves) into American society. Howard devised far-reaching programs and guidelines including social welfare in the form of rations, schooling, courts, and medical care. Howard often clashed with President Andrew Johnson, who strongly disliked the welfare aspects of the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau, and especially tried to return political power to Southern whites. However, Howard had the support of the Radical Republicans in Congress. When the Radical Republicans gained power in 1867, they gave blacks the right to vote in the South and set up new elections, which the Republican coalition of freedmen, northern Republicans who came south and were referred to derogatorily as carpetbaggers, and southerners who supported Reconstruction, nicknamed scalawags, won (except in Virginia). The Bureau was very active in helping blacks organize themselves politically, and therefore it became a target of partisan hostility.

President Johnson called Howard a fanatic. Reconstruction&#x27;s opponents alleged that, in abusing both civil and military power, the Bureau became a centralized dictatorship. Howard described the extent of his enormous powers as:

...Almost unlimited authority gave me scope and liberty of action... Legislative, judicial and executive powers were combined in my commission.

Andrew Johnson reacted to the meaning of such unlimited scope of action against civilians:

The power thus given to the commanding officer over all the people ... is that of an absolute monarch ... He alone is permitted to determine the rights of persons and property ... It places at his free disposal all the lands and goods in his district, and he may distribute them without let or hindrance to whom he pleases. Being bound by no State law, and there being no other law to regulate the subject, he may make a criminal code of his own; and can make it as bloody as any in history ... Everything is a crime which he chooses to call so, and all persons are condemned who he pronounces to be guilty.

The limited ideological framework of General Howard and his aides encouraged their attempt at radical reconstruction of southern society without realizing the need for essential legislation. They thought that the elimination of all statutory inequalities—for instance, Black court testimony—would be enough to assure protection. Southern states pretended to comply with this point in order to end the threat of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau courts&#x27; system.

===Military commands and Native American affairs===
In 1872, Howard, accompanied by 1st Lt Joseph A. Sladen, who served as his aide, was ordered to Arizona Territory to negotiate a peace treaty with Cochise, resulting in a treaty on October 12. This episode of American history was dramatized in the movie &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (see below)
He was placed in command of the Department of the Columbia in 1874, went west to Washington Territory&#x27;s Fort Vancouver, where he fought in the Indian Wars, particularly against the Nez Perce in Idaho and Montana territories in 1877, with the resultant surrender of Chief Joseph. He was criticized by Chief Joseph as precipitating the war by trying to rush the Nez Perce to a smaller reservation, with no advance notice, no discussion, and no time to prepare. Joseph said, &quot;If General Howard had given me plenty of time to gather up my stock and treated Too-hool-hool-suit as a man should be treated, there would have been no war.&quot;

Subsequently, Howard was superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1881–1882. He served as commander of the Department of the Platte from 1882 to 1886 and the Military Division of the Pacific from 1886 to 1888. From 1888, his final command was of the Department of the East (Military Division of the Atlantic) at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York Harbor, encompassing the states east of the Mississippi River. He retired from the U.S. Army at that posting in 1894 with the rank of major general. The French government made him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1884 and he was subsequently promoted to the ranks of officer and commander.

===Howard University===
General Howard is also remembered for playing a role in founding Howard University, which was incorporated by Congress in 1867. The school is nonsectarian and is open to both sexes without regard to race. On November 20, 1866, Howard was among 10 members of various socially concerned groups of the time who met in Washington, D.C., to discuss plans for a theological seminary to train black ministers. Interest was sufficient, however, to create an educational institute for areas other than the ministry. The result was the Howard Normal and Theological Institute for the Education of Preachers and Teachers. On January 8, 1867, the board of trustees voted to change the name of the institution to Howard University. Howard served as president from 1869 to 1874. He was quoted as saying &quot;[t]he opposition to Negro education made itself felt everywhere in a combination not to allow the freed men any room or building in which a school might be taught. In 1865, 1866, and 1867, mobs of the baser classes at intervals and in all parts of the South occasionally burned school buildings and churches used as schools, flogged teachers or drove them away, and in a number of instances murdered them.&quot; He also founded Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee, in 1895, for the education of the &quot;mountain whites.&quot;

===Memberships===
General Howard was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Grand Army of the Republic.

===Death and burial===
Oliver Howard died in Burlington, Vermont on October 26, 1909, and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. At his death, Howard was the last surviving Union Army general to have held the permanent rank of a general in the regular U.S. Army.
==Legacy==
A bust of Howard designed by artist James E. Kelly is on display at Howard University. An equestrian statue is on East Cemetery Hill on the Gettysburg Battlefield. A dormitory at Bowdoin College is named for Howard.

The Oliver O. Howard Relief Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic provided funds to help destitute former Union soldiers and to support worthy public causes. It contributed money and the design for the State Flag of Utah in 1920. An Army Reserve Center was named after him in Auburn, Maine, and is still used today by several U.S. Army Reserve units.

Howard High School of Technology in Wilmington, Delaware, is named in his honor, as is Howard County, Nebraska and the Howard School of Academics and Technology, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Howard, Kansas is named in his honor.

The O. O. Howard House, located on Officers Row within the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site was built in 1878 upon General Howard&#x27;s order at a cost of $6,938.20 (~$ in ). Completed in 1879, the building suffered a fire in 1986 and was left vacant until renovated by the City of Vancouver in 1998. The building serves as the headquarters of the Fort Vancouver National Trust.

In Portland, Oregon, on the 150th Anniversary of Howard&#x27;s acts of valor on June 1, 1862, while leading his troops at the Battle of Fair Oaks, a commemorative wreath was laid by the Oregon Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission at the site of General Howard&#x27;s former residence in downtown Portland at the corner of SW 10th and Morrison. The month of June 2012 was dedicated to Howard with a lecture and programs by the Oregon Civil War Sesquicentennial spotlighting General Howard&#x27;s activities in Portland and at Fort Vancouver, Washington; and his post-war achievements at the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, Howard University and Lincoln Memorial University and the Indian Wars. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview given the day after Howard retired from the Army on November 8, 1894, at the age of 64, it was reported that he was traveling West to stay at his daughter&#x27;s house in Portland, Oregon, where he planned to start writing his memoirs.

<doc id="275801" wikidata="Q611744" url="?curid=275801" title="TWiki">
<text>TWiki is a Perl-based structured wiki application, typically used to run a collaboration platform, knowledge or document management system, a knowledge base, or team portal. Users can create wiki pages using the TWiki Markup Language, and developers can extend wiki application functionality with plugins.

The TWiki project was founded by Peter Thoeny in 1998 as an open-source wiki-based application platform. In October 2008, the company TWiki.net, created by Thoeny, assumed full control over the TWiki project while much of the developer community forked off to join the Foswiki project.

==Major features==

* Revision control - complete audit trail, also for meta data such as attachments and access control settings
* Fine-grained access control - restrict read/write/rename on site level, web level, page level based on user groups
* Extensible TWiki markup language
* TinyMCE based WYSIWYG editor
* Dynamic content generation with TWiki variables
* Forms and reporting - capture structured content, report on it with searches embedded in pages
* Built in database - users can create wiki applications using the TWiki Markup Language
* Skinnable user interface
* RSS/Atom feeds and e-mail notification
* Over 400 Extensions and 200 Plugins

===TWiki extensions===

TWiki has a plugin API that has spawned over 300 extensions to link into databases, create charts, tags, sort tables, write spreadsheets, create image gallery and slideshows, make drawings, write blogs, plot graphs, interface to many different authentication schemes, track Extreme Programming projects and so on.

===TWiki application platform===

TWiki as a structured wiki provides database-like manipulation of fields stored on pages, and offers a SQL-like query language to embed reports in wiki pages.

Wiki applications are also called situational applications because they are created &quot;ad hoc&quot; by the users for very specific needs. Users have built TWiki applications that include call center status boards, to-do lists, inventory systems, employee handbooks, bug trackers, blog applications, discussion forums, status reports with rollups and more.

===User interface===

The interface of TWiki is completely skinnable in templates, themes and (per user) CSS. It includes support for internationalization (&#x27;I18N&#x27;), with support for multiple character sets, UTF-8 URLs, and the user interface has been translated into Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.

==TWiki deployment==

TWiki is primarily used at the workplace as a corporate wiki to coordinate team activities, track projects, implement workflows and as an Intranet Wiki. The TWiki community estimates 40,000 corporate wiki sites as of March 2007, and 20,000 public TWiki sites.

TWiki customers include Fortune 500 such as Disney, Motorola, Nokia, NYU, Oracle Corporation and Yahoo!, as well as small and medium enterprises, such as ARM Holdings and DHL. TWiki has also been used to create collaborative internet sites, such as the City of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;FutureMelbourne&quot; wiki where citizens can collaborate on the future plan.

==Realization==

TWiki is implemented in Perl. Wiki pages are stored in plain text files. Everything, including meta such as access control settings, are version controlled using RCS. RCS is optional since an all-Perl version control system is provided.

TWiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data. Many corporate TWiki installations have several hundred thousand pages and tens of thousands of users. Load balancing and caching can be used to improve performance on high traffic sites.

TWiki has database features built into the engine. A TWiki Form is attached to a page as meta data. This represents a database record. A set of pages that share the same type of form build a database table. A formatted search with a SQL-like query can be embedded into a page to construct dynamic presentation of data from multiple pages. This allows for building wiki applications and constitutes the TWiki&#x27;s notion of a structured wiki.

==Forks of TWiki==
Forks of TWiki include:
* 2001: Spinner Wiki (abandoned)
* 2008: Foswiki, launched in October 2008 when a dispute about the future guidance of the project could not be settled, resulting in the departure of much of the TWiki community including the core developer team

<text>The National Alliance was a white supremacist, neo-Nazi political organization founded by William Luther Pierce in 1974 and based in Mill Point, West Virginia. Membership in 2002 was estimated at 2,500 with an annual income of $1 million. Membership declined after Pierce&#x27;s death in 2002, and after a split in its ranks in 2005, became largely defunct. 

==History==
The National Alliance was reorganized from an earlier group called the National Youth Alliance (NYA), which in turn was formed out of the remains of the youth wing of Governor George Wallace&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. The NYA broke into factions as a result of infighting, and William Luther Pierce, a former physics associate-professor and later author of the white supremacist novels &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;, gained control of the largest remnant and relaunched it as the National Alliance in 1974.

William Pierce was arrested in 1995 on charges of assaulting a female staff member on the grounds of the Mill Point headquarters. Twenty years later, Will Williams was also arrested for assault of a female staff member while serving as chairman of the National Alliance.

The Order was an offshoot of the National Alliance and modeled themselves after a similar group depicted in &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. Timothy McVeigh was in possession of a copy of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; at the time of his arrest following the Oklahoma City Bombing. McVeigh bought copies of the book (published by the National Alliance), sold them at gun shows, and otherwise distributed them.

In 1997, two National Alliance members were charged with committing bank robberies in Florida and Connecticut. One of them admitted to channeling funds from the robberies to the National Alliance. He was charged with attempting to detonate a series of pipe bombs in order to divert attention from a future robbery.

German fugitive Hendrik Moebus was captured near the National Alliance compound, at which he is believed to been hiding, in August 2000.
Following Pierce&#x27;s death from cancer in 2002, the Alliance&#x27;s board of directors appointed Erich Gliebe to succeed him as chairman of the organization. A series of power struggles began almost immediately, with high-ranking members either resigning or being fired. A boycott of the National Alliance&#x27;s Resistance Records label resulted in a steep drop-off in generated funds.

In April 2005, prominent Alliance member Kevin Alfred Strom, then editor of &quot;National Vanguard&quot; magazine, issued a declaration calling for Gliebe to step down; the Alliance&#x27;s executive committee and most of its unit coordinators supported the action. Gliebe refused, claiming that the Alliance operated under the &quot;Leadership Principle&quot; and stating that he would not yield to any coup. Strom formed a new group called National Vanguard. In January 2008, Strom pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in exchange for the other charges to be dropped. He was sentenced to 23 months in prison on April 23, 2008. Strom told the court before being sentenced that he was &quot;not a pedophile&quot; and was &quot;in fact the precise opposite of what has been characterized in this case&quot;, saying he had been &quot;unwillingly&quot; possessing 10 images of child pornography and that those came from an online forum he had visited which had been &quot;flooded with spam&quot;, which included &quot;sleazy, tragic&quot; pictures of children that he deleted. The judge of the case responded: &quot;Mr. Strom, you pled guilty to charges that now you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;re innocent. I prefer people plead not guilty than put it on me.&quot;

Shortly after the attempted coup by Strom, Gliebe resigned as chairman of the Alliance and briefly appointed Shaun Walker as his successor. However, following Walker&#x27;s arrest in June 2006, Gliebe again assumed leadership of the organization. By that year, paid membership for the Alliance had declined to fewer than 800 and the paid staff was down to only ten people. By 2012, the Alliance reportedly consisted of fewer than 100 members, with no paid staff other than Gliebe. The following year, it was revealed that the Alliance&#x27;s property in Mill Point, West Virginia, had been put up for sale. The end of the National Alliance as a &quot;membership organization&quot; was confirmed by Gliebe in September 2013.

===Will Williams offshoot===
In 2014, Will Williams became head of an organization which calls itself the National Alliance (NA). However, a rival faction disputes the claim that this group is maintaining continuity with the original Alliance which was founded by Pierce. The Williams led NA has since been embroiled in several legal issues.

In 2015, an accountant was hired to audit the NA&#x27;s books by Williams. According to a lawsuit which was filed by a former Baltimore attorney against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), there was a confrontation between the accountant and Williams. The lawsuit further claims that after the accountant left the NA headquarters he released documents that he had scanned to the SPLC.

In December 2015, Williams was arrested and charged with battery after he allegedly hit and strangled a female employee on the grounds of the Mill Point compound. He was convicted, briefly incarcerated, and placed on probation. 

Williams was banned from the NA compound in West Virginia pursuant to a court order stemming from his 2015 arrest.

Williams claims that the National Alliance &quot;(is) back. We are definitely back&quot;. He also said in a letter to a newspaper sent from Laurel Bloomery, Tennessee (allegedly the NA&#x27;s headquarters) that &quot;(The National Alliance does) not appreciate being called &#x27;haters&#x27; or being associated with some &#x27;hate movement&#x27;.&quot;

===Murder of a British MP===
Thomas Mair, later to be convicted of murdering the British Labour Party politician Jo Cox, was connected to the National Alliance.

==Business==
Before the death of Pierce, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the National Alliance the best-financed and best-organized white nationalist organization of its kind in the United States. In 2002, the National Alliance was estimated to have 2,500 members, with an annual income of $1 million.

In 2004, Harry Robert McCorkill of New Brunswick, Canada, attempted to will his entire estate (valued at $220,000) to the National Alliance upon his death. However, in 2014, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of New Brunswick invalidated his will on the ground that the National Alliance incites hatred.

===Media===
The organization held a radio/internet show named &quot;American Dissident Voices&quot;, and the organization also published a &quot;National Alliance Bulletin&quot;.

Its publication &quot;Attack!&quot; was started by Pierce to increase membership in the National Youth Alliance in 1968. He published and edited the publication. It was later retitled &quot;National Vanguard&quot;.

====Resistance Records====

The organization ran a white power record label which was called Resistance Records. In 2002, it released the video game &quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot;, an action which was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League.

==== National Vanguard Books ====
National Vanguard Books, Inc. was the book publishing firm of the National Alliance.

===Cosmotheist Church===
The spiritual aspect of the National Alliance&#x27;s ideology is espoused by the Cosmotheist Community Church.

<doc id="275803" wikidata="Q1234847" url="?curid=275803" title="Gillingham, Dorset">
<text>Gillingham ( ) is a town and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale area of Dorset, England. It lies on the B3095 and B3081 roads, approximately south of the A303 trunk road and northwest of Shaftesbury. It is the most northerly town in the county. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 11,756. The neighbouring hamlets of Peacemarsh, Bay and Wyke have become part of Gillingham as it has expanded.

Gillingham is pronounced with a hard initial &quot;g&quot; (), unlike Gillingham, Kent, which is pronounced with a soft &quot;g&quot; ().

==History==

There is a Stone Age barrow in the town, and evidence of Roman settlement in the 2nd and 3rd centuries; however the town was established by the Saxons. The church of St Mary the Virgin has a Saxon cross shaft dating from the 9th century.

The name Gillingham was used for the town in its 10th century Saxon charter, and also in an entry for 1016 in the annals, as the location of a battle between King Edmund Ironside and Danish King Cnut. In the Domesday Book in 1086 it is recorded as &quot;Gelingeham&quot;, and later spellings include &quot;Gellingeham&quot; in 1130, &quot;Gyllingeham&quot; in 1152 and &quot;Gilingeham&quot; in 1209. The name derives from a personal name plus the Old English &quot;inga&quot; and &quot;hām&quot;, and means a homestead of the family or followers of a man called Gylla.

Half of the town&#x27;s population of 2,000 died of the Black Death in the four months following October 1348.

In the Middle Ages, Gillingham was the site of a royal hunting lodge, visited by Kings Henry I, Henry II, John and Henry III. A nearby royal forest, Gillingham Forest, was set aside for the king&#x27;s deer. The lodge fell into disrepair and was destroyed in 1369 by Edward III.

Edward Rawson, the first secretary to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was born in Gillingham.

Gillingham became a local farming centre, gained the first grammar school in Dorset in 1516 and a silk mill in 1769. Gillingham&#x27;s church has a 14th-century chancel, though most of the rest of the building was built in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many other buildings in the town are of Tudor origin.

In the 1820s, the artist John Constable stayed at Gillingham vicarage and, being impressed by the beauty of the countryside, executed several local sketches and paintings. His painting of the old town bridge is in the Tate Gallery. In the 1850s, the arrival of the railway to the town brought prosperity and new industries including brickmaking, cheese production, printing, soap manufacture and at the end of the 19th century one of the first petrol engine plants in the country. In the Second World War Gillingham&#x27;s position on the railway from London to Exeter was key to its rapid growth. In 1940 and 1941 there was large-scale evacuation of London and other industrial cities to rural towns, particularly in the north, southwest and Wales. Gillingham grew rapidly because of this.

Gillingham was the centre of a liberty of the same name.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Gillingham civil parish had 5,345 dwellings, 5,107 households and a population of 11,756.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2011 is shown in the table below:

==Governance==
Gillingham is divided into four electoral wards for Town Council: Gillingham Town, Lodbourne, Milton and Wyke. Their total population in the 2011 census was 9,799. They form part of the constituency of North Dorset, which is currently represented in the UK parliament by the Conservative Simon Hoare.

After 2019 structural changes to local government in England, the Gillingham ward ahs elected three councillors to Dorset Council.

==Economy and society==
Gillingham has good transport links, being south of the A303, the main road from London to the South West, and having a railway station on the Exeter to London railway line. Salisbury is about 30 minutes away by train, and 50 minutes by car. It is approximately two hours into central London, with trains arriving at Waterloo.

The town has 70 shops and two commercial estates (Brickfields Business Park and Brickfields Industrial Estate) and the Gillingham education area has 7 primary schools(4 in the town) and 1 secondary school.

The town plays host to the annual &#x27;Gillingham &amp; Shaftesbury Show&#x27;, which is an agricultural show held every August at the showground on the outskirts of the town. Gillingham Town Carnival is held every October.

The biggest sports club in the town is North Dorset Rugby Club. This is located at Slaughtergate on the west side of Gillingham. The town also has a Non-League football club, Gillingham Town, which plays at Woodwater Lane.

Until 2009, when it ceased for financial reasons, Gillingham hosted an annual 10-day festival of music and sport. Gillingham has had a brass band since 1928 and perform at civic events and carnivals.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

<doc id="275811" wikidata="Q46052" url="?curid=275811" title="Anders Fogh Rasmussen">
<text>Anders Fogh Rasmussen (; born 26 January 1953) is a Danish politician who was the prime minister of Denmark from November 2001 to April 2009 and the secretary general of NATO from August 2009 to October 2014. He became founder of political consultancy Rasmussen Global and founded the Alliance of Democracies Foundation. He serves as a senior adviser to Citigroup. He also served as a senior advisor at the Boston Consulting Group.

Rasmussen was first elected to the Folketing in 1978 and served in various ministerial positions, including Minister of Tax (1987–1992) and Minister of Economic Affairs (1990–1992). In his early career, Rasmussen was a strident critic of the welfare state, writing the classical liberal book &quot;From Social State to Minimal State&quot; in 1993. However, his views moved towards the political centre through the 1990s. He was elected the leader of the conservative-liberal party Venstre in 1998 and headed a centre-right coalition with the Conservative People&#x27;s Party which took office in November 2001 and won its second and third terms in February 2005 and in November 2007. Rasmussen&#x27;s government relied on the Danish People&#x27;s Party for support, keeping with the Danish tradition of minority government.

His government introduced tougher limits on immigration and a freeze on tax rates (&quot;skattestoppet&quot; in Danish). Certain taxes were lowered, but his coalition partners in the Conservative People&#x27;s Party repeatedly argued for more tax cuts and a flat tax rate at no higher than 50%. Rasmussen&#x27;s government implemented an administrative reform reducing the number of municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;) and replacing the thirteen counties (&quot;amter&quot;) with five regions which he referred to as &quot;the biggest reform in thirty years&quot;. He authored several books about taxation and government structure.

He resigned as prime minister in April 2009 to become Secretary General of NATO, a military alliance that was expanding into Eastern Europe. He aggressively pushed NATO in new directions that extended far beyond the traditional roles of containment of the Soviet Union and directing the Cold War in Europe. His term ended on 30 September 2014. He was the first former prime minister since Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium in 1961 to become Secretary General of NATO.

He became a private consultant on the international stage. He is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network (ELN).

== Personal life ==
Rasmussen was born in 1953 in Ginnerup, Jutland, Denmark, to farmer Knud Rasmussen and Martha Rasmussen (née Fogh). His surname is Rasmussen; Fogh, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, is his middle name and not considered part of his last name. He is correctly referred to as Rasmussen (not Fogh Rasmussen), unless his full name (including his given name) is used. In Danish media and society, he has often been popularly referred to as Fogh Rasmussen, or merely Anders Fogh, when not referred to by his full name, mainly to distinguish him from other prominent politicians in the country with the same family name.

He matriculated in languages and social studies from Viborg Cathedral School, in 1969–1972 and studied economics at the University of Aarhus, graduating in 1978. He has been active in politics most of his life and has authored several books about taxation and government structure. He and his wife Anne-Mette married in 1978 and have three children and six grandchildren.

As an amateur cyclist, Rasmussen completed part of the notorious Alpe d&#x27;Huez stage of the 2008 Tour de France the day after the professional race took place. His attendance at &quot;Le Tour&quot; was at the invitation of Danish former cyclist Bjarne Riis.

He is of no relation to either his predecessor Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, nor his successor Lars Løkke Rasmussen as Prime Minister of Denmark.

Rasmussen received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2017. 

== Early political career ==
He has held positions in government and opposition throughout his career, first winning a seat in the Folketing (Danish parliament) in 1978.

=== Politics ===
In general, Rasmussen is in favour of centralisation, privatisation and limiting the size of government.

Rasmussen wrote the book &quot;From Social State to Minimal State&quot; () in 1993, in which he advocated an extensive reform of the Danish welfare system along classic liberal lines. In particular, he favours lower taxes and less government interference in corporate and individual matters. In 1993 he was awarded the Adam Smith award by the libertarian society Libertas, partly because of this book.

=== Resignation as Minister of Taxation ===
From 1987 to 1990 he was Minister for Taxation and from 1990 Minister for Economy and Taxation in the Conservative-led Poul Schlüter government.

In 1992 Rasmussen resigned from his ministerial posts after a report from a commission of inquiry had decided that he had provided the Folketing with inaccurate and incomplete information regarding his decision to postpone payment of several bills from Regnecentralen and Kommunedata from one accounting year to the next. Rasmussen disagreed with the findings of the commission, but faced with the threat of a motion of no confidence, he left his posts voluntarily.

=== 2001 election ===
His Liberal (&quot;Venstre&quot;) Party won power in the November 2001 election, defeating the Social Democratic government of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and enabling him to form his first cabinet. That election marked a dramatic change in Danish politics. It was the first time since 1920 that the Social Democratic Party lost its position as the largest party in the Folketing (parliament), mainly due to a loss of working class votes to Dansk Folkeparti (The Danish People&#x27;s Party).

== Prime Minister of Denmark ==
Following the 2001 election, &quot;Venstre&quot; formed a government in a parliamentary coalition with the Conservative People&#x27;s Party to form a minority government with the parliamentary support of Dansk Folkeparti. Together these three parties survived both the 2005 election and the 2007 election.

After becoming Prime Minister, Rasmussen distanced himself from his earlier writings and announced the death of neoliberalism during the national elections of 2005. Commonly regarded to have been inspired by the success of Tony Blair, Rasmussen now seemed more in favour of the theories of Anthony Giddens and his third way. There was talk in Libertas of revoking Fogh Rasmussen&#x27;s award as a result of this, though this never happened.

His government enacted tough measures designed to limit the number of immigrants coming to Denmark, specifically as asylum seekers or through arranged marriages. However, his governments depended on the support of Dansk Folkeparti, and it is impossible to draw a clear dividing line between his personal ideology and the required compromises with Dansk Folkeparti.

=== Tax reform ===
After the 2001 elections, Venstre banned all tax increases. Venstre campaigned by claiming that taxes had been growing constantly during the previous eight years under the Social Democrats. While the overall tax burden was more or less unchanged from 1993 until 2001, there was a shift from the taxation of income, both corporate and personal, to a personal consumption (especially through the &quot;ecological taxes&quot; (da. &quot;grønne afgifter&quot;)), which gave the average citizen the impression of rising taxes.

This &quot;tax stop&quot; was criticised by left wing parties, allegedly for being &quot;antisocial&quot; and &quot;only for the rich.&quot; Since the tax stop also froze the tax on real property (da. &quot;ejendomsværdiskat&quot;, 1%), it was beneficial to homeowners in densely populated regions that had experienced rising real estate values. The property tax was set at a nominal level – not at a relative level. While the rate was one percent when the tax stop was enacted, the rate is much less today when recent increases in property value (+20%/p.a. in large cities) are considered. The Danish Economic Council criticized this as unfairly benefiting current homeowners.

Even though the total tax burden was marginally higher in 2005 than in 2001, the tax stop was popular among voters. Thus, in January 2005, the Social Democrats announced that they accepted the principle of a tax stop until at least one right-wing party was willing to participate in tax reform.

The tax stop has, however, been ineffective, judging by Venstre&#x27;s intentions. Its goal was to halt the growth of public expenditures (and halt the growth of taxes), but even with cuts in public spending (which were considered aggressive by the political left wing), overall spending continued to rise by approximately one percentage point above inflation each year.

From 2004 and onwards, minor tax cuts came into effect, on two accounts:
# People with jobs got a 3% tax reduction on the 5.5% &quot;bottom tax&quot; (da. &quot;bundskat&quot;).
# An &quot;employment deduction&quot; (da. &quot;beskæftigelsesfradrag&quot;) was introduced. This initiative was to encourage people to get off welfare and take jobs instead.
# The bottom limit of the &quot;middle tax&quot; (da. &quot;mellemskat&quot;) of 6%, was raised by 12.000 DKK every year, over the next four years. This was supposed to limit the income stresses of middle incomes and families with children.

In 2009 a major tax reform was implemented. The overall marginal tax rate was reduced by 7.5%. In the end, the top tax rate (topskatten) was not changed, but the income level at which it applied was raised. This had the effect of removing 350,000 Danes from the top tax bracket. The medium tax rate was eliminated, and the lowest was reduced by 1.5%. Various other tax reforms were enacted such as an increase in the old age pension, incentives for renovation, and various initiatives designed to improve energy efficiency. Finance Minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, called it the biggest reduction in the marginal tax rate since the introduction of income tax in 1903. In 2009 tax revenue was 777,375 million Krone. It had grown to 831,172 million in 2011, 901,001 million in 2013, 954,473 million in 2015, and 995,058 million in 2017. It&#x27;s important to note that from 2011 to 2015 Social Democrat Helle Thorning-Schmidt was the prime minister, however, she passed a tax-reform with support from the liberal-conservative opposition. It raised the top tax threshold, effectively lowering tax rates for high income earners.

=== 2002 EU Presidency ===
Rasmussen held the rotating presidency of the European Union from July to December 2002, proving his dedication to a pro-EU agenda and the guiding principles of the Ellemann-Jensen doctrine. He pursued this to its logical conclusion by publicly denouncing the Danish collaboration policy during its second World War occupation, the first official apology on behalf of Denmark for this.

=== War in Iraq ===

As Prime Minister, Rasmussen strongly supported the 2003 Iraq War. As in most European countries he faced considerable opposition, both in the parliament and in the general population. Subsequent opinion polls suggested the Danish population&#x27;s opinion was split on the issue. One vocal protester managed to get into the Danish parliament during the period before the war, where he poured red paint on the prime minister while yelling &quot;Du har blod på dine hænder&quot; (literally: &quot;You have blood on your hands&quot;). A member of the Danish parliament for the socialist Red-Green Alliance, Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil, stated that it was a reaction she might have made under the circumstances, although she later denounced such behaviour. Denmark was one of only five countries to take part in the actual invasion operations (the others being the U.S., UK, Poland and Australia) though the contingent mainly consisted of two minor warships and staff and radio units that were never involved in actual combat. In the months after the initial phase of the war, Danish troops participated in the multi-national force stationed in Iraq. Approximately 550 Danish troops were stationed in Iraq from 2004 and into 2007, first at &quot;Camp Dannevang&quot; and later at &quot;Camp Einherjer&quot;, both near Basra. When the contingent of troops left around August 2007, it was not replaced and Denmark shifted its focus to non-military support around Baghdad. The official reason provided is that the Iraqi government should now be able to handle security in the Basra area. Critics of Rasmussen argued that the withdrawal was motivated by decreasing domestic support for the war.

In 2004 Rasmussen&#x27;s government came under attack based on questions of how much intelligence it had with regard to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The government held hearings, and was forced to publish classified reports it had consulted about the likelihood of banned weapons existing in Iraq. While the Blair and Bush administrations became the subject of criticism for extended periods because of their reliance on questionable intelligence, Rasmussen stayed clear of this controversy. This is probably largely because the motion passed by parliament (Folketinget) authorising the deployment of Danish troops states as the reason for the deployment Iraq&#x27;s continued refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors in violation of the UN Security Council&#x27;s resolution. The Danish deployment of troops was thus not formally based on a claim that Iraq had WMD&#x27;s.
In March 2003, Rasmussen stated as one of the reasons to support a military intervention, &quot;Irak har masseødelæggelsesvåben. Det er ikke noget vi tror. Vi ved det. Irak har selv indrømmet, at det har haft sennepsgas, nervegas, miltbrand, men Saddam vil ikke afregne. Han vil ikke fortælle os, hvor og hvordan de våben er blevet destrueret. Det ved vi fra FN&#x27;s inspektører, så der er ingen tvivl i mit sind.&quot; In English, this translates to:
 

=== Gay marriage ===
Civil unions between gay couples became legal in Denmark in 1989. In January 2004, Rasmussen stated his belief that homosexuals should be able to marry in religious ceremonies, which were not allowed at the time in the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Denmark, but he has said it should be up to religious communities to decide whether to perform ceremonies for gay couples.

=== 2005 election ===
On 18 January 2005 Rasmussen called an election for 8 February 2005. He delayed the call by a couple of weeks because of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake which killed several Danes. His government was criticized for its allegedly slow response to that crisis, although a clear majority applauded the government&#x27;s actions.

Although his party&#x27;s support was reduced from the 2001 election, costing it four seats, &quot;Venstre&quot; was able to maintain its coalition through gains by other parties, and on 18 February Rasmussen formed the Cabinet of Anders Fogh Rasmussen II.

Rasmussen received the most &quot;personal votes&quot; ever of any politician in the Folketing (Denmark&#x27;s Parliament) with 61,792.

=== Muhammad cartoons and Danish goods boycott ===

A major period of conflict in Rasmussen&#x27;s political career concerned a set of cartoons printed in &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;, a major Danish newspaper. In September 2005 the newspaper printed a full page with 12 cartoons depicting various interpretations of Muhammad. Due to the cartoons portraying Muhammad as a terrorist, some Muslims found the cartoons offensive. Rasmussen denied a request from 11 ambassadors of Middle-Eastern countries to discuss the issue. Rasmussen described the controversy as Denmark&#x27;s worst international crisis since World War II. Later he stated, that he &quot;was deeply distressed that the cartoons were seen by some Muslims as an attempt by Denmark to mark and insult or behave disrespectfully towards Islam or Mohammed.&quot;

=== Municipal reform ===

One of Rasmussen&#x27;s main initiatives was the introduction of municipal reform, the aim of which was the geographic and administrative consolidation of smaller municipalities and the abolition of counties. Major areas of public services, such as the national health service, were consolidated into five regional bodies, while the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98. The reform was ratified on 16 June 2005 and was effective as of 1 January 2007.

=== 2007 election and resignation ===
In October 2007, Rasmussen called the 2007 general election, which was held on 13 November. His official reason for doing so was to allow parliament to face important upcoming decisions without being distracted by a future election, with welfare reform being cited as an example. Initial polls had predicted that neither the incumbent alliance nor the left-wing opposition would win a majority, leaving the centrist New Alliance with the balance of power.
At 11:30 p.m. on the night of the election, Rasmussen claimed victory on the basis of almost-complete results. By the morning of 14 November 2007, after results came through from the Faroe Islands and Greenland, his centre-right coalition of the Liberals, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and the Danish People&#x27;s Party secured 90 seats, the minimum number required for a majority. Rasmussen went on to become the longest-ruling Liberal Prime Minister of Denmark.

Shortly after his second reelection in 2007, rumours began to spread in the Danish media that Rasmussen was a candidate for high-profile international jobs. A first rumour was that he was informally one of the top candidates for the new position of President of the European Council that could be created when the Lisbon Treaty would come into effect. Following the Irish rejection of the treaty in June 2008, it became obvious that this position would not be created in the near future. Rumors then spread around Rasmussen&#x27;s candidacy for Secretary General of NATO. Rasmussen denied the rumors until a few days before the official announcement of his selection was made.

Rasmussen expressed support for Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself during the Gaza–Israel conflict. He said that, &quot;it was Hamas that broke the truce, and Hamas started the conflict by firing rockets on Israel. No country can just passively accept being fired on.&quot;

After he was confirmed as the NATO Secretary General, Rasmussen announced that he would resign as Prime Minister of Denmark on 5 April 2009.

== NATO Secretary General ==

===2009===
Anders Fogh Rasmussen became the 12th NATO Secretary General on 1 August 2009, succeeding Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, who held the post from 2004 until 2009. The announcement was made on 4 April 2009, at the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit in Strasbourg. During the final selection process only one country, Turkey, remained opposed to Rasmussen&#x27;s candidacy, partly because of his handling of the cartoon episode in 2005, when the publication in some Danish newspapers of cartoons of Muhammad caused violent protests. Another major element of Turkey&#x27;s opposition was Denmark&#x27;s tolerance of Roj TV, which is claimed by the Turkish government to be a mouthpiece for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Eventually, Turkey withdrew its opposition to Rasmussen&#x27;s appointment in exchange of assurances Roj TV would be closed down.

After his accession on 1 August 2009, Rasmussen&#x27;s first mission was a visit to Afghanistan, where he met with President Karzai and senior Afghan ministers, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Spanta, Minister for Defence General Wardak, and Minister of Interior Atmar to discuss the then impending presidential and provincial council elections.
===2010===
On 28 January 2010 Rasmussen attended the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan at Lancaster House in London. It was at this event that the framework for the next decade of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was settled by the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and his successor Ashraf Ghani and their donors. As seen at right, Gordon Brown, Hillary Clinton, Catherine Ashton and Hermann van Rompuy amongst other Western leaders were in attendance.

===2011===
In April 2011, in relation to the 2011 Libyan civil war Rasmussen said that on the day NATO started taking command of the mission under the U.N. mandate, the alliance ruled out arming the rebels. Rasmussen said the coalition under his control was clear about its mission. &quot;We are not in Libya to arm people. We are in Libya to protect civilians against attacks&quot; from loyalists of the country&#x27;s Muammar Gaddafi government, he said at that time.
In October 2011, the intensive 7-month NATO intervention had &quot;now moved much closer&quot; to its end, according to Rasmussen. The last two major outposts of Gaddafi loyalists—Gaddafi&#x27;s hometown of Sirte and the town of Bani Walid—had fallen and the deposed leader had been killed as he tried to flee from Sirte toward Misrata. Gaddafi&#x27;s killing came with close NATO aerial support of Libyan ground forces.

===2012===
The Secretary General normally serves for a term of four years with a one-year extension option. On 3 October 2012, Fogh Rasmussens term was extended one year, so it ended on 31 July 2014.

===2013===
In February 2013 in the first visit of a NATO Secretary General to Ireland for a meeting with EU defence ministers, he said NATO had an &quot;open-door policy&quot; towards membership of the organisation. &quot;Our door remains open for European countries, European democracies that fulfil the necessary criteria and can contribute to Euro-Atlantic security, but of course it&#x27;s for individual partners to decide how they want to develop their relationship and partnership with NATO.&quot; Ireland is not a member of the organisation but ties through the Partnership for Peace Programme (PFP), a bilateral programme that allows for Irish forces to be used for peacekeeping and crisis management where there is a UN mandate and parliamentary approval.

On 19 December 2013 Rasmussen was invited to speak at a periodic meeting of the European Council by the Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, in opposition to plans proposed by the External Action Service of HRUFASC Catherine Ashton to create a European Air Force composed of surveillance drones, heavy transport airplanes, and air-to-air refuelling planes. This plan was supported by France, Spain, Italy, Poland and Germany who together have QMV majority. Rasmussen&#x27;s position was opposed to that of European Parliament President Martin Schulz, who made a presentation at the same meeting where he said that &quot;If we wish to defend our values and interests, if we wish to maintain the security of our citizens, then a majority of MEPs consider that we need a headquarters for civil and military missions in Brussels and deployable troops.&quot; Rasmussen was satisfied with the role of NATO in European defence matters and saw every reason to maintain the status quo.

===2014===
On 28 March 2014, Jens Stoltenberg was nominated as Rasmussen&#x27;s successor as secretary-general. He was to take office on 1 October 2014.

During the first week of April, the Foreign Ministers met at Brussels NATO HQ.

On 6 April, Rasmussen wrote an op-ed piece in London&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to warn allies to invest in their armed forces, and to maintain that &quot;Russia&#x27;s illegal aggression against Ukraine and its continued breach of international law&quot; were clear. Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Rasmussen for his &quot;active employment of double standards.&quot;

On 15 April, an EU Defence Ministers&#x27; meeting took place in Luxembourg with the Secretary-General. The next day, the Defence Ministers meeting of the North Atlantic Council was convened, one day in advance of the meeting in Geneva between Russia, Ukraine, the US and the EU over the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Rasmussen said: &quot;NATO&#x27;s core task is to protect and defend our Allies. We have already taken a series of steps, including enhancing our Air Policing mission in the Baltic States, and AWACS surveillance flights over Poland and Romania... We will have more planes in the air, more ships on the water, and more readiness on the land. For example, air policing aircraft will fly more sorties over the Baltic region. Allied ships will deploy to the Baltic Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere, as required. Military staff from Allied nations will deploy to enhance our preparedness, training and exercises. Our defence plans will be reviewed and reinforced.&quot;

In June 2014, Rasmussen claimed that Russia &quot;engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organisations – environmental organisations working against shale gas – to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas&quot;, without providing evidence for this claim.

== Organizations ==
=== Rasmussen Global ===
On 1 October 2014 as Rasmussen was succeeded by Jens Stoltenberg, the former Prime Minister of Norway, he declared the launch of the political consultancy Rasmussen Global to provide support on issues regarding security policy, Transatlantic relations, the European Union, Brexit and Economic development. Furthermore, in 2016 he published a book called &#x27;The Will to Lead&#x27;, giving his view that the USA should &#x27;restore America&#x27;s role as a global leader&#x27;

On 27 May 2016 Rasmussen became non-staff advisor to President Poroshenko of Ukraine. Rasmussen also convened the Friends of Ukraine group of sitting and former senior politicians and diplomats to raise international awareness of Ukraine and to keep domestic reform on the agenda.

On 2 April 2020 global bank Citi announced Rasmussen would join as a senior advisor in Citi&#x27;s European, Middle East and Africa business, with a primary focus on the Nordic region.

In June 2022, Anders Fogh Rasmussen was asked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to co-chair an international working group on security guarantees together with Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. The resulting Kyiv Security Compact became the foundation of a G7 joint declaration on security guarantees co-signed by NATO allies at the 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius. At the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, the individual agreements negotiated between Ukraine and NATO allies were formalized in the Ukraine Compact.

=== Alliance of Democracies Foundation ===
In 2017 Rasmussen founded the Alliance of Democracies Foundation a non-profit organisation dedicated to the advancement of democracy and free markets across the globe. Its initiatives include the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, an annual conference bringing together political and business leaders, including current and former heads of government, from the world&#x27;s democracies. The first summit in 2018 was addressed by Joe Biden and other speakers have included Tony Blair, Mike Pompeo and John Kerry.

The Foundation also hosts the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which &#x27;helps advance solutions to protect integrity of democratic elections.&#x27; The commission was founded by Rasmussen, Former US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Joe Biden.

<text>The Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, acronym AYP or AYPE, was a world&#x27;s fair held in Seattle in 1909 publicizing the development of the Pacific Northwest. It was originally planned for 1907 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, but the organizers learned of the Jamestown Exposition being held that same year and rescheduled.

The fairgrounds were hosted on an undeveloped portion of the present day campus of the University of Washington.

==Planning==


Godfrey Chealander proposed the idea for the fair. Chealander was then Grand Secretary of the Arctic Brotherhood, was involved in the Alaska Territory exhibit at the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Originally, he pitched William Sheffield of the Alaska Club and James A. Wood, city editor of the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; on the idea of a permanent exhibit in Seattle about Alaska. This merged with Wood&#x27;s desire for an exposition to rival Portland. They soon gained the backing of &quot;Times&quot; publisher Alden J. Blethen—remarkably, for the time, without gaining the opposition of the rival &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. Among other early proponents of the exposition was John Edward Chilberg, one of a line of prominent Seattle merchants in the Chilberg family, who was president of the Alaska Club, and was then given the title of president of the Exposition.

Edmond S. Meany proposed that the exposition be held on the then largely forested campus of the University of Washington, which in 1905 had exactly three buildings and little deliberate landscaping. At the time, this was considered rather far from the center of town, but Meany eventually sold the others involved on the idea that the forested campus could, itself, be an attraction for out-of-town visitors and that the trolley ride from downtown would not be an obstacle to attendance. Of course, he was also highly aware of what the landscaping and structures could do for the campus.

The state legislature endorsed the fair, with the proviso that it would produce at least four permanent buildings, and that any state monetary contribution would be focused mainly on those buildings. King County (the county in which Seattle is located) stepped up with US$300,000 for a forestry exhibit—the largest log cabin ever built—and $78,000 for other exhibits. Because the original Klondike gold strikes had been in Canada, the concept soon evolved to an &quot;Alaska-Yukon Exposition&quot;; later, at the behest of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, the &quot;Pacific&quot; theme was also added to emphasize the Oriental trade. The Exposition became known as the &quot;A-Y-P&quot; for short

Although the fair almost certainly could have been ready for 1907, it was postponed so as not to conflict with the Jamestown Exposition. This turned out to be good fortune for Seattle, because 1907 proved to be a bad year for the economy. If the exposition had been held that year it almost certainly would have been a financial failure, rather than the success it was in 1909.

==Design and construction==

The Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts, were selected to plan the Exposition; the firm was already involved in planning parks and parkways for the City of Seattle. John C. Olmsted visited Seattle in October 1906 and saw the dominant form of Mount Rainier toward the southeast. He selected the mountain as the focus of the primary axis of the Exposition. This axis later became the Rainier Vista of the University of Washington campus.

The principal landscape architect for the fair was the Olmsted firm&#x27;s James Frederick Dawson. His design centered on a long pool with a series of short waterfalls along Rainier Vista. John Galen Howard&#x27;s firm, Howard and Galloway, based in San Francisco, was chosen as supervising architects for the Exposition buildings. They designed several buildings and supervised construction of those designed by other architects.

The fairgrounds were entirely ready for the June 1, 1909 opening.

==Exhibits==
The only foreign countries to erect entire buildings at the fair were Japan and Canada, but their presence was enough to validate the &quot;Pacific&quot; theme along with the US territory of Hawaii and the Philippines, recently ceded to the US by Spain. Other foreign countries were represented on a smaller scale. The very popular King County exhibit included a scale model of the coal mine at nearby Newcastle, Washington and dioramas of several Seattle scenes, the originals of which were only a trolley ride away. The Woman&#x27;s Building emphasized the role of women in pioneering the American West and in current charity work. The Pay Streak was Seattle&#x27;s answer to Chicago&#x27;s Midway and featured games of chance and amusements. There was also a reenactment of the American Civil War naval Battle of Hampton Roads (the Battle of &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Merrimack&quot;).
==Opening ceremony==

The gates opened at 8:30 a.m. on June 1, and crowds entered immediately. At 9:30 a.m., attendees watched performances by military bands from the Army and the Navy. Many sat in the fair&#x27;s amphitheater, awaiting a signal scheduled to be given in Washington, D.C. At 3 p.m. East Coast time (noon in Seattle), in the East Room of the White House, President Taft sent the signal. He &quot;opened...the Exposition...by touching a gold [telegraph] key, studded with gold nuggets taken from the first mine opened in the Klondike region.&quot; The telegraphic spark that Taft sent was received by telegraphers at the fairgrounds; as soon as it arrived, a gong was struck five times, a large American flag was unfurled, and there was a 21-gun salute, while other demonstrations of pageantry announced the official opening of the fair.

==Attendance==
Opening Day, June 1, was declared a city holiday, and 80,000 people attended. Attendance was even higher—117,013—on &quot;Seattle Day&quot;. Other big draws were days dedicated to various ethnic groups, fraternal organizations, and U.S. states. By the time the fair closed on October 16, more than 3,700,000 people had visited.

==Publicity==
The fair had its own publicity department, and it used newspapers and magazines to promote the upcoming exhibition well in advance. In early 1908, Seattle newspapers reported that the publicity department was already showing positive results and the fair was earning many favorable mentions in publications all over the United States. The publicists stressed that this exhibition would be far better organized than 1907&#x27;s Jamestown Exposition, and would feature entertainment. But what many newspapers found interesting was the assertion that this next World&#x27;s Fair would not require any financial assistance or subsidies from the U.S. government; the only request made by the fair&#x27;s directors was that the United States erect buildings and exhibits like any other country.

Throughout 1908, as each new exhibit was built and the fair gradually began to take shape, publicity about the fair&#x27;s progress was sent out, and frequently printed, nearly verbatim, from the press releases. For example, the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; in Tampa, Florida, printed a story about how the fair would have motor boat races: the article noted that the pavilion for the event was being built on &quot;one of the prettiest spots on the exposition&#x27;s shoreline.&quot; The article praised Puget Sound for being an area perfect for motor boating enthusiasts, and concluded by saying, &quot;The climate is such that motor boating can be enjoyed all the year round.&quot;

By early 1909, the focus turned to who was going to attend, as many local newspapers in distant locations wrote articles about residents of their state who planned to make the trip out to Seattle. Also helpful was the fact that several major newspaper conventions were scheduled for the west coast, and the editors were said to be very interested in visiting the fair. The fair&#x27;s organizers were also able to benefit from advertisements placed in newspapers by the railroads, which encouraged people to travel by rail to Seattle. One such ad, for the Great Northern Railway, promoted the train as the best way to enjoy a scenic trip: &quot;an attractive route over the Rockies and through the Cascades&quot; before finally arriving at what was sure to be &quot;the World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Fair.&quot;

==Legacies==

The primary physical legacy of the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition is the planning framework from the fair which continues to shape the University of Washington campus. The Rainier Vista and Geyser Basin, presently known as Drumheller Fountain, were central features of the exposition and now serve as the focal point of the Science Quadrangle within the university&#x27;s comprehensive plan.

Although most of the Exposition&#x27;s buildings were designed as temporary structures, intended to last only for the duration of the fair, some were more permanent. The Fine Arts Palace was designed by Howard and Galloway as a chemistry building. It was used during the A-Y-P for the exhibit of art. After the Exposition was over, chemistry lab tables and other furnishings were moved in and it became the University&#x27;s primary facility for teaching chemistry. The building was named Bagley Hall (after Daniel Bagley) and retained that name until 1937, when a new chemistry building named Bagley Hall opened. The older building then became the home of Architecture and Physiology. The building survives today, albeit with extensive renovation and restoration, and is known as Architecture Hall.

The A-Y-P Women&#x27;s Building also survives. During the fair it housed exhibits related to women. Today the building is named Cunningham Hall (after Imogen Cunningham), one of only a few buildings on the University of Washington campus named for women. During the Exposition itself the building was clad in stucco; today it is faced in wood siding. The building now houses various educational and other programs related to women.
Other buildings from the A-Y-P survived for a time, but were subsequently demolished as the university grew. The Forestry Building was demolished mid-century after the natural logs of the structure proved difficult to maintain and few alternative uses for the structure were found. It stood on the site of the current Husky Union Building (HUB). The original Meany Hall, the AYP Auditorium Hall, was damaged by an earthquake in 1965 and subsequently demolished. Another example is the Hoo-Hoo-House, designed by architect Ellsworth Storey, a clubhouse with reception spaces constructed for the Hoo-Hoos, a lumbermen&#x27;s fraternity. After the fair, this building served as the faculty club until it was replaced in 1958–60 by the current faculty club.

Another legacy of the fair was the enhanced status of exposition president J. E. Chilberg. Although a respected banker, Chilberg had never really been one of the city&#x27;s elite. He was drafted into his position with the fair simply as a man who was known to be good at getting things done, but without consideration by the city&#x27;s elite that they had just made an outsider into something tantamount to royalty for the duration of a social season. Suddenly, any party at their First Hill home became a major event in the social calendar. He and his wife found themselves dining with a close relative of the emperor of Japan and hosting a French ambassador.

The statue of William H. Seward, originally erected for the fair, now stands in Volunteer Park.

William Boeing, founder of Boeing, stated that it was during the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition when he saw a manned flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft.

==Controversy==
===Labor objections===
Because the Exposition buildings were built with non-union labor, various unions protested against the exposition in actions ranging from pamphleteering to boycotts. The Central Labor Council organized a protest march outside the grounds on Labor Day. The &quot;Seattle Socialist&quot; editorialized that the Exposition was, &quot;a great fantastic monument to the brutal avarice of the capitalist class.&quot;

===Human exhibits===

A month-old orphaned boy named Ernest was raffled away as a prize. Although a winning ticket was drawn, nobody claimed the prize. The ultimate destiny of the child was still being investigated in 2009.

Other human exhibits included displays presenting Igorot people from the Philippines as dog-eating, primitive people; the &quot;Alaskan Siberians — Eskimos&quot;; and a Chinese village depicting opium dens and recounting the recent Boxer Rebellion. The Igorot exhibit spawned a letter of protest to the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; signed by over 100 Filipino merchant marines, although some local resident Filipinos responded to the letter by defending the exhibit.

Premature babies were also displayed in French physician Alexandre Lion&#x27;s incubators, decades before such systems were commonplace in hospitals. This display was not unique to the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition; babies had been displayed in incubators since the 1896 Berlin Exposition (and Seattle itself had seen at least two such exhibits before the A-Y-P Exposition). Given the robustness of the infants seen in photographs, there is some question as to whether these infants actually required extra care or if they were simply used for profit. Particular to this exhibit was a Baby Incubator Cafe which is seen in some photos, although historians are unsure if this was an actual cafe or rather a place to view babies feeding. At the time there was little in the way of protest from either fair-goers or physicians. In fact there was already a seasonal incubator exhibit at Luna Park in West Seattle, the Infant Electrobator concession. The babies were mentioned by name in the newspaper during their stay at the exposition and their medical state followed throughout. A specific point of interest was the range in ethnicity of the infants. No deaths were experienced amongst the babies at the exhibit.
==Anniversary==
The year 2009 was the centennial of the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition. The City and University held various activities to celebrate this anniversary.

A documentary was produced by John Forsen called &quot;AYP-Seattle&#x27;s Forgotten World&#x27;s Fair&quot; for PBS.

On July 4, 2009, a group of 12 cyclists set off from Santa Rosa, California, on a 1,000 mile bike ride to Seattle, Washington, to support the disease Histiocytosis. The ride, titled Wheels North, was a centennial of the 1909 adventure of Vic McDaniel and Ray Francisco who traveled on bicycles to the Exposition. The ride ended at the Drumheller Fountain on the campus of the University of Washington on July 16, 2009.

<doc id="275833" wikidata="Q21020" url="?curid=275833" title="Buxales">
<text>The Buxales are a small order of eudicot flowering plants, recognized by the APG IV system of 2016. The order includes the family Buxaceae; the families Didymelaceae and Haptanthaceae may also be recognized or may be included in the Buxaceae. Many members of the order are evergreen shrubs or trees, although some are herbaceous perennials. They have separate &quot;male&quot; (staminate) and &quot;female&quot; (carpellate) flowers, mostly on the same plant (i.e. they are mostly monoecious). Some species are of economic importance either for the wood they produce or as ornamental plants.

==Description==

The Buxales have relatively few obvious shared features distinguishing them from related groups of plants (i.e. few obvious synapomorphies). One is the presence of a particular type of alkaloid or pseudoalkaloid, pregnane steroids. They have unisexual flowers (i.e. separate staminate or &quot;male&quot; flowers and carpellate or &quot;female&quot; flowers), most being monoecious. The flowers are small, less than 7 mm across. The tepals have a single vascular bundle (trace). Other characters common to the order include leaves with entire (untoothed) margins, flowers arranged in racemes, small styles capable of receiving pollen along their entire length rather than having a separate stigma, one to two ovules per carpel, and seeds with testae (coats) made up of several cell layers.

&quot;Didymeles&quot;, the sole genus in the family Didymelaceae, consists of two species of evergreen tree occurring only in Madagascar. It is dioecious, i.e. with staminate and carpellate flowers on separate plants. Buxaceae (including Haptanthaceae) is more diverse, with five or six genera totalling about 115 species, and is found in most temperate and tropical areas of the world. Most species are evergreen shrubs or small trees, but some (such as those of &quot;Pachysandra&quot;) are herbaceous perennials.

==Taxonomy==

In the APG III system of 2009, the order includes two families, Buxaceae and Haptanthaceae. Unlike previous classifications (including the APG II system of 2003), APG III does not recognize the family Didymelaceae, but includes the genus &quot;Didymeles&quot; in Buxaceae. Subsequent research published in 2011 suggests that the Haptanthaceae are embedded in the Buxaceae, possibly as the sister to &quot;Buxus&quot;, and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website no longer recognizes Haptanthaceae. In the 2016 APG IV system, Haptanthaceae is incorporated into Buxaceae, which leaves Buxaceae the only family under &quot;Buxales&quot;.

===Phylogeny===

The Buxales are placed within the eudicots but outside the core eudicots, in a paraphyletic group of basal eudicots. The monophyly of the order and its general position relative to other eudicots has been confirmed by many studies. One possible phylogenetic tree is shown below, where the precise ordering of the basal eudicots is still uncertain.

One difference between the basal eudicots and the core eudicots is that the latter appear to have undergone a complete duplication of the nuclear genome which is absent in the former. Molecular phylogenetic studies have produced slightly different internal arrangements of the families and genera within the order; hence the variation in the number of families into which it is divided.

===Genera===

Didymelaceae or Buxaceae
* &quot;Didymeles&quot; 
Buxaceae
* &quot;Buxus&quot; (including &quot;Notobuxus&quot; )
* &quot;Pachysandra&quot; 
* &quot;Sarcococca&quot; 
* &quot;Styloceras&quot; 
Buxaceae or Haptanthaceae
* &quot;Haptanthus&quot; 

===Former treatment===

In the Cronquist system of 1981, the Buxaceae were associated with the Euphorbiaceae s.l., and the Didymelaceae were given their own order. In the APG II system of 2003, the Buxaceae were a family unplaced as to order in the eudicots, optionally including the genus &quot;Didymeles&quot;, which could alternatively be placed in its own family.

===Age===

According to molecular clock calculations, the lineage that led to Buxales split from other plants about 129 million years ago or 120 million years ago.

==Uses==

Some species of the Buxaceae are of economic importance. &quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot; (common box) and &quot;Buxus macowanii&quot; (Cape box) produce hard wood valued for carving and engraving. Species are also used as ornamental garden plants and for bonsai. Common box is used for hedging and border edging. Species of &quot;Pachysandra&quot; are used as ground cover. Species of &quot;Sarcococca&quot; produce small but strongly scented flowers in the winter.

<doc id="275856" wikidata="Q579987" url="?curid=275856" title="Fantasy football (gridiron)">
<text>Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as owners and general managers of virtual gridiron football teams. The competitors select their rosters by participating in a draft in which all relevant National Football League (NFL) players are available. Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances of football players in real-world competition. The game typically involves the NFL, but can also involve other leagues, such as the Canadian Football League or NCAA.

There are three main types of fantasy football:
* Traditional (redraft) – Leagues in which the competition can run for an entire season, normally culminating in playoffs. Participants engage in a draft once yearly and emerge with completely new teams.
* Keeper or dynasty leagues – These leagues are initially drafted in the same fashion as a traditional season-long league, however, each team in a keeper league is able to retain a certain number of players from one year to the next, and in a dynasty league, each team retains all players who have not retired. All subsequent drafts solely involve rookie players who are joining the NFL for the first time.
* Daily – Daily fantasy sports are accelerated versions of the traditional fantasy format in which contests are conducted over shorter periods, such as a week or a single day. Online daily fantasy football is typically managed by companies running widespread betting pools that can involve thousands of players. In the United States, the two largest daily fantasy firms are DraftKings and FanDuel.

Fantasy football is often played in small groups of mutually familiar individuals who may or may not be playing for money. However, online fantasy contests, particularly those run by daily fantasy companies, regularly involve large groups of people who otherwise do not know each other contributing to a shared betting pool. The structure of these games has led some jurisdictions to characterize and regulate online fantasy contents as a form of gambling.

==History==
Modern fantasy football can be traced back to Wilfred &quot;Bill&quot; Winkenbach, an Oakland, California businessman and limited partner in the Oakland Raiders. In a New York City hotel room during a 1962 Raiders cross-country trip, Winkenbach, along with Raiders public relations employee Bill Tunnel and &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; reporter Scotty Stirling, developed the rules that would eventually be the basis of modern fantasy football.

The inaugural league was called the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League (GOPPPL), and its first draft took place in Winkenbach&#x27;s home in Oakland in August 1963. The league consisted of eight members, made up of administrative affiliates of the American Football League, pro football journalists, and individuals who had purchased or sold 10 season tickets for the Raiders&#x27; 1963 season. Each roster consisted of two quarterbacks, four halfbacks, two fullbacks, four wide receivers or tight ends, two return specialists, two kickers, two defensive backs or linebackers, and two defensive linemen. The scoring system was entirely dependent on real-life scoring. It awarded 25 points for a touchdown pass, rush, or reception, 25 for a field goal, 10 for an extra point, and 200 for a kickoff, punt, or interception that was returned for a touchdown. As of 2015, the GOPPPL was still active and had maintained the original scoring system.

In 1969, Andy Mousalimas, an original creator of GOPPPL and participant in the inaugural draft, brought the game to his Oakland sports bar, the King&#x27;s X, where the first public fantasy football league was founded. From this point onward, the idea spread by word of mouth when the patrons of other Bay Area bars visited the King&#x27;s X for trivia contests.

Fantasy football slowly spread across the country in the following decades. Early leagues whose existence has been documented were typically founded by groups of friends attending school together. Examples include leagues founded at DePaul University of Chicago, Illinois in 1978, Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland, Ohio in 1980, and Marist School of Atlanta, Georgia in 1983. Each of these leagues maintained continuous operation for several decades after their founding.

In 1985, the Grandstand Sports Services launched the first nationally available fantasy football leagues online through Q-Link (later America Online). In 1987, &quot;Fantasy Football Index&quot;, the first national magazine dedicated to fantasy football, was launched by Ian Allan and Bruce Taylor.

A national fantasy football game, Pigskin Playoff, was launched in 1990 in a number of newspapers throughout the United States, including the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. Players chose their teams by calling a toll-free phone number and entering four-digit codes for each of their selections. Pigskin Playoff served as an early version of today&#x27;s daily fantasy football by rewarding each week&#x27;s highest-scoring participant with a trip to Hawaii.

In 1997, CBS launched an online fantasy football competition, with other sports networks and websites quickly following suit. Yahoo was the first site to launch a free competition, giving it an advantage over its industry competitors. The NFL launched its own official game on the league&#x27;s website in 2010. Online growth has fueled both the fantasy football industry and interest in the NFL itself. As of 2022, an estimated 62.5 million people played fantasy sports in the United States and Canada, per the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, and around four out of five fantasy participants played fantasy football.

On May 27, 2022, Cincinnati Reds player Tommy Pham slapped Joc Pederson of the San Francisco Giants in the face prior to a game; he would later receive a three-game suspension and a $5,000 fine. Pham said that the slap was prompted by his belief that Pederson had broken the rules of a fantasy football league in which they had both participated during the previous football season. Pham said that he did not regret the slap, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of principle, man.&quot;

==League types==
A fantasy football league may be organized in a variety of ways. The most popular league type is head-to-head, in which each team is matched up against an opponent each week, with the team that scores the most fantasy points earning a win in the standings. A less common form of league is a total points league, in which the league standings are determined by the number of points each team scores over an entire season. In addition to scoring variations, league organization may also differ based on the structure of each team&#x27;s roster.

=== Competition variations ===
* In head-to-head leagues, a fantasy team matches up against a different fantasy team from the league each week. The team that receives the most points of the two receives a win for that week, while the other team receives a loss. Points are dictated by a common scoring system that can be adjusted in a variety of ways &quot;(see Scoring configurations)&quot;. A team&#x27;s total is the sum of all points accumulated by players who were placed in a starting slot by the team owner for the day they were playing (as opposed to being on the bench, in which any points gained would not count). Teams with the best win–loss record may advance to the playoffs in the final weeks of the season. If two teams have the same record, playoff qualification tiebreakers are employed based on league preference.
* Total points leagues are leagues in which teams accumulate points on an ongoing basis. The league standings are determined by the teams&#x27; total points. Total points leagues are often also best ball leagues, in which owners do not need to set a starting lineup, as their weekly point totals automatically reflect their highest-scoring players at each position. Other forms of roster management, such as player trades and the waiver wire, are traditionally eliminated in best ball leagues. This is often the structure on platforms such as DraftKings and Underdog.
* All-play leagues are leagues in which all teams play each other each week. For example, if there are 14 teams in the league, the highest-scoring team in each week would post a 13–0 record, the next highest-scoring team would post a 12–1 record, and so on.
* Pirate leagues are leagues in which a winning owner gets to choose a player from his or her opponent&#x27;s roster.
* In guillotine leagues, the lowest scoring team is eliminated from the league each week. All of the players on the eliminated team&#x27;s roster become free agents and may be subsequently added to any remaining team. This process continues until only one team remains and is crowned the league winner.

=== Roster variations ===
* Keeper leagues allow teams to keep a set number of players on their roster from one year to the next and sometimes assign them contracts for a certain number of years. In the first season of a keeper league, the draft is performed the same as any other standard league draft would be performed. At the end of each season, each roster is cut down to a predetermined limit. Teams in keeper leagues can retain as few as one player or as many as every player on the roster except one, though generally the number of retained players is five or fewer.
* In dynasty leagues, a team keeps all players from one year to the next and replenishes rosters through rookie drafts. Unlike keeper leagues, each team&#x27;s roster limit is unchanged during the offseason, though it may increase temporarily to allow the addition of rookies.
* Developmental or devy leagues are dynasty leagues in which owners are allowed to draft college players in addition to the standard pool of NFL players.
* Campus 2 Canton (c2c) leagues are a form of devy league in which each owner controls two teams. One team is composed of college players (Campus) and the other NFL players (Canton). The teams score points independently of each other, which creates two separate leagues running simultaneously. Once the college players graduate, they are eligible to be used on the Canton team.
* Salary cap leagues implement a salary cap, which also exists in the NFL. Each player has an associated salary, and the combined salary of each roster may not exceed the predetermined cap.
* Superflex leagues are leagues in which teams can start a quarterback in the flex position, which is normally limited to running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. The superflex slot may exist on its own or in addition to a traditional flex position.
* In two-quarterback leagues, each team has the ability to start two quarterbacks in their weekly lineup, rather than one, thus creating a premium on value at the quarterback position. Along with superflex, both of these roster variations are particularly popular in dynasty leagues.
* Individual Defensive Player (IDP) leagues are leagues in which teams draft defensive players as individuals, rather than as an entire unit. In rare cases, it is also possible to draft individual players at other positions that are not typically included on fantasy rosters, such as offensive linemen, punters, and return specialists.
* In empire leagues, teams compete in a dynasty format, with each year&#x27;s winner receiving a portion of that year&#x27;s entrance fees. The rest of the fees go into a special pot known as the empire pot. Once an owner wins the league in two consecutive seasons, he or she wins the empire pot.

==Draft==
Before each season, fantasy football leagues hold a draft in which each team drafts NFL players or, in the case of dynasty leagues, NFL rookies. These players are kept on the roster of the team that drafted them unless they are traded for other players or dropped, whereby they enter a pool of unowned players that any team may claim. The order of draft picks may be determined randomly or by the league standings from the previous year, in which the team with the worst record picks first, followed by the team with the second-worst record, etc. In some cases, owners retain the same draft position in each round. In contrast, in a traditional &quot;serpentine&quot; or &quot;snake&quot; draft, owners draft players in a &quot;snake&quot; method, in which the owner who picks first in the odd rounds picks last in the even rounds, the owner who picks second in the odd rounds picks second to last in the even rounds, etc. in the interest of fairness.
In an auction draft, each owner has a budget which he or she must use to purchase all of his or her players in an auction format. Owners take turns nominating players for open bid, and the owner who bids the highest on each player receives that player, reducing his or her remaining budget accordingly. One proposed advantage of auction drafts is their ability to offer every owner equal access to every player, whereas in a traditional format, a certain owner&#x27;s desired player may be selected by another team before his or her turn to pick.

Drafts can be conducted in &quot;live&quot; or &quot;auto&quot; formats. Live drafts involve team owners selecting players in real time, while auto drafts are those in which selections are made automatically by computer based on pre-draft rankings set by each owner. Often, owners who are not present at the chosen time of the draft will &quot;auto-draft&quot; while the rest of the league makes their selections live.

Whether live or auto, the vast majority of fantasy football drafts take place online, but some leagues hold in-person drafts in which selections are made on computers or physical draft boards.

A variety of strategies may be employed by owners when making their selections. Fantasy football websites routinely release projections for the number of points each player will score during an upcoming season. The concept of value-based drafting entails comparing the projected fantasy point value for a given player and comparing this value to those of other players at his position. A player with a high value and a low average draft position (ADP) is likely to be undervalued by fantasy owners; the concept of value-based drafting is designed to find such players. Some positions are considered more valuable than others, with running backs, wide receivers, and quarterbacks often selected in early rounds and team defenses and kickers almost always selected in late rounds. The type of league may also influence draft strategy. In leagues with points per reception (PPR) scoring, running backs who often catch passes are considered more valuable than they would be in a league with standard scoring.

== Team rosters ==
Each team is allowed a set number of players on each roster, as well as a specified number of starters at each position that can be used in a matchup. Each week, owners determine which players will start and which will be &quot;benched.&quot; Just like in real football, players who are usually benched can become starters for various reasons: due to a starting player&#x27;s injury, poor performance, or if the starter&#x27;s NFL team has a bye that week. Whether to sit or start a player is also based on strategic considerations, such as the player&#x27;s past and expected performance, defensive matchups, and the team he is playing that week.

=== Starters ===
Each team owner must designate which players from the overall roster will be starters each week. Only players in the starting lineup may earn fantasy points. The following is a standard starting lineup configuration and is used as the default setting on NFL.com, ESPN, and Yahoo except where noted:

* 1 Quarterback (QB)
* 2 Running backs (RB)
* 2 Wide receivers (WR)
* 1 Tight end (TE)
* 1 Flex (RB, WR, or TE)
* 1 Placekicker (K)
* 1 Team defense/special teams unit (D/ST)
* 6 Bench players (BN)

There exist numerous possible variants of the traditional roster alignment. The number of starter, bench, and injured reserve slots can be altered. Sleeper, a recent upstart fantasy football platform, defaults to two flex spots. The eligible positions for the flex slot are variable. For example, in leagues with a superflex position, any offensive player, including quarterbacks, may fill the slot. Other leagues have a two-quarterback requirement for each starting lineup. In individual defensive player (IDP) leagues, the defensive portion of rosters is composed of individual players from various teams rather than an entire NFL team&#x27;s defensive and special teams unit.

=== Scoring configurations ===
League managers earn fantasy points based on the performance of their starting players&#x27; performances in NFL games. Players accumulate points based purely on their statistical output. This means that, for example, each real-life yard gained or touchdown scored correlates to a certain number of fantasy points. On the other hand, yards lost and turnovers result in negative fantasy points as well.

While rare, it is possible for players to earn points for plays not traditionally associated with their position. For example, a wide receiver who completes a pass would earn the same number of points as a quarterback completing the same pass.

==== Standard and PPR scoring ====
A key distinction in scoring systems is between standard and points per reception (PPR) scoring. Leagues with standard scoring award no points for receptions, though players still earn points for receiving yards gained. PPR leagues award one point for each reception, while half-PPR leagues award half a point. PPR leagues are higher-scoring and place a greater emphasis on wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs who catch a large number of passes, while half-PPR leagues attempt to provide more balance between rushing and receiving. The majority of leagues employ either PPR or half-PPR scoring. Many major fantasy football websites use PPR as their default setting, including ESPN and NFL.com.

The following is the default scoring system on NFL.com and is identical to the default scoring systems of ESPN and Yahoo except where noted. Negative points are awarded for yards lost at the same rate that positive points are awarded for yards gained.

* 1 point for every 25 passing yards
* 1 point for every 10 rushing or receiving yards
* 1 point for each reception
* 4 points for each passing touchdown
* 6 points for each rushing or receiving touchdown
* 6 points for each fumble recovered for a touchdown by the offense
* 2 points for each passing, rushing, or receiving two-point conversion
* -2 points for each interception thrown or fumble lost
* 1 point for each extra point made
* 3 points for each 0-49 yard field goal
* 5 points for each 50+ yard field goal
* 1 point for each sack by the defense
* 2 points for each interception or fumble recovered by the defense
* 2 points for each safety by the defense
* 6 points for each touchdown scored by the defense
* 6 points for each touchdown scored by a player returning a kickoff or punt

A team defense can also gain or lose fantasy points based on the number of real-life points that they allow. The following is the default defensive scoring system on NFL.com and Yahoo.

* 10 points for a shutout
* 7 points for allowing 1-6 points
* 4 points for allowing 7-13 points
* 1 point for allowing 14-20 points
* 0 points for allowing 21-27 points
* -1 point for allowing 28-34 points
* -4 points for allowing 35+ points

==== Pure-scoring and pure-yardage leagues ====

A pure-scoring system awards fantasy points based solely on touchdowns, field goals, and extra points scored by a team&#x27;s players. Many of the original fantasy football leagues were pure-scoring leagues as this provided for easier tracking of team points throughout the season. As the game matured and moved online, tracking yardage became easier and more sophisticated scoring configurations were adopted. In pure-yardage leagues, points may only be scored by accumulating passing, rushing, or receiving yards.

==== Individual defensive player (IDP) ====
An alternative method for scoring defense is individual defensive player (IDP) scoring. Rather than awarding points for the on-field actions of entire defensive units, IDP scoring awards points for plays made by individual players. Such plays may include tackles, sacks, interceptions, quarterback hits, safeties, and other defensive statistics.

==== Additional customization ====
Most fantasy websites allow leagues to customize their own scoring options. Some leagues award bonus points to players for exceptional performances. For example, NFL.com allows leagues to customize scoring to award bonus points for a player who passes for over 300 yards in a game or scores a touchdown of over 40 yards, among others. NFL.com also allows players to earn points in statistical categories that are not traditionally a part of fantasy scoring, such as pass attempts or yards gained on kickoff and punt returns. In addition to earning or losing fantasy points based on real-life points allowed, team defenses may also earn or lose points based on real-life yards allowed. ESPN even allows custom scoring for punting yards, touchbacks, and punting average. Sleeper offers similar customization options, but also allows the commissioner to adjust the number points awarded from a reception based on position.

==Demographics==
According to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association (FSGA), an estimated 62.5 million people played fantasy sports in the US and Canada in 2022. The FSGA estimated that 19% of American adults played fantasy sports in 2023, compared to 13% in 2014. A 2023 FSGA survey found that 64% of fantasy sports players were male, 48% were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 84% had a college degree or higher. A 2015 analysis found that 89.8% were white and 51.5% were unmarried.

==Effect on American economy==
Many fantasy leagues require an entry fee that is given to or used to fund prizes for the top player or players in the league. Daily fantasy platforms, such as FanDuel, manage games with thousands of players and collect a percentage of each entry fee before distributing winnings. For example, FanDuel&#x27;s revenue includes 10% of its entry fee intake.

Fantasy football players also contribute to the economy via spending on industry products and services, such as advanced scouting reports and player rankings. In 2012, an estimated $1.67 billion was spent on fantasy sports in the United States and Canada, not including league entry fees. In 2019, the size of the American and Canadian fantasy sports industry was estimated at more than $7 billion by the FSGA.

===Ad revenue===
Advertising is one of the largest sources of fantasy football revenue. Many sports websites that offer free entry into leagues use advertising to support their fantasy offerings. Though difficult to quantify, revenue generated by ads on fantasy football programming is estimated at $2 to $5 billion annually. This form of revenue can be especially lucrative because fantasy team managers are often frequent Internet users. In 2012, on average, fantasy players generated four times more page views and spent six times as long on NFL.com, compared to non-fantasy players.

===Complementary and derivative industries===
Fantasy football has given rise to a number of complementary and derivative industries. Subscription-based information sites, such as Rotoworld, offer advanced data and player rankings marketed as providing an informational advantage. Fantasy-specific escrow companies, such as LeagueSafe, may hold league entry fees in secure accounts until the end of the season. Other websites offer the ability to have disputes between players solved by a third party via fantasy football arbitration.

The rise of fantasy football has contributed to a rise in interest in applying high-level mathematics and computer science to the fantasy industry. A small number of fantasy players, usually with advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, or computer science, apply algorithms and advanced statistics in order to hypothesize the best possible lineup for a given week or season. These advanced players are often far more successful than casual fans; a 2015 study found that 91% of daily fantasy baseball profits over the first half of the season were won by the top 1.3% of players.

===Popular culture===
Fantasy football has occasionally featured as a theme or plot point in popular media. The FX show &quot;The League&quot;, once described as a prime example of &quot;fantasy football hooliganism,&quot; depicts six friends competing in a fantasy football league. The show ran for seven seasons from 2009 to 2015 and featured frequent cameos from then-current and former NFL players.

In 2019, &quot;For The Win&quot; profiled a pair of exclusive and highly competitive celebrity leagues, Bloodsport and the AGBO Superhero League. Both leagues were created by figures associated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and counted numerous actors, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, and Tom Holland, as members. In the AGBO league, each participant played for a share of $100,000 to be donated to the charitable organization of their choice.

===Gambling===
Fantasy sports are generally considered to be a form of gambling, though they are far less strictly regulated than other forms of sports betting. In the United States, Montana is the only state with a prohibition against online fantasy sports that is codified in statute. Louisiana and Arizona, states with bans previously not explicitly outlined by law, launched online fantasy offerings in their states in 2021. In contrast, as of May 2023, only 33 US states have operational legalized sports betting. Unlike traditional sports betting, fantasy football is generally viewed as a &quot;game of skill,&quot; rather than a &quot;game of chance,&quot; thus exempting it from gambling bans and regulations in many jurisdictions.

As of May 2023, daily fantasy sports operate in 45 US states, as well as in several other countries around the world.

According to a 2023 survey by the FSGA, 23% of American adults participate in sports betting, while 19% of American adults participate in fantasy sports.

===Effect on spectatorship===
Fantasy football affects viewership for the NFL, as fantasy owners have rooting interests that go beyond those of traditional fans. While most individuals will follow a specific team, fantasy players follow the entire league due to the nature of the game, in which players on their roster may play for any team in the NFL. Despite leading to some conflict of interests between rooting interests and fantasy success, fantasy football has been shown to have a positive impact on NFL spectatorship.

NFL executives have recognized the importance of fantasy football&#x27;s success to the league. A 2019 survey found that people who had played fantasy football were more than twice as likely to follow the NFL &quot;very closely&quot; or &quot;somewhat closely&quot; compared to those who had not. Nearly a quarter of fantasy players reported that the primary reason that they watched NFL games was to keep up with their fantasy teams. Fantasy participants are also reported to attend 0.22 to 0.57 more NFL games in person per season than non-fantasy players. The NFL entered into a reported five-year, $600 million deal with Sprint in 2006 that was driven at least in part by fantasy sports, allowing subscribers to draft and monitor their teams using their cellphones. In 2011, the NFL directed teams to show fantasy statistics during games on stadium video boards.

NFL players have displayed mixed reactions on the impact of fantasy football on fans&#x27; habits and preferences. In 2006, then-Denver Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer told ESPN, &quot;I think it&#x27;s ruined the game&quot; due to fan allegiance shifting away from teams and towards individual player performance. Then-New York Giants running back Tiki Barber said that &quot;in a game solely designed around the team concept, it&#x27;s nice to have some individual recognition every now and then. Fantasy football does that.&quot; Fans frequently ask players on their fantasy rosters to score more often; Peyton Manning reported that only autograph requests exceeded fan requests for &quot;more fantasy touchdowns&quot; from him. Several NFL players have stated that they play fantasy football as well.

A key component of fantasy football team management is tracking player injuries throughout the season. Critics charge that this leads to fantasy players being more concerned with the amount of game time missed by an injured player than the nature or extent of the injury. David Chao said that when he was team doctor for the San Diego Chargers, &quot;The first 10 to 12 years, I would be asked &#x27;Is LT (LaDainian Tomlinson) healthy?&#x27; to help our team win this Sunday. The last five years there, the question would be &#x27;Is (Antonio) Gates healthy? He’s on my fantasy team!&#x27;&quot;

===Wasted productivity===
While its precise impact is difficult to quantify, estimates of American workplace productivity lost due to fantasy football range from $6.5 billion to $17 billion annually. As of 2019, an estimated 7.5 million Americans play fantasy football at work. However, according to John Challenger, an executive at a research firm that produces an annual report on the subject, measuring the precise impact of fantasy football on employers is difficult because &quot;there is no way to determine how many people are managing their teams from work or how long they are spending on these activities.&quot;

Researchers have noted that fantasy football&#x27;s benefits towards motivation and workplace culture may offset these losses. &quot;It might cost employers a little bit in lost productivity, but we think it makes up for it in spades in terms of building up the culture in an organization,&quot; said Andrew Challenger, whose firm estimated in 2019 that fantasy football cost employers $9 billion. &quot;It helps transform jobs that have become more and more transactional into communities.&quot;

<text>A horse&#x27;s neck is an American cocktail recognised by the International Bartenders Association (IBA), identifiably sporting a long, curling strip of lemon rind.

==Mixture==
It is made with brandy (or sometimes bourbon) and ginger ale, with a long spiral of lemon peel draped over the edge of an old fashioned glass or a highball glass. A similar Canadian drink, the rye and ginger, is made with Canadian whisky and ginger ale.

==History==
Dating back to at least the 1900s, it was a non-alcoholic mixture of ginger ale, ice and lemon peel. By the 1910s, brandy, or bourbon would be added for a &quot;horse&#x27;s neck with a kick&quot; or a &quot;stiff horse&#x27;s neck.&quot; The non-alcoholic version was still served in upstate New York in the late 1950s and early 60s, but eventually it was phased out. IBA classifies this drink as a long drink.

Franklin Roosevelt occasionally consumed this drink in its non-alcoholic form. According to the head of FDR&#x27;s Secret Service personal protection detail, “Whenever he [the President] was in a gathering where there was prolonged drinking he would ask for a ‘horse’s neck,’ a drink made of ginger ale, lemon peel, and no alcohol.”

==Horse&#x27;s neck in popular culture==
In the 1934 film &quot;The Captain Hates the Sea&quot;, Alison Skipworth&#x27;s character craves a horse&#x27;s neck, when Fred Keating&#x27;s character tries to stop her, she says, &quot;...I&#x27;m a lone wolf and it&#x27;s my night to howl&quot; then tells the waiter &quot;...be sure to add a big horse, Charley&quot;. The disgruntled bartender then takes a lemon and begins to peel it, muttering &quot;...around, and around, and around, for that cock-eyed Horse&#x27;s Neck.&quot;

In the 1935 musical film &quot;Top Hat&quot;, Madge (Helen Broderick) tries to order a drink in Italian but gives up and says &quot;horse&#x27;s neck&quot;.

In the 1935 film &quot;No Limit&quot;, starring George Formby as George Shuttleworth, George accidentally orders a horse&#x27;s neck at the bar in the steam packet ferry en route to the Isle of Man. He originally tries to order a lemonade but becomes confused and begins to repeat the orders of other passengers in a bid to be noticed by the barman who is studiously ignoring George at the busy bar.

In the 1937 crime-adventure novel &quot;Challenge&quot; featuring gentleman adventurer Bull-Dog Drummond, Drummond&#x27;s friend Algy Longworth suffering from a hangover requests a breakfast cocktail of his butler: &quot;Beneath this outer husk, conditions are poor--very poor... I could do with a horse&#x27;s neck.&quot;

The non-alcoholic version of the drink is referenced in at least two film noir movies from 1950: &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; with Humphrey Bogart, in which Martha Stewart—playing the hat-check girl—states that adding a twist of lemon to ginger ale is called a &quot;horse&#x27;s neck&quot;; and &quot;Outside the Wall&quot;, in which Dorothy Hart tells Richard Basehart the two ingredients that compose the cocktail.

The horse&#x27;s neck became popular in the wardrooms of the Royal Navy in the 1960s, displacing pink gin as the officers&#x27; preferred drink. An early reference to this is made in the 1957 film &quot;Yangtse Incident&quot;, in which a naval officer is shown drinking a horse&#x27;s neck in 1949. At naval cocktail parties (CTPs), it used to be served by the mess stewards ready-mixed in glass jugs, alongside similar jugs of mixed gin and tonic, with the request &quot;H-N or G&amp;T, sir?&quot;

In the 1979 BBC TV spy thriller series &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot;, Alec Guinness&#x27;s character (George Smiley) asks for a brandy and ginger ale in episode six. 

In the 1983 British TV series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot; based on Christie&#x27;s Tommy and Tuppence mysteries, in the episode &quot;The Crackler&quot;, Tuppence is particularly eager to try a horse&#x27;s neck, and drinks several.

At the end of the 1988 film &quot;Return of the Living Dead Part II&quot;, the character Doc Mandel asks the pre-teen character Jesse Wilson if he has ever had a horse&#x27;s neck, to which he replies &quot;No.&quot;

<text>Wood carving (or woodcarving) is a form of woodworking by means of a cutting tool (knife) in one hand or a chisel by two hands or with one hand on a chisel and one hand on a mallet, resulting in a wooden figure or figurine, or in the sculptural ornamentation of a wooden object. The phrase may also refer to the finished product, from individual sculptures to hand-worked mouldings composing part of a tracery.

The making of sculpture in wood has been extremely widely practised, but does not survive undamaged as well as the other main materials like stone and bronze, as it is vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. Therefore, it forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures. Outdoor wood sculptures do not last long in most parts of the world, so it is still unknown how the totem pole tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan, in particular, are in wood, and so are the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions. Wood is light and can take very fine detail so it is highly suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be worn or carried. It is also much easier to work on than stone and can be carved more thinly and precisely due to its fibrous strength.

Some of the finest extant examples of early European wood carving are from the Middle Ages in Germany, Russia, Italy, and France, where the typical themes of that era were Christian iconography. In England, many complete examples remain from the 16th and 17th century, where oak was the preferred medium.

The oldest wood carved sculpture, the Shigir Idol carved from larch, is around 12,000 years old.

===Wood carving process===

====Selection====
The nature of the wood being carved limits the scope of the carver in that wood is not equally strong in all directions: it is an anisotropic material. The direction in which wood is strongest is called &quot;grain&quot; (grain may be straight, interlocked, wavy or fiddleback, &quot;etc&quot;.). It is smart to arrange the more delicate parts of a design along the grain instead of across it. Often, however, a &quot;line of best fit&quot; is instead employed, since a design may have multiple weak points in different directions, or orientation of these along the grain would necessitate carving detail on end grain, (which is considerably more difficult). Carving blanks are also sometimes assembled, as with carousel horses, out of many smaller boards, and in this way, one can orient different areas of a carving in the most logical way, both for the carving process and for durability. Less commonly, this same principle is used in solid pieces of wood, where the fork of two branches is utilized for its divergent grain, or a branch off of a larger log is carved into a beak (this was the technique employed for traditional Welsh shepherd&#x27;s crooks, and some Native American adze handles). The failure to appreciate these primary rules may constantly be seen in damaged work, when it will be noticed that, whereas tendrils, tips of birds beaks, etc., arranged across the grain have been broken away, similar details designed more in harmony with the growth of the wood and not too deeply undercut remain intact.

Probably the two most common woods used for carving in North America are basswood (aka tilia or lime) and tupelo; both are hardwoods that are relatively easy to work with. Chestnut, butternut, oak, American walnut, mahogany and teak are also very good woods; while for fine work Italian walnut, sycamore maple, apple, pear, box or plum, are usually chosen. Decoration that is to be painted and of not too delicate a nature is often carved in pine, which is relatively soft and inexpensive.

====Sculpture====

A wood carver begins a new carving by selecting a chunk of wood the approximate size and shape of the figure he or she wishes to create or if the carving is to be large, several pieces of wood may be laminated together to create the required size. The type of wood is important. Hardwoods are more difficult to shape but have greater luster and longevity. Softer woods may be easier to carve but are more prone to damage. Any wood can be carved but they all have different qualities and characteristics. The choice will depend on the requirements of carving being done: for example, a detailed figure would need a wood with a fine grain and very little figure as a strong figure can interfere with &#x27;reading&#x27; fine detail.

Once the sculptor has selected their wood, he or she begins a general shaping process using gouges of various sizes. The gouge is a curved blade that can remove large portions of wood smoothly. For harder woods, the sculptor may use gouges sharpened with stronger bevels, about 35 degrees, and a mallet similar to a stone carver&#x27;s. The terms &quot;gouge&quot; and &quot;chisel&quot; are open to confusion. Correctly, a gouge is a tool with a curved cross-section and a chisel is a tool with a flat cross-section. However, professional carvers tend to refer to them all as &#x27;chisels&#x27;. Smaller sculptures may require the woodcarver to use a knife, and larger pieces might require the use of a saw. No matter what wood is selected or tool used, the wood sculptor must always carve either across or with the grain of the wood, never against the grain.

Once the general shape is made, the carver may use a variety of tools for creating details. For example, a &quot;veiner&quot; or &quot;fluter&quot; can be used to make deep gouges into the surface, or a &quot;v-tool&quot; for making fine lines or decorative cuts. Once the finer details have been added, the woodcarver finishes the surface. The method chosen depends on the required quality of the surface finish. The texture left by shallow gouges gives &#x27;life&#x27; to the carving&#x27;s surface and many carvers prefer this &#x27;tooled&#x27; finish. If a completely smooth surface is required general smoothing can be done with tools such as &quot;rasps,&quot; which are flat-bladed tools with a surface of pointed teeth. &quot;Rifflers&quot; are similar to rasps, but smaller, usually double-ended, and of various shapes for working in folds or crevasses. The finer polishing is done with abrasive paper. Large grained paper with a rougher surface is used first, with the sculptor then using finer grained paper that can make the surface of the sculpture slick to the touch.

After the carving and finishing is completed, the artist may seal &amp; colour the wood with a variety of natural oils, such as walnut or linseed oil which protects the wood from dirt and moisture. Oil also imparts a sheen to the wood which, by reflecting light, helps the observer &#x27;read&#x27; the form. Carvers seldom use gloss varnish as it creates too shiny a surface, which reflects so much light it can confuse the form; carvers refer to this as &#x27;the toffee apple effect&#x27;. Objects made of wood are frequently finished with a layer of wax, which protects the wood and gives a soft lustrous sheen. A wax finish (e.g., shoe polish) is comparatively fragile though and only suitable for indoor carvings.

<text>Amborella is a monotypic genus of understory shrubs or small trees endemic to the main island, Grande Terre, of New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The genus is the only member of the family Amborellaceae and the order Amborellales and contains a single species, Amborella trichopoda. &quot;Amborella&quot; is of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently place it as the sister group to all other flowering plants, meaning it was the earliest group to evolve separately from all other flowering plants.

==Description==
&quot;Amborella&quot; is a sprawling shrub or small tree up to high. It bears alternate, simple evergreen leaves without stipules. The leaves are two-ranked, with distinctly serrated or rippled margins, and about long.

&quot;Amborella&quot; has xylem tissue that differs from that of most other flowering plants. The xylem of &quot;Amborella&quot; contains only tracheids; vessel elements are absent. Xylem of this form has long been regarded as a primitive feature of flowering plants.

The species is dioecious. This means that each plant produces either male flowers (meaning that they have functional stamens) or female flowers (flowers with functional carpels), but not both. At any one time, a dioecious plant produces only functionally staminate or functionally carpellate flowers. Staminate (&quot;male&quot;) &quot;Amborella&quot; flowers do not have carpels, whereas the carpellate (&quot;female&quot;) flowers have non-functional &quot;staminodes&quot;, structures resembling stamens in which no pollen develops. Plants may change from one reproductive morphology to the other. In one study, seven cuttings from a staminate plant produced, as expected, staminate flowers at their first flowering, but three of the seven produced carpellate flowers at their second flowering.

The small, creamy white flowers are arranged in inflorescences borne in the axils of foliage leaves. The inflorescences have been described as cymes, with up to three orders of branching, each branch being terminated by a flower. Each flower is subtended by bracts. The bracts transition into a perianth of undifferentiated tepals. The tepals typically are arranged in a spiral, but sometimes are whorled at the periphery.

Carpellate flowers are roughly in diameter, with 7 or 8 tepals. There are 1 to 3 (or rarely 0) well-differentiated staminodes and a spiral of 4 to 8 free (apocarpous) carpels. Carpels bear green ovaries; they lack a style. They contain a single ovule with the micropyle directed downwards. Staminate flowers are approximately 4 to 5 mm in diameter, with 6 to 15 tepals. These flowers bear 10 to 21 spirally arranged stamens, which become progressively smaller toward the center. The innermost may be sterile, amounting to staminodes. The stamens bear triangular anthers on short broad filaments. An anther consists of four pollen sacs, two on each side, with a small sterile central connective. The anthers have connective tips with small bumps and may be covered with secretions. These features suggest that, as with other basal angiosperms, there is a high degree of developmental plasticity.

Typically, 1 to 3 carpels per flower develop into fruit. The fruit is an ovoid red drupe (approximately 5 to 7 mm long and 5 mm wide) borne on a short (1 to 2 mm) stalk. The remains of the stigma can be seen at the tip of the fruit. The skin is papery, surrounding a thin fleshy layer containing a red juice. The inner pericarp is lignified and surrounds the single seed. The embryo is small and surrounded by copious endosperm.

==Taxonomy==
=== History ===

The Cronquist system, of 1981, classified the family:
: Order Laurales
:: Subclass Magnoliidae
::: Class Magnoliopsida [=dicotyledons]
:::: Division Magnoliophyta [=angiosperms]

The Thorne system (1992) classified it:
: Order Magnoliales
:: Superorder Magnolianae
::: Subclass Magnoliideae [=dicotyledons]
:::: Class Magnoliopsida [=angiosperms]

The Dahlgren system classified it:
: Order Laurales
:: Superorder Magnolianae
::: Subclass Magnoliideae [=dicotyledons],
:::: Class Magnoliopsida [=angiosperms].

=== Modern classification ===
&quot;Amborella&quot; is the only genus in the family Amborellaceae. The APG II system recognized this family, but left it unplaced at order rank due to uncertainty about its relationship to the family Nymphaeaceae. In the more recent APG systems, APG III and APG IV, the Amborellaceae comprise the monotypic order Amborellales at the base of the angiosperm phylogeny.

===Phylogeny===
Currently plant systematists accept &quot;Amborella trichopoda&quot; as the most basal lineage in the clade of angiosperms. In systematics the term &quot;basal&quot; describes a lineage that diverges near the base of a phylogeny, and thus earlier than other lineages. Since &quot;Amborella&quot; is apparently basal among the flowering plants, the features of early flowering plants can be inferred by comparing derived traits shared by the main angiosperm lineage but not present in &quot;Amborella&quot;. These traits are presumed to have evolved after the divergence of the &quot;Amborella&quot; lineage.

One early 20th century idea of &quot;primitive&quot; (i.e. ancestral) floral traits in angiosperms, accepted until relatively recently, is the &quot;Magnolia&quot; blossom model. This envisions flowers with numerous parts arranged in spirals on an elongated, cone-like receptacle rather than the small numbers of parts in distinct whorls of more derived flowers.

In a study designed to clarify relationships between well-studied model plants such as &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, and the basal angiosperms &quot;Amborella&quot;, &quot;Nuphar&quot; (Nymphaeaceae), &quot;Illicium&quot;, the monocots, and more derived angiosperms (eudicots), chloroplast genomes using cDNA and expressed sequence tags for floral genes, the cladogram shown below was generated.

This hypothesized relationship of the extant seed plants places &quot;Amborella&quot; as the sister taxon to all other angiosperms, and shows the gymnosperms as a monophyletic group sister to the angiosperms. It supports the theory that &quot;Amborella&quot; branched off from the main lineage of angiosperms before the ancestors of any other living angiosperms. There is however some uncertainty about the relationship between the Amborellaceae and the Nymphaeales: one theory is that the Amborellaceae alone are the monophyletic sister to the extant angiosperms; another proposes that the Amborellaceae and Nymphaeales form a clade that is the sister group to all other extant angiosperms.

Because of its evolutionary position at the base of the flowering plant clade, there was support for sequencing the complete genome of &quot;Amborella trichopoda&quot; to serve as a reference for evolutionary studies. In 2010, the US National Science Foundation began a genome sequencing effort in &quot;Amborella&quot;, and the draft genome sequence was posted on the project website in December 2013.

==== Genomic and evolutionary considerations ====
&quot;Amborella&quot; is of great interest to plant systematists because molecular phylogenetic analyses consistently place it at or near the base of the flowering plant lineage. That is, the Amborellaceae represent a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on (more than 130 million years ago) from all the other extant species of flowering plants, and, among extant flowering plants, is the sister group to the other flowering plants. Comparing characteristics of this basal angiosperm, other flowering plants and fossils may provide clues about how flowers first appeared—what Darwin called the &quot;abominable mystery&quot;. This position is consistent with a number of conservative characteristics of its physiology and morphology; for example, the wood of &quot;Amborella&quot; lacks the vessels characteristic of most flowering plants. The genes responsible for floral traits like scent and colors in other angiosperms, have yet to be found. Further, the female gametophyte of &quot;Amborella&quot; is even more reduced than normal female angiosperm gametophyte.

&quot;Amborella&quot;, being an understory plant in the wild, is commonly in intimate contact with shade- and moisture-dependent organisms such as algae, lichens and mosses. In those circumstances, some horizontal gene transfer between &quot;Amborella&quot; and such associated species is not surprising in principle, but the scale of such transfer has caused considerable surprise. Sequencing the &quot;Amborella&quot; mitochondrial genome revealed that for every gene of its own origin, it contains about six versions from the genomes of an assortment of the plants and algae growing with or upon it. The evolutionary and physiological significance of this is not as yet clear, nor in particular is it clear whether the horizontal gene transfer has anything to do with the apparent stability and conservatism of the species.

==Ecology==
&quot;Amborella&quot; is typically dioecious, but has been known to change sex in cultivation. &quot;Amborella&quot; has a mixed pollination system, relying on both insect pollinators and wind.

==Conservation==
The islands of New Caledonia are a biodiversity hot-spot, preserving many early diverging lineages of plants, of which &quot;Amborella&quot; is but one. This preservation has been ascribed to climate stability during and since the Tertiary (), stability that has permitted the continued survival of tropical forests on New Caledonia. In contrast, drought conditions dominated the Australian climate towards the end of the Tertiary. Current threats to biodiversity in New Caledonia include fires, mining, agriculture, invasion by introduced species, urbanization and global warming. The importance of conserving &quot;Amborella&quot; has been dramatically stated by Pillon: &quot;The disappearance of &quot;Amborella trichopoda&quot; would imply the disappearance of a genus, a family and an entire order, as well as the only witness to at least 140 million years of evolutionary history.&quot; Conservation strategies targeted on relict species are recommended, both preserving a diversity of habitats in New Caledonia and &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation in cultivation. The IUCN conservation status is Least Concern (LC).

<doc id="275868" wikidata="Q827860" url="?curid=275868" title="New Jersey Route 208">
<text>Route 208 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States. It runs from an interchange with Route 4 and County Route 79 (CR 79, Saddle River Road) in Fair Lawn northwest to an interchange with Interstate 287 (I-287) at the Franklin Lakes–Oakland borough line. The route runs through suburban areas of Bergen and Passaic counties as a four- to six-lane divided highway. The route runs through the communities of Fair Lawn, Glen Rock, Hawthorne, Wyckoff, and Franklin Lakes along the way, interchanging with CR 507 in Fair Lawn and CR 502 in Franklin Lakes.

What is now Route 208 was initially planned as Route S4B in 1929, a spur of Route 4 that was to run from Fair Lawn northwest to the New York border in Greenwood Lake, where it would eventually connect to New York State Route 208 (NY 208). This route replaced what was planned as a part of Route 3 in 1927 between Paterson and Greenwood Lake. By the time the route was renumbered to Route 208 in 1953 to match NY 208, only a portion of the route in Fair Lawn from Route 4 to Maple Avenue had been built. Route 208 was completed west to U.S. Route 202 (US 202) in Oakland by 1960 as a two-lane undivided road; it would be built into its present configuration in later years. A Route 208 freeway was planned across the Ramapo Mountains from Oakland to connect to a proposed NY 208 freeway at Greenwood Lake; however, it was never built. After I-287 was extended from Montville to the New York border in 1993, it took over the alignment of Route 208 between US 202 and the route’s current northern terminus. The last traffic signal along Route 208 at McBride Avenue was removed in 1995 and the interchange with Route 4 and Saddle River Road was reconstructed in 2002.

==Route description==
Traffic moves in at least two lanes in each direction for the road&#x27;s entire length of , widening briefly to three lanes next to a commercial area in Fair Lawn and near its northern terminus.

The road originates as a four-lane arterial road at an interchange with Route 4 in Fair Lawn, Bergen County that also includes ramps for CR 79 (Saddle River Road), heading to the west near residential areas. Shortly after beginning, a ramp from southbound Route 208 provides access via Virginia Drive to westbound Route 4. The next exit is a partial interchange with CR 78 (Morlot Avenue), followed by a full interchange with Plaza Road. Past the latter, the route passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line and comes to a southbound exit and entrance with Berdan Avenue. From here, the road turns to the northwest, passing near more neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with CR 76 (Fair Lawn Avenue). Past this interchange, the northbound direction of Route 208 widens to three lanes and it continues into commercial areas, with some driveways along the road and an intersection with McBride Avenue. At this point, the highway passes an industrial park. A short distance later, the road reaches the interchange with CR 507 (Maple Avenue) and CR 127 (Harristown Road). Past this interchange, the road enters Glen Rock and has a northbound exit and entrance with De Boer Drive before crossing over NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line. Route 208 then heads through wooded residential areas prior to a northbound interchange with CR 653 (Lincoln Avenue), where it enters Hawthorne, Passaic County. CR 653 and Route 208 are connected by a short segment of CR 664 (Rea Avenue).

The highway has turnoffs in each direction for Utter Avenue before passing beneath the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s (NYSW) New Jersey Subdivision line prior the interchange with CR 659 (Goffle Road). Past here, the highway turns north and climbs a hill, passing the Hawthorne Gospel Church on the right. It re-enters Bergen County in Wyckoff, just before the Grandview Avenue interchange. From here, Route 208 largely resembles a wooded parkway, although there are a few driveways off the road. The road turns northwest and interchanges with CR 93 (Cedar Hill Avenue) before passing near more homes and coming to an interchange with CR S93 (Russell Avenue). The road continues into Franklin Lakes and interchanges with CR 502 (Ewing Avenue) before turning west-northwest and coming to an exit for CR S89 (Summit Avenue). Past Summit Avenue, the road has two interchanges providing access to the Becton Dickinson headquarters campus, where the road carries three lanes in each direction. It narrows back to two lanes in each direction before coming to the interchange with CR 117 (Colonial Road) and CR 89 (High Mountain Road). The final exit heading northbound is for I-287 north, an interchange that includes another crossing of the NYSW line. After passing the exit, Route 208 northbound merges into I-287 southbound at the Franklin Lakes–Oakland borough line.

==History==

Route 208 was first plotted in 1929 as Route S4B, a spur of Route 4 that was to run from Fair Lawn northwest through Ringwood, and West Milford to the New York border near Greenwood Lake. This route was to replace what was to be a portion of Route 3 between Paterson and the New York border that was designated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The road was projected to continue into New York and continue through Sterling Forest and Monroe, New York, where it would join NY 208 at its intersection with NY 17. By 1953, the portion of Route S4B between Route 4 and Maple Avenue in Fair Lawn was completed; that same year, it was renumbered to Route 208 in order to match NY 208. By 1960, the road was extended to a northern terminus at US 202 and West Oakland Avenue in Oakland, where traffic could exit and continue over Skyline Drive to Ringwood. When first constructed, this portion of Route 208 was a two-lane undivided road. By 1969, the portion between Maple Avenue and Goffle Road was widened to a divided highway with the entire route built into a multi-lane divided highway by the 1980s.
Meanwhile, plans still existed to build Route 208 past Oakland to the New York border. Passaic County called for a divided highway to bypass Skyline Drive, and in 1967 the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) proposed a Route 208 freeway through the Ramapo Mountains that would run from Oakland to the New York border in Greenwood Lake, where it would connect to a proposed NY 208 freeway (called the Orange Expressway) that would continue north to I-84 in Maybrook, New York. This freeway, which was to cost $66.3 million, was to improve traffic in the resort areas of the Ramapo Mountains and also connect to the proposed Route 94 freeway leading to Warren County and the proposed Route 178 freeway leading to Morris County. In 1975, this proposed freeway was recommended by the Tri-State Regional Planning Commission to be completed by 2000. However, it was never built.
When I-287 was extended from Montville to the New York border in 1993, it took over the alignment of Route 208 between US 202 and the current northern terminus of Route 208. In 1995, the last traffic signal along Route 208 at McBride Avenue was turned off. In 2002, construction was completed on a $32 million project that improved the interchange with Route 4 in Fair Lawn. This interchange saw improvements of the ramps and bridges, including the Route 208 bridge over Saddle River Road. Route 208, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar powered emergency call boxes every ; however with the advent of cell phones the usage of these call boxes became extremely limited. To save on maintenance costs, the NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005.

<text>Signal refers to both the process and the result of transmission of data over some media accomplished by embedding some variation. Signals are important in multiple subject fields including signal processing, information theory and biology. 

In signal processing, a signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. Any quantity that can vary over space or time can be used as a signal to share messages between observers. The &quot;IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing&quot; includes audio, video, speech, image, sonar, and radar as examples of signals. A signal may also be defined as observable change in a quantity over space or time (a time series), even if it does not carry information.

In nature, signals can be actions done by an organism to alert other organisms, ranging from the release of plant chemicals to warn nearby plants of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of food. Signaling occurs in all organisms even at cellular levels, with cell signaling. Signaling theory, in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for evolution is the ability of animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a sensor, and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a transducer. For example, a microphone converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a speaker does the reverse.

Another important property of a signal is its entropy or information content. Information theory serves as the formal study of signals and their content. The information of a signal is often accompanied by noise, which primarily refers to unwanted modifications of signals, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with desired signals (crosstalk). The reduction of noise is covered in part under the heading of signal integrity. The separation of desired signals from background noise is the field of signal recovery, one branch of which is estimation theory, a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.

Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have advanced the design, study, and implementation of systems involving transmission, storage, and manipulation of information. In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines: electronic engineering and computer engineering developed to specialize in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals, while design engineering developed to address the functional design of signals in user–machine interfaces.

==Definitions==
Definitions specific to sub-fields are common: 
* In electronics and telecommunications, &quot;signal&quot; refers to any time-varying voltage, current, or electromagnetic wave that carries information.
* In signal processing, signals are analog and digital representations of analog physical quantities. 
* In information theory, a signal is a codified message, that is, the sequence of states in a communication channel that encodes a message. 
* In a communication system, a &quot;transmitter&quot; encodes a &quot;message&quot; to create a signal, which is carried to a &quot;receiver&quot; by the communication channel. For example, the words &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; might be the message spoken into a telephone. The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical signal. The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds.
* In telephone networks, signaling, for example common-channel signaling, refers to phone number and other digital control information rather than the actual voice signal.

== Classification ==
Signals can be categorized in various ways. The most common distinction is between discrete and continuous spaces that the functions are defined over, for example, discrete and continuous-time domains. Discrete-time signals are often referred to as &quot;time series&quot; in other fields. Continuous-time signals are often referred to as &quot;continuous signals&quot;.

A second important distinction is between discrete-valued and continuous-valued. Particularly in digital signal processing, a digital signal may be defined as a sequence of discrete values, typically associated with an underlying continuous-valued physical process. In digital electronics, digital signals are the continuous-time waveform signals in a digital system, representing a bit-stream.

Signals may also be categorized by their spatial distributions as either point source signals (PSSs) or distributed source signals (DSSs).
In Signals and Systems, signals can be classified according to many criteria, mainly: according to the different feature of values, classified into analog signals and digital signals; according to the determinacy of signals, classified into deterministic signals and random signals; according to the strength of signals, classified into energy signals and power signals.

=== Analog and digital signals ===
Two main types of signals encountered in practice are &quot;analog&quot; and &quot;digital&quot;. The figure shows a digital signal that results from approximating an analog signal by its values at particular time instants. Digital signals are &quot;quantized&quot;, while analog signals are continuous.

====Analog signal====
An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time-varying feature of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., &quot;analogous&quot; to another time varying signal. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the sound pressure. It differs from a digital signal, in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values.

The term &quot;analog signal&quot; usually refers to electrical signals; however, analog signals may use other mediums such as mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic. An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal&#x27;s information. For example, an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information. In an electrical signal, the voltage, current, or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information.
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, position, or pressure. The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a transducer. For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, sound) strike the diaphragm of a microphone which induces corresponding electrical fluctuations. The voltage or the current is said to be an &quot;analog&quot; of the sound.

====Digital signal====
A digital signal is a signal that is constructed from a discrete set of waveforms of a physical quantity so as to represent a sequence of discrete values. A &quot;logic signal&quot; is a digital signal with only two possible values, and describes an arbitrary bit stream. Other types of digital signals can represent three-valued logic or higher valued logics.

Alternatively, a digital signal may be considered to be the sequence of codes represented by such a physical quantity. The physical quantity may be a variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or polarization of an optical or other electromagnetic field, acoustic pressure, the magnetization of a magnetic storage media, etc. Digital signals are present in all digital electronics, notably computing equipment and data transmission.

With digital signals, system noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect system operation whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog signals to some degree.

Digital signals often arise via sampling of analog signals, for example, a continually fluctuating voltage on a line that can be digitized by an analog-to-digital converter circuit, wherein the circuit will read the voltage level on the line, say, every 50 microseconds and represent each reading with a fixed number of bits. The resulting stream of numbers is stored as digital data on a discrete-time and quantized-amplitude signal. Computers and other digital devices are restricted to discrete time.

=== Energy and power ===
According to the strengths of signals, practical signals can be classified into two categories: energy signals and power signals.

Energy signals: Those signals&#x27; energy are equal to a finite positive value, but their average powers are 0;

formula_1

Power signals: Those signals&#x27; average power are equal to a finite positive value, but their energy are infinite.

formula_2

=== Deterministic and random ===
Deterministic signals are those whose values at any time are predictable and can be calculated by a mathematical equation.

Random signals are signals that take on random values at any given time instant and must be modeled stochastically.

=== Even and odd ===
An even signal satisfies the condition formula_3

or equivalently if the following equation holds for all formula_4 and formula_5 in the domain of formula_6:
:formula_7

An odd signal satisfies the condition formula_8

or equivalently if the following equation holds for all formula_4 and formula_5 in the domain of formula_6:
:formula_12

=== Periodic ===
A signal is said to be periodic if it satisfies the condition:

formula_13 or formula_14

Where:

formula_15 = fundamental time period,

formula_16= fundamental frequency.

The same can be applied to formula_17. A periodic signal will repeat for every period.

==== Time discretization ====
Signals can be classified as continuous or discrete time. In the mathematical abstraction, the domain of a continuous-time signal is the set of real numbers (or some interval thereof), whereas the domain of a discrete-time (DT) signal is the set of integers (or other subsets of real numbers). What these integers represent depends on the nature of the signal; most often it is time.

A continuous-time signal is any function which is defined at every time &quot;t&quot; in an interval, most commonly an infinite interval. A simple source for a discrete-time signal is the sampling of a continuous signal, approximating the signal by a sequence of its values at particular time instants.

=== Amplitude quantization ===
If a signal is to be represented as a sequence of digital data, it is impossible to maintain exact precision – each number in the sequence must have a finite number of digits. As a result, the values of such a signal must be quantized into a finite set for practical representation. Quantization is the process of converting a continuous analog audio signal to a digital signal with discrete numerical values of integers.

== Examples of signals ==
Naturally occurring signals can be converted to electronic signals by various sensors. Examples include:
* &quot;Motion&quot;. The motion of an object can be considered to be a signal and can be monitored by various sensors to provide electrical signals. For example, radar can provide an electromagnetic signal for following aircraft motion. A motion signal is one-dimensional (time), and the range is generally three-dimensional. Position is thus a 3-vector signal; position and orientation of a rigid body is a 6-vector signal. Orientation signals can be generated using a gyroscope.
* &quot;Sound&quot;. Since a sound is a vibration of a medium (such as air), a sound signal associates a pressure value to every value of time and possibly three space coordinates indicating the direction of travel. A sound signal is converted to an electrical signal by a microphone, generating a voltage signal as an analog of the sound signal. Sound signals can be sampled at a discrete set of time points; for example, compact discs (CDs) contain discrete signals representing sound, recorded at 44,100 Hz; since CDs are recorded in stereo, each sample contains data for a left and right channel, which may be considered to be a 2-vector signal. The CD encoding is converted to an electrical signal by reading the information with a laser, converting the sound signal to an optical signal.
* &quot;Images&quot;. A picture or image consists of a brightness or color signal, a function of a two-dimensional location. The object&#x27;s appearance is presented as emitted or reflected light, an electromagnetic signal. It can be converted to voltage or current waveforms using devices such as the charge-coupled device. A 2D image can have a continuous spatial domain, as in a traditional photograph or painting; or the image can be discretized in space, as in a digital image. Color images are typically represented as a combination of monochrome images in three primary colors.
* &quot;Videos&quot;. A video signal is a sequence of images. A point in a video is identified by its two-dimensional position in the image and by the time at which it occurs, so a video signal has a three-dimensional domain. Analog video has one continuous domain dimension (across a scan line) and two discrete dimensions (frame and line).
* Biological &quot;membrane potentials&quot;. The value of the signal is an electric potential (voltage). The domain is more difficult to establish. Some cells or organelles have the same membrane potential throughout; neurons generally have different potentials at different points. These signals have very low energies, but are enough to make nervous systems work; they can be measured in aggregate by electrophysiology techniques.
*The output of a thermocouple, which conveys temperature information.
*The output of a pH meter which conveys acidity information.

==Signal processing==

Signal processing is the manipulation of signals. A common example is signal transmission between different locations. The embodiment of a signal in electrical form is made by a transducer that converts the signal from its original form to a waveform expressed as a current or a voltage, or electromagnetic radiation, for example, an optical signal or radio transmission. Once expressed as an electronic signal, the signal is available for further processing by electrical devices such as electronic amplifiers and filters, and can be transmitted to a remote location by a transmitter and received using radio receivers.

==Signals and systems==
In electrical engineering (EE) programs, signals are covered in a class and field of study known as &quot;signals and systems&quot;. Depending on the school, undergraduate EE students generally take the class as juniors or seniors, normally depending on the number and level of previous linear algebra and differential equation classes they have taken.

The field studies input and output signals, and the mathematical representations between them known as systems, in four domains: time, frequency, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. Since signals and systems are both studied in these four domains, there are 8 major divisions of study. As an example, when working with continuous-time signals (&quot;t&quot;), one might transform from the time domain to a frequency or &quot;s&quot; domain; or from discrete time (&quot;n&quot;) to frequency or &quot;z&quot; domains. Systems also can be transformed between these domains like signals, with continuous to &quot;s&quot; and discrete to &quot;z&quot;.

Signals and systems is a subset of the field of mathematical modeling. It involves circuit analysis and design via mathematical modeling and some numerical methods, and was updated several decades ago with dynamical systems tools including differential equations, and recently, Lagrangians. Students are expected to understand the modeling tools as well as the mathematics, physics, circuit analysis, and transformations between the 8 domains.

Because mechanical engineering (ME) topics like friction, dampening etc. have very close analogies in signal science (inductance, resistance, voltage, etc.), many of the tools originally used in ME transformations (Laplace and Fourier transforms, Lagrangians, sampling theory, probability, difference equations, etc.) have now been applied to signals, circuits, systems and their components, analysis and design in EE. Dynamical systems that involve noise, filtering and other random or chaotic attractors and repellers have now placed stochastic sciences and statistics between the more deterministic discrete and continuous functions in the field. (Deterministic as used here means signals that are completely determined as functions of time).

EE taxonomists are still not decided where signals and systems falls within the whole field of signal processing vs. circuit analysis and mathematical modeling, but the common link of the topics that are covered in the course of study has brightened boundaries with dozens of books, journals, etc. called &quot;Signals and Systems&quot;, and used as text and test prep for the EE, as well as, recently, computer engineering exams.

<doc id="275872" wikidata="Q1564640" url="?curid=275872" title="Ring modulation">
<text>In electronics, ring modulation is a signal processing function, an implementation of frequency mixing, in which two signals are combined to yield an output signal. One signal, called the carrier, is typically a sine wave or another simple waveform; the other signal is typically more complicated and is called the input or the modulator signal. A ring modulator is an electronic device for ring modulation. A ring modulator may be used in music synthesizers and as an effects unit.

The name derives from the fact that the analog circuit of diodes originally used to implement this technique takes the shape of a ring: a diode ring. The circuit is similar to a bridge rectifier, except that instead of the diodes facing left or right, they face clockwise or counterclockwise.

Ring modulation is quite similar to amplitude modulation, with the difference that in the latter the modulator is shifted to be positive before being multiplied with the carrier, while in the former the unshifted modulator is multiplied with the carrier. This has the effect that ring modulation of two sine waves having frequencies of 1,500 Hz and 400 Hz will produce as output signal the sum of a sine wave with frequency 1,900 Hz and one with frequency 1,100 Hz. These two output frequencies are known as sidebands. If one of the input signals has significant overtones (which is the case for square waves), the output will sound quite different, since each harmonic will generate its own pair of sidebands that won&#x27;t be harmonically-related.

== Simplified operation ==
Denoting the carrier signal by formula_1, the modulator signal by formula_2 and the output signal by formula_3 (where formula_4 denotes time), ring modulation approximates multiplication:

:formula_5

If formula_1 and formula_2 are sine waves with frequencies formula_8 and formula_9, respectively, then formula_3 will be the sum of two (phase-shifted) sine waves, one of frequency formula_11 and the other of frequency formula_12. This is a consequence of the trigonometric identity:

:formula_13

Alternatively, one can use the fact that multiplication in the time domain is the same as convolution in the frequency domain.

Ring modulators thus output the sum and difference of the frequencies present in each waveform. This process of ring modulation produces a signal rich in partials. As well, neither the carrier nor the incoming signal are prominent in the output, and ideally, not present at all.

Two oscillators, whose frequencies were harmonically related and ring modulated against each other, produce sounds that still adhere to the harmonic partials of the notes but contain a very different spectral makeup. When the oscillators&#x27; frequencies are &quot;not&quot; harmonically related, ring modulation creates inharmonics, often producing bell-like or otherwise metallic sounds.

If the carrier signal is a square wave of frequency formula_8, whose Fourier expansion contains the fundamental and a series of reducing-amplitude odd harmonics:

:formula_15

and the carrier frequency formula_8 is at least twice the maximum frequency of the modulating signal &quot;formula_2&quot;, then the resulting output is a series of duplicates of &quot;formula_2&quot; at increasing regions of the frequency spectrum. For example, let &quot;formula_2&quot; represent a sine wave at 100 Hz, and the carrier &quot;formula_1&quot; be an ideal square wave at 300 Hz. The output will then include sine waves at 100±300 Hz, 100±900 Hz, 100±1500 Hz, 100±2100 Hz, etc., at decreasing amplitudes according to the Fourier expansion of the carrier square wave. If the carrier frequency is less than twice the upper frequency of the signal then the resulting output signal contains spectral components from both the signal and the carrier that combine in the time domain. 

Because the output contains neither the individual modulator or carrier components, the ring modulator is said to be a &quot;double-balanced&quot; mixer, where both input signals are suppressed (not present in the output)—the output is composed entirely of the sum of the products of the frequency components of the two inputs.

== History ==
The ring modulator was invented by Frank A. Cowan in 1934 and patented in 1935 as an improvement on the invention of Clyde R. Keith at Bell Labs. The original application was in the field of analog telephony for frequency-division multiplexing for carrying multiple voice signals over telephone cables. It has since been applied to a wider range of uses, such as voice inversion, radio transceivers, and electronic music.

While the original Cowan patent describes a circuit with a ring of four diodes, later implementations used FETs as the switching elements.

== Circuit description ==
The ring modulator includes an input stage, a ring of four diodes excited by a carrier signal, and an output stage. The input and output stages typically include transformers with center-taps towards the diode ring. It is important to note that while the diode ring has some similarities to a bridge rectifier the diodes in a ring modulator all point in the same clockwise or counterclockwise direction. (See the schematic of a ring modulator in the upper right.)

The carrier, which alternates between positive and negative current, at any given time makes one pair of diodes conduct, and reverse-biases the other pair. The conducting pair carries the signal from the left transformer secondary to the primary of the transformer at the right. If the left carrier terminal is positive, the top and bottom diodes conduct. If that terminal is negative, then the side diodes conduct, but create a polarity inversion between the transformers. This action is much like that of a DPDT (&quot;double pole, double throw&quot;) switch wired for reversing connections.

A particular elegance of the ring modulator is that it is bidirectional: the signal flow can be reversed allowing the same circuit with the same carrier to be used either as a modulator or demodulator, for example in low-cost radio transceivers.

==Integrated circuit methods of ring modulation==

Some modern ring modulators are implemented using digital signal processing techniques by simply multiplying the time domain signals, producing a nearly-perfect signal output. Intermodulation products can be generated by carefully selecting and changing the frequency of the two input waveforms. If the signals are processed digitally, the frequency-domain convolution becomes circular convolution. If the signals are wideband, this will cause aliasing distortion, so it is common to oversample the operation or low-pass filter the signals prior to ring modulation.

The SID chip found in the Commodore 64 allows for triangle waves to be ring modulated. Oscillator 1 gets modulated by oscillator 3&#x27;s frequency, oscillator 2 by oscillator 1&#x27;s frequency, and oscillator 3 by oscillator 2&#x27;s frequency. Ring modulation is disabled unless the carrier oscillator is set to produce a triangle wave, but the modulating oscillator can be set to generate any of its available waveforms. However, no matter what waveform you set the modulating oscillator to, the ring modulation will always have the effect of modulating a triangle wave with a square wave.

On an ARP Odyssey synthesizer (and a few others from that era as well) the ring modulator is an XOR function (formed from four NAND gates) fed from the square wave outputs of the two oscillators. For the limited case of square or pulse wave signals, this is identical to true ring modulation.

Analog multiplier ICs (such as those made by Analog Devices) would work as ring modulators, of course with regard to such matters as their operating limits and scale factors. Use of multiplier ICs means that the modulation products are largely confined to sum and difference frequency of inputs (unless the circuit is overdriven), rather than the much more complicated products of the rectifier circuit.

== Limitations ==

Any DC component of the carrier will degrade the suppression of the carrier and thus in radio applications the carrier is typically transformer- or capacitor-coupled; in low frequency (e.g., audio) applications the carrier may or may not be desired in the output.

Imperfections in the diodes and transformers introduce artifacts of the two input signals. In practical ring modulators, this leakage can be reduced by introducing opposing imbalances (&quot;e.g.&quot;, variable resistors or capacitors).

== Applications ==
=== Radio communications ===
Ring modulation has also been extensively used in radio receivers, for example, to demodulate an FM stereo signal, and to heterodyne microwave signals in mobile telephone and wireless networking systems. In this case, the circuit is sometimes called a &quot;ring demodulator&quot;, one of many possible chopper circuits. A ring modulator can be used to generate a double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSB-SC) wave used in radio transmission.

=== Music and sound effects ===
One of the earliest musical instruments utilizing a ring modulator was the &quot;Melochord&quot; (1947) built by Harald Bode. It was a two-tone melody keyboard instrument with foot controllers and later added a second keyboard for timbre control, featuring a white-noise generator, envelope controller, formant filters and ring modulators for harmonics. The early Melochord was extensively used by Werner Meyer-Eppler in the early days of the electronic music studio at Bonn University. Meyer-Eppler mentioned the musical application of ring modulator in his book &quot;Elektrische Klangerzeugung&quot;, published in 1949.

Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s student Karlheinz Stockhausen used ring modulation in 1956 for some sounds in &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; and his realization score for &quot;Telemusik&quot; (1966) also calls for it. Indeed, several entire compositions by Stockhausen are based around it, such as &quot;Mixtur&quot; (1964), one of the first compositions for orchestra and live electronics; &quot;Mikrophonie II&quot; (1965), where the sounds of choral voices are modulated with a Hammond organ; &quot;Mantra&quot; (1970), where the sounds from two pianos are routed through ring modulators; and &quot;Licht-Bilder&quot; (2002) from &quot;Sonntag aus Licht&quot; (2003), which ring-modulates flute and trumpet. Other Stockhausen pieces employing ring modulation include &quot;Kontakte&quot; (1960), &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot; (1964), &quot;Hymnen&quot; (1969), &quot;Prozession&quot; (1967), and &quot;Kurzwellen&quot; (1968).

A ring-modulator was the major component used in Louis and Bebe Barron&#x27;s music for the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956). One of the best-known applications of the ring modulator may be its use by Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to produce the distinctive voice of the Daleks in the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, starting in 1963.

One of the first products dedicated for music was the &quot;Bode Ring Modulator&quot; developed in 1961 by Harald Bode. Also in 1964 he developed the &quot;Bode Frequency Shifter,&quot; which produced a clearer sound by eliminating a side band. These devices were designed to be controlled by voltage, compatible with modular synthesizer architecture also advocated by him, and these modules were licensed to R.A. Moog for their Moog modular synthesizers started in 1963–1964. In 1963, Don Buchla included an optional ring modulator in his first modular synthesizer, the Model 100. Also Tom Oberheim built a ring modulator unit for his musician friend in the late 1960s, and it became an origin of Oberheim Electronics &quot;Music Modulator&quot; and &quot;Maestro Ring Modulator&quot;, one of the earliest ring modulator effect products for guitarists. The EMS VCS3, Synthi A, ARP 2600, Odyssey, Rhodes Chroma and Yamaha CS-80 synthesizers also featured built-in ring modulators.

John McLaughlin employs the ring modulator heavily in the 1974 Mahavishnu Orchestra album &quot;Visions of the Emerald Beyond&quot;, especially on the track &quot;On the Way Home to Earth&quot;. On Miles Davis&#x27; 1975 live album &quot;Agharta&quot;, guitarist Pete Cosey ran the sounds he played through a ring modulator. Deep Purple&#x27;s Jon Lord fed the signal from his Hammond through a Gibson Ring Modulator unit live on stage, which he described in 1989. Founding member of Hawkwind, Dik Mik, a self-confessed non-musician, used a ring modulator as his main instrument during his time with the band (1969-1973).

Vangelis used a ring modulator with his Yamaha CS-80 to improvise his 1978 avant-garde-experimental album &quot;Beaubourg&quot;. The music on the album is often atonal, with the ring modulator converting the synthesizer&#x27;s sound into complex metallic timbres. It remains the most experimental released work by the artist, with reviewers calling it &quot;difficult listening at best&quot;.

Ring modulation is used in the piece &quot;Ofanim&quot; (1988/1997) by Luciano Berio, and in the first section is applied to a child&#x27;s voice and a clarinet: &quot;The transformation of the child voice into a clarinet was desired. For this purpose, a pitch detector computes the instantaneous frequency formula_21 of the voice. Then the child voice passes through a ring modulator, where the frequency of the carrier formula_8 is set to formula_23. In this case odd harmonics prevail which is similar to the sound of a clarinet in the low register.&quot;

=== Analogue telephone systems ===
An early application of the ring modulator was for combining multiple analog telephone voice channels into a single wideband signal to be carried on a single cable using frequency-division multiplexing. A ring modulator in combination with carrier wave and filter was used to assign channels to different frequencies.

Early attempts at securing analog telephone channels used ring modulators to modify the spectrum of the audio speech signals. One application is spectral inversion, typically of speech; a carrier frequency is chosen to be above the highest speech frequencies (which are low-pass filtered at, say, 3 kHz, for a carrier of perhaps 3.3 kHz), and the sum frequencies from the modulator are removed by more low-pass filtering. The remaining difference frequencies have an inverted spectrum: high frequencies become low, and vice versa.

<doc id="275873" wikidata="Q7832904" url="?curid=275873" title="Train robbery">
<text>Since the invention of locomotives in the early 19th century, trains have often been the target of robbery, in which the goal is to steal money or other valuables. Train robbery was especially common during the 19th century and is commonly associated with gangs of outlaws in the American Old West. It has continued into the 21st century, with criminals usually targeting freight trains carrying commercial cargo, or targeting passengers of public transportation for their valuables.

==History==
===Background===
Prior to the development of railroads, stagecoach robbery was common. Especially in Europe and North America, stagecoaches and mail couriers were frequently targeted for their cargo. As coaches and horses were phased out in favor of trains, which could haul far more freight and passengers, so too did robbers adjust their targets.

===Victorian England===
Several major train robberies occurred in England in the mid-19th century. The Great Western Mail Robbery occurred in 1849. In two robberies on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, two passengers climbed from their carriage to the mail van and back. They were discovered at Bridgwater after the second robbery. One was Henry Poole, a former guard on the Great Western Railway, dismissed for misconduct (possibly on suspicion of another robbery); the other was Edward Nightingale, the son of George Nightingale, accused, but acquitted, of robbing the Dover mail coach in 1826, when two thieves had dressed in identical clothes to gain an alibi for the other. They were transported for 15 years. Henry was sent to Bermuda on the Sir Robert Seppings (ship) in December 1850 whilst Edward was transported to Fremantle on the Sea Park in January 1854.

On May 15, 1855, a train carrying gold departed London, England, for Boulogne, France, and was found upon arrival to be missing over £12,000 worth of gold and money. The incident became known as the Great Gold Robbery of 1855. Four men were arrested in 1856 for the crime.

===American Old West===
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, train robberies were frequent in the American Old West, where trains carrying valuable cargo, like payroll shipments, were a frequent target. These shipments would be guarded by an expressman whose duty was to protect the cargo of the &quot;express car&quot;. Changing social and economic situations after the American Civil War led to the development of gangs and individuals who took up train robbery as a means of income. After the war, many soldiers were faced with little economic opportunity upon returning home, and train robbing required little specialized skill. Other robbers held the railroad companies in contempt, particularly those from the Midwest and West. The first post-Civil War robberies occurred in Indiana; Wells Fargo and American Express Company cars carrying money and other expensive materials were common targets.

Initially, trains were perceived to be largely impenetrable—especially when compared with the earlier stagecoach—and were often unguarded or only lightly guarded. Early trains passed through large stretches of rural landscape with little to no communication available, leaving them vulnerable to attack and hindering investigation and response by law enforcement. Early bandits were rarely caught. The sensationalization of these crimes in newspapers, dime novels, and Wild West shows added to the appeal for copycat and repeat crimes.

Infamous train robbers from this era include Butch Cassidy, Bill Miner, and Jesse James. Jesse James is mistakenly thought to have completed the first successful train robbery in the American West when on July 21, 1873, the James–Younger Gang took US$3,000 from a Rock Island Railroad train after derailing it southwest of the town of Adair, Iowa. However, the first peacetime train robbery in the United States occurred on October 6, 1866, when robbers boarded an Ohio &amp; Mississippi train shortly after it left Seymour, Indiana. They broke into one safe and tipped the other off the train before jumping off. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency later traced the crime to the Reno Gang. There was one earlier train robbery in May 1865, but because it was committed by armed guerrillas and occurred shortly after the end of the Civil War, it is not considered to be the first train robbery in the United States.

Train robberies peaked in the 1890s. Although they occurred in a wide variety of states, California, Missouri, Texas, and Oklahoma recorded the highest numbers. Notable robberies during this period include the Union Pacific Big Springs robbery in 1877, the Canyon Diablo Train Robbery in 1889, the Fairbank Train Robbery in 1900, and the Baxter&#x27;s Curve Train Robbery in 1912.

Several factors contributed to the decline of train robberies around the turn of the 20th century and the decades following, although they did not stop entirely. Ruddell and Decker (2017) write, &quot;train robberies were eliminated, in large part, due to making targets less attractive, increasing guardianship, and reducing offender motivation or in other words taking routine precaution&quot;. Law enforcement agencies and railroad companies, which once struggled to investigate crimes and arrest perpetrators, began creating or recruiting specialized task forces, such as the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. These bodies relentlessly pursued offenders, often for years, and imposed harsher sentences, which deterred further crime. Railroad companies spent more than they lost from the robberies on investigating and preventing thefts; &quot;that for every dollar that was stolen in a train robbery, five dollars were spent on apprehending offenders&quot;. Trains also became faster and thus more difficult to board. Wireless communications spread and the population and law enforcement presence in once-sparse areas grew, making crime reporting and response much faster. The first train robbery to be reported by telephone occurred in 1907.

In 1923, what would later be dubbed the &quot;Last Great Train Robbery&quot;, the DeAutremont Brothers targeted a Southern Pacific Railroad carrying mail. The would-be robbers attempted to breach the mail car using dynamite but accidentally used too much, causing a large explosion that destroyed the targeted goods; ultimately, four people died in the attack. Southern Pacific and the Pinkertons pursued the gang for years and distributed 3.5 million leaflets worldwide for information, eventually apprehending the members. Train robbery had become obsolete by the 1930s in the United States, and many criminals began instead targeting banks.

The outlaw culture in the American Old West became romanticized in Hollywood&#x27;s Western films, such as &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; in 1903. Some serial train robbers, like William L. Carlisle, became folk heroes.

===20th century===

Train robbery saw a marked decline as the 20th century progressed, although isolated incidents still occurred. Train robberies outside the United States were not as common before the mid-20th century; additionally, many robberies in Canada and Mexico during that time were perpetrated by American outlaws. Examples of 20th-century robberies outside of the US include the 1906 Rogów raid in Poland; the 1908 Bezdany raid in Lithuania; the 1923 Lincheng Outrage in China; the 1925 Kakori Train Robbery in India; and the 1976 Sallins Train robbery in Ireland.

Some countries were an exception to this rule. Egypt, then a British colony, struggled with an epidemic of train robberies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time, Egypt had high rates of poverty and social inequality, leading some citizens to turn to crime; some of these were underpaid train employees. An unorganized and ill-equipped police force hampered efforts to resolve cases; during this time, only about 17% of train robbers were apprehended. Some gangs were sheltered by local residents, and in turn gangs often used their profits to support their communities. Most cases occurred in Gharbia Governorate, Beheira Governorate, and Cairo and Giza. Egypt established its Railway Police force in 1893, and this, combined with new advances in security and forensic technology led to the gradual decrease of train robberies after 1904.
The Great Train Robbery of 1963, the UK&#x27;s most infamous occurrence, occurred in Buckinghamshire in 1963. On April 8, a group of robbers targeted a Post Office train en route from Glasgow to London and stole over £2.3 million in parcels. Apprehended members of the gang were sentenced to a collective total of 307 years imprisonment.

===21st century===
Modern train robbery still exists, although it no longer resembles the mythos set by Hollywood Westerns. Thieves often target train cars carrying cargo for large corporations, such as Walmart and Amazon; and are most interested in commercial goods, particularly electronics, or raw industrial materials like metals and textiles. In the United States, the Los Angeles Basin is the most common spot for freight to be stolen en route. Other hotspots include areas near large depots, like Detroit, Chicago, and Memphis.

In Mexico in 2011, train theft had increased by 120% from the previous year. Railroads in the south-central part of the country, such as Zacatecas, Veracruz, Puebla, and Guanajuato, are at the highest risk. The area around Acultzingo has the highest rate of train robberies, recording 521 in 2017–2018 alone.

A string of train robberies in India have targeted both cargo and passengers. On August 9, 2016, a group of robbers drilled a hole into the roof of a secure car aboard the Chennai–Salem Express and stole ₹57.8 million ($860,000; £570,000). The train had been transporting ₹342 crore from the Indian Overseas Bank to the Reserve Bank of India in Chennai. The Indian media dubbed it &quot;the great train robbery&quot;. Eight arrests were made in 2018 in connection with the heist. Since 2023, several instances of armed dacoits boarding trains and robbing money, mobile phones, and valuables from passengers have been reported aboard Indian passenger trains. Multiple people have been injured in these attacks.

In 2021, train robberies in Los Angeles resulted in hundreds of discarded packages being strewn across the tracks. Trains were targeted on a section of tracks that they must slow down on and that are easy to access. Thieves used bolt cutters to cut open the locks on shipping containers and took the packages inside. The dropped packages were then picked over by thieves as well as passerby. Union Pacific estimated that losses were in the millions from all the stolen merchandise. By late 2021, an average of 90 containers were broken into daily. The Los Angeles Police Department assembled the Train Burglary Task Force in response to the robberies.

==Methods==
The nature of train robbery varies. Cargo can be stolen from either a moving or stationary train in a variety of ways. Perpetrators of train robberies may work alone or in groups and might be committed by gangs or other organized crime. Sometimes, gangs might recruit local residents to partake in the robbery. Goods are often stolen from unattended train cars and in transitional areas like rail yards, parking lots, and warehouses. Thieves might sabotage the train itself and bypass security measures, either causing it to drop cargo, creating a distraction, or triggering an emergency stop, thereby creating an easier method of boarding the train. Sometimes, thieves will climb onto the train and pass or spill cargo onto the ground below, where packages can be retrieved.

However, as was much more common historically but is still done today, robbers sometimes use more violent means of breaching a train. Some will obstruct or sabotage the railroad itself in an attempt to derail a moving train. Some use dynamite to damage the rails or train itself to gain entry.

Before the invention of dynamite, it was almost impossible to break into safes. Criminals required the combination lock to open safes and often relied on the courier to provide it. Following its invention and widespread use, it became much easier to break into safes and rob trains. Criminals sometimes robbed passengers of the train&#x27;s carriages at , stealing their jewelry or currency.

Contrary to the method romanticized by Hollywood, outlaws in the American Old West were never known to jump from horseback onto a moving train. Usually, they would either board the train normally and wait for a good time to initiate the heist, or they would stop or derail the train and then begin the holdup.

==Effects==
Train theft results in significant financial and commercial losses. As e-commerce has increased demand for large quantities of goods to be transported even longer distances, and as trains create fewer emissions than cargo trucks, the size of trains has also increased. Ferromex, Mexico&#x27;s largest railroad company, reported that its carload volume had increased by 6.6% in 2011.

Financial losses to train robbery are difficult to calculate and vary from one crime to another. Robberies during the American Old West period resulted in an average loss of $9,980 per crime. In 2006, 11,711 train robberies in China were reported, with losses totalling ¥41.7 million ($6.8 million).

Sometimes, train drivers do not realize a car has been breached, and packages may continue to fall from the train, causing more loss as cargo is damaged by the fall or the train&#x27;s wheels. Train derailment, caused either directly or indirectly, is also frequent. One such derailment in China caused a pileup in a railway tunnel that cost ¥3 million to clear, and millions more in indirect costs and loss of income. Additionally, packages or debris falling from a train can damage surrounding infrastructure. In one case in China, sheet metal being thrown from a train by robbers damaged nearby power lines, causing a blackout.

===Humanitarian cost===

Especially during the early decades of train robbery, violence against train staff and passengers, both directly and indirectly, was common. A 2017 review of 241 train robberies in the United States between 1866 and 1930 found that 91% were committed at gunpoint, 28% used dynamite, 29% resulted in shootings, 13.5% led to deaths, and 7.5% included derailments. One 1896 train derailment caused by robbers resulted in the deaths of about 27 passengers. Such violence only added to the high mortality rate of railroad employees, which during the first decades of operation averaged about 12,000 deaths annually. Additionally, perpetrator death was high; in almost 10% of cases, robbers died at the scene or during apprehension. Others were later executed, lynched, or died by suicide.

Today, violence against train employees is rare, and the majority of robberies on freight trains are nonviolent, as robbers prefer to avoid confrontation in most cases. However, passengers aboard carrier trains generally still fear being victimized. A 2024 study on Swedish rail safety reported 19% of surveyed passengers feared robbery while on or waiting for a train.

==Investigation and prevention==
Railroad companies have long hired private security agencies to protect cargo during transport, or even establish their own internal police forces to patrol railroads. They may also hire private detectives to investigate and deter theft. In the early decades of train robbery, sheriffs would often recruit vigilante posses of citizens to apprehend perpetrators. Of the robberies during 1965–1930 studied by Ruddell and Decker, up to 90% of all train robbers were eventually caught. Those who survived the arrest—30% died during the confrontation—were sentenced to prison and sometimes faced capital punishment or were lynched.

In response to increased cargo train traffic, the Mexican federal government made train robbery a federal crime. China has its own railway police force, which in 2013 employed approximately 80,000 officers. Chinese cargo trains transporting electronics are usually accompanied by armed guards.

Several preventative measures are taken to deter and complicate robberies. These include increased security, target hardening, heavier punishments for convicted criminals, and collaboration with different law enforcement bodies. New technology, such as motion sensors, cameras, anti-theft doors, GPS, and smart seals are all used to deter theft.

===In Westerns===

Train robberies are a common depiction in Western films and media. The first movie to depict a train robbery was the 1903 silent film &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, produced by Edison Studios. This 11-minute film depicts a gang of outlaws who rob a train, only to later be hunted down by vigilantes and killed in a shootout. &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; is credited with popularizing and setting a narrative standard for the enture Western film genre. Since then, dozens of Westerns have depicted train robberies, including:
* &quot;The Great K &amp; A Train Robbery&quot; (1926)
* &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), based on the life of the titular character

<text>A railway signal is a visual display device that conveys instructions or provides warning of instructions regarding the driver&#x27;s authority to proceed. The driver interprets the signal&#x27;s indication and acts accordingly. Typically, a signal might inform the driver of the speed at which the train may safely proceed or it may instruct the driver to stop.

== Application and positioning of signals ==

Originally, signals displayed simple stop or proceed indications. As traffic density increased, this proved to be too limiting and refinements were added. One such refinement was the addition of distant signals on the approach to stop signals. The distant signal gave the driver warning that they were approaching a signal which might require a stop. This allowed for an overall increase in speed, since train drivers no longer had to drive at a speed within sighting distance of the stop signal.

Under timetable and train order operation, the signals did not directly convey orders to the train crew. Instead, they directed the crew to pick up orders, possibly stopping to do so if the order warranted it.

Signals are used to indicate one or more of the following:
* That the line ahead is clear (free of any obstruction) or blocked
* That the driver has permission to proceed
* That points (also called &quot;switch&quot; or &quot;turnout&quot; in the US) are set correctly
* Which way points are set
* The speed the train may travel
* The state of the next signal
* That the train orders are to be picked up by the crew

=== Early signal systems ===


Signals can be placed:
* At the start of a section of track
* On the approach to a movable item of infrastructure, such as points or switches or a swingbridge
* In advance of other signals
* On the approach to a level crossing
* At a switch or turnout
* Ahead of platforms or other places that trains are likely to be stopped
* At train order stations

&#x27;Running lines&#x27; are usually continuously signalled. Each line of a double track railway is normally signalled in one direction only, with all signals facing the same direction on either line. Where bidirectional signalling is installed, signals face in both directions on both tracks (sometimes known as &#x27;reversible working&#x27; where lines are not normally used for bidirectional working). Signals are generally not provided for controlling movements within sidings or yard areas.

== Aspects and indications ==
Signals have &quot;aspects&quot; and &quot;indications&quot;. The &quot;aspect&quot; is the visual appearance of the signal; the &quot;indication&quot; is the meaning. In American practice the indications have conventional names, so that for instance &quot;Medium Approach&quot; means &quot;Proceed at not exceeding medium speed; be prepared to stop at next signal&quot;. Different railroads historically assigned different meanings to the same aspect, so it is common as a result of mergers to find that different divisions of a modern railroad may have different rules governing the interpretation of signal aspects. For example, stop aspect refers to any signal aspect that does not allow the driver to pass the signal. 

Signals control motion past the point at which the signal stands and into the next section of track. They may also convey information about the state of the next signal to be encountered. Signals are sometimes said to &quot;protect&quot; the points or switches, section of track, etc. that they are ahead of. The term &quot;ahead of&quot; can be confusing, so official UK practice is to use the terms &quot;in rear of&quot; and &quot;in advance of&quot;. When a train is waiting at a signal it is &quot;in rear of&quot; that signal and the danger being protected by the signal is &quot;in advance of&quot; the train and signal.

In North American practice, a distinction must be made between &quot;absolute&quot; signals, which can display a &quot;Stop&quot; (or &quot;Stop and Stay&quot;) indication, and &quot;permissive&quot; signals, which display a &quot;Stop &amp; Proceed&quot; aspect. Furthermore, a permissive signal may be marked as a &quot;Grade Signal&quot; where a train does not need to physically stop for a &quot;Stop &amp; Proceed&quot; signal, but only decelerate to a speed slow enough to stop short of any obstructions. Interlocking (&#x27;controlled&#x27;) signals are typically absolute, while automatic signals (i.e. those controlled through track occupancy alone, not by a signalman) are usually permissive.

Drivers need to be aware of which signals are automatic. In current British practice for example, automatic signals have a white rectangular plate with a black horizontal line across it. In US practice a permissive signal typically is indicated by the presence of a number plate. In the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, as well as New Zealand, a permissive signal has the lower set of lights offset (usually to the right) from the upper lights; in Victoria and New Zealand, an absolute signal displaying a red or white &quot;A&quot; light is also treated as a permissive signal. Some types of signal display separate permissive and absolute stop aspects. In Germany, the rules which apply to the respective signal are indicated by a vertical plate on the signal&#x27;s post ().

Operating rules normally specify that a signal with an abnormality, such as one with an extinguished lamp or an entirely dark signal, must be interpreted as the most restrictive aspectgenerally &quot;Stop&quot; or &quot;Stop and Proceed&quot;.

== Signal forms ==
Signals differ both in the manner in which they display aspects and in the manner in which they are mounted with respect to the track.

=== Mechanical signals ===

The oldest forms of signal displays their different indications by a part of the signal being physically moved. The earliest types comprised a board that was either turned face-on and fully visible to the driver, or rotated away so as to be practically invisible. These signals had two or at most three positions.

Semaphore signals were developed in France at the end of the 18th century, before being later adopted by the railways. The first railway semaphore was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the Brighton) at New Cross Gate, southeast London, in 1841. It was similar in form to the optical telegraphs then being replaced on land by the electric telegraph. Gregory&#x27;s installation was inspected and approved for the Board of Trade by Major-General Charles Pasley. Pasley had invented a system of optical telegraphy through semaphores in 1822 for the British military, and appears to have suggested to Gregory the application of the semaphore to railway signaling. The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as a fixed signal nearly universally. Disc signals, such as those made by the Hall Signal Company, were sometimes used, but semaphores could be read at much longer distances. The invention of the electric light, which could be made brighter than oil lamps and hence visible both by night and day, resulted in the development of position light signals and colour-light signals at the beginning of the 20th century, which gradually displaced semaphores. A few remain in modern operations in the United Kingdom.

Mechanical signals may be operated manually, connected to a lever in a signal-box, by electric motors, or hydraulically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position.

In the U.S., semaphores were employed as train order signals, with the purpose of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order, and also as simply one form of block signalling.

=== Colour light signals ===


The introduction of electric light bulbs made it possible to produce colour light signals which were bright enough to be seen during daylight, starting in 1904.

The &quot;signal head&quot; is the portion of a colour light signal which displays the aspects. To display a larger number of indications, a single signal might have multiple signal heads. Some systems used a single head coupled with auxiliary lights to modify the basic aspect.

Colour light signals come in two forms. The most prevalent form is the &quot;multi-unit&quot; type, with separate lights and lenses for each colour, in the manner of a traffic light. Hoods and shields are generally provided to shade the lights from sunlight which could cause false indications.

Searchlight signals were the most often used signal type in the U.S. until recently. In these, a single incandescent light bulb is used in each head, and either an A.C. or D.C. relay mechanism is used to move a coloured spectacle (or &quot;roundel&quot;) in front of the lamp. In this manner, gravity (fail safe) returns the red roundel into the lamp&#x27;s optical path. In effect, this mechanism is very similar to the colour light signal that is included in an electrically operated semaphore signal, except that the omission of the semaphore arm allows the roundels to be miniaturized and enclosed in a weatherproof housing. Widely used in the U.S. from World War II onward, searchlight signals have the disadvantage of having moving parts which may be deliberately tampered with. This had led to them becoming less common during the last fifteen to twenty years when vandalism began to render them vulnerable to false indications.

However, in some other countries, such as on the Italian railways (FS) as from the &quot;Regolamento Segnali&quot;, they are still the standard colour light signal albeit with new installations being as outlined below.

More recently, clusters of LEDs have started to be used in place of the incandescent lamps, reflectors and lenses. These use less power and have a purported working life of ten years, but this may not in reality be the case.

Operating rules generally dictate that a dark signal be interpreted as giving the most restrictive indication it can display (generally &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;stop and proceed&quot;). Many colour light systems have circuitry to detect such failures in lamps or mechanism.

=== Position light signals ===
A position light signal is one where the position of the lights, rather than their colour, determines the meaning. The aspect consists solely of a pattern of illuminated lights, which are all of the same colour. In many countries, small position light signals are used as shunting signals, while the main signals are of colour light form. Also, many tramway systems (such as the Metro of Wolverhampton) use position light signals.

=== Colour-position signals ===
A system combining aspects of the colour and position systems was developed on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) in 1920 and was patented by L.F. Loree and F.P. Patenall. It is similar to the position light system with the central light removed and the resulting pairs of lights colored in correspondence to the angle they make: green for the vertical pair, amber for the right diagonal pair, and red for the horizontal pair. An additional pair, colored &quot;lunar white&quot;, may be added on the other diagonal for restricting indications. Speed signalling is indicated not by additional signal heads, but by a system of white or amber &quot;orbital&quot; lights placed in one of six positions above and below the main head. The position above or below indicates the current speed, while the left-to-right position indicates the speed at the next signal (full, medium, or slow in both cases). Dwarf signals have the same aspects as full-sized signals. One of the advantages claimed for the system is that burned-out bulbs produce aspects which can be interpreted unambiguously as either the intended indication (for the main head) or as a more restrictive indication (for the orbitals—if only the central head is lit, the indication is either slow or restricting).

Colour position lights (CPLs) were first installed as a pilot on the Staten Island Railway in New York City, at the time a B&amp;O subsidiary; they were also applied to the Chicago and Alton Railroad when the latter was under B&amp;O control, as well as on the B&amp;O itself. With the disappearance of the B&amp;O into CSX they have been gradually replaced with NORAC color light signals.

== Signal mounting ==
Lineside signals need to be mounted in proximity to the track which they control.

=== Post mounting ===
When a single track is involved, the signal is normally mounted on a &quot;post&quot; or &quot;mast&quot; which displays the arm or signal head at some height above the track, in order to allow it to be seen at a distance. The signal is normally placed on the engine driver&#x27;s side of the track.

=== Gantry mounting ===
When multiple tracks are involved, or where space does not permit post mounting, other forms are found. In double track territory one may find two signals mounted side by side on a bracket which itself is mounted on a post. The left hand signal then controls the left-hand track, and the right signal the right-hand track. A &quot;gantry&quot; or &quot;signal bridge&quot; may also be used. This consists of a platform extending over the tracks; the signals are mounted on this platform over the tracks they control.

=== Ground mounting ===
In some situations or places, such as in tunnels, where there is insufficient room for a post or gantry, signals may be mounted at ground level. Such signals may be physically smaller (termed &quot;dwarf signals&quot;). Rapid transit systems commonly use only dwarf signals due to restricted space. In many systems, dwarf signals are only used to display &#x27;restrictive&#x27; aspects such as low speed or shunt aspects, and do not normally indicate &#x27;running&#x27; aspects.

=== Other ===
Occasionally, a signal may be mounted to a structure such as a retaining wall, bridge abutment, or overhead electrification support.

=== Filaments ===
Electric lamps for railway signals are often fitted with twin filaments, so that if one burns out, the other keeps the signal lit. A more complicated version of this, such as in the SL35 lamp, a filament changeover relay is fitted in series with the first filament, where if the first filament burns out, the relay drops and lights the second filament. This filament fail relay also activates an alarm in the signal box.

=== Lamp proving ===
When lamps fail, this can result in aspects that are less restrictive (high speed) than when the lamps are correctly lit. This is potentially dangerous.

For example, in UK practice, if a white &quot;feather&quot; indicator fails, the low speed feather combined with a green light, which is low speed, becomes a green light on its own, which is high speed. A lamp proving relay would detect the reduction in current when more than two lamps are not working in a failed feather indicator, and prevent the green from showing. It can also display an indication on the signaller&#x27;s panel.

Due to this possibility, most signals are configured to be failsafe.

For example, a flashing aspect can be used to display a less restrictive signal. In this case, if the relay that controls the flashing fails, the signal becomes more restricting. A flashing yellow, in Canada and the United States, is part of an &quot;advance clear to stop&quot; indication, which means the second signal ahead is &quot;stop&quot;. A solid yellow means &quot;clear to stop&quot;, which means the next signal ahead is &quot;stop&quot;.

== Control and operation of signals ==
Signals were originally controlled by levers situated at the signals, and later by levers grouped together and connected to the signal by wire cables, or pipes supported on rollers (US). Often these levers were placed in a special building, known as a signal box (UK) or interlocking tower (US), and eventually they were mechanically interlocked to prevent the display of a signal contrary to the alignment of the switch points. Automatic traffic control systems added track circuits to detect the presence of trains and alter signal aspects to reflect their presence or absence.

== Cab signalling ==
Some locomotives are equipped to display &quot;cab signals&quot;. These can display signal indications through patterns of lights in the locomotive cab, or in simple systems merely produce an audible sound to warn the driver of a restrictive aspect. Occasionally, cab signals are used by themselves, but more commonly they are used to supplement signals placed at lineside. Cab signalling is particularly useful on high speed railways. In the absence of lineside signals, fixed markers may be provided at those places where signals would otherwise exist, to mark the limit of a movement authority.

== Signalling power ==
Usually, signals and other equipment (such as track circuits and level crossing equipment), are powered from a low voltage supply. The specific voltage varies with the country and equipment used. The reason behind this is that the low voltage allows easy operation from storage batteries and indeed, in some parts of the world (and previously in many more locations, before the widespread adoption of electricity), batteries are the primary power source, as mains power may be unavailable at that location.
In urban built-up areas, the trend is now to power signal equipment directly from mains power, with batteries only as backup.

<doc id="275877" wikidata="Q910597" url="?curid=275877" title="Signalling control">
<text>On a rail transport system, signalling control is the process by which control is exercised over train movements by way of railway signals and block systems to ensure that trains operate safely, over the correct route and to the proper timetable. Signalling control was originally exercised via a decentralised network of control points that were known by a variety of names including signal box (International and British), interlocking tower (North America) and signal cabin (some railways e.g., GCR). Currently these decentralised systems are being consolidated into wide scale signalling centres or dispatch offices. Whatever the form, signalling control provides an interface between the human signal operator and the lineside signalling equipment. The technical apparatus used to control switches (points), signals and block systems is called interlocking.

== History ==

Originally, all signaling was done by mechanical means. Points and signals were operated locally from individual levers or handles, requiring the signalman to walk between the various pieces of equipment to set them in the required position for each train that passed. Before long, it was realized that control should be concentrated into one building, which came to be known as a signal box. The signal box provided a dry, climate-controlled space for the complex interlocking mechanics and also the signalman. The raised design of most signal boxes (which gave rise to the term &quot;tower&quot; in North America) also provided the signalman with a good view of the railway under his control. The first use of a signal box was by the London &amp; Croydon Railway in 1843 to control the junction to Bricklayers Arms in London.

With the practical development of electric power, the complexity of a signal box was no longer limited by the distance a mechanical lever could work a set of points or a semaphore signal via a direct physical connection (or the space required by such connections). Power-operated switch points and signaling devices greatly expanded the territory that a single control point could operate from several hundred yards to several miles. As the technology of electric relay logic was developed, it no longer became necessary for signalmen to operate control devices with any sort of mechanical logic at all. With the jump to all electronic logic, physical presence was no longer needed and the individual control points could be consolidated to increase system efficiency.

Another advancement made possible by the replacement of mechanical control by all-electric systems was that the signalman&#x27;s user interface could be enhanced to further improve productivity. The smaller size of electric toggles and push buttons put more functionality within reach of an individual signalman. Route-setting technology automated the setting of individual points and routes through busy junctions. Computerized video displays removed the physical interface altogether, replacing it with a point-and-click or touchscreen interface. Finally, the use of Automatic Route Setting removed the need for any human input at all as common train movements could be fully automated according to a schedule or other scripted logic.

Signal boxes also served as important communications hubs, connecting the disparate parts of a rail line and linking them together to allow the safe passage of trains. The first signaling systems were made possible by technology like the telegraph and block instrument that allowed adjacent signal boxes to communicate the status of a section of track. Later, the telephone put centralized dispatchers in contact with distant signal boxes, and radio even allowed direct communication with the trains themselves. The ultimate ability for data to be transmitted over long distances has proven the demise of most local control signal boxes. Signalmen next to the track are no longer needed to serve as the eyes and ears of the signaling system. Track circuits transmit train locations to distant control centers and data links allow direct manipulation of the points and signals.

While some railway systems have more signal boxes than others, most future signaling projects will result in increasing amounts of centralized control relegating the lineside signal box to niche or heritage applications.

== Naming ==
In any node-based control system, proper identification is critical to ensuring that messages are properly received by their intended recipients. As such, signaling control points are provided with names or identifiers that minimize the likelihood of confusion during communications. Popular naming techniques include using nearby geographic references, line milepost numbers, sequence numbers, and identification codes. Geographic names can refer to a municipality or neighborhood, a nearby road or geographic feature, local landmarks, and industry that may provide the railway with traffic or railway features like yards, sidings, or junctions.

On systems where Morse code was in use it was common to assign control locations short identification codes to aid in efficient communication, although wherever signalling control locations are more numerous than mileposts, sequence numbers and codes are more likely to be employed. Entire rail systems or political areas may adopt a common naming convention. In Central Europe, for example, signalling control points were all issued regionally unique location codes based roughly on the point&#x27;s location and function, while the American state of Texas sequentially numbered all interlockings for regulatory purposes.

As signaling control centers are consolidated it can become necessary to differentiate between older style boxes and newer train control centers, where signalmen may have different duties and responsibilities. Moreover, the name of the signaling center itself may not be employed operationally in preference to the name of individual signaling workstations. This is especially true when signaling centers control large amounts of territory spanning many diverse lines and geographical regions.

In most cases where the control locations are still in the field adjacent to railway tracks, the name or code of the control point is plainly labeled on the side of the signal box structure as an extra visual reminder to the train operators where they are. Moreover, wayside signals may also be equipped with identification plates that directly or indirectly indicate who controls that signal and that stretch of the line.

== Control apparatus ==

For more information, see also Interlocking.

=== Lever frame ===
The earliest signal boxes housed mechanical lever frames. The frame was usually mounted on a beam beneath the operating floor. Interlocking was attached to the levers, which ensured that signals showed the correct indication concerning the points and were operated in the right order. Wires or rods, connected at one end to the signals and points and the other to levers in the signal box, ran alongside the railway.

In many countries, levers are painted according to their function, e.g. red for stop signals and black for points, and are usually numbered, from left to right, for identification. In most cases, a diagram of the track and signaling layout is mounted above the lever frame, showing the relevant lever numbers adjacent to the signals and points.

Hand-powered interlockings were referred to as &#x27;Armstrongs&#x27; and hand throws in the United States.

Power frames have miniature levers and control the signals and points electrically. In some cases, the interlocking was still done mechanically, but in others, electric lever locks were used.

In a few cases, signals and points were operated pneumatically upon operation of the appropriate lever or slide.

=== Control panel ===

In a signal box with a control panel, the levers are replaced by buttons or switches, usually appropriately positioned directly onto the track diagram. These buttons or switches are interfaced with an electrical or electronic interlocking. In the UK, control panels are of the following types:

;Individual function switch (IFS)
:A separate button/switch is provided for each signal and each set of points. This type of panel is operated similarly to a lever frame. The signalman must move each set of points to the desired position before operating the switch or button of the signal reading over them.

:This type of panel needs the least complex circuitry but is not suited to controlling large or busy areas.

;One control switch (OCS)
:A separate switch/button is provided for every signaled route. There will be as many switches/buttons per signal as there are routes (i.e. signaled destinations) from that signal. To set the desired route, the relevant switch or button is operated. All points within the route are automatically set to the required position.

:Individual points switches are provided, but they are normally left in the central position, which allows the points to be automatically set by the action of setting a route.

;Entrance-exit (NX)
:This type of panel has one switch/button provided for every signal (except that some panels have separate &#x27;entrance&#x27; and &#x27;exit&#x27; devices). To set a route, the signalman operates the device for the &#x27;entrance&#x27; signal, followed by the device for the &#x27;exit&#x27; (destination) signal. All points within the route are automatically set to the required position and, provided all the points are detected by the interlocking in the correct position, the entrance signal will clear.

:Individual points switches are provided, but they are normally left in the central position, which allows the points to be automatically set to the normal or reverse position by the action of setting a route.

Similar principles of operation as described above are applicable throughout the world.

=== Video display unit ===

Modern signal boxes tend to be provided with VDU based, or similar, control systems. These systems are less expensive to build and easier to alter than a traditional panel. In the UK, large modern signal boxes are typical of the Integrated Electronic Control Centre type, or, more recently, of the Rail Operating Centre variety. Variations of these control systems are used throughout the world.

== Present day ==
While rare, some traditional signal boxes can still be found. Some still control mechanical points and signals, although in many cases, the lever frame has been removed or is out of use, and a control panel or VDU has been installed. Most modern countries have little, if any, mechanical signalling remaining on the rail system. Both in the UK and Ireland, however, mechanical signalling is still relatively common away from the busiest lines; in Europe, there is also a considerable amount in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Traditional signal boxes can be found on many heritage railways.

The modern control centre has largely replaced widespread signal cabins. These centres, usually located near main railway stations, control the track network electrically or electronically.

<doc id="275880" wikidata="Q104668131" url="?curid=275880" title="Nasdaq Nordic">
<text>Nasdaq Nordic is the common name for the subsidiaries of Nasdaq, Inc. that provide financial services and operate marketplaces for securities in the Nordic and Baltic regions of Europe.

Historically, the operations were known by the company name &quot;OMX AB&quot; (&quot;Aktiebolaget Optionsmäklarna&quot;/Helsinki Stock E&quot;x&quot;change), created in 2003 with the merger between &quot;OM AB&quot; and &quot;HEX plc&quot;. In 2015, the legal entity OMX AB was renamed Nasdaq AB, but it also operates under the name &quot;Nasdaq OMX AB&quot;. The operations have been part of Nasdaq, Inc. (formerly known as &quot;Nasdaq OMX Group&quot;) since February 2008. 

On 23 August 2023, the company formed EuroCTP as a joint venture with 13 other bourses, in an effort to provide a consolidated tape for the European Union, as part of the Capital Markets Union proposed by the European Commission.

==History==
===Origins===
OM AB (&quot;Optionsmäklarna&quot;) was a futures exchange founded by Olof Stenhammar in the 1980s to introduce trading in standardized option contracts in Sweden. OM acquired the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1998 and unsuccessfully attempted acquisition of the London Stock Exchange in 2001. During the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, OM, together with investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, launched a virtual European stock exchange called Jiway. The project was not successful and was cancelled on 14 October 2002.

===Acquisition of other exchanges===
On 3 September 2003, the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) merged with OM and the joint company became OM HEX. On 31 August 2004, the company name was changed to OMX. OMX then acquired the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in January 2005 for €164 million. On 19 September 2006, Iceland Stock Exchange owner Eignarhaldsfelagid Verdbrefathing (EV) announced it would be acquired by OMX in a deal valuing the company at 250 million SEK. The transaction was completed by the end of the year.

The company took a 10% stake in Oslo Børs Holding ASA, the owner of the Oslo Stock Exchange in October 2006. As of September 2016, Nasdaq is not a major shareholder in the Oslo Stock Exchange holding company, which following a merger is currently called &quot;Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA&quot;. Nasdaq has, however, publicly stated its interest in eventually acquiring the Oslo Stock Exchange.

In November 2007, OMX acquired the Armenian Stock Exchange and the Central Depository of Armenia.

===Expansion of offerings===
In December 2005, OMX started First North, an alternative exchange for smaller companies, in Denmark. The First North exchange expanded to Stockholm in June 2006, Iceland in January 2007 and Helsinki in April 2007. The Markets Technology division of Computershare was acquired in 2006. The acquisition greatly expanded its product offerings and made its client list the largest of all trading system technology providers.

On 2 October 2006, the group launched a virtual Nordic Stock Exchange after merging the individual lists of shares traded at its three wholly owned Nordic exchanges into a combined Nordic List. Companies listed on the Iceland Stock Exchange have also since been merged into the list. OMX also launched a pan-regional benchmark index known as the OMX Nordic 40 on the same date; however, the individual exchanges also retained their own national benchmark indices.

===NASDAQ takeover===

On 25 May 2007, NASDAQ agreed to buy OMX for US$3.7 billion. In August, however, Borse Dubai offered US$4 billion, prompting speculation of a bidding war. On 20 September 2007, Borse Dubai agreed to stop competing to buy OMX in return for a 20% stake and 5 percent of votes in NASDAQ, as well as NASDAQ&#x27;s then-28% stake in the London Stock Exchange. In a complex transaction, Borse Dubai acquired 97.2% of OMX&#x27;s outstanding shares before selling them to NASDAQ. The newly merged company was renamed the NASDAQ OMX Group upon completion of the deal on 27 February 2008.

<doc id="275881" wikidata="Q765583" url="?curid=275881" title="Officine Meccaniche">
<text>Officine Meccaniche or OM was an Italian car and truck manufacturing company. It was founded in 1899 in Milan as Società Anonima Officine Meccaniche to manufacture railway rolling stock and car production began in 1918. It disappeared as such in 1975, subsumed into Iveco, but still exists as a forklift builder.

==Origins==
The inception of the company resulted from the merger of two companies, Grondona Comi &amp; C and Miani Silvestri &amp; C in 1899. Originally, OM manufactured railway stock. Car production started in 1918, using the plant of the former Brixia-Zust (Brixia-Züst), just after OM took over Zust car company of Brescia, Northern Italy. The first OM car, the Tipo S305, was derived from an old Zust model. It appeared in 1918, fitted with a inline four-cylinder, side-valve engine.

==The OM cars era==
Further models were the Tipo 465, with a , in 1919, joined by the Tipo 467 () and Tipo 469 () in 1921. The model names reflected the number of cylinders (4) and the bore of the engines: . 1923 saw a new model, with an engine derived from the earlier four-cylinder models, the Tipo 665 &#x27;Superba&#x27; with a six-cylinder engine. This model was extremely successful in racing, winning top five positions in the class in 1925 and 1926 at the Le Mans but its greatest achievement was the victory in the first Mille Miglia race in 1927 where Ferdinando Minoia and Giuseppe Morandi led home an OM &#x27;1-2-3&#x27; finish at an average speed of for 21 hours 4 minutes 48 seconds. Some cars were equipped with Roots superchargers, while later models were bored and stroked to 2.2 and 2.4 litres - without changing the model name, however.

In 1925 OM began to build trucks and buses, using licensed Swiss Saurer engines and other mechanical components. Ties with Saurer persisted through all of OM&#x27;s history. Passenger car production began to taper off, with some sources stating that production ended in 1932, with existing stocks sold for another couple of years. In total, 7,500 OM automobiles were built in about fifteen years. After passenger car had effectively ended, OM still displayed one last model: in 1934 the OMV, also called the Alcyone made the car show circuit. Equipped with hydraulic brakes, a full synchromesh transmission, and an engine with overhead exhaust valves, it never reached production.

==Fiat take-over and post-war years==
OM was taken over by the Fiat Group in 1933 and the following year passenger car sales definitely ceased; OM became strictly a commercial vehicle and train parts manufacturer.

The main new product in the post-WWII era was the Leoncino (1950) a light truck in the range, which was an immediate success. It became the forefather of several series of heavier but structurally similar models, namely Tigrotto, Tigre, Lupetto, Cerbiatto and Daino, launched between 1957 and 1964. Bus chassis versions of several of these models were also available. After having been subsumed into Fiat, the lighter models were replaced by the beginning in 1967.

OM also built a heavier range of trucks, starting with the post-war Orione. This was succeeded by the Super Orione in 1955 and by the in 1961. The latter was capable of pulling as a tractor or on the 6x4 truck chassis. Its , six-cylinder turbo-diesel engine produced , making it the most powerful road-going European truck in the early 1960s. The Titano was discontinued in 1968 and effectively replaced by Fiat&#x27;s heavier trucks, the Fiat 619 and the . As with the lighter duty models, bus versions were also available of the Titano, called the &quot;Titano P.&quot;

In the 60s and 70s the light and medium-weight OM truck ranges were sold in Switzerland as Saurer-OM or Berna-OM, in Austria as Steyr-OM, in France as Unic-OM, and in Germany as Büssing-OM.

==The end of OM==
In 1968 OM was definitively merged into the Fiat Group as a brand belonging to the Commercial Vehicles division, which also included Fiat and Unic.

In 1975 it was absorbed (as part of the Fiat Group) into IVECO and the OM brand disappeared from the truck and bus markets, although it still survives as an independent forklift manufacturer.

<doc id="275882" wikidata="Q191796" url="?curid=275882" title="Cameo appearance">
<text>A cameo appearance, also called a cameo role and often shortened to just cameo (), is a brief guest appearance of a well-known person or character in a work of the performing arts. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake) or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by celebrities, film directors, politicians, athletes or musicians are common. A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo role as well, such as director Alfred Hitchcock who made frequent cameo appearances in his films.

==Concept==
Originally, in the 1920s, a &quot;cameo role&quot; meant &quot;a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; connects this with the meaning &quot;a short literary sketch or portrait&quot;, which is based on the literal meaning of &quot;cameo&quot;, a miniature carving on a gemstone. More recently, in the late 20th century, a &quot;cameo&quot; has come to refer to any short appearance as a character.
Cameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity&#x27;s stature and the film or television series in which they are appearing. Many are publicity stunts. Others are acknowledgements of an actor&#x27;s contribution to an earlier work, as in the case of many film adaptations of television series, or of remakes of earlier films. Others honour artists or celebrities known for work in a particular field, such as comic book writer Stan Lee, who made appearances in every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie up to &quot;.&quot;

Cameos also occur in novels and other literary works. &quot;Literary cameos&quot; usually involve an established character from another work who makes a brief appearance to establish a shared universe setting, to make a point, or to offer homage. Balzac often employed this practice, as in his &quot;Comédie humaine&quot;. Sometimes a cameo features a historical person who &quot;drops in&quot; on fictional characters in a historical novel, as when Benjamin Franklin shares a beer with Phillipe Charboneau in &quot;The Bastard&quot; by John Jakes.

A cameo appearance can be made by the author of a work to put a sort of personal &quot;signature&quot; on a story. Vladimir Nabokov often put himself in his novels, for instance as the very minor character Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of his name) in &quot;Lolita&quot;.
Cameos are also a tradition of the Muppets&#x27; many projects over the years.

===Film directors===
Alfred Hitchcock is known for his frequent cameos in his movies, as early as in his third film &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1927). In &quot;Lifeboat&quot;, as the action was restricted to the titular lifeboat, Hitchcock appeared in a newspaper ad.

Quentin Tarantino provides brief cameos or small roles in all his movies.

Likewise, Peter Jackson has made brief cameos in all of his movies, except for his first feature-length film &quot;Bad Taste&quot; in which he played a main character, as well as &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;, though a portrait of him appears in the film. For example, he played a peasant eating a carrot in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, a warrior of Rohan in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and a Corsair of Umbar boatswain in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. All four were non-speaking &quot;blink and you miss him&quot; appearances, although in the Extended Release version of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, his character was given more screen time and his reprise of the carrot eating peasant in &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot; was featured in the foreground in reference to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. In addition, when he was directing &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (1994), he appeared as a person bumping who is kissed by one the main characters, and in the &quot;Frighteners&quot;, Jackson appeared as a man with piercings.
Director Tim Burton briefly appears in his films. He made a short appearance as a street thug who confronts Pee-wee in the back alley in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, and a visitor at the fair in Blackpool who gets a skeleton thrown at him in &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot;.

Director Martin Scorsese appears in the background of his films as a bystander or an unseen character. In &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot; (1967), he played one of the gangsters; he was a lighting crewman in &quot;After Hours&quot; and a passenger in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. He opened up his film &quot;The Color of Money&quot; with a monologue on the art of playing pool. In addition, he appeared with his wife and daughter as wealthy New Yorkers in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, and as a theatre-goer and can be heard as a movie projectionist in &quot;The Aviator&quot;. He also appeared in his 2023 work &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;, in a minor role as a radio drama narrator.

In a same way, Roman Polanski appeared as a hired hoodlum in his film &quot;Chinatown&quot;, slitting Jack Nicholson&#x27;s nose with the blade of his clasp knife.

F. Gary Gray has made many appearances in the films he has directed including &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Set It Off&quot;, &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;, and &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.

In addition to George Lucas&#x27;s cameo in Revenge of the Sith, his children were cast in a number of cameo roles across the Star Wars prequels. Amanda and Katie Lucas both had cameo roles as three different characters each across The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith (in addition to Amanda&#x27;s voicing a fourth character), and Jett Lucas has two cameo roles for different characters in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.

===Actors and writers===
Directors sometimes cast well-known lead actors with whom they have worked in the past in other films. In &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943), Elizabeth Taylor makes a cameo appearance as Helen Burns, Jane&#x27;s friend from school who dies from a cold. Mike Todd&#x27;s film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) was filled with cameo roles: John Gielgud as an English butler, Frank Sinatra playing piano in a saloon, and others. The stars in cameo roles were pictured in oval insets in posters for the film, and gave the term wide circulation outside the theatrical profession.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), an &quot;epic comedy&quot;, also features cameos from nearly every popular American comedian alive at the time, including The Three Stooges, Jerry Lewis, Buster Keaton and a voice-only cameo by Selma Diamond.

Anthony Daniels made a cameo appearance in Attack of the Clones, despite already starring in the film. Daniels voiced the droid C-3PO, but also made a brief appearance (revealing the actor&#x27;s actual face and body) as a patron in the background of the Outlander Club.

&quot;Murder on High C&quot;, a 1975 episode of the TV series &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot;, which starred former &quot;Laugh-In&quot; cast member Teresa Graves, featured a number of her former cast members, including the villain 
(Arte Johnson), Johnny Brown, Judy Carne, Henry Gibson, Gary Owens and Joanne Worley.

&quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976) features cameos by dozens of actors from Hollywood&#x27;s golden age.

&quot;The Player&quot; (1992) features cameos from 65 Hollywood actors.

&quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; (2012) is filled with cameos from 80 of Britain&#x27;s film and TV stars from the 1960s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s.

Aaron Sorkin also had cameos in some works he wrote: as a bar customer speaking about the law in his debut film screenplay &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), as an advertising executive in &quot;The Social Network&quot;, and as a guest at the inauguration of President Matt Santos in the final episode of &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Franco Nero, the actor who portrayed the Django character in the original 1966 film, appears in a bar scene of the Tarantino film &quot;Django Unchained&quot;. There, he asks Django (Jamie Foxx) to spell his name, which led to the famous promotional tagline for the film - &quot;The &#x27;D&#x27; is silent&quot;. Franco&#x27;s character responds simply, &quot;I know.&quot;

Many cameos featured in &quot;Maverick&quot; (1994), directed by Richard Donner. Among them, Danny Glover – Mel Gibson&#x27;s co-star in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise also directed by Donner – appears as the lead bank robber. He and Maverick (Gibson) share a scene where they look as if they knew each other, but then shake it off. As Glover makes his escape with the money, he mutters &quot;I&#x27;m too old for this shit&quot;, his character&#x27;s catchphrase in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films. In addition, a strain of the main theme from &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; plays in the score when Glover is revealed. Actress Margot Kidder made a cameo appearance in the same film as a robbed villager: she had previously starred as Lois Lane in Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978).

Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell have made appearances in so many of the same films (whether as lead characters or cameos) that &quot;USA Today&quot; coined the term &quot;Frat Pack&quot; to name the group. Actor Adam Sandler is also known for frequently casting fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performers (including Rob Schneider and David Spade) in various roles in his films (as well as making cameo appearances of his own in theirs, most of which he co-produces). Sam Raimi frequently uses his brother Ted and Bruce Campbell in his films.

The American singer/actress Cher had a couple of cameos. She had two cameos in &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; and she even had a few in the 1990s.

Actor Edward Norton appeared as himself in the satirical film &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012) starring Sacha Baron Cohen.

The mangaka Shotaro Ishinomori made many cameos in his &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; series.

The animated series &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; featured its author Hergé in all the episodes.

Stephen King is famous for making short cameo appearances in almost every movie based on his novels.

&quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, a drama about how &quot;Doctor Who&quot; began, features many actors from the show&#x27;s past, including two past companions in a party scene, another as a mother calling her children in for dinner and a fourth in a car park at the BBC as a guard.

In the movie adaptation of &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, Colm Wilkinson, who originated the role of Jean Valjean in the West End and on Broadway, made a cameo as the Bishop of Digne. 
In the Soviet film &quot;Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears&quot;, Innokenty Smoktunovsky appeared for a minute as himself.

In Percy Jackson and the Olympians (TV series), author Rick Riordan appeared as a teacher in the first episode. 

===Other===
Films based on actual events occasionally include cameo guest appearances by the people portrayed in them. In &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;, Chris Gardner made a cameo at the end. &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, a film about Tony Wilson, has a cameo by the real Tony Wilson and many other notable people. In the film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, James Lovell (the real commander of that flight) and his wife Marilyn appeared next to the actors playing them (Tom Hanks and Kathleen Quinlan respectively), and Chuck Yeager, whose story is told in the early part of the film, appears in a cameo in the airfield bar.

<text>Symyx Technologies, Inc. was a company that specialized in informatics and automation products. Symyx provided software solutions for scientific research, including Enterprise Laboratory Notebooks and products for combinatorial chemistry. The software part of the business became part of Accelrys, Inc. in 2010 and then in 2014 this company merged with Dassault Systèmes. Symyx also offered laboratory robotics systems for performing automated chemical research, which in 2010 was spun out as Freeslate, Inc.

==Products==

Symyx offered high-speed combinatorial technologies for the discovery of new materials. Using proprietary technologies - including instruments, software and methods - Symyx was able to generate hundreds to thousands of unique materials at a time and screen those materials rapidly and automatically for desired properties. This approach was said to deliver results hundreds to thousands of times faster than traditional research methods, at a fraction of the cost. Symyx applied this technology to revolutionize materials discovery in the life sciences, chemical, and electronics industries.

==History==

Founded in 1994 by Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni and Dr. Peter G. Schultz, Symyx&#x27; conceptual basis drew from Affymax, Inc. and Affymetrix, Inc., which commercialized the use of high-speed combinatorial methods for pharmaceutical and genetic research, respectively. Dr. Eric McFarland, professor at UCSB, was the founding director. Symyx screens about a million materials a year and has produced a product pipeline with several materials that have the potential to be commercialized in the next few years. Examples of their discovery efforts include X-ray storage phosphors for radiography, polymers to speed DNA research and catalysts for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and plastics.

In 2004, Symyx Technologies acquired Intellichem, a software manufacturer for electronic laboratory notebooks and, in 2007 Symyx Technologies acquired MDL Information Systems (originally Molecular Design Limited, Inc.), a provider of R&amp;D informatics in the chemistry and life sciences industries, which had been launched as a computer-aided drug design firm in January 1978. With this purchase came the purveyorship of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS, www.cdc.gov/niosh/rtecs), a database of basic toxicity information on household chemical substances, food additives, drugs, solvents, biocides, and chemical waste components which as of first quarter of 2012 contained ≈170,000 entries. In 2008, Symyx sold non-RTECS portions of the occupational health and safety (OHS) component of the MDL business to ChemAdvisor, Inc., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Subsequent innovations derived from these business components included an enterprise electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) capable of supporting multiple scientific disciplines.

In 2010 Symyx spun off their laboratory robotics business as Freeslate, Inc. Freeslate developed high throughput systems for automating chemical research. In 2010, the remaining Symyx software business merged with Accelrys, with the combined company being known simply as Accelrys. In 2014, Accelrys in turn merged with Dassault Systèmes, who announced the creation of the BIOVIA brand to supply software for scientific applications.

==Business model considerations==
The concept of combinatory chemistry (outside of bio-tech area) was the focus of Symyx. The initial Symyx business model was to provide contract research for large chemical companies at a contract size from $0.5 Million to $200 Million. The company had initial success in gaining enough contracts to reach profitability, with small deals with few initial customers which led to large deals, such as with Exxon. Symyx then started to sell equipment.

One other key point was the company had to develop new tools and hire new people when a new project came up because the contract was in a brand new research area and required different expertise. Therefore, the research contract business was not scalable. This is seen as the reason for company failure, even though the company had over 500 patents. Other companies followed Symyx&#x27;s path. Intermolecular licensed Symyx patents on electronic materials and is developing tools for the electronic materials companies.

<text>A line-replaceable unit (LRU), lower line-replaceable unit (LLRU), line-replaceable component (LRC), or line-replaceable item (LRI) is a modular component of an airplane, ship or spacecraft (or any other manufactured device) that is designed to be replaced quickly at an operating location (1st line). The different lines (distances) are essential for logistics planning and operation. An LRU is usually a sealed unit such as a radio or other auxiliary equipment. LRUs are typically assigned logistics control numbers (LCNs) or work unit codes (WUCs) to manage logistics operations.

LRUs can improve maintenance operations, because they can be stocked and replaced quickly from distributed nearby on-site inventories (sometimes mobile storage), restoring the mobile systems to service, while the failed (unserviceable) LRU is undergoing complicated repair and overhaul actions in other support locations (lines). Because of their modularity, LRUs also can contribute reducing system costs and increase quality, by centralizing development across different models of vehicles.

LRUs are similar in nature to shop-replaceable units (SRUs), but rather than being component functions, represent complete functional units.

== Definition ==

While the term LRU has been in use for decades, MIL-PRF-49506, Notice 1 of 18 Jan 05, the Performance Spec for Logistics Management Information defines an LRU as:

An LRU is an essential support item which is removed and replaced at the field level to restore the end item to an operational ready condition. Conversely, a non-LRU is a part, component, or assembly used in the repair of an LRU / LLRU, when the LRU has failed and has been removed from the end item for repair.

An LLRU is part of an LRU, and which can be removed and replaced at the field level to restore its LRU to an operational ready condition. As an LRU is considered the &#x27;parent&#x27;, the LLRU is considered a &#x27;child&#x27;. An LLRU can also be a child of a child--that is, an LLRU being a component of a higher-level LLRU. However, there is no hierarchy difference between child levels; the only hierarchical separation is parent versus child.

== Specifications ==

LRUs are designed to specifications to assure that they can be interchanged, especially if they are from different manufacturers. Usually a class of LRUs will have coordinated environmental specifications (i.e. temperature, condensation, etc.). However, each particular LRU will also have detailed specifications describing its function, tray size, tray connectors, attachment points, weight ranges, etc. It is common for LRU trays to have standardized connections for rapid mounting, cooling air, power, and grounding. The mounting hardware is often manually removable standard-screw-detent quick-release fittings. Front-mounted electrical connectors are often jacks for ring-locked cannon plugs that can be removed and replaced (R&amp;R) without tools. Specifications also define the supporting tools necessary to remove and replace the unit. Many require no tools, or a standard-sized Frearson screwdriver. Frearson is specified for some vehicles and many marine systems because Frearson screws keep their mating screwdriver from camming out, and the same screwdriver can be used on many sizes of screws. Most LRUs also have handles, and specific requirements for their bulk and weight. LRUs typically need to be &quot;transportable&quot; and fit through a door or hatchway. There are also requirements for flammability, unwanted radio emissions, resistance to damage from fungus, static electricity, heat, pressure, humidity, condensation drips, vibration, radiation, and other environmental measurements.

LRUs may be designed to ARINC 700-series standards. The form factor of LRUs comply to ARINC Standards, ARINC 404 and ARINC 600. LRUs are also defined by manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing and by various military organizations. In the military, electronic LRUs are typically designed to interface according to data bus standards such as MIL-STD-1553. On the International Space Station, LRUs are referred to as Orbit Replaceable Units.

<doc id="275889" wikidata="Q1238713" url="?curid=275889" title="Abacaenum">
<text>Abacaenum (; ) was an ancient city of Magna Graecia in Sicily, situated about 6.5 km from the north coast, between Tyndaris (modern Tindari) and Mylae (modern Milazzo), and 13 km from the former city.

Remains of the city have been excavated from 2005.

==History==
Abacaenum was a city of the Siculi and does not appear to have ever been a Greek colony, though it was influenced by Greek art and civilisation. For this reason it is considered a &quot;poleis&quot; of Magna Graecia.

Its territory originally included that of Tyndaris, which was separated from it by the elder Dionysius when he founded that city in 395 BC. Dionysius defeated the Carthaginian general Mago in the battle of Abacaenum in 393 BC. From the way in which it is mentioned in the wars of Dionysius, Agathocles, and Hieron, it is clear that it was a place of power and importance: but for a period from the time of Hieron it disappears from history, and no mention is found of it in the Verrine orations of Cicero. Its name is, however, found in Ptolemy, so that it appears to have still continued to exist in his day. Its decline was probably owing to the increasing prosperity of the neighbouring city of Tyndaris.
Abacaenum was allied with Agathocles of Syracuse.

There can be little doubt that the ruins visible in the time of Tommaso Fazello, at the foot of the hill on which the modern town of Tripi is situated, were those of Abacaenum. He speaks of fragments of masonry, prostrate columns, and the vestiges of walls, indicating the site of a large city, but which had been destroyed to its foundations.

==Coinage==

Abacaenum is famous for its mint and its silver and copper coins that bear the classic symbols of sows, boars and acorns found in museums around the world. The acorns evidently refer to the great forests of oak which still cover the neighbouring mountains and give pasture to large herds of swine.

<text>The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) or Canadian lynx is one of the four living species in the genus &quot;Lynx&quot;. It is a medium-sized wild cat characterized by long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, snowshoe-like paws. Its hindlimbs are longer than the forelimbs, so its back slopes downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands tall at the shoulder and weighs between . It is a good swimmer and an agile climber.

The Canada lynx was first described by Robert Kerr in 1792. Three subspecies have been proposed, but their validity is doubted; it is mostly considered a monotypic species. It ranges across Alaska, Canada and northern areas of the contiguous United States, where it predominantly inhabits dense boreal forests.
It is a specialist predator and depends heavily on the snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;) for food. This leads to a prey-predator cycle, as the Canada lynx population responds to the cyclic rises and falls in snowshoe hare populations over the years in Alaska and central Canada. The Canada lynx population increases with an increasing hare population; if the hare population decreases in a given area, it moves to areas with more hares and has fewer offspring. The Canada lynx hunts mainly around twilight, or at night, when the snowshoe hare tends to be active. The Canada lynx waits for the hare on specific trails or in &quot;ambush beds&quot;, then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals, particularly of the same sex, tend to avoid each other, forming &quot;intrasexual&quot; territories. The mating season is roughly a month long from March to early April. After a gestation of two to three months, females give birth to a litter of one to eight kittens, which are weaned at the age of 12 weeks.

Given its abundance throughout the range and lack of severe threats, the Canada lynx has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

== Taxonomy ==
The scientific name &quot;Felis lynx canadensis&quot; was proposed by Robert Kerr in 1792 who described a lynx from Canada. In the late 19th century, several lynx zoological specimens were described:
*&quot;Lynx subsolanus&quot; was proposed by Outram Bangs in 1897 for a lynx skin and skull collected near Codroy, Newfoundland.
*&quot;Lynx canadensis mollipilosus&quot; was proposed by Witmer Stone in 1900 who described a skull and a dark brown skin of a male lynx killed near Wainwright, Alaska.

The placement of the Canada lynx in the genus &quot;Lynx&quot; was supported by Gerrit Miller in 1912. Until as late as the early 2000s, scientists were divided over whether &quot;Lynx&quot; should be considered a subgenus of &quot;Felis&quot;, or a subfamily itself; some even doubted if the Canada lynx should be considered a species on its own. It was recognized by Wallace Christopher Wozencraft in 2005 as a valid &quot;Lynx&quot; species along with the bobcat (&quot;L. rufus&quot;), the Eurasian lynx (&quot;L. lynx&quot;) and the Iberian lynx (&quot;L. pardinus&quot;).
Wozencraft recognized three subspecies of the Canada lynx:
* &quot;L. c. canadensis&quot; in Canadian mainland
* &quot;L. c. subsolanus&quot; in Newfoundland
* &quot;L. c. mollipilosus&quot; in Alaska

The validity of the subspecific status of the Newfoundland lynx was questioned in 1975, as results of a study of coat colour, cranial measurements and weights of Canada lynx specimens showed that the standard measurements are not significantly distinct, apart from a few variations like the Newfoundland lynx&#x27;s darker coat.

In 2017, the Cat Specialist Group considered the Canada lynx a monotypic species, since it shows little morphological or genetic differences. 

The lynx population on Newfoundland is thought to have genetically diverged from the mainland Canada lynx around 20,000 to 33,000 years ago following the Last Glacial Period.

== Evolution ==
According to a 2006 phylogenetic study, the ancestor of five extant felid lineages—&quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Leopardus&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Felis&quot; and &quot;Prionailurus&quot; plus &quot;Otocolobus&quot;—arrived in North America after crossing the Bering Strait (mya). &quot;Lynx&quot; diverged from the &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Felis&quot; and &quot;Prionailurus&quot; plus &quot;Otocolobus&quot; lineages around 2.53–4.74mya. The Issoire lynx (&quot;L. issiodorensis&quot;), believed to be the ancestor of the four modern &quot;Lynx&quot; species, probably originated in Africa 4mya and occurred in Europe and northern Asia until it fell to extinction around 1mya. The populations of the Eurasian lynx that reached North America 2.6mya are believed to have initially settled in the southern half of the continent, as the northern part was covered by glaciers. The southern populations gradually evolved into the modern bobcat. Later, when the continent was invaded by the Eurasian lynx for a second time within the last 200,000 years, the populations that settled in the northern part of the continent, now devoid of glaciers, evolved into the Canada lynx. In his 1981 paper, Swedish paleontologist Lars Werdelin noted that the Canada lynx does not appear to have changed much since its first appearance. Canada lynx fossils excavated in North America date back to the Sangamonian and the Wisconsin Glacial Episode. The 2006 study gave the phylogenetic relationships of the Canada lynx as follows:
== Characteristics ==
The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, snowshoe-like paws. Like the bobcat, the hindlimbs are longer than the forelimbs, so the back slopes downward to the front. The Canada lynx is sexually dimorphic, with males larger and heavier than females. The lynx is between in total length and stands tall at the shoulder; females range in weight from and males from , though an exceptional male in Pennsylvania weighed . Physical proportions do not vary significantly across the range and are probably naturally selected to allow for survival on smaller prey. The stubby tail is long and has a completely black tip. Skeletal muscles make up 56.5 % of the Canada lynx&#x27;s body weight.

The long, thick fur, uniformly coloured with little to no markings except on the underside, insulates the lynx in its frosty habitat. The fur is typically yellowish brown, though in Newfoundland it can vary from brown or buff-grey in spring and summer to a greyish shade with a grizzled appearance in winter; the underparts are white and may have a few dark spots. An individual from Alaska was reported to have bluish-grey fur. The fur is generally shorter in summer than in winter. The backs of the ears are brown with a silvery-grey spot at the centre. Black tufts around in length emerge from the tips of the ears, which are lined with black fur. In winter, the hair on the lower cheek becomes longer, giving the impression of a ruffle covering the throat. There are four nipples.

The claws are sharp and fully retractile. The large, broad paws are covered in long, thick fur and can spread as wide as to move quickly and easily on soft snow. Its paws can support almost twice as much weight as a bobcat&#x27;s before sinking. Both species walk with the back foot typically following the front foot and often do not follow a straight line. The lynx&#x27;s stride is , while the bobcat&#x27;s varies between . Canada lynx tracks are generally larger than those of the bobcat; thicker fur may make the toe pads appear less prominent in the snow. In dirt the tracks of the lynx are long and wide, whereas in snow they are bigger ( long and wide). The warm coat, wide paws and long legs serve as adaptations for the lynx to navigate and hunt efficiently in snow.

The Canada lynx has 28 teeth. The dental formula is . The deciduous dentition is , as the young do not have molars. The four long canines are used for puncturing and gripping. The lynx can feel where it is biting the prey with its canines because they are heavily laced with nerves. It also has four carnassial teeth that cut the meat into small pieces. To use its carnassials, the lynx must chew the meat with its head to its side. There are large spaces between the four canines and the rest of the teeth, and the second upper premolars are absent, to ensure the bite goes as deeply as possible into the prey.

The Canada lynx can be told apart from the bobcat by its longer ear tufts, broader paws, shorter tail with a fully black tip, longer legs and the fewer markings and greyer shade of the coat. The bobcat is generally smaller than the Canada lynx, but in areas where they are sympatric the bobcat tends to be larger and may still be confused with the Canada lynx.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in the dense boreal forest of Canada, and its range strongly coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. In the past, the lynx occurred in the northern United States in 24 states, possibly southward to the Rocky Mountains in New Mexico and northward to the tree line in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in its former range in most of Alaska and Canada. In the United States, the Canada lynx occurs in the Blue Mountains and the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the northern Great Lakes region (in Minnesota and Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula) and northern New England (in New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont). The lynx was successfully reintroduced in Colorado starting in 1999, after being extirpated from the state in the 1970s. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and on agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas that have been left to regenerate at least fifteen years. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of . It is considered extirpated in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Nevada, Indiana, and Ohio.
In February 2022, a picture of a large male Canada lynx was taken by a hunter in the southern Gros Ventre Range of Wyoming after his hounds treed the cat, making it the first confirmed sighting in the state since 2012.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
The Canada lynx tends to be nocturnal like its primary prey, the snowshoe hare. Nevertheless, activity may be observed during daytime. The lynx can cover daily, moving at , to procure prey. These lynxes are good swimmers; one account records a Canada lynx swimming across the Yukon River. Canada lynxes are efficient climbers, and will dodge predators by climbing high up in trees, but they hunt only on the ground. These lynxes are primarily solitary, with minimal social interaction except for the bond between mothers and female offspring, and the temporary association between individuals of opposite sexes during the mating season. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming &quot;intrasexual&quot; territories—a social structure similar to that of bears, bobcats, cougars and mustelids. Intraspecific aggression and consequent cannibalism are rare, but may be more common when food is scarce.

=== Home ranges ===
Canada lynxes establish home ranges that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx in snow (snow-tracking) and radio telemetry; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of , while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between . Like other cats, Canada lynxes scent-mark their ranges by spraying urine and depositing feces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.

Factors such as the availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), the density of the lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range. Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynxes&#x27; home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from —when the density of hares fell from . However, a few other studies have reported different responses from Canada lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges. Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force them to disperse or expand their ranges.

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in Minnesota showed that males&#x27; home ranges spread over , while those of females covered . In a study in the southern Northwest Territories, ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided. The study suggested that individuals do not show any significant tendency to avoid or mingle with one another, and thus only passively defend their ranges. Female home ranges contract in size when the females have offspring to take care of and expand to their original size at the time of weaning.

Canada lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and susceptibility to separation from the central population by natural barriers (such as rivers), might face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes towards the centre of the population and hence show lower genetic variability. However, Canada lynxes are known to disperse over large distances, often thousands of kilometres, which might increase genetic variability in widely separated populations. They typically move within areas where prey availability and the features of the snow (such as the hardness and the extent to which their paws sink into the snow) are more or less similar; individuals may disperse over smaller areas in areas of soft snow.

=== Diet and hunting ===

The Canada lynx preys primarily on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares. However, at times when the hare&#x27;s numbers drop, Canada lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, grouse, moles, ptarmigan, American red squirrels, voles and young ungulates (Dall&#x27;s sheep, mule deer and boreal woodland caribou)—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals to their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to a greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares. A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of red fox, caribou and Dall&#x27;s sheep when hares were very low in number. They have also been reported feeding occasionally on succulents, sedges and grasses. Canada lynxes ingest of food daily.

Canada lynxes hunt around twilight or at night, the time when snowshoe hares tend to be active. They rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey. The lynx will roam or wait (in what researchers often term &quot;ambush beds&quot;) on certain trails that snowshoe hares frequent, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Sometimes a chase of up to several bounds may be necessary to trap the prey. The lynx is assisted by its stereoscopic vision in detecting prey and measuring distances. Staying in cover while hunting helps the lynx conserve energy in its frigid habitat by avoiding unnecessary movement. Young ungulates are given a throat bite to suffocate them to death. The lynx may eat its kill immediately or cache it in snow or leaves to eat it over the next few days. Studies suggest success in hunting hares depends heavily on the distance between the lynx and the hare when the lynx begins chasing it and their relative speeds, which in turn depends on the hunting prowess of the lynx, the alertness of the hare and the vegetation cover among other factors. Canada lynxes will occasionally hunt together, though studies differ on how this affects the success rate compared to hunting solo. These lynxes may hunt in groups when hares are scarce. Scavenging is common; they will take ungulates killed by the cold or vehicles.
Apart from Canada lynxes, coyotes are also major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that, compared to Canada lynxes, coyotes&#x27; feet sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it as lynxes often do. A study of those two animals in southwest Yukon showed that when the hare population increased, both killed more than necessary for subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however, this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. When snowshoe hare numbers declined, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they had earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with American red squirrels.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===
A specialist predator, the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food. Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as to as low as . Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every eight to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and coyotes—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes often move to areas with more hares, sometimes covering over , and tend not to produce litters; as the hares&#x27; numbers increase, so does the lynx population. In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from records maintained by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the Canadian government since the 1730s. Lynx populations have been found to vary periodically three- to seventeen-fold. These cycles have been cited as an example of the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations, caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction. A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare&#x27;s dynamics depend on both its diet and its predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one. Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.

=== Reproduction ===

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of display behaviour and increase the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be induced ovulators when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single estrus cycle; estrus lasts three to five days in captivity. Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls. Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.

After a gestation of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Lynx reproductive cycles and litter sizes have been observed to vary with prey availability; litter size would typically contract in years of snowshoe hare decline (along with high infant mortality rates), and increase when hares were abundant. Kittens weigh from at birth and initially have greyish buff fur with black markings. They are blind the first fourteen days and weaned at twelve weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but they do not reach the full adult size until around two years of age. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother&#x27;s range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months but often delay breeding another year; males mature at age two or three. Canada lynxes have been reported to live sixteen years in the wild, though most do not survive ten; in captivity they may make it to twenty-seven.

=== Diseases and mortality ===
The Canada lynx is known to host several parasites including &quot;Cylicospirura felineus&quot;, &quot;Taenia&quot; species, &quot;Toxocara cati&quot;, &quot;Toxascaris leonina&quot; and &quot;Troglostrongylus wilsoni&quot;. Canada lynxes could have played a role in the transmission of the zoonotic parasite &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; to the Inuit in North America. A study in 2019 identified a gammaherpesvirus species in the Canada lynx for the first time. The study discovered a novel percavirus, named LcaGHV1, in spleen samples of Canada lynxes from Maine and Newfoundland. A study identified plague as a major cause of mortality in reintroduced populations in Colorado.

Fishers are known to hunt Canada lynxes occasionally in the northeastern United States; a study in northern Maine identified predation by fishers as the leading cause of Canada lynx mortality over twelve years, though it did not appear to affect population growth in the lynxes.

== Interactions with humans ==
=== Trade ===
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific seasons in most of Alaska and Canada; hunting seasons and quotas are set based on population data. Alberta typically leads in the production of pelts, accounting for nearly a third of Canada&#x27;s total. Following a cyclic fall in populations during the mid to late 1980s, there was a sharp decline in the prices and harvest of Canada lynx furs—the average number of pelts exported from Canada and the United States fell from 35,669 in 1980–1984 to 7,360 between 1986 and 1989. Subsequently, the numbers have increased to 15,387 during 2000–2006. Average illegal trade in fur and live animals appears to be negligible on the national scale. Even without regulation, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century.

A survey of the international wildlife trade between 1980 and 2004 recorded that among all lynxes, the Canada lynx accounted for thirty percent of legal items and had little part in illegal trade. While it was unclear which lynxes were preferred in North America, bobcat and Canada lynx furs appeared to be in greater demand than those of other lynxes in Asian and European markets.

=== Threats and conservation ===

In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the eastern coyote, whose numbers in the region have risen in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the contiguous United States, while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range. Hybridization between closely related species might significantly delimit the geographic range of the species, especially if they are endangered as reproductive success in females would be reduced by the birth of sterile offspring; on the other hand, fertile hybrids can compete and breed further with the parent species, potentially reducing the numbers of the parent species. Canada lynx-bobcat hybrids have shown signs of reproductive success and do not appear to pose any significant threat to the parent species. The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range and has not been significantly threatened by legal trade for centuries. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as Least Concern.

However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from the fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. On March 24, 2000, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous states. In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx reproduction had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and New Hampshire, northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern Idaho, the Kettle River Range and the &quot;Wedge area&quot; between the Kettle and Columbia rivers of Washington, the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the Greater Yellowstone area of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado. The initial introduction was in the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado, but self-sustaining populations were established throughout the south-central Colorado Rockies as far north as Summit County. A 2012 study showed numbers had improved in the northeastern United States; however, a 2008 study showed lynx populations were not doing well in Washington because of habitat fragmentation. A 2017 study reported increasing numbers in many areas in the United States. In January 2018, the USFWS declared that the Canada lynx no longer needed special protections in the United States following measures to preserve their populations, and their &quot;Threatened&quot; status may be revoked in the future.

Various techniques have been employed to study Canada lynx populations; the data collected can provide useful information on the ecology and distribution of the species and pave the way for effective conservation measures. In scent stations, the lynx is typically lured into camera-monitored areas by skunk scent (sometimes catnip) and a &quot;flasher&quot; such as a bird wing on a string. This technique, though systematic, might be too expensive to carry out in large areas. Other methods include radio telemetry and snow tracking. Snow tracking might be a challenge in areas lacking roads, and sometimes bobcat tracks can be mistaken for those of the Canada lynx. Hair-snaring involves collecting hairs shed by the lynx, especially when they rub against objects (such as the snow); a study showed a mixture of beaver castoreum and catnip oil can strongly induce rubbing behaviour in lynxes. This method is generally inexpensive, and chances of misidentification are low as physical evidence like hairs can be genetically analysed.

Between 1989 and 1992, a reintroduction attempt into New York State was made when 80 lynx were caught in from northwestern Canada and released into the Adirondacks by the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Some of the released lynx dispersed into the surrounding states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. After the attempt, Canada lynx were officially considered extirpated in New York State, but are still fully protected under state law. Nineteen individuals were killed in traffic accidents, eight were mistakenly shot by bobcat hunters, and the remaining died from unknown causes or predation.

<doc id="275902" wikidata="Q2905331" url="?curid=275902" title="Black box (phreaking)">
<text>Black boxes were devices which, when attached to home phones, allowed all incoming calls to be received without charge to the caller.

The black box (as distinguished from blue boxes and red boxes) was a small electronic circuit, usually a resistor or zener diode in series with the line. It relied on (now-obsolete) telephone exchanges controlled by mechanical relays.

These exchanges used a relay to detect a drop in line voltage (usually to less than -10V off-hook, compared to -48V when on-hook) to begin billing for a call; a separate relay controlled ringing on the line. The black box placed a resistor in series with the line, so that the off-hook voltage was closer to -36V: just enough to stop the ringing, but not enough to trigger billing. A bypass capacitor was often added to prevent the device from attenuating AC signals such as transmitted voice.

A call originating from a telephone fitted with a black box would still be charged for by the telephone company unless some method to circumvent the call charging was deployed. Black boxes were commonly built by phone phreaks during the 1960s to 1980s (and in some places like Eastern Europe, well into the 2000s) in order to provide callers with free telephone calls. Sometimes several friends would incorporate a black box into each of their telephones to enable them to hold long conversations with each other without having to pay for them. Another use of black boxes was in the incoming modems of computers running bulletin board systems that were popular back in the 1980s and early 90s.

Electronic switching systems rendered black boxes obsolete, as no audio path was established until the call was answered. The infinity transmitter, an eavesdropping device which in its original design relied on an audio path to the target line remaining open before a call was answered or after it was hung up by the recipient, was similarly affected by the demise of mechanical switching.

<doc id="275908" wikidata="Q4745255" url="?curid=275908" title="American Tobacco Trail">
<text>The American Tobacco Trail (ATT) is a long Rails-to-Trails project located in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, running along an abandoned railroad bed originally built for the American Tobacco Company in the 1970s. The route crosses through portions of Durham County (including the City of Durham), Chatham County, and Wake County (including the Town of Cary, North Carolina). The ATT is part of the East Coast Greenway and is open to pedestrians, cyclists, equestrians (in non-urban sections) and other non-motorized users.

Starting from the southern end of the trail in New Hill, the 6.5 mile Wake County portion of the trail is gravel, followed by a 4.7-mile multi-use section in Chatham County that contains a paved lane and a gravel (equestrian lane); the northernmost 11.4-mile paved section in Durham County on the north end of the trail ends at the Durham Bulls Athletic Park (DBAP).

The 4.7-mile Chatham County section of the trail was built, and is managed, by the Town of Cary (which resides in both Wake and Chatham counties).

==Route==

===Durham County===

The ATT traverses in Durham County, North Carolina. The trail&#x27;s northern terminus lies in the city of Durham across Morehead Avenue from the Durham Bulls Athletic Park. Within the city, the trail is a wide asphalt paved greenway with loose gravel shoulders. It is open to walkers, cyclists, rollerbladers and wheelchair users, but not equestrians.

The American Tobacco Trail runs through the city of Durham south to the Chatham county line, crossing over I-40 near The Streets at Southpoint mall. A pedestrian bridge was erected over I-40 in April 2013, connecting the northern and southern segments of the Durham County portion of the trail, but due to construction errors, did not open until February 2014. This segment of the ATT within Durham County is a designated portion of the East Coast Greenway.

===Chatham County===

The ATT traverses in Chatham County, North Carolina. Once the trail crosses into Chatham county, the trail converts to a dual surface of asphalt and compacted screenings. The trail is open for foot, bike and equestrian use by TRTC. The trail crosses Northeast Creek and O&#x27;Kelly Chapel Road, past the Old Chatham Golf Course. It also traverses the end of Pittard Sears Road, Panther Creek, and continues past New Hope Church Road. 
===Wake County===
The ATT traverses in Wake County, North Carolina. The Wake County portion of the ATT is approximately wide with a granite screening surface. The trail is open to hikers, cyclists, wheelchair users and equestrians. Users can access this portion of the greenway most conveniently at 2575 New Hope Church Rd, Cary, NC.

In total, of continuous paved trail is usable in the northernmost portion and of continuous unpaved trail is usable in the southernmost portion.

==History==
J.B. Duke founded the American Tobacco Company in 1890, which subsequently acquired the Lucky Strike Company and over 200 other firms. The company built processing plants and warehouses in Durham which were served by several rail lines built in 1905. The rail line to the south which is now the ATT, connected from Durham to Bonsal, NC and onwards to Duncan. It was known as the New Hope Valley Railway and later Durham &amp; South Carolina (it never got as far as SC), and later became part of the Norfolk Southern Railway system. In the 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Jordan Lake reservoir in Chatham County necessitating the relocation of a large portion of the tracks. A portion of the original right-of-way is presently a natural surface trail accessible off of Stagecoach Rd. in Durham. A new rail line was built on higher ground a few miles to the east. However, only about 10 years later, the tracks were removed from this new railroad as Norfolk Southern had been bought out, and trains could access the American Tobacco complex via the Southern Railway more economically.

The Triangle Rails-to-Trails Conservancy Inc. (TRTC), founded in 1989, aimed to preserve abandoned railroad corridors in North Carolina&#x27;s Triangle area for future transportation and recreational use, particularly through rail-to-trail conversions. TRTC&#x27;s first president, Jon Parker, and his successor, John Goebel, along with Robert Payne, Al Capehart, Libby Searles, and Rick Burt, secured funding to develop the American Tobacco Trail (ATT), a 22-mile trail spanning Durham, Wake, and Chatham counties on the former Norfolk &amp; Southern railroad line. The project&#x27;s early stages, beginning with a $2,500 grant, involved extensive planning led by Greenways Incorporated and collaboration with the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), local governments, and various organizations.

In 1994, TRTC leadership passed to Tom Mappes, who coordinated planning efforts to address trail design challenges, such as the I-40 “gap” and widening standards. Advocacy from Leslie Kennedy and the NC Horse Council led to the construction of a tunnel under US Hwy 64 to maintain the trail&#x27;s continuity in Wake County. Sig Hutchinson and the Triangle Greenways Council envisioned a connected network of trails, incorporating the ATT as a key segment. Curt Devereux and Rick Burt contributed by maintaining TRTC&#x27;s website and newsletters, while Bill Bussey later led TRTC, overseeing continuous improvements and community engagement efforts.

The ATT officially opened in phases, starting in Durham in the year 2000, followed by sections in Wake and Chatham counties. Key milestones included the addition of a 3.2-mile section in 2002, a 3.5-mile equestrian-friendly segment in Wake County in 2003, and federally funded expansions secured by Congressman David Price, which helped complete the Chatham section by 2010. The final Durham section, featuring a pedestrian bridge over I-40, was completed in 2014.

TRTC continues to advocate for the ATT and related projects, including the Timberlake and Duke Beltline Corridors, expanding recreational and transportation opportunities in the region.

<doc id="275909" wikidata="Q879969" url="?curid=275909" title="Black-box testing">
<text>Black-box testing, sometimes referred to as specification-based testing, is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. Black-box testing is also used as a method in penetration testing, where an ethical hacker simulates an external hacking or cyber warfare attack with no knowledge of the system being attacked.

==Test procedures==
Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; the same as the expected value specified in the test case.
Specific knowledge of the application&#x27;s code, internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required. The tester is aware of &quot;what&quot; the software is supposed to do but is not aware of &quot;how&quot; it does it. For instance, the tester is aware that a particular input returns a certain, invariable output but is not aware of &quot;how&quot; the software produces the output in the first place.

===Test cases===
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. Test cases are generally derived from external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements and design parameters. Although the tests used are primarily &quot;functional&quot; in nature, &quot;non-functional&quot; tests may also be used. The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output, often with the help of a test oracle or a previous result that is known to be good, without any knowledge of the test object&#x27;s internal structure.

=== Test design techniques ===
Typical black-box test design techniques include decision table testing, all-pairs testing, equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, cause–effect graph, error guessing, state transition testing, use case testing, user story testing, domain analysis, and syntax testing.

== Test coverage ==

Test coverage refers to the percentage of software requirements that are tested by black-box testing for a system or application. This is in contrast with code coverage, which examines the inner workings of a program and measures the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a test suite is run. Measuring test coverage makes it possible to quickly detect and eliminate defects, to create a more comprehensive test suite. and to remove tests that are not relevant for the given requirements.

== Effectiveness ==
Black-box testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations. An advantage of the black box technique is that no programming knowledge is required. Whatever biases the programmers may have had, the tester likely has a different set and may emphasize different areas of functionality. On the other hand, black-box testing has been said to be &quot;like a walk in a dark labyrinth without a flashlight.&quot; Because they do not examine the source code, there are situations when a tester writes many test cases to check something that could have been tested by only one test case or leaves some parts of the program untested.

<doc id="275915" wikidata="Q1342882" url="?curid=275915" title="English National Opera">
<text>English National Opera (ENO) is a British opera company based in London, resident at the London Coliseum in St Martin&#x27;s Lane. It is one of the two principal opera companies in London, along with The Royal Opera. ENO&#x27;s productions are sung in English.

The company&#x27;s origins were in the late 19th century, when the philanthropist Emma Cons, later assisted by her niece Lilian Baylis, presented theatrical and operatic performances at the Old Vic, for the benefit of local people. Baylis subsequently built up both the opera and the theatre companies, and later added a ballet company; these evolved into the ENO, the Royal National Theatre and The Royal Ballet, respectively.

Baylis acquired and rebuilt the Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre in north London, a larger house, better suited to opera than the Old Vic. The opera company grew there into a permanent ensemble in the 1930s. During the Second World War, the theatre was closed and the company toured British towns and cities. After the war, the company returned to its home, but it continued to expand and improve. By the 1960s, a larger theatre was needed. In 1968, the company moved to the London Coliseum and adopted its present name in 1974.

Among the conductors associated with the company have been Colin Davis, Reginald Goodall, Charles Mackerras, Mark Elder and Edward Gardner. The current music director of the ENO is Martyn Brabbins. Noted directors who have staged productions at the ENO have included David Pountney, Jonathan Miller, Nicholas Hytner, Phyllida Lloyd and Calixto Bieito. The ENO&#x27;s current artistic director is Annilese Miskimmon. In addition to the core operatic repertoire, the company has presented a wide range of works, from early operas by Monteverdi to new commissions, operetta and Broadway shows.

==History==

===Foundations===

In 1889, Emma Cons, a Victorian philanthropist who ran the Old Vic theatre in a working-class area of London, began presenting regular fortnightly performances of opera excerpts. Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At the same time she appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic&#x27;s musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally the preserve of the rich and fashionable. They worked on a tiny budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By the early years of the 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.

Emma Cons died in 1912, leaving her estate, including the Old Vic, to Baylis, who dreamed of transforming the theatre into a &quot;people&#x27;s opera house&quot;. In the same year, Baylis obtained a licence to allow the Old Vic to stage full performances of operas. In the 1914–1915 season, Baylis staged 16 operas and 16 plays (13 of which were by Shakespeare). In the years after the First World War, Baylis&#x27;s Shakespeare productions, which featured some of the leading actors from London&#x27;s West End, attracted national attention, as her shoe-string opera productions did not. The opera, however, remained her first priority. The actor-manager Robert Atkins, who worked closely with Baylis on her Shakespearean productions, recalled, &quot;Opera, on Thursday and Saturday nights, played to bulging houses.&quot;

===Vic-Wells===

By the 1920s, Baylis concluded that the Old Vic no longer sufficed to house both her theatre and her opera companies. She noticed the empty and derelict Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre in Rosebery Avenue, Islington, on the other side of London from the Old Vic. She sought to run it in tandem with her existing theatre.

Baylis made a public appeal for funds in 1925. With the help of the Carnegie Trust and many others, she acquired the freehold of Sadler&#x27;s Wells. Work started on the site in 1926. By Christmas 1930, a completely new 1,640-seat theatre was ready for occupation. The first production there, a fortnight&#x27;s run from 6 January 1931, was Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. The first opera, given on 20 January, was &quot;Carmen.&quot; Eighteen operas were staged during the first season.

The new theatre was more expensive to run than the Old Vic, as a larger orchestra and more singers were needed, and box office receipts were at first inadequate. In 1932, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; commented that the Vic-Wells opera performances did not reach the standards of the Vic-Wells Shakespeare productions. Baylis strove to improve operatic standards, while at the same time fending off attempts by Sir Thomas Beecham to absorb the opera company into a joint enterprise with Covent Garden, where he was in command. At first, the apparent financial security of the offer appeared attractive, but friends and advisers such as Edward J. Dent and Clive Carey convinced Bayliss that it was not in the interests of her regular audience. This view received strong support from the press; &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:

The Old Vic began by offering opera of some sort to people who hardly knew what the word meant ... under a wise, fostering guidance it has gradually worked upwards ...Any kind of amalgamation which made it the poor relation of the &#x27;Grand&#x27; season would be disastrous.
At first, Baylis presented both drama and opera at each of her theatres. The companies were known as the &quot;Vic-Wells&quot;. However, for both aesthetic and financial reasons, by 1934, the Old Vic had become the home of the spoken drama, while Sadler&#x27;s Wells housed both the opera and a ballet company, the latter co-founded by Baylis and Ninette de Valois in 1930.

Lawrance Collingwood joined the company as resident conductor alongside Corri. With the increased number of productions, guest conductors were recruited, including Geoffrey Toye and Anthony Collins. The increasing success of the new ballet company helped to subsidise the high cost of opera productions, enabling a further increase in the size of the orchestra, to 48 players. Among the singers in the opera company were Joan Cross and Edith Coates. In the 1930s, the company presented standard repertoire operas by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner and Puccini, lighter works by Balfe, Donizetti, Offenbach and Johann Strauss, some novelties, among which were operas by Holst, Ethel Smyth and Charles Villiers Stanford, and an unusual attempt at staging an oratorio, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;.

In November 1937, Baylis died of a heart attack. Her three companies continued under the direction of her appointed successors: Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic, in overall charge of both theatres, with de Valois running the ballet, and Carey and two colleagues running the opera. In the Second World War, the government requisitioned Sadler&#x27;s Wells as a refuge for those made homeless by air-raids. Guthrie decided to keep the opera going as a small touring ensemble of 20 performers. Between 1942 and the war&#x27;s end in 1945, the company toured continuously, visiting 87 venues. Joan Cross led and managed the company, and also sang leading soprano roles in its productions when needed. The size of the company was increased to 50, and then to 80. By 1945, its members included singers from a new generation such as Peter Pears and Owen Brannigan, and the conductor Reginald Goodall.

===Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera===

Both Sadler&#x27;s Wells and the Royal Opera House had presented no opera or ballet since 1939. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), the official government body charged with dispensing the modest public subsidy recently introduced, considered its options on the future of opera in Britain. CEMA concluded that a new Covent Garden company should be established, as a year-round, permanent ensemble, singing in English, instead of the shorter international seasons of pre-war years. This was a potential path to merge the two companies, as the modus operandi of the new Covent Garden company was now similar to that of Sadler&#x27;s Wells. However, David Webster, who was appointed to run Covent Garden, though keen to secure de Valois&#x27; ballet company for Covent Garden, did not want the Sadler&#x27;s Wells opera company. He considered Sadler&#x27;s Wells to be a worthy organisation, but also &quot;dowdy&quot; and &quot;stodgy&quot;. Even with a policy of singing in English, he believed that he could assemble a better company. The management of Sadler&#x27;s Wells was unwilling to lose its company&#x27;s name and tradition. It was agreed that the two companies should remain separate.

Divisions within the company threatened its continued existence. Cross announced her intention to re-open Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; by Benjamin Britten, with herself and Pears in the leading roles. Many complaints resulted about supposed favouritism and the &quot;cacophony&quot; of Britten&#x27;s score. &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; opened in June 1945, to both public and critical acclaim; its box-office takings matched or exceeded those for &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which the company was concurrently staging. However, the rift within the company was irreparable. Cross, Britten and Pears severed their ties with Sadler&#x27;s Wells in December 1945 and founded the English Opera Group. The departure of the ballet company to Covent Garden two months later deprived Sadler&#x27;s Wells of an important source of income, as the ballet had been profitable and had since its inception subsidised the opera company.

Clive Carey, who had been in Australia during the war, was brought back to replace Joan Cross and rebuild the company. The critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote in 1946 that Carey had begun to make a difference, but that Sadler&#x27;s Wells needed &quot;a big heave to get out of mediocrity&quot;. In the same year, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; asked whether the Old Vic and Sadler&#x27;s Wells companies would stick to their old bases, &quot;or shall they boldly embrace the ideal of a National Theatre and a National Opera in English?&quot; Carey left in 1947, replaced in January 1948 by a triumvirate of James Robertson as musical director, Michael Mudie as his assistant conductor and Norman Tucker in charge of administration. From October 1948, Tucker was given sole control. Mudie became ill, and the young Charles Mackerras was appointed to deputise for him.
By 1950 Sadler&#x27;s Wells was receiving a public subsidy of £40,000 a year, whilst Covent Garden received £145,000. Tucker had to give up the option of staging the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, for lack of resources. Keen to improve the dramatic aspects of opera production, Tucker engaged eminent theatrical directors including Michel Saint-Denis, George Devine and Glen Byam Shaw worked on Sadler&#x27;s Wells productions in the 1950s. New repertoire was explored, such as the first British staging of Janáček&#x27;s &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, at Mackerras&#x27;s urging. Standards and company morale were improving. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; summed up the 1950–51 London opera season as &quot;Excitement at Sadler&#x27;s Wells: Lack of Distinction at Covent Garden&quot; and judged Sadler&#x27;s Wells to have moved &quot;into the front rank of opera houses&quot;.

The company continued to leave Rosebery Avenue for summer tours to British cities and towns. The Arts Council (successor to CEMA) was sensitive to the charge that since 1945, far fewer opera performances had been given in the provinces. The small Carl Rosa Opera Company toured constantly, but the Covent Garden company visited only those few cities with theatres big enough to accommodate it. In the mid-1950s, renewed calls appeared for a reorganisation of Britain&#x27;s opera companies. There were proposals for a new home for Sadler&#x27;s Wells on the South Bank of the Thames near the Royal Festival Hall, which fell through because the government was unwilling to fund the building.

Once again, there was serious talk of merging Covent Garden and Sadler&#x27;s Wells. The Sadler&#x27;s Wells board countered by proposing a closer working arrangement with Carl Rosa. When it became clear that this would require the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company to tour for 30 weeks every year, effectively removing its presence on the London opera scene, Tucker, his deputy Stephen Arlen, and his musical director Alexander Gibson resigned. The proposals were modified, and the three withdrew their resignations. In 1960, the Carl Rosa Company was dissolved. Sadler&#x27;s Wells took over some of its members and many of its touring dates, setting up &quot;two interchangeable companies of equal standing&quot;, one of which played at Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre while the other was on the road.
By the late 1950s, Covent Garden was gradually abandoning its policy of productions in the vernacular; such singers as Maria Callas would not relearn their roles in English. This made it easier for Tucker to point up the difference between the two London opera companies. While Covent Garden engaged international stars, Sadler&#x27;s Wells focused on young British and Commonwealth performers. Colin Davis was appointed musical director in succession to Gibson in 1961. The repertoire continued to mix familiar and unfamiliar operas. Novelties in Davis&#x27;s time included Pizzetti&#x27;s &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;, Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, Richard Rodney Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Mines of Sulphur&quot; and more Janáček. Sadler&#x27;s Wells&#x27;s traditional policy of giving all operas in English continued, with only two exceptions: &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, which was sung in Latin, and Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, sung in Italian, for reasons not clear to the press. In January 1962, the company gave its first Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, with Margaret Gale in the title role, on the day on which the Savoy operas came out of copyright and the D&#x27;Oyly Carte monopoly ended. The production was well received (it was successfully revived for many seasons until 1978) and was followed by a production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in May of the same year.

The Islington theatre was by now clearly too small to allow the company to achieve any further growth. A study conducted for the Arts Council reported that in the late 1960s the two Sadler&#x27;s Wells companies comprised 278 salaried performers and 62 guest singers. The company had experience of playing in a large West End theatre, such as its 1958 sell-out production of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; that had transferred to the 2,351-seat London Coliseum for a summer season. Ten years later, the lease of the Coliseum became available. Stephen Arlen, who had succeeded Tucker as managing director, was the primary advocate for moving the company. After intense negotiations and fund-raising, a ten-year lease was signed in 1968. One of the company&#x27;s last productions at the Islington theatre was Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Mastersingers&quot;, conducted by Goodall in 1968, which 40 years later was described by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine as &quot;legendary&quot;. The company left Sadler&#x27;s Wells with a revival of the work with which it had re-opened the theatre in 1945, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. Its last performance at the Rosebery Avenue theatre was on 15 June 1968.

===Coliseum===
The company, retaining the title &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera&quot;, opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.

The success of the 1968 &quot;Mastersingers&quot; was followed in the 1970s by the company&#x27;s first &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood&#x27;s view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the &quot;Ring&quot;, Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;.

The company&#x27;s musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range &quot;from &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; to &quot;Patience&quot;.&quot; Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;; Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; with Baker; and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot;. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot;. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves &quot;immensely encouraging and supportive&quot;.

A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company&#x27;s name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented &quot;The one major setback the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue&quot;.

Harewood considered it an elementary rule that &quot;you must not carry the name of one theatre if you are playing in another one.&quot; Covent Garden, protective of its status, objected to the suggestion that the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company should be called &quot;The British National Opera&quot; or &quot;The National Opera&quot;, although neither Scottish Opera nor the Welsh National Opera opposed such a change. Eventually the British government decided the matter, and the title &quot;English National Opera&quot; was approved. The company&#x27;s board adopted the new name in November 1974. In 1977, in response to demand for more opera productions in English provincial cities, a second company was established. It was based at Leeds in northern England, and was known as ENO North. Under Harewood&#x27;s guidance, it flourished, and in 1981 it became an independent company, Opera North.

===ENO===

====1980–99====
In 1982, at Elder&#x27;s instigation, Harewood appointed David Pountney director of productions. In 1985 Harewood retired, becoming chairman of ENO&#x27;s board the following year. Peter Jonas succeeded Harewood as managing director. The 1980s leadership team of Elder, Pountney and Jonas became known as the &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, initiated a new era of &quot;director&#x27;s opera&quot;. The three of them favoured productions described, contrastingly, by Elder as &quot;groundbreaking, risky, probing and theatrically effective&quot;, and by the director Nicholas Hytner as &quot;Euro-bollocks that never has to be comprehensible to anybody but the people sitting out there conceiving.&quot; Directors who did not, in Harewood&#x27;s phrase, &quot;want to splash paint in the face of the public&quot; were sidelined. A 1980s audience survey showed that the two things that ENO audiences most disliked were poor diction and the extremes of &quot;director&#x27;s opera&quot;.

In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Barry Millington has described the &#x27;Powerhouse&#x27; style as &quot;arresting images of dislocated reality, an inexhaustible repertory of stage contrivances, a determination to explore the social and psychological issues latent in the works, and above all an abundant sense of theatricality.&quot; As examples, Millington mentioned &quot;Rusalka&quot; (1983), with its Edwardian nursery setting and Freudian undertones, and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (1987), its dream pantomime peopled by fantasy figures from the children&#x27;s imagination ... &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; (1987) and &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1990) exemplified an approach to production in which grotesque caricature jostles with forceful emotional engagement.

Poor average box-office sales led to a financial crisis, exacerbated by backstage industrial relations problems. After 1983, the company ceased touring to other British venues. Assessing the achievements of the &#x27;Powerhouse&#x27; years, Tom Sutcliffe wrote in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;:
Productions during the 1980s included the company&#x27;s first presentations of &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; (1981), &quot;Parsifal&quot; (1986) and &quot;Billy Budd&quot; (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included &quot;Xerxes&quot; directed by Hytner, and &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot; directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed &quot;Gloriana&quot;, &quot;War and Peace&quot;, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where &quot;Patience&quot; received a standing ovation and Miller&#x27;s production of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, Pountney&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and Hytner&#x27;s much-revived &quot;Xerxes&quot;.

The &#x27;Powerhouse&#x27; era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney&#x27;s post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company&#x27;s finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, described by the critic Hugh Canning as &quot;the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised&quot;.

Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which the ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By increasing ticket sales in successive years, Marks demonstrated that the Arts Council&#x27;s proposition was unrealistic. After what &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;a sustained period of criticism and sniping at the ENO by music critics&quot;, Edwards resigned as music director at the end of 1995. Paul Daniel became ENO&#x27;s next music director. In 1997, Marks resigned. No official reason was announced, but one report stated that he and the ENO board had disagreed about his plans to move the company from the Coliseum to a purpose-built new home. Daniel took over the management of the company until a new general director was appointed.

Daniel inherited from Marks a company thriving artistically and financially. The 1997–1998 season played to 75 per cent capacity and made a surplus of £150,000. Daniel led the campaign against yet another proposal to merge Covent Garden and ENO, which was rapidly abandoned. In 1998 Nicholas Payne, director of opera at Covent Garden, was appointed as ENO&#x27;s general director. Productions in the 1990s included the company&#x27;s first stagings of &quot;Beatrice and Benedict&quot; (1990), &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1990), &quot;Jenůfa&quot; (1994), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1995), &quot;Die Soldaten&quot; (1996), &quot;Doctor Ox&#x27;s Experiment&quot; (1998) and &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; (1999). Co-productions, enabling opera houses to share the costs of joint enterprises, became important in this decade. In 1993 ENO and Welsh National Opera collaborated on productions of &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, &quot;Ariodante&quot; and &quot;The Two Widows&quot;.

====2000–2009====
Martin Smith, a millionaire with a finance background, was appointed chairman of the ENO board in 2001. He proved to be an expert fund-raiser, and personally donated £1M to the cost of refurbishing the Coliseum. He and Payne came into conflict over the effect on revenue of the &quot;director&#x27;s opera&quot; productions that Payne insisted on commissioning. The most extreme case was a production of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; directed by Calixto Bieito in 2001, despised by critics and public alike; Michael Kennedy described it as &quot;a new nadir in vulgar abuse of a masterpiece,&quot; and other reviewers agreed with him. Payne insisted, &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of the best things we&#x27;ve done. ... It&#x27;s exceeded my expectations.&quot; In the arts pages of &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, Martin Hoyle wrote of Payne&#x27;s &quot;exquisite tunnel vision&quot; and expressed &quot;the concern of those of us who value the true people&#x27;s opera&quot;. Payne remained adamant that opera lovers who came to the ENO for a &quot;nice, pleasant evening ... had come to the wrong place.&quot; The differences between Smith and Payne became irreconcilable, and Payne was forced to resign in July 2002.

The successor to Payne was Séan Doran, whose appointment was controversial because he had no experience of running an opera company. He attracted newspaper headlines with unusual operatic events, described by admirers as &quot;unexpected coups&quot; and by detractors as &quot;stunts&quot;; a performance of the third act of &quot;The Valkyrie&quot; played to 20,000 rock music fans at the Glastonbury Festival. In December 2003, Daniel announced his departure from ENO at the end of his contract in 2005. Oleg Caetani was announced as the next music director, from January 2006.

In 2004, ENO embarked on its second production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot;. After concert performances over the previous three seasons, the four operas of the cycle were staged at the Coliseum in 2004 and 2005 in productions by Phyllida Lloyd, with designs by Richard Hudson, in a new translation by Jeremy Sams. The first instalments of the cycle were criticised as poorly sung and conducted, but by the time &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; was staged in 2005, matters were thought to have improved: &quot;Paul Daniel&#x27;s command of the score is more authoritative than could have been predicted from his uneven accounts of the previous operas.&quot; The production attracted generally bad notices. The four operas were given individual runs, but were never played as a complete cycle.
During the 2000s the company repeated the experiment, previously tried in 1932, of staging oratorios and other choral works as operatic performances. Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. John Passion&quot; was given in 2000, followed by Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (2000), Tippett&#x27;s &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; (2005) and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Jephtha&quot; (2005) and &quot;Messiah&quot; (2009). ENO responded to the increased interest in Handel&#x27;s operas, staging &quot;Alcina&quot; (2002), &quot;Agrippina&quot; (2006) and &quot;Partenope&quot; (2008). In 2003 the company staged its first production of Berlioz&#x27;s massive opera &quot;The Trojans&quot;, with Sarah Connolly as &quot;a supremely eloquent, genuinely tragic Dido&quot;.

In 2005, after an internal debate that had been going on since 1991, the ENO announced that surtitles would be introduced at the Coliseum. Surveys had shown that only a quarter of audience members could hear the words clearly. With a few exceptions, including Lesley Garrett and Andrew Shore, ENO singers of the 21st century were considered to have poorer diction than earlier singers such as Masterson and Derek Hammond-Stroud. Harewood and Pountney had been immovably opposed to surtitles, as both believed that opera in English was pointless if it could not be understood. Harewood thought, moreover, that surtitles could undermine the case for a publicly funded opera-in-English company. The editor of &quot;Opera&quot; magazine, Rodney Milnes, campaigned against surtitles on the grounds that &quot;singers would give up trying to articulate clearly and audiences would cease focusing on the stage&quot;. Despite these objections, surtitles were introduced from October 2005.

On 29 November 2005, Doran resigned as artistic director. To replace him, Smith divided the duties between Loretta Tomasi as chief executive and John Berry as artistic director. These elevations from within the organisation were controversial, because they were neither advertised nor cleared at the top level of the Arts Council. Smith received severe press criticism for his action, and in December 2005 he announced his resignation. In the same week, Caetani&#x27;s appointment as the next ENO music director was cancelled. Berry was at first criticised in the press for his choice of singers for ENO productions, but the appointment of Edward Gardner as music director from 2007 received considerable praise. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that Gardner was &quot;widely credited with breathing fresh life into English National Opera&quot;.

Attendance figures recovered, with younger audiences attracted by ENO&#x27;s marketing schemes. The company&#x27;s finances improved, with £5M in reserve funds in April 2009.

====2010–present====
Productions in the 2011 season continued the company&#x27;s traditions of engaging directors with no operatic experience (a well-reviewed &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; staged by Terry Gilliam and set in Nazi Germany) and of drastic reinterpretations (a version of Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; presented by Christopher Alden as a paedophile parable set in a 1950s boys&#x27; school, which divided critical opinion). In the 2012–13 season ENO introduced &quot;Opera Undressed&quot; evenings, aimed at attracting new audiences who had thought opera &quot;Too pricey, too pompous, too posh&quot;. Operas advertised under this banner were &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot;, Michel van der Aa&#x27;s &quot;Sunken Garden&quot; (performed at the Barbican) and Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect American&quot;.

In January 2014, the ENO announced Gardner&#x27;s departure as music director at the end of the 2014–15 season, to be succeeded by Mark Wigglesworth. At the time, the ENO had accumulated an £800,000 deficit, exacerbated by reductions in public subsidy; &quot;The Times&quot; commented that the incoming music director had a reputation for &quot;steely, even abrasive determination&quot; and that he would need it. From late 2014 the company went through a further organisational crisis. The chairman, Martyn Rose, resigned after two years in the post, following irreconcilable differences with Berry. Henriette Götz, the company&#x27;s executive director, who had a series of public disagreements with Berry, resigned soon after. In February 2015, the Arts Council of England announced the unprecedented step of removing ENO from the national portfolio of 670 arts organisations that receive regular funding, and instead offered &quot;special funding arrangements&quot; because of continuing concerns over ENO&#x27;s business plan and management. The council recognised that the company was &quot;capable of extraordinary artistic work&quot;, but &quot;we have serious concerns about their governance and business model and we expect them to improve or they could face removal of funding.&quot; In March 2015 Cressida Pollock, a management consultant, was named the interim CEO of ENO. In July 2015, Berry resigned as artistic director of ENO.

Critical and box-office successes in the company&#x27;s 2014–2015 season included &quot;The Mastersingers&quot;, which won an Olivier Award for best new opera production, and &quot; Sweeney Todd&quot;, with Bryn Terfel in the title role. New productions announced for 2015–2016 were &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, with sets by Anish Kapoor; the company&#x27;s first staging of &quot;Norma&quot;; and the first London performance for 30 years of &quot; Akhnaten&quot;.

In September 2015, Pollock was elevated to formal full-time status as CEO for an additional three years, along with the formalised full appointment of Harry Brünjes as chairman of the ENO. Shortly into his tenure, he expressed his disapproval of proposals by the ENO management for economising measures such as a reduction in the contract of the ENO chorus. On 27 February 2016 the ENO chorus had voted to take industrial action in protest at newly proposed contract reductions, but industrial action was averted on 18 March 2016 after a newly negotiated proposal, at a different level of reduced salary, was reached. In general protest at his view of the situation at ENO, Wigglesworth announced his resignation on 22 March 2016 from the ENO music directorship, effective at the end of the 2015–2016 season.

On 29 April 2016, the ENO appointed Daniel Kramer as its new artistic director, effective 1 August 2016, Kramer&#x27;s first appointment as director of an opera company. On 21 October 2016, the ENO announced the appointment of Martyn Brabbins as its next music director, with immediate effect, with an initial contract through October 2020. In September 2017, the ENO announced that Pollock is to stand down as its chief executive in June 2018. In March 2018, ENO announced the appointment of Stuart Murphy as its next chief executive, effective 3 April 2018. In April 2019, ENO announced the resignation of Kramer as its artistic director, effective at the end of July 2019. In October 2019, ENO announced the appointment of Annilese Miskimmon as its next artistic director, effective September 2020. In October 2022, ENO announced that Stuart Murphy would leave the company as Chief Executive in September 2023.

In December 2018, ENO started offering free balcony tickets for Under 18s on Saturdays in an attempt to engage more young people with the opera. This scheme was expanded to Under 21s in 2021 to cover performances throughout the week, with free seats in all parts of the audiotorium.

In November 2022, Arts Council England removed ENO from its National Portfolio, effectively cutting its income by £12.5 million a year. ENO initially responded with a statement that it was looking forward to &#x27;creating a new base out of London, potentially in Manchester&#x27; in line with suggestions by the Arts Council. ENO later shared a petition to have its funding reinstated and to retain its London base at The London Coliseum. In January 2023, ACE and ENO released a joint statement that funding had been reinstated through to 2024, with an aim to &quot;sustain a programme of work at the ENO’s home the London Coliseum, and at the same time help the ENO start planning for a new base outside London by 2026.&quot; In October 2023, Martyn Brabbins resigned as music director of ENO, with immediate effect, in protest at proposed personnel reductions to the company&#x27;s music staff. Two months later, ENO announced the planned establishment of a &quot;main base&quot; in Greater Manchester by 2029. Jenny Mollica was appointed as the company&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2024; she had served as interim CEO since August 2023.

==Repertoire==

The company has aimed to present the standard operatic repertoire, sung in English, and has staged all the major operas of Mozart, Wagner and Puccini, and a wide range of Verdi&#x27;s operas. Under Mackerras and his successors the Czech repertoire has featured strongly, and a broad range of French and Russian operas has been presented. The company has for decades laid stress on opera as drama, and has avoided operas where vocal display takes precedence over musical and dramatic content. In addition to the operatic staples, ENO has a history of presenting new works, and latterly of commissioning them.

===Commissions and premieres===

ENO has commissioned more than a dozen operas by composers including Gordon Crosse, Iain Hamilton, Jonathan Harvey, Alfred Schnittke, Gavin Bryars, David Sawer, Asian Dub Foundation and Nico Muhly. The company&#x27;s best known world premiere was &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 1945. Subsequent world premieres have included &quot;The Mines of Sulphur&quot; (1965), &quot;The Mask of Orpheus&quot; (1986), &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot; (1999), and works by Malcolm Williamson, Iain Hamilton, David Blake, Robin Holloway, Julian Anderson and Stephen Oliver. British stage premieres include operas by Verdi (&quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, 1948), Janáček (&quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;, 1951), Stravinsky (&quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, 1960), Prokofiev (&quot;War and Peace&quot;, 1972) and Philip Glass (&quot;Akhnaten&quot;, 1985, among others).

===Operetta and musicals===
From the beginning, the company interspersed serious opera with lighter works. In the early years the &quot;Irish Ring&quot; (&quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, &quot;The Lily of Killarney&quot; and &quot;Maritana&quot;) featured in Old Vic and Sadler&#x27;s Wells seasons. After the Second World War, the company began to programme operetta, including &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1958), &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1958), &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; (1960), &quot;Merrie England&quot; (1960), &quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; (1961), &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Gipsy Baron&quot; (1964).

The company has produced most of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy operas. After the successful &quot;Iolanthe&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Patience&quot; in 1969, the last much revived in the UK, the U.S. and on the continent, a second production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in 1986 starred the comedian Eric Idle in a black-and-white setting moved to a 1920s English seaside hotel. It has been regularly revived over 25 years. A 1992 production of &quot;Princess Ida&quot; directed by Ken Russell was a critical and box office disaster, ran briefly, and was not revived. &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was produced in 2005. A highly coloured production of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; opened in 2006; the press pointed out that the company&#x27;s diction had declined to the point that the recently introduced surtitles were essential. In 2015 the film director Mike Leigh directed a new production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;; the critical consensus was disappointment that Leigh had chosen one of the supposedly weaker operas in the Savoy canon, but the show provided a box-office hit. The cinema live broadcast of the production broke all previous box-office records for UK opera cinema-event releases. Cal McCrystal directed &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (2018) and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (2021). The company produced &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; in 2022.

From the 1980s the company has experimented with Broadway shows, including &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; (1987), &quot;Street Scene&quot; (1989), &quot;On the Town&quot; (2005), &quot;Kismet&quot; (2007), and &quot;Candide&quot; (2008). In many of ENO&#x27;s lighter shows, the size of the Coliseum has been a problem, both in putting across pieces written for much more intimate theatres and in selling enough tickets. In 2015 a new business plan for the ENO included making money from a West End musical partnership with the impresarios Michael Grade and Michael Linnit.

==Recordings==
Recordings of individual scenes and numbers were made by Sadler&#x27;s Wells singers from the company&#x27;s earliest days. In 1972 an LP set was issued bringing together many of these recordings, prefaced with a tribute to Lilian Baylis recorded in 1936. Among the singers in the set are Joan Cross, Heddle Nash, Edith Coates, Joan Hammond, Owen Brannigan, Peter Pears, Peter Glossop and Charles Craig. The conductors include Lawrance Collingwood, Reginald Goodall and Michael Mudie.

After the Second World War, the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company made a 78 r.p.m. set of excerpts from &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; (1949), but made no more recordings until the stereo LP era. In the 1950s and 1960s, the company recorded a series of abridged sets of operas and operettas for EMI, each occupying two LP sides. All were sung in English. The opera sets were &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; (1960), &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (1962), and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; (1966). The abridged operetta recordings were &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1959), &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1959), &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (1960), &quot;La vie parisienne&quot; (1961), &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; (1960), &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1962), &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot; (1965). A complete recording of &quot;The Mikado&quot; was released in 1962.

Excerpts from the company&#x27;s &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; were recorded in German under Mackerras (1972) and in English under Goodall (1973). EMI recorded the complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle during public performances at the Coliseum between 1973 and 1977. Chandos Records has since reissued the cycle on CD, and also produced the first official release of a live 1968 recording of the company&#x27;s &quot;The Mastersingers&quot;, in a 2008 release.

In the CD era, ENO was featured as part of a series of operatic recordings, sung in English, released by Chandos Records. Some were reissues of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera or ENO recordings originally issued by EMI: &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; (recorded in 1982) and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1985), both starring Janet Baker, and &quot;La traviata&quot; (1981), starring Valerie Masterson. Newer recordings, made specifically for the Chandos series, whilst having no official connection with the ENO, featured many past and present members of the company. Conductors include Sir Charles Mackerras, Sir Mark Elder and Paul Daniel. Those in which the chorus and orchestra of the ENO appear are &quot;Lulu&quot;, &quot;The Makropoulos Affair&quot;, &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;Ernani&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot;, as well as the live recordings of &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Mastersingers&quot;.

==Education==
In 1966, under the company&#x27;s head of design, Margaret Harris, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Design Course was founded; it later became Motley Theatre Design Course. ENO Baylis, founded in 1985, is the education department of the ENO; it aims to introduce new audiences to opera and &quot;to deepen and enrich the experience of current audiences in an adventurous, creative and engaging manner.&quot; The programme offers training for students and young professionals, and also workshops, commissions, talks and debates, which is now called ENO Engage.

<text>The East Coast Greenway is a pedestrian and bicycle route between Maine and Florida along the East Coast of the United States. The nonprofit East Coast Greenway Alliance was created in 1991 with the goal to use the entire route with off-road, shared-use paths; , over of the route (35%) meets these criteria. In 2020, the Greenway received over 50 million visits.

==History==

In 1991, a group of cyclists and long-distance trail enthusiasts met in New York City and formed a national non-profit organization, the East Coast Greenway Alliance (ECGA), to plan and promote a greenway linking existing and planned trails into a contiguous &quot;spine route&quot; between Atlantic coast cities.

In summer 1992, the ECGA sent nine cyclists from Boston, New York City, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., on a 30-day &quot;exploratory&quot; cycle tour.

In 1993, tours went along the route to explore options and promote the idea of the greenway. In 1994, the first promotional tour took place from Maine to Washington, D.C. &quot;East Coast Greenway&quot; became a trademark in 1995.

The first five trail segments were designated in 1996. These segments were the Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Trail in Maryland, the Charter Oak Greenway in Connecticut, the Coventry Greenway in Rhode Island, the Farmington Canal Greenway in Connecticut, and the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal Trail in New Jersey. These trails make up of the greenway.

Between 1997 and 2000, about of trail segments were designated throughout the region. In 2000, Amtrak became a partner, helping to open access to various parts of the route. Between February and June 2000, the ECG Wave non-motorized relay carried a bottle of seawater from Key West to Canada along the route of the ECG. From 2001 to 2004, another were designated, and multiple states stepped in to help finalize their section of the route. This brought in more partnerships with government organizations, such as NJDOT, that would be essential for trail development. In 2003, members of the House of Representatives and the Senate signed letters to President Bush in support of the greenway.

In 2004, seven cyclists rode the entire route, from Key West to Calais, in 55 days. Later that year, the first Maine-to-Florida tour was held; four cyclists completed the event in 52 days, raising $75,000. In the following years, more people would complete the ride outside of ECG events. A 2005 &quot;GQ&quot; magazine article about a ride by Wil Hylton brought national attention to the greenway.

The entire spine route was finalized and mapped in 2008. The accessibility of the trail expanded with support of the states, and more events were held each year.

In 2020, the route reached over of completed off-road greenway. Efforts to increase the amount of off-road routes are continuing. In 2020 the greenway received over 50 million visits.

On June 25, 2021, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law adding the state&#x27;s section of the greenway as its tenth State Trail.

== East Coast Greenway Alliance ==
The East Coast Greenway Alliance (ECGA) is a nonprofit organization that oversees, but does not own, the greenway. The Alliance is based in Durham, North Carolina, next to the American Tobacco Trail. Six Greenway coordinators work remotely in their regions.

The Alliance coordinates the Greenway&#x27;s growth by working with local, state, regional, and national organizations and agencies. The Alliance is in charge of designating new trail segments and finding routes for the greenway, posting signs designating the path, spreading awareness of the project, and providing maps and information about the greenway.

ECGA advocates for safe access to bike paths on roadways and bridges, as well as convenient access to public transportation for cyclists. In addition, the Alliance promotes the use of alternate transportation, such as use of greenways.

<text>Pringles is an American brand of stackable potato-based chips invented by Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) in 1968 and marketed as &quot;Pringle&#x27;s Newfangled Potato Chips&quot;. It is technically considered an extruded snack because of the manufacturing process. The brand was sold in 2012 to Kellanova, but in 2024 Kellanova, Kellogg&#x27;s parent company agreed to be purchased by Mars Inc.

 Pringles were sold in more than 140 countries. In 2012, Pringles were the fourth most popular snack brand after Lay&#x27;s, Doritos, and Cheetos (all manufactured by Frito-Lay), with 2.2% market share globally.

== History ==
In 1956, Procter &amp; Gamble assigned a task to chemist Fredric J. Baur (1918–2008): to develop a new kind of potato chip to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags. Baur spent two years developing saddle-shaped chips from fried dough, and selected a tubular can as the chips&#x27; container. The saddle-shape of Pringles chips is mathematically known as a hyperbolic paraboloid. However, Baur could not figure out how to make the chips palatable, and was pulled off the task to work on another brand.

In the mid-1960s another P&amp;G researcher, Alexander Liepa of Montgomery, Ohio, restarted Baur&#x27;s work and succeeded in improving the taste. Although Baur designed the shape of the Pringles chip, Liepa&#x27;s name is on the patent. Gene Wolfe, a mechanical engineer and author known for science fiction and fantasy novels, helped develop the machine that cooked them.

In 1968, P&amp;G first marketed Pringles in Indiana. The earliest mention in an advertisement was on October 3, 1968, where a newspaper in Evansville, Indiana advertised &quot;Pringle Potato Chips&quot; as being &quot;New at Kroger&quot;. Afterward, they were gradually distributed around the rest of the country and by 1975, were available across most of the US. By 1991, Pringles were distributed internationally.

There are several theories behind the origin of the product&#x27;s name. One theory refers to Mark Pringle, who filed a US Patent 2,286,644 titled &quot;Method and Apparatus for Processing Potatoes&quot; on March 5, 1937. Pringle&#x27;s work was cited by P&amp;G in filing their own patent for improving the taste of dehydrated processed potatoes. Another theory suggests that two Procter advertising employees lived on Pringle Drive in Finneytown (north of Cincinnati, Ohio), and the name paired well with &quot;potato chips&quot;. Another theory says that P&amp;G chose the Pringles name from a Cincinnati telephone book. Another source says that the name Pringles was &quot;chosen out of a hat&quot; to promote a family name appeal.

The product was originally known as Pringle&#x27;s Newfangled Potato Chips, but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato &quot;chip&quot; since they were made from a potato-based dough rather than being sliced from potatoes. The US Food and Drug Administration weighed in on the matter, and in 1975 they ruled Pringles could only use the word &quot;chip&quot; in their product name within the phrase: &quot;potato chips made from dried potatoes&quot;. Faced with such a lengthy and unpalatable appellation, Pringles eventually renamed their product potato &quot;crisps&quot;, instead of chips.

In July 2008, in the London High Court, P&amp;G lawyers successfully argued that Pringles were not crisps (the term by which potato chips are known in British English), even though labelled &quot;Potato Crisps&quot; on the container, as the potato content was only 42% and their shape, P&amp;G stated, &quot;is not found in nature&quot;. This ruling, against a United Kingdom value added tax (VAT) and Duties Tribunal decision to the contrary, exempted Pringles from the then 17.5% VAT for potato crisps and potato-derived snacks. In May 2009, the Court of Appeal reversed the earlier decision. A spokesman for P&amp;G stated it had been paying the VAT proactively and owed no back taxes.

In April 2011, P&amp;G agreed to the US$2.35 billion sale of the brand to Diamond Foods of California, a deal which would have more than tripled the size of Diamond&#x27;s snack business. However, the deal fell through in February 2012 after a year-long delay due to issues over Diamond&#x27;s accounts. On May 31, 2012, Kellogg&#x27;s officially acquired Pringles for $2.695 billion as part of a plan to grow its international snacks business. The acquisition of Pringles made Kellogg&#x27;s the second-largest snack company in the world. In 2024 Kellonova, Kellogg&#x27;s parent company agreed to be purchased by Mars Inc.

As of 2015, there were five Pringles factories worldwide: in Jackson, Tennessee; Mechelen, Belgium; Johor, Malaysia; Kutno, Poland; and Fujian, China.

== Ingredients ==
Pringles have about 42% potato content, the remainder being wheat starch and flours (corn and rice) combined with vegetable oils, an emulsifier, salt, and seasoning. Other ingredients can include sweeteners such as maltodextrin and dextrose, monosodium glutamate (MSG), disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, sodium caseinate, modified food starch, monoglyceride and diglyceride, autolyzed yeast extract, natural and artificial flavorings, malted barley flour, wheat bran, dried black beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.; Pringles varieties vary in their ingredients.

Pringles also produces several &quot;tortilla&quot; and &quot;multi-grain&quot; varieties which have some of their base starch ingredients replaced with corn flour, rice, wheat bran, black beans, and barley flour. At one point in the early 1990s, &quot;Corn Pringles&quot; were available; the canister was black and had cartoon images of corn. The chips were made of corn and resembled a corn chip in flavor and texture. Rice Pringles were also available in the UK although they have since been discontinued.

== Nutrition ==
One serving of about 15 Pringles (Original flavor) contains 150 kilocalories, 2.5 g of saturated fat, 150 mg of sodium, 110 mg of potassium, and 1 g of protein.

== Flavors ==

Pringles are available in several flavors. Until the 1980s, only the original flavor was available in the US. Standard flavors in the US include original, salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, barbecue, hot and spicy, and loaded baked potato. Some flavors are distributed only to limited market areas; for example, prawn cocktail, wasabi, and curry flavors have been available in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

Occasionally, P&amp;G has produced limited edition runs. Seasonal flavors, past and present, include ketchup, zesty lime and chili, chili cheese dog, &quot;pizzalicious&quot;, paprika, Texas BBQ sauce, buffalo wing, and cajun. A &quot;low-fat&quot; variety was also sold. Examples of limited edition flavors include jalapeño, honey mustard, cheesy fries, onion blossom, mozzarella cheese stick, screamin&#x27; dill pickle, and Mexican-layered dip. In 2012, the seasonal flavors &quot;peppermint white chocolate&quot;, cinnamon sugar, and &quot;pumpkin pie spice&quot; were introduced. 

Other examples of limited runs only in certain parts of the world include mozzarella stick with marinara in North America and jalapeño in Latin America, also soft-shelled crab, grilled shrimp, seaweed, &quot;blueberry and hazelnut&quot;, and &quot;lemon and sesame&quot; in Asia in early 2010s. The grilled shrimp chips are pink in color, while the seaweed variety is green.

Two limited-market flavors, cheeseburger and &quot;Taco Night&quot;, were recalled in March 2010 as a safety precaution after &quot;Salmonella&quot; was found in a Basic Food Flavors plant which produced the flavor-enhancing hydrolyzed vegetable protein used in those flavors.

==Marketing==
Pringles is advertised in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland with the slogan &quot;Once you pop, the fun don&#x27;t stop&quot; along with the original slogan &quot;Once you pop, you can&#x27;t stop!&quot;
The original Pringles television commercials were written, produced and directed by Thomas Scott Cadden (composer of the original Mr. Clean jingle) in 1968, while working at Tatham-Laird and Kudner Advertising Agency in Chicago.

Throughout its history, Pringles used its print and television advertising campaigns to compare their products to conventional potato chips. In its early years, they were marketed as &quot;Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips&quot; and had a small silver pull-top to open the can. Unlike the current advertising, they only mentioned that, with their pull-top cans (which have been replaced with foil tops since the late 1980s), their chips remain fresh and unbroken, the can holds as many chips as a typical large bag, and their curvy shape allows them to be stackable; thus inspiring the slogan, &quot;Other potato chips just don&#x27;t stack up.&quot;

By the 1980s, the company launched the &quot;Pringle Jingle&quot;, whose lyrics were &quot;Once you taste the flavor (&quot;It&#x27;s a deep-fried taste!&quot;), then you get the fever (&quot;With a crispy crunch!&quot;), then you&#x27;ve got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle!&quot;

Beginning in the late 1990s and continuing today, Pringles advertising has returned to comparing their product to bagged chips, which they view as greasy and broken. In a typical ad, a group of people are enjoying Pringles, while a lone person is eating a bag of generic potato chips (the bags themselves resemble either Lay&#x27;s or Ruffles, depending on the Pringles variety marketed in the ad). They dump out some broken potato chips into their hand, only to find they are greasy, and end up wiping the grease on their clothing.

Pringles, as a product brand, is especially known for its packaging, a tubular paperboard can with a foil-lined interior (until the 1980s, the cans also contained a removable pleated paper liner which held the chips in place) and a resealable plastic lid, which was invented by Fredric J. Baur, an organic chemist and food storage technician who specialized in research and development and quality control for Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble. Baur&#x27;s children honored his request to bury him in one of the cans by placing part of his cremated remains in a Pringles container in his grave.

The can has been criticized for being difficult to recycle due to the multiple materials used in its construction.

In 2013, Lucasfilm and Pringles jointly commissioned crowdsourcing video studio Tongal for a commercial, with a total of $75,000 in prize money distributed to seven finalists.

In January 2021, a Pringles campaign took the character Frank out of the Raw Fury video game &quot;West of Dead&quot; in a live Twitch stream. Leahviathan, a gaming influencer, was playing the game and Frank reached through the screen, entered the real world and interacted with players.

The aerodynamics of Pringles chips (as well as other consumer products) have been optimized for food processing using supercomputers. Kellogg&#x27;s has used this fact in a 2022 Pringles advertisement campaign.

== Logo and mascot ==

The Pringles logo is a stylized cartoon caricature of the head of a male figure designed by Louis R. Dixon, with a large mustache and parted bangs (until 2001, the character had eyebrows and his bow tie framed the product name; in 1998, the bangs and lips were removed from the logo, and his head was widened a little). In 2020, the character was again revised with a minimalistic approach to generally negative reception.

The mascot originally had no name, and the name originated with a Wikipedia hoax; in 2006, an editor inserted the then-hoax &quot;Julius&quot; into the Pringles Wikipedia article, which was subsequently picked up by other news outlets. The editors supported and promoted their claim through creating a Facebook page to raise awareness of Julius Pringles being his name. Prior to this the mascot was officially known only as &quot;Mr. P&quot;, no first name. By 2013, the name had spread and in a case of , Kellogg formally acknowledged Julius Pringles (abbreviated as &quot;Mr. P&quot;).

<text>Theodor Wulf (28 July 1868 – 19 June 1946) was a German physicist and Jesuit priest who was one of the first experimenters to detect excess atmospheric radiation.

Theodor Wulf became a Jesuit priest at the age of 20, before studying physics with Walther Nernst at the University of Göttingen. He taught physics at Valkenburg, a Jesuit University from 1904 to 1914 and 1918-1935. He designed and built an electrometer which could detect the presence of energetic charged particles (or electromagnetic waves). Since natural radiation sources on the ground were detected by his electrometer, he predicted that if he moved far enough away from those sources he would detect less radiation.

To test his hypothesis, in 1910 he compared the radiation at the bottom and the top of the Eiffel Tower. He found that the ionisation fell from 6 ions cm−3 to 3.5 ions cm−3 as he ascended the Eiffel Tower (330m). If the ionisation had been due to γ-rays originating at the surface of the Earth, the intensity of ions should have halved in 80m. Energy was coming from outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and being detected by his device; this radiation was from cosmic rays. He published a paper in &quot;Physikalische Zeitschrift&quot; detailing the results of his four days of observation on the Eiffel Tower. His results were not initially accepted.

<text>Norman Carl Odam (born September 5, 1947, in Lubbock, Texas), known professionally as the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, is an outsider performer who is considered one of the pioneers of the genre that came to be known as psychobilly in the 1960s.

==Early life==
Odam was interested in space travel from early childhood, recalling that at kindergarten age he &quot;used to look at the moon and [tell himself] that some day man will go to the moon.&quot; As a teenager he combined his interests in outer space and the American west to create the name &quot;Stardust Cowboy&quot;, adding the word &quot;legendary&quot; because &quot;I am a legend in my own time.&quot; The fact that the initials of &quot;Legendary Star Dust&quot;, LSD, referred to a popular drug at the time was coincidental; he claims to have adopted the name in 1961, before the drug was popularized.

Odam took up music in his high school years as a means toward popularity and impressing girls. Inspired by Chet Atkins, he learned guitar and also taught himself to play the bugle. After high school he briefly attended college, majoring in electronics.

==&quot;Paralyzed&quot;==
While in college Odam had the idea of &quot;writing a wild song that would captivate everybody.&quot; This led to his writing of a song, &quot;Paralyzed&quot;, which he performed at local talent contests. He recorded &quot;Paralyzed&quot; in 1968 in what was apparently a moment of spare time in a recording studio in Fort Worth, Texas. He played dobro and bugle, while T-Bone Burnett played drums. The track features unintelligible snarls, growls, and similar vocalisms, surrounded by frantic strumming on acoustic guitar, Burnett&#x27;s equally frantic drumming, and occasional slurred yelps of the song&#x27;s title, &quot;Paralyzed!&quot; The words that are uttered change with each performance, and are occasionally somewhat intelligible; the song&#x27;s main storyline centers on Odam&#x27;s unrequited love for a real-life &quot;beautiful cheerleader from Lubbock.&quot;

Five hundred copies of the single were initially pressed and were released on Odam&#x27;s own Psycho-Suave label. The song gained some regional popularity and was picked up by a major label, Mercury Records. The song&#x27;s popularity earned &quot;the Ledge&quot; (as he is known by fans) an appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-in&quot; comedy television series, season 2, episode 10. He dressed in his trademark buckskin jacket, boots and spurs, and ten-gallon hat and, presumably backed by T-Bone Burnett on drums, performed &quot;Paralyzed&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Who’s Knocking On My Door&quot;. During the latter song the entire &quot;Laugh-In&quot; cast joined him on stage and began cavorting and clowning around. The Ledge, in his words, &quot;got mad and ran off the set. That wasn&#x27;t part of the act.&quot; The song also made an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; during the show&#x27;s &#x27;Do Not Play&#x27; sketch.

In 1973, NASA used the song to wake up members of its space crew. The crew was allegedly so distracted from the shock over the course of the day that NASA forbade the use of the song for that purpose ever again, effectively banning the song from space.

In the 1994 book &quot;The New Book of Rock Lists&quot;, writers Dave Marsh and James Bernard name &quot;Paralyzed&quot; the &quot;Worst Song Issued by a Major Label&quot;. They write that the Legendary Stardust Cowboy was &quot;a one-man band incapable of playing any instrument, singing in tune, or keeping in time even with himself,&quot; but note that &quot;certain outlaw country fans consider &#x27;Paralyzed&#x27; a camp classic.&quot; Conversely, critic Toby Creswell includes the song in his book &quot;1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them&quot; (2005). In 1976, &quot;Paralyzed&quot; ranked 15th in the first ever Festive Fifty, a top 50 list documenting the favourite songs of listeners of John Peel&#x27;s radio show. Classical pianist Paul Lewis considers the song his guilty pleasure.

==Later career==
Odam was invited to appear on other programs but these were canceled because of a musicians&#x27; strike that halted live television performances. By the time the strike was over, his 15 minutes of fame had lapsed. Historian Rob Weiner of Texas Tech University considers Odam&#x27;s musical career &quot;a product of desperation,&quot; a result of the adage that &quot;there is nothing to do in Lubbock&quot;. &quot;Paralyzed&quot; went on to be featured on several Doctor Demento compilations, and it often appears prominently in lists of the worst recordings ever made.

Odam has continued recording intermittently since &quot;Paralyzed&quot; and released several albums and singles. &quot;I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship&quot;—an LSD-tinged satire of &quot;I Thought About You&quot;—was covered by longtime fan David Bowie on his &quot;Heathen&quot; album. Odam, who was largely oblivious to Bowie&#x27;s fandom of his work, returned the compliment by recording his version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Bowie himself said that the term &quot;stardust&quot; in &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is taken from The Legendary Stardust Cowboy.
On a live online chatroom in his own ISP, BowieNet, Bowie was asked where he had discovered the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, to which he replied: &quot;When I first joined Mercury Records in the late 60s, he was one of the only other artists they had. And they gave me his entire catalogue, which at the time was three singles. I immediately fell in love with his music. Well actually, the IDEA of his music. As the music itself wasn&#x27;t too recognizable as being such.&quot; Bowie has often mentioned his love for Odam&#x27;s music.

A documentary of Odam&#x27;s career, entitled &quot;Cotton Pickin’ Smash! The Story of the Legendary Stardust Cowboy&quot;, was prepared during the late 1980s. It remains unreleased commercially but is occasionally viewed non-commercially.

Odam currently resides in San Jose, California. In keeping with his passion for space, he has worked for a private contractor that works with NASA and still performs regularly. Since the late 1990s, Odam has played with a backing band called the Altamont Boys, which includes bassist Klaus Flouride (of Dead Kennedys), guitarist Jay Rosen (of The Better Beatles), and drummer Joey Meyers. In May 2007, he played at the David Bowie High-Line festival in New York City at Bowie&#x27;s invitation. Weiner said that Odam has never returned to perform in Lubbock, having believed that his hometown, where he first gained experience by playing in parking lots to draw an audience, offered him little encouragement.

College radio station KMSU in Mankato, Minnesota flew the Legendary Stardust Cowboy and his band to Mankato in May 2010 for a show, at which the mayor declared, officially, that May 21 is &quot;Legendary Stardust Cowboy Day&quot; in Mankato. Mankato has emerged as a &quot;Mecca&quot; for Legendary Stardust Cowboy fans, perhaps second only to San Francisco, California.

In 2010, Odam played himself in the independent film &quot;Rainbows End&quot;, a mockumentary about a band traveling from Texas to California to record an album with him.

In late 2011, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy released an anthology of his life&#x27;s work, a double CD on Cherry Red Records from England, titled &quot;For Sarah, Raquel, and David: An Anthology&quot;. The names refer to Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York; Raquel Welch, actress; and performing artist David Bowie, all longtime fans of The Ledge&#x27;s work.

In 2020, Jeff Feuerzeig began work on a documentary on Odam&#x27;s life, which will feature interviews with Odam interspersed with animations based on interviews of people close to him. It is being developed in the vein of Feuerzeig&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Johnston&quot;. No release date was set , as production had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Nicolae &quot;Nicu&quot; Covaci (19 April 1947 – 2 August 2024) was a Romanian guitarist, painter, and music composer. He is best known as the leader and founding member of rock and cult band Phoenix, for which he was the lead vocalist and guitar player, with more than 60 years of activity.

==Biography==
Nicolae Covaci was born in Timișoara, on 19 April 1947. He took up playing guitar at the age of 15 and in 1962 he, together with Florin &quot;Moni&quot; Bordeianu, founded a band called Sfinții (The Saints). Covaci died in Timișoara on 2 August 2024, at the age of 77.

==1960s==
* 1962: Nicolae Covaci founds the student band &quot;Sfinții&quot; (The Saints) in Timișoara. The band wins the second prize at the Bucharest Student Festival. From the very beginning the band is criticized for having a western European influence.
* 1963: The band&#x27;s recordings of their own compositions first receive radio air play.
* 1965: The Saints are banned. The authorities accuse the band of spreading religious propaganda, and the band is forced to change its name. PHOENIX is born. Under their new name, the band plays three times a week at the School of Engineering cantina, and later at &quot;Lola&quot;, the club of the Construction Industry Union in Timișoara.
* 1968: PHOENIX wins the Grand-Prix of the Romanian Festival in Iasi. The band receives its first recording contract and makes regular appearances on radio and TV. PHOENIX releases its first record &quot;Vremuri&quot;(Times), an EP with four songs.
* 1969: The band wins prizes for creativity and interpretation at the Romanian student festival at the School of Architecture in Bucharest. Their second four-song EP called &quot;Floarea stincilor&quot; (The flower of the rocks) is released.

==1970s==
* 1970: PHOENIX again wins a prize (for originality) at the Romanian student festival at the School of Architecture in Bucharest.
* 1971: The band changes its style and finds its own direction, inspired by pre-Christian rites and customs of the Balkans. Their third EP &quot;Mesterul Manole&quot; is released with three songs. PHOENIX is invited to play at the &quot;Bratislava Lyra&quot; and &quot;Sopot&quot; festivals in Czechoslovakia and Poland-the band is a big hit.
* 1972: &quot;Cei ce ne-au dat nume&quot; (&quot;The Ones Who Gave us the Name&quot;), the band&#x27;s first LP is released. After the release of the second LP with the metaphoric title &quot;Mugur de fluier&quot; (&quot;Flute bud&quot;) the authorities ban PHOENIX from appearing in Romania.
* 1973: &quot;Cantafabule&quot; is released. It is their first double LP and a milestone in Romanian music history.
* 1974: PHOENIX plays concerts with the ensemble &quot;The Drummers from Brănești&quot;, a group of 25 men from a small village in the Carpathians, who play traditional rhythms on different drums.
*Leaving 1976: Nicu Covaci renounces his Romanian citizenship and leaves Romania for Amsterdam. Nicu Covaci founds a new band with musicians of different nationalities.
* 1977: Covaci returns to Romania and helps the members of his band escape. They hide in the band&#x27;s Marshall speakers and are smuggled across four borders to Germany.

==1980s – The New Phoenix==
* 1978: The band breaks up. The band members leave Covaci and try to make it on their own under the name &quot;Madhouse&quot;.
* 1981: PHOENIX releases its first production in English, the LP &quot;Transsylvania Phoenix&quot;. The band disintegrates again.
* 1983: Nicu Covaci plays with Dzidek Marcinkiewicz as a duo.
* 1986: Nicu Covaci and Erlend Krauser contribute to the production of &quot;Evita&quot; in Osnabrück.

* 1988: Release of the single &quot;Tuareg&quot; + &quot;Mr. G&#x27;s promises&quot;.

==1990s – Covaci returns to Romania==
* 1990: PHOENIX launches a gigantic come-back in Romania. The band raffles off 5000 singles of &quot;Ciocârlia&quot;.

===Tours in Romania===
* 1992: Nicolae Covaci produces the CD &quot;Symphoenix&quot; with the Romanian choir &quot;Song&quot; and the Radio Bucharest Symphonic Orchestra.

==2000s==
* 2000: Spring tour in Romania. For the first time in history, a free CD is given with each ticket purchased. 35,000 maxi-CDs are given as gifts.

A new album, called &quot;Baba Novak&quot; is released. The guitarist Cristi Gram joins the band in 2004. The release of the album is followed by a tour of the band in many cities of Romania.

Break-up (2007)
Following conflicts between Nicu Covaci and Mircea Baniciu, the vocalist of the band, the latter leaves Phoenix. Soon, the bassist, Joszef &quot;Ioji&quot; Kappl, and the violinist, Mani Neumann, leave the band, too.

<text>County Louth ( ; ) is a coastal county in the Eastern and Midland Region of Ireland, within the province of Leinster. Louth is bordered by the counties of Meath to the south, Monaghan to the west, Armagh to the north and Down to the north-east, across Carlingford Lough. It is the smallest county in Ireland by land area and the 17th most populous, with just over 139,100 residents as of 2022. The county is named after the village of Louth. Louth County Council is the local authority for the county.

==History==
County Louth is named after the village of Louth, which in turn is named after Lugh, a god of the ancient Irish. Historically, the placename has had various spellings; , , and (see Historic Names List, for full listing). is the modern simplified spelling.

The county is steeped in myth, legend and history, and is a setting in the epic. Later it saw the influence of the Vikings, as seen in the name of Carlingford Lough. They also established a longphort at Annagassan in the ninth century. At this time Louth consisted of three sub-kingdoms, each subject to separate over-kingdoms: ; ; and, the . The whole area became part of the O&#x27;Carroll Kingdom of (Oriel) early in the 12th century under . At the same time, the area was removed from the diocese of Armagh and the episcopal see of the Diocese of Airgíalla or Clogher was transferred to Louth .

A number of historic sites are in the county, including religious sites at Monasterboice, Mellifont Abbey and the St Mary Magdalene Dominican Friary.

The Normans occupied the Louth area in the 1180s, forming the County of Oriel (Uriel or Vriell) out of the O&#x27;Carroll kingdom. At this time the western boundary of occupation was unfixed and Monaghan was still considered part of Oriel. However, over time, Louth became differentiated as &#x27;English&#x27; Oriel, to distinguish it from the remainder (&#x27;Irish&#x27; Oriel), outside the control of the Norman colony, which had passed into the hands of the McMahon lordship of .

In the early 14th century Edward Bruce made claim to the High Kingship of Ireland and led an expeditionary force to Ireland. The Scottish army was repulsed from Drogheda but laid waste to much of the Anglo-Norman colony of Ireland including Ardee and Dundalk. Edward was crowned on the hill of Maledon near Dundalk on 2 May 1316. His army was finally defeated and Edward was killed in the Battle of Faughart near Dundalk, by a chiefly local force led by John de Bermingham. He was created 1st Earl of Louth and granted estates at Ardee on 12 May 1319 as a reward for his services to the Crown in defeating the Scots. De Bermingham was subsequently killed in the Braganstown massacre on 13 June 1329 along with some 200 members of his family and household, in a feud between the Anglo-Irish families of Louth.

One of the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1465 (5 Ed. IV, 3) stated &quot;That every Irishman that dwell betwixt or amongst Englishmen in the County of Dublin, Myeth, Vriell [i.e. Oriel], and Kildare ... shall take to him an English surname of one town, as Sutton, Chester, Trym, Skryne, Corke, Kinsale; or colour, as white, blacke, browne; or arte or science, as smith or carpenter; or office, as cooke, butler ...&quot;. This was an attempt to compel Irish families in the Pale, including Louth, to adopt English surnames.

In 1189, a royal charter was granted to Dundalk after a Norman nobleman named Bertram de Verdun erected a manor house at Castletown Mount. Bertram&#x27;s granddaughter Roesia de Verdun later built Castle Roche in 1236. In 1412, a royal charter was granted to Drogheda which unified the towns of Drogheda-in-Meath and Drogheda-in-Uriel (Louth) as a County in its own right, styled as &#x27;the County of the town of Drogheda&#x27;. Drogheda continued as a County Borough until the setting up of County Councils, through the enactment of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which saw all of Drogheda, including a large area south of the River Boyne, become part of an extended County Louth.

Until the late 16th century, 1596, Louth was considered part of Ulster, before becoming part of Leinster after a conference held at Faughart between the Chiefs of Ulster (Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell), on the Irish side, and the Ulster-born Miler Magrath, Anglican Archbishop of Cashel, and Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond on that of the English. The lands of Ballymascanlan, part of the former estates of Mellifont Abbey, were transferred from Armagh to Louth .

The 16th and 17th centuries featured many skirmishes and battles involving Irish and English forces, as Louth was on the main route to &#x27;the Moiry Pass&#x27; and the Ulster areas often in rebellion and as yet uncolonised. Oliver Cromwell attacked Drogheda in 1649 slaughtering the Royalist garrison and hundreds of the town&#x27;s citizens. Towards the end of the same century, the armies of the warring Kings, James II and William (III) of Orange, faced off in south Louth during the build-up to the Battle of the Boyne; the battle was fought west from Drogheda. Drogheda held for James under Lord Iveagh but surrendered to William the day after the battle of the Boyne.

In 1798, the leaders of the United Irishmen included Bartholomew Teeling, John Byrne, and Patrick Byrne, all from Castletown; Anthony Marmion from Louth Town and Dundalk, Anthony McCann from Corderry; Nicholas and Thomas Markey from Barmeath, and Arthur McKeown, John Warren, and James McAllister from Cambricville. They were betrayed by informers, notably a Dr Conlan, who came from Dundalk, and an &quot;agent provocateur&quot; called Sam Turner, from Newry. Several leaders were hanged.

The Burning of Wildgoose Lodge took place on the night of 29–30 October 1816, for which 18 men were executed.

The priest and scientist Nicholas Callan (1799–1864), inventor of the first induction coil, was from Darver.

== Geography ==
Louth, colloquially known as &quot;The Wee County&quot;, is the smallest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by area. It is the 17th most populous county, making it the fourth most densely populated county on the island of Ireland. It is the smallest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties in size and the 6th-largest by population. Louth is bordered by four counties – Meath to the south, Monaghan to the west, Armagh to the north, and Down to the northeast. It bounded to the east by the Irish Sea. Dundalk is the county town and is located approximately from Belfast and from Dublin. Louth is also the northernmost county in Leinster, and the only county in the province to share a border with Northern Ireland.

===Climate===

Louth has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), with cool humid summers and mild winters, strongly influenced by Atlantic ocean currents. Coastal areas generally experience milder winters and cooler, windier summers than inland areas. Daytime highs are generally in the range throughout the county in July, with overnight lows in the range. January and February are the coldest months, with average daily minimum temperatures typically falling below .
Met Éireann records climate data for the county from their station at Boharnamoe, ca. from Ardee, in the southwest of the county. The county&#x27;s record high temperature is , set on 12 July 1983. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Louth was on 1 January 1979, when the temperature at Ardee fell to . Due to the moderating influence of the Irish sea, the temperature at Ardee has only surpassed once since records began in 1968. Prolonged or heavy snow is rare, but most of the county will typically experience snowfall on a few days per year.

Precipitation is evenly distributed year-round, with only about of rainfall separating the wettest months (October and November) from the driest months (March and April). There are a number of synoptic weather stations which solely record rainfall located throughout the county. The driest areas are located along the coast, with average annual rainfall at Clogherhead being , making it one of the driest locations on the island of Ireland. The wettest areas of the county are located around the Cooley Mountains, with the stations at Omeath () and Glenmore () recording the most rainfall in the county.

The coastal areas of the county are particularly vulnerable to flooding and storm surges during the Winter months, and significant flood defences have been constructed along Dundalk Bay. Louth County Council&#x27;s Climate Change Adaptation Strategy identified coastal and riverine flooding as the primary environmental risks to the county.

==Demographics==
===Population===

According to the Central Statistics Office, 139,703 people lived in County Louth as of the 2022 census, a 7.9% increase since the 2016 census. The population density of the county is 169.1 people per square kilometre, more than double the national average, which makes Louth the second most densely populated county in the Republic of Ireland, and the fourth most densely populated county on the island of Ireland. As of 2022, Louth was also the second most urbanised county in the State, with 69.7% of the county&#x27;s population living within urban areas. Under Central Statistics Office (CSO) classification, an &quot;urban area&quot; is a town with a population greater than 1,500. As a result, much of the county outside of the larger towns is relatively sparsely populated, with most small areas (SAs) having a population density of between 20 and 50 people per km2.

The county has two dominant population centres, Dundalk, located in the north of the county, and Drogheda, located in the south on the border with County Meath. These two towns combined comprise approximately 58.9% of the county&#x27;s total population, and are the 6th- and 7th-largest urban areas in Ireland respectively. Overall, Drogheda is the larger of the two.
 
Louth has experienced a rapid rate of population growth since the 1960s, nearly doubling in size in the fifty years between the census of 1966 and that of 2016. Its rate of growth (7.9%) since the 2016 census ranks 13th of 26 counties. The sizeable population growth in the county is influenced by its location along the Dublin–Belfast corridor; with the completion of the M1 motorway in particular driving the growth of Drogheda as a commuter town of Dublin. However, the northern areas of the county along the border with Northern Ireland have experienced a slight decline since 2011.

In 2016, Louth surpassed its pre-famine (1841 Census) population, becoming one of only five counties in the State to do so. As of the 2022 census, 5.9 per cent of the county&#x27;s population was reported as younger than 5 years old, 28.1 per cent were between 5 and 25, 51.8 per cent were between 25 and 65, and 14.2 per cent of the population was older than 65. Of this latter group, 4,591 people (3.3 per cent) were over the age of 80. The population was evenly split between females (50.68 per cent) and males (49.32 per cent).

In 2021, there were 1,677 births within the county, and the average age of a first time mother was 30.5.

===Urban areas===
The most populous towns in Louth as of the 2022 census were (population in parentheses):

===Ethnicity and migration===
As of the 2022 census, the population of County Louth was 85.9% white. Those who identified as White Irish constituted 76.7% of the county&#x27;s population, and Irish Travellers comprised a further 0.7%. Caucasians who did not identify as ethnically Irish accounted for 8.5% of the population.

The second largest ethnic group in Louth in 2022 was black, accounting for 3.3% of the population. Of this group, virtually the entire population lived in the two largest towns, with 56.5% of Louth&#x27;s black residents living in Dundalk and 36.2% living in Drogheda.

Those of Asian and Mixed Race backgrounds accounted for 2.7% (3,808 people) and 1.7% (2,333 people) of the population respectively, with the majority of these groups residing in either Drogheda or Dundalk. Around 9,000 people or 6.4% of the population did not state their ethnicity in 2022, a significant increase from 2.5% in the 2016 census.

In contrast to the other counties in the Mid-East Region, which are characterised by widespread migration from the Dublin area, Louth has one of the highest proportions of native residents in Ireland. Around two-thirds (64.5%) of Louth&#x27;s residents were born within the county, making it the 7th most indigenous county in the State. People from elsewhere in the Republic of Ireland accounted for just 13.9% of Louth&#x27;s population in 2022, compared with 49.2% in neighbouring County Meath to the south. A total of 30,145 people (21.7%) were born outside of the country, up from 24,509 people (19.2%) in 2016.

The largest foreign national groups by citizenship in Louth are: British (1.69%), Polish (1.50 percent), Lithuanian (1.40 percent), Nigerian (0.97 percent), Latvian (0.89 percent) and Romanian (0.57 percent).

===Irish language===
The Cooley Peninsula was the last outpost in Leinster. Speakers of Irish existed around Omeath and into southern Armagh up until the middle of the 20th century. The area had its own local dialect, songs, poetry and traditional customs. The dialect, known as , is now extinct, as the last native speaker, Anne O&#x27;Hanlon, died in 1960 at the age of 89. However, extensive recordings of the dialect were made by German linguist Wilhelm Doegen for the Royal Irish Academy in 1928. An Irish language college, , was originally established in Omeath in 1912, but later moved to Ranafast, County Donegal. In 2012, celebrated its 100th anniversary in Omeath, and locals were taught phrases in .

Uniquely, the Cooley Peninsula had a sizable population of Presbyterian in the late 18th and 19th centuries, owing to its proximity to Ulster. In 1808, Reverend William Neilson published &quot;An introduction to the Irish language&quot; to distribute to Presbyterian ministers in the area, as many in their congregations could not speak English.

Despite its historic , Louth has the lowest percentage of Irish speakers of any county in the State. Just 31.8% of the population stated that they could speak any level of Irish in the 2022 census.

===Religion===
According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the Catholic Church is by far the largest religious institution in County Louth, with 100,077 members. Orthodox Christianity was the second largest religious denomination, with 2,598 adherents. This was followed by Islam in third, with 2,281 adherents, and Anglican denominations including the Church of Ireland, England and Episcopalian in fourth, with 2,195.

The county is located within the archdiocese of Armagh in the Roman Catholic Church, and the Archbishop of Armagh has been recognised by the Vatican as the &quot;Primate of All Ireland&quot; since 1353. This was replicated in the Church of Ireland following the Reformation, and the Protestant Diocese of Armagh covers the same territorial extent as the Catholic diocese. Further, the Archbishop of Armagh also has the title of Primate of All Ireland within the Church of Ireland.

As was the case in much of Ireland, there was a significant increase in the number of people stating that they were either non-religious or atheist in the 2022 Census. This demographic has increased by 202% in a little over a decade (2011 to 2022), from 5,485 to 16,556. People with no religion now account for 11.9% of the county&#x27;s population, up from 8% in 2016.

The fastest growing religions in the county between 2016 and 2022 were Hinduism (107%), Orthodox Christianity (80%) and Pantheism (78%), while the most rapidly declining religions were Lutheran (−23%), Evangelicalism (−19%), Buddhism (−13%) and Apostolic or Pentecostal (−11%). Although Catholicism only recorded a 4.3% decrease, the share of County Louth&#x27;s residents who identified as Catholic fell sharply from 81.8% in 2016 to 72.1% in 2022.

==Local government and politics==

===Louth County Council===

The local authority is Louth County Council, which has its offices in Dundalk, and provides a number of services including planning, roads maintenance, fire brigade, council housing, water supply, waste collection, recycling and landfill, higher education grants and funding for arts and culture.

As of the 2019 local election, Louth has been divided into five local electoral areas, whose councillors sit in three municipal districts: Ardee (which is also a municipal district), Drogheda Rural and Drogheda Rural (which form the borough district of Drogheda), and Dundalk—Carlingford and Dundalk South (which form the municipal district of Dundalk).

====Freedom of the county====
The following people have received the freedom of County Louth.

===Louth Dáil constituency===

For elections to Dáil Éireann, Louth is represented by the five-seat Dáil constituency of Louth which takes all in the county of Louth, and in County Meath, the electoral divisions of Julianstown and part of St. Mary&#x27;s.

The Report on Dáil and European Parliament Constituencies 2007 outlined:
This brought the areas of the Greater Drogheda area in County Meath and their combined population of 20,375 into a single constituency.

<text>A Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) is a family of Power-Electronic based devices designed for use on an Alternating Current (AC) Transmission System to improve and control Power Flow and support Voltage. FACTs devices are alternatives to traditional electric grid solutions and improvements, where building additional Transmission Lines or Substation is not economically or logistically viable.

In general, FACTs devices improve power and voltage in three different ways: Shunt Compensation of Voltage (replacing the function of capacitors or inductors), Series Compensation of Impedance (replacing series capacitors) or Phase-Angle Compensation (replacing Generator Droop-Control or Phase-Shifting Transformers). While other traditional equipment can accomplish all of this, FACTs devices utilize Power Electronics that are fast enough to switch sub-cycle opposed to seconds or minutes. Most FACTs devices are also dynamic and can support voltage across a range rather than just on and off, and are multi-quadrant, i.e. they can both supply and consume Reactive Power, and even sometimes Real Power. All of this give them their &quot;flexible&quot; nature and make them well-suited for applications with unknown or changing requirements.

The FACTs family initially grew out of the development of High-Voltage Direct-Current (HVDC) conversion and transmission, which used Power Electronics to convert AC to DC to enable large, controllable power transfers. While HVDC focused on conversion to DC, FACTs devices used the developed technology to control power and voltage on the AC system. The most common type of FACTs device is the Static VAR Compensator (SVC), which uses Thyristors to switch and control shunt capacitors and reactors, respectively.

== History ==
When AC won the War of Currents in the late 19th century, and electric grids began expanding and connecting cities and states, the need for reactive compensation became apparent. While AC offered benefits with transformation and reduced current, the alternating nature of voltage and current lead to additional challenges with the natural capacitance and inductance of transmission lines. Heavily loaded lines consumed reactive power due to the line&#x27;s inductance, and as transmission voltage increased throughout the 20th century, the higher voltage supplied capacitive reactive power. As operating a transmission line only at it surge impedance loading (SIL) was not feasible, other means to manage the reactive power was needed. 

Synchronous Machines were commonly used at the time for generators, and could provide some reactive power support, however were limited due to the increase in losses it caused. They also became less effective as higher voltage transmissions lines moved loads further from sources. Fixed, shunt capacitor and reactor banks filled this need by being deployed where needed. In particular, shunt capacitors switched by circuit breakers provided an effective means to managing varying reactive power requirements due to changing loads. However, this was not without limitations.

Shunt capacitors and reactors are fixed devices, only able to be switched on and off. This required either a careful study of the exact size needed, or accepting less than ideal effects on the voltage of a transmission line. The need for a more dynamic and flexible solution was realized with the mercury-arc valve in the early 20th century. Similar to a vacuum tube, the mercury-arc valve was a high-powered rectifier, capable of converting high AC voltages to DC. As the technology improved, inverting became possible as well and mercury valves found use in power systems and HVDC ties. When connected to a reactor, different switching pattern could be used to vary the effective inductance connected, allow for more dynamic control. Arc valves continued to dominate power electronics until the rise of solid-state semiconductors in the mid 20th century.

As semiconductors replaced vacuum tubes, the thyristor created the first modern FACTs devices in the Static VAR Compensator (SVC). Effectively working as a circuit breaker that could switch on in milliseconds, it allowed for quickly switching capacitor banks. Connected to a reactor and switched sub-cycle allowed the effective inductance to be varied. The thyristor also greatly improved the control system, allowing an SVC to detect and react to faults to better support the system. The thyristor dominated the FACTs and HVDC world until the late 20th century, when the IGBT began to match its power ratings.

==Theory==
The basic theory for how FACTs devices affect the AC system is based on analyzing how power transfers between two points in an AC system. This is particularly relevant to how an AC electrical grid functions, as the grid has numerous nodes (substations) that lack sources (generators) or loads. Power flow must be calculated and controlled at each node (substation bus) to ensure the grid design and topology itself does not prevent generated electricity from reaching loads, as when Transmission Lines reach dozens to hundreds of miles in length, they add significant impedance and voltage drop to the system.
Given two buses, each with their own voltage magnitude and phase angle, and connected by a Transmission Line with an impedance, the current flowing between them is given byformula_1

Apparent Power flow, and thus real and reactive power, is then given by

formula_2

Combining these two equations gives the real and reactive power flow as a function of voltages and impedance. This can be done relatively easily, and is done in load-flow and power analysis programs, but results in equations that are not intuitive to understand. Two approximations can be made to simplify things: assume a lossless Transmission Line (a decent assumption as very low resistance conductor is typically used) and neglecting any capacitance on the line (a fair assumption for 200kV lines and lower). This reduces the Line impedance to just a reactance, and results in the real and reactive power being

formula_3

formula_4

where

formula_5 is the magnitude of the Sending-End Voltage, at the first bus

formula_6 is the magnitude of the Receiving-End Voltage, at the second bus

formula_7 is the reactance of the Transmission Line between the buses

formula_8 is the phase angle difference between the sending-end and receiving end voltages

From the above equations, it can be seen that there are three variables that affect real and reactive power flow on a Transmission Line: the voltage magnitudes at either bus, the line reactance between the buses, and the voltage phase-angle difference between the buses. All FACTs devices operation on the fundamental principal that changing one or more of these variables will change the real and reactive power flow on the transmission line. Some FACTs devices will just change a single variable, while others will control all three.

It should be noted, and will be made more explicit below, that FACTs devices do not create or add real power to the system, they simply affect the circuit parameters between two points to affect how and when power flows.

== Types of FACTs devices ==
Given that FACTs device can change up to three parameters to affect power flow (voltage, impedance, and/or phase-angle), they are often categorized by what parameter they are controlling. As the conventional devices for controlling voltage (shunt capacitors and shunt inductors) and impedance (series capacitors and load-flow reactors) are so common, FACTs devices targeting voltage and impedance parameters are categorized as shunt and series devices, respectively.

=== Shunt Compensation Devices ===
The goal shunt compensation is to connect a device in parallel with the system that will improve voltage and enable larger power flow. This is traditionally done using shunt capacitors and inductors (reactors), much like Power Factor Correction.

The most common shunt compensation device is the Static VAR Compensator (SVC). SVCs use power electronics, generally Thyristors, to switch fixed capacitors and reactors. These are referred to as Thyristor Switched Capacitor (TSC) and Thyristor Switched Reactor (TSR), respectively. Thyristors are fast enough that they can be switched sub-cycle, and can switch a reactor at different points each cycle to control the vars the reactor produces. When arranged to do this, the TSR is referred to as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR). TCRs produce large amounts of harmonics and require Filter Banks to prevent adverse effects to the system.

Another type of shunt compensation is the Static Synchronous Compensator or STATCOM. Power electronics are combined in series with a reactor to form a Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC), which when connected to an AC system forms a STATCOM. A VSC use the same principal of power flow on a transmission line; measuring the system voltage its connected to and varying the voltage of the power electronics to cause reactive power flow in or out of the VSC. Early STATCOMs used thyristors as their power electronics and Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) to control reactive power, but with advances in semiconductor technologies, Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) have replaced them.

=== Series Compensation Devices ===
Series Compensation devices change the impedance of the Transmission Line to increase or decrease power flow. Power flow is increased by adding a series capacitor to offset line inductance or decreased by adding a series load-flow reactor to add to the line inductance.

One type of series compensation is the Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), which combines the TCR from an SVC in parallel with a traditional fixed series capacitor. As using power electronics to switch capacitors sub-cycle is not feasible due to concerns of stored charge, a TCR is used to create a variable inductance to offset the capacitor. A TCSC can be used to dynamically vary the power flow on a transmission line.

A VSC can also be used as a series compensation device if it&#x27;s connected across the secondary winding of a series-connected transformer. This arrangement is referred to as a Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), and offers the benefits of a smaller reactor than in a TCSC, and the lower harmonic production of a VSC (or Voltage-Source Inverter - VSI when used in a SSSC) compared to a TCR.

=== Phase Angle Compensation ===
Power will only flow between two points on an AC system if there is a phase angle difference between the buses. Traditionally this is controlled by generators, however in large grids this becomes ineffective for managing power flow between distant buses. Phase-Shifting Transformers (PST) are generally used for these applications and can just be a Phase-Angle Regulator (PAR) or control both phase-angle and voltage.

The most straightforward phase angle compensation device would be to replace the tap changer on PAR with thyristors to switch portions of the winding in and out, forming a Thyristor-Controlled Phase-Shifting Transformer (TCPST). However, this is generally not done as a TCPST would be considerably more expensive than a PAR. Instead, this idea is expanded to replace a Quadrature Booster with a device referred to as a Thyristor-Controlled Phase-Angle Regulator (TCPAR), also known as a Static Phase-Shifter (SPS). From the schematic, it can be seen that a TCPAR is just a Quadrature Booster with the mechanical portions of the excitor and booster transformers replaced with Power Electronics, typically Thyristors.

Another way to form a TCPAR is to separate the Excitor and Booster transformer and control their secondaries with separate sets of Power Electronics. By linking the two sets of Power Electronics through a DC bus, typically by using GTO Thyristors or IGBTs, a TCPAR can be formed. While doing this may initially seem unnecessary, by looking at the shunt and series transformers and their electronics separately, it is apparent that the shunt portion is a STATCOM, and the series portion is a SSSC. With the DC bus providing power from the shunt portion to the series portion, the device functions as a Phase-Angle regulator, however with the DC bus isolating the two side, the STATCOM can control the shunt voltage or the SSSC can control line impedance. This gives the device its name, the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), as it can control all three parameters that affect Power Control.

<text>The Phimai Historical Park () is a historical park in Thailand, covering the ancient town of Phimai and the ruins of Prasat Phimai , ; , ) the largest ancient-Hindu temple in Thailand. It is located in the town of Phimai, Nakhon Ratchasima province. It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the province.

Phimai had previously been an important town at the time of the Khmer Empire. The temple Prasat Hin Phimai, located in the center of the town, was one of the major Khmer temples in ancient Thailand, connected with Angkor by the Ancient Khmer Highway, and oriented to face Angkor as its cardinal direction.

== History ==

The temple marks one end of the Ancient Khmer Highway from Angkor. As the enclosed area of 1020x580m is comparable with that of Angkor Wat, it is suggested to have been an important city in the Khmer Empire. Most buildings are from the late 11th to the late 12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon and Khmer temple style. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back as the 7th century. Inscriptions name the site &quot;Vimayapura&quot; (which means city of &quot;Vimaya&quot;), which developed into the Thai name &quot;Phimai&quot;.

In the aftermath of the fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767, attempts were made to set up five separate states, with Prince Teppipit, a son of King Borommakot, attempting to establish Phimai as one, ruling over eastern provinces including Nakhon Ratchasima. As the weakest of the five, Prince Teppipit was the first to be defeated and was executed in 1768.

The first inventory of the ruins was done in 1901 by the French geographer Etienne Aymonier. The site was put under Thai governmental protection by announcement in the Government Gazette, Volume 53, section 34, on September 27, 1936. Most of the restorations were done from 1964 to 1969 as a joint Thai-French project. The historical park, now managed by the Fine Arts Department, was officially opened by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on April 12, 1989.

Phimai has recently been the base of operations for the excavation of Ban Non Wat.

== Khmer influence ==
As the northeastern part of Thailand was part of the Khmer Empire (once ruled by the Khmer Empire), Phimai&#x27;s architecture and cultural decorations were built in Khmer architecture. Art and architecture shown on the temple itself shows great evidence of the ancient Khmer civilization. Similar in its look and design to Angkor, it also has the same function for worshiping the gods in the Hindu religion.

Despite the fact that Phimai was built in a similar fashion to Angkor and other Khmer Buddhist temples, the religious origin of some structures within Phimai&#x27;s walls are still debated. Evidence of Dvaravati influence, such as the sculpture of &quot;the Wheel of Law&quot; or the statue of Buddha, shows that Phimai was an important Buddhist spiritual location. Although a large quantity of Buddhist artwork has been uncovered in Phimai, evidence including the large pots that were embedded in some corners of the structure suggest that spiritual practices other than Buddhism were also practiced in Phimai. Phimai thus has been an important religious landmark for Animists, Buddhists, and Hindus.

The earliest engraved records of the Khmer is dated from the 6th century AD in the northeast of Thailand. For example, stone Sanskrit inscriptions were found along with statues and engraved images of Hindu deities, such as the image of Shiva&#x27;s bull Nandin. The king during that time, Mahendravarman, ordered his men to obliterate the engraved inscription. Modern scholars debate about the possibility that evidence may have been lost.

Phimai, along with other Khmer temples in Thailand, were built mainly under the cause of the &quot;Deveraja cult,&quot; or &quot;the King that resembles a god.&quot; Jayavarman II was the most mentioned &quot;devaraja.&quot; The Devaraja cult developed the belief of worshiping Shiva and the principle that the king was an avatar of Shiva. Under this principle, Khmer rulers built temples to glorify the reign of the king along with the spread of Hinduism.
The 10th century was the time of the reign of king Rajendravarman II (944-968 AD), which was also a time when Khmer control was spreading into what is now northeastern Thailand. Consequently, temples in Thailand with the Kleang and Baphuon styles remain as evidence of this Khmer heritage. These structures shared the same signature of having three brick towers on a single platform, for instance, the Prasat Prang Ku in Si Saket province and Ban Phuluang in Surin province.

Each individual building has its own special features or functions. For example, Prang Brahmadat was built of laterite blocks that form a square. Or Prang Hin Daeng which translates to &quot;Red Stone Tower&quot; which is also a square but was made of red sandstone. Or the main sanctuary built of white sandstone that is almost 32 meters long. The southern lintel has a statue of Buddha meditating with &quot;seven hoods of naga Muchalinda.&quot; Adjacent to this is a collection of statues of devils and animals depicted from the Tantric Mahayana Buddhist scripture.

Today Phimai is a well-known tourist attraction, especially among people interested in history and archaeology. Located in the middle of Phimai is a small rectangular gallery surrounding the courtyard, which has been newly rebuilt. Within the gallery, there is a pre-Angkorian Buddhist inscription that tells the story of Prince Siddhartha Gautama and his journey to becoming Buddha, along with other classic Buddhist stories. The &quot;prang&quot; symbolize that the area is a sacred space.

==Within Phimai&#x27;s wall==

When tourists enter the area of Phimai from the old town on the south, they have to cross a river about one kilometer to the south and enter an ancient laterite landing stage which archaeologists believe stood for the bathing place for the heroine in local myths. The south gate is the city&#x27;s main gate, also known as the &quot;Pratu Chai,&quot; which has recently been reconstructed by the Royal Fine Arts Department. Its size is enormous; it is said that the size is big enough for a royal elephant to enter. The Royal Fine Arts Department also built an inner gallery that shows ancient Buddhist inscriptions and small sculptures as well as pieces of wrecked architecture. The rest of Phimai remains the same only with a little restoration by the Royal Arts Department.

===Architecture style===

Having a lot in common with Angkor Wat, Phimai is an example of classical Khmer architecture. Ancient Khmer architects were best known for their superior use of sandstone over the traditional bricks and laterite architectures. Sandstone is used on the visible outer layer. Laterite on the other hand was used for the inner wall and other hidden parts. All the structures are huge sandstone blocks. There are many lotus-shaped roofs representing Mount Meru (Hinduism&#x27;s holy mountain).

Khmer temples in general, as well as Phimai in this case, were intended to resemble the universe. The main building resembles the peak of Mount Meru at the center of the universe. The surrounding walls resemble the water and encircling mountains. The Khmer did not develop the technique of true vault architecture during their time, resulting in large areas at Phimai that could not be roofed over. Instead, they developed the use of multiple chapels separated by open-air spaces.

===Construction materials===
The Khmer learned how to use bricks, sandstone, and laterite effectively. They were the three principal structural materials. Builders generally cut the lintel at 45 degrees to produce a triangular wedge.

== Archaeological projects ==
In 1998, the &quot;Origins of Angkor Project&quot; (OAP), a joint project of the Royal Thai Fine Arts Department, Anthropology Department, and the University of Otago, New Zealand, began excavations to investigate the underlying sequence. Temple construction during the Angkorian period involved the deliberate deposition of layers of fill, which can clearly be seen in the stratigraphy of the site.

<text>The Dutch National Opera (DNO; formerly De Nederlandse Opera, now De Nationale Opera in Dutch) is a Dutch opera company based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Its present home base is the Dutch National Opera &amp; Ballet housed in the Stopera building, a modern building designed by Cees Dam and Wilhelm Holzbauer that opened in 1986.

It received the &quot;Opera Company of the Year&quot; award at the 2016 International Opera Awards.

==History==
The DNO was established shortly after the end of World War II as a repertory company with a permanent ensemble. In the postwar period, it toured extensively in the Netherlands from its home base in the Stadsschouwburg, a &quot;fin de siècle&quot; theatre on the Leidseplein in Amsterdam. In 1964, it was renamed &quot;De Nederlandse Operastichting&quot;. (&quot;The Dutch Opera Foundation&quot;), and the company adopted a &quot;stagione&quot; orientation, inviting different soloists and artistic teams for each new production. In 1986, the company moved to the new Stopera building, which it shares with the Dutch National Ballet, and thereafter became known as De Nederlandse Opera (DNO). In 2014, the company changed its name to &quot;De Nationale Opera&quot; (Dutch National Opera).

The DNO has its own choir of sixty singers and a technical staff of 260. The DNO historically has not had its own resident orchestra, and so various orchestras of the Netherlands, including the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO), the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra (NKO), the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, Residentie Orkest, Den Haag (The Hague Philharmonic), and the AskoSchönberg ensemble have provided the orchestral forces for DNO productions.

The DNO produces on average eleven productions per year. While most performances are in the Dutch National Opera &amp; Ballet building, the company has also performed in the Stadsschouwburg, at the Carré Theatre, and on the Westergasfabriek industrial site in Amsterdam. For many years, the June production has been organized as part of the Holland Festival and includes the participation of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The DNO has lent its productions to foreign companies, such as the Metropolitan Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, as well as the Adelaide Festival in Australia.

Pierre Audi was artistic director of the DNO from 1998 to 2018. In April 2017, the DNO announced the appointment of Sophie de Lint as the company&#x27;s next artistic director, effective 1 September 2018.

Hartmut Haenchen was chief conductor from 1986 to 1999, in parallel with holding the title of chief conductor of the NPO. He subsequently held the title of principal guest conductor with the DNO. Subsequent chief conductors have been Edo de Waart (1999–2004) and Ingo Metzmacher (2005–2008). In March 2009, the DNO announced the appointment of Marc Albrecht as the orchestra&#x27;s next chief conductor, with the 2011–2012 season, for an initial contract of four years. This return to a single chief conductor at both the DNO and the NedPhO/NKO allows for the NedPhO to become the principal opera orchestra for the DNO. Albrecht stood down as chief conductor of the DNO at the end of the 2019–2020 season. 

In April 2019, the DNO announced the appointment of Lorenzo Viotti as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2021–2022 season. In April 2023, the DNO announced the scheduled conclusion of Viotti&#x27;s tenure as its chief conductor at the close of the 2024–2025 season.

<doc id="275945" wikidata="Q839922" url="?curid=275945" title="Static VAR compensator">
<text>In Electrical Engineering, a static VAR compensator (SVC) is a set of electrical devices for providing fast-acting reactive power on high-voltage electricity transmission networks. SVCs are part of the flexible AC transmission system device family, regulating voltage, power factor, harmonics and stabilizing the system. A static VAR compensator has no significant moving parts (other than internal switchgear). Prior to the invention of the SVC, power factor compensation was the preserve of large rotating machines such as synchronous condensers or switched capacitor banks.

The SVC is an automated impedance matching device, designed to bring the system closer to unity power factor. SVCs are used in two main situations:
* Connected to the power system, to regulate the transmission voltage (&quot;transmission SVC&quot;)
* Connected near large industrial loads, to improve power quality (&quot;industrial SVC&quot;)

In transmission applications, the SVC is used to regulate the grid voltage. If the power system&#x27;s reactive load is capacitive (leading), the SVC will use thyristor controlled reactors to consume VARs from the system, lowering the system voltage. Under inductive (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher system voltage. By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, the net result is continuously variable leading or lagging power.

In industrial applications, SVCs are typically placed near high and rapidly varying loads, such as arc furnaces, where they can smooth flicker voltage.

== Description ==

===Principle===
Typically, an SVC comprises one or more banks of fixed or switched shunt capacitors or reactors, of which at least one bank is switched by thyristors. Elements which may be used to make an SVC typically include:
*Thyristor-controlled reactor (TCR), where the reactor may be air- or iron-cored
*Thyristor-switched capacitor (TSC)
*Harmonic filter(s)
*Mechanically switched capacitors or reactors (switched by a circuit breaker)

By means of phase angle modulation switched by the thyristors, the reactor may be variably switched into the circuit and so provide a continuously variable VAR injection (or absorption) to the electrical network. In this configuration, coarse voltage control is provided by the capacitors; the thyristor-controlled reactor is to provide smooth control. Smoother control and more flexibility can be provided with thyristor-controlled capacitor switching.

The thyristors are electronically controlled. Thyristors, like all semiconductors, generate heat and deionized water is commonly used to cool them. Chopping reactive load into the circuit in this manner injects undesirable odd-order harmonics and so banks of high-power filters are usually provided to smooth the waveform. Since the filters themselves are capacitive, they also export MVARs to the power system.

More complex arrangements are practical where precise voltage regulation is required. Voltage regulation is provided by means of a closed-loop controller. Remote supervisory control and manual adjustment of the voltage set-point are also common.

=== Connection ===
Generally, static VAR compensation is not done at line voltage; a bank of transformers steps the transmission voltage (for example, 230 kV) down to a much lower level (for example, 9.0 kV). This reduces the size and number of components needed in the SVC, although the conductors must be very large to handle the high currents associated with the lower voltage. In some static VAR compensators for industrial applications such as electric arc furnaces, where there may be an existing medium-voltage busbar present (for example at 33 kV or 34.5 kV), the static VAR compensator may be directly connected in order to save the cost of the transformer.

Another common connection point for SVC is on the delta tertiary winding of Y-connected auto-transformers used to connect one transmission voltage to another voltage.

The dynamic nature of the SVC lies in the use of thyristors connected in series and inverse-parallel, forming &quot;thyristor valves&quot;. The disc-shaped semiconductors, usually several inches in diameter, are usually located indoors in a &quot;valve house&quot;.

== Advantages ==
The main advantage of SVCs over simple mechanically switched compensation schemes is their near-instantaneous response to changes in the system voltage. For this reason they are often operated at close to their zero-point in order to maximize the reactive power correction they can rapidly provide when required.

They are, in general, cheaper, higher-capacity, faster and more reliable than dynamic compensation schemes such as synchronous condensers. However, static VAR compensators are more expensive than mechanically switched capacitors, so many system operators use a combination of the two technologies (sometimes in the same installation), using the static VAR compensator to provide support for fast changes and the mechanically switched capacitors to provide steady-state VARs.
