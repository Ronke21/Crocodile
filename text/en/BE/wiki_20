<text>There have been various attempts at the classification of [[demon]]s within the contexts of classical mythology, demonology, occultism, and Renaissance magic. These classifications may be for purposes of traditional medicine, exorcisms, ceremonial magic, witch-hunts, lessons in morality, folklore, religious ritual, or combinations thereof. Classifications might be according to astrological connections, elemental forms, noble titles, or parallels to the angelic hierarchy; or by association with particular sins, diseases, and other calamities; or by what angel or saint opposes them.

Many of the authors of such classifications identified as Christian, though Christian authors are not the only ones who have written on the subject.

== Classification by domain==

===The Testament of Solomon===

The &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot; is a pseudepigraphical work, purportedly written by King Solomon, in which the author mostly describes particular demons who he enslaved to help build the temple, the questions he put to them about their deeds and how they could be thwarted, and their answers, which provide a kind of self-help manual against demonic activity. The date is very dubious, though it is considered the oldest surviving work particularly concerned with individual demons.

===Psellus&#x27; classification===
Michael Psellus prepared the influential &quot;De operatione dæmonum (On the Operation of Demons)&quot; in the 11th century, with a taxonomy dividing demons into six types: Leliurium (Igneous), Aërial, Marine (Aqueous), Terrestrial (Earthly), Subterranean, and Lucifugous (Heliophobic).

===&quot;Lanterne of Light&quot;===
In 1409–1410 &quot;The Lanterne of Light&quot; (an anonymous English Lollard tract often attributed to John Wycliffe) provided a classification system based on the seven deadly sins, known as the &quot;seven deadly devils&quot; or &quot;seven princes of Hell&quot;, with each demon tempting people by means of those sins, as follows:
This list was later used in the works of John Taylor, the Water Poet. Later writers, such as Peter Binsfeld, assigned different demons to the respective sins and should not be confused with this list. The two classification systems are shown side-by-side below:

===Spina&#x27;s classification===
Alphonso de Spina, in 1467, prepared a classification of demons. 

* Incubi and succubi
* Wandering groups or armies of demons can include multiple regions in hell
* Familiars
* Drudes
* Cambions and other demons that are born from the union of a demon with a human being.
* Liar and mischievous demons
* Demons that attack the saints are rogue demons 
* Demons that try to induce old women to attend Witches&#x27; Sabbaths
This classification is somewhat capricious and it is difficult to find a criterion for it. It seems that Spina was inspired by several legends and stories. The drudes belong to German folklore. Familiars, goblins, and other mischievous demons belong to the folklore of most European countries.

The belief in incubi and succubi (and their ability to procreate) seem to have inspired the fifth category, but it could also have been inspired in the Talmudic legend of demons having sexual intercourse with mortal women and men (see also Mastema).

The visions of tempting demons that some early (and not so early) saints had, perhaps inspired the eighth category (e.g. the visions of Anthony the Great).

The idea of old women attending Sabbaths was common during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance, and Spina mentioned it before the .

===Agrippa&#x27;s classification===

In &quot;De occulta philosophia&quot; (1509-1510), Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa proposed several classifications for demons, based on numeric scales, like his whole Cosmology. Francis Barrett, in his book &quot;The Magus&quot; (1801), adopted this classification of demons.

====Scale of unity====
* One prince of rebellion, of angels, and darkness:
** Lucifer

====Scale of binary====
* Two chiefs of the devils:
** Behemoth
** Leviathan

====Scale of ternary====
* Three furies:
** Alecto
** Megera
** Ctesiphon

* Three infernal judges:
** Minos
** Aeacus
** Rhadamanthus

====Scale of quaternary====
* Four Princes of devils in the elements:
** Samael: Fire
** Azrael: Water
** Azazel: Air
** Mahazael: Earth

* Four Princes of spirits, upon the four angles of the world
** : East
** Paymon: West
** Egyn: North
** Amaymon: South

Despite listing these separately, Agrippa mentions that these groups are identical, making the first as the Hebrew equivalent of the names of the latter.
The same four demons appear in the &quot;Semiphoras and Schemhamforas&quot;.

====Scale of six====
* Six authors of all calamities:
** Acteus
** Megalesius
** Ormenus
** Lycus
** Nicon
** Mimon

====Scale of novenary====
* Nine princes ruling over nine orders of devils (with biblical references):
** Beelzebub: False Gods ()
** Python: Spirits of Lying ()
** Belial: Instruments of iniquity and wrath (, , , , )
** Asmodeus: Revengers of Wickedness
** Satan: Deluders or Imitators of miracles ()
** Merihem: Aerial Powers ()
** Abaddon: Furies – sowing mischief
** Astaroth: Calumniators – inquisitors and accusers
** Mammon: evil genies – tempters and ensnarers

===Binsfeld&#x27;s classification===
As part of his 1589 &quot;Treatise on Confessions by Evildoers and Witches&quot;, German theologian Peter Binsfeld prepared a classification of demons known as the Princes of Hell. Like the &quot;Lanterne of Light&quot;, Binsfeld used the seven deadly sins as a basis, though the two schemes differ in various ways.
# Lucifer: pride
# Mammon: greed
# Asmodeus: lust
# Leviathan: envy
# Beelzebub: gluttony
# Satan: wrath
# Belphegor: sloth

===King James classification===

King James&#x27; dissertation titled &quot;Daemonologie&quot; was first published in 1597, several years before the first publication of the King James Authorized Version of the Bible. It&#x27;s three short books which are in the form of a philosophical dialogue, making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. Within them, James classified demons into four sections:
* Lemures or Spectra: Spirits that trouble houses or solitary places
* Obsession: Spirits that follow upon certain people to outwardly trouble them at various times of the day
* Possession: Spirits that enter inwardly into a person to trouble them
* Fairies: Spirits that prophesy, consort, and transport

His classification was not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles, but rather categorized them based on four methods used by any given devil to cause mischief or torment on a living individual or a corpse. The purpose was to relay the belief that spirits caused maladies and that magic was possible only through demonic influence. He further quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying arrays of purposes as well. In his description of them, he relates that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without permission, further illustrating how demonic forces are used as a &quot;Rod of Correction&quot; when men stray from the will of God and may be commissioned by witches, or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others but will ultimately only conduct works that will end in the further glorification of God despite their attempts to do otherwise.

===Michaëlis&#x27;s classification===
In 1613 the Dominican prior and French inquisitor, Sébastien Michaëlis wrote a book, &quot;Admirable History&quot;, which included a classification of demons as it was told to him by the demon Berith when he was exorcising a nun, according to the author. This classification is based on the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchies, according to the sins the devil tempts one to commit, and includes the demons&#x27; adversaries (who suffered that temptation without falling).

====First hierarchy====
The first hierarchy includes angels that were Seraphim, Cherubim, and Ophanim/Thrones:
* Beelzebub was a prince of the Seraphim, second to Lucifer, founder of Hell’s Order of the Fly. He tempts men with envy and is opposed by St. Francis.
* Leviathan was also a prince of the Seraphim who tempts people to give into heresy, and is opposed by St. Peter.
* Asmodeus was a prince of the Ophanim/Thrones, burning with desire to tempt men into wantonness. He is opposed by St. John the Baptist.
* Berith was a prince of the Cherubim. He tempts men to commit homicide, and to be quarrelsome, contentious, and blasphemous. He is opposed by St. Barnabas.
* Astaroth was a prince of Thrones, who tempts men to be lazy and is opposed by St. Bartholomew.
* Verrine was also a prince of Thrones, just below Astaroth. He tempts men with impatience and is opposed by St. Dominic.
* Gressil was the third prince of Thrones, who tempts men with impurity and is opposed by St. Bernard.
* Soneillon was the fourth prince of Thrones, who tempts men to hate and is opposed by St. Stephen.

====Second hierarchy====
The second hierarchy includes Powers, Dominions, and Virtues:
* Carreau was a prince of Powers. He tempts men with hardness of heart and is opposed by St. Vincent.
* Carnivale was also a prince of Powers. He tempts men to obscenity and shamelessness, and is opposed by John the Evangelist.
* Oeillet was a prince of Dominions. He tempts men to break the vow of poverty and is opposed by St. Martin.
* Rosier was the second in the order of Dominions. He tempts men against sexual purity and is opposed by St. Basil.
* Belias was the prince of Virtues. He tempts men with arrogance and women to be vain, raise wanton children, and gossip during mass. He is opposed by St. Francis de Paul.

====Third hierarchy====
The third hierarchy Principalities, Archangels, and Angels:
* Verrier was the prince of Principalities. He tempts men against the vow of obedience and is opposed by St. Bernard.
* Olivier was the prince of the Archangels. He tempts men with cruelty and mercilessness toward the poor and is opposed by St. Lawrence, patron saint of the poor.
* Iuvart was the prince of Angels. At the time of Michaelis&#x27;s writing, Iuvart was believed to have possessed a young novice nun of the Ursulines, Madeleine Demandols de La Palud, from whom it was exorcised.

Many of the names and ranks of these demons appear in the Sabbath litanies of witches, according to Jules Garinet&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la magie en France&quot;, and Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;.

==Classification by office==
In the study of demonology, many spirits are classified by office, rank, or titles which theologians believe were once held in heaven before the fall, or which they currently hold in their infernal dwelling. These offices are usually elaborated in several grimoires which determines their authority in hell or abilities. Demons categorized by office are often depicted in a militant hierarchy, in which a general may hold command over some designated legion for a specialized function which they may trouble men. Other theologians have determined the classification of a spirit&#x27;s office depending on the times or locations which they roam the Earth.

===&quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot;===
&quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot;, possibly written in the 14th or 15th century, lists four princes of the demons: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial. There are also eight sub-princes: Astaroth, Magoth, Asmodee, Beelzebub, , Paimon, Ariton (Egin) and Amaymon. Under the rule of these there are many lesser demons.

===&quot;Le Livre des Esperitz&quot;===

Written in the 15th or 16th century, this grimoire was a likely source for Wierus hierarchy of demons, but while Wierus mentions 69 demons, &quot;Le Livre des Esperitz&quot; has only 46. Wierus omitted, however, the four demons of the cardinal points: , Ponymon, Amaymon and Equi (see Agrippa&#x27;s classification) and the three great governors of all the other demons: Lucifer, Beelzebub and Satan.

===The &quot;Munich Manual of Demonic Magic&quot;===

Written in the 15th century, this manual includes a list of eleven demons.

===&quot;Fasciculus Rerum Geomanticarum&quot;===
Written in 1494, this grimoire contains a list of 37 demons.

===&quot;Le Dragon Rouge&quot; (or &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot;)===

Like many works of mystical nature, &quot;Le Dragon Rouge&quot; (or the &quot;Red Dragon&quot;) claims to come from Solomon and his priests and is said to be published in 1517 by Alibeck the Egyptian. However, it was most likely written in France in the 18th century.

The grimoire details the different hosts of hell and their powers, describing how to enter a pact with them to attain the magicians&#x27; goals. The demons of hell are classified by three different tiers from Generals to Officers.

===&quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;===

&quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, by Johann Weyer, is a grimoire that contains a list of demons and the appropriate hours and rituals to conjure them &quot;in the name of God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost&quot; (simpler than those cited by &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; below).

This book was written around 1583, and lists sixty-nine demons. The demons Vassago, Seir, Dantalion and Andromalius are not listed in this book. Pseudomonarchia Daemonum does not attribute seals to the demons.

===&quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;===

The &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; or &quot;Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis&quot; is an anonymous 17th century grimoire, and one of the most popular books of demonology. The &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; contains detailed descriptions of spirits and the conjurations needed to invoke and oblige them to do the will of the conjurer (referred to as the &quot;exorcist&quot;). It details the protective signs and rituals to be performed, the actions necessary to prevent the spirits from gaining control, the preparations prior to the invocations, and instructions on how to make the necessary instruments for the execution of these rituals.

The author of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; copied &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; almost completely, but added demons&#x27; descriptions, their seals and details.

====&quot;The Ars Goetia&quot;====
&quot;Ars Goetia&quot; is the first section of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, containing descriptions of the seventy-two demons that King Solomon is said to have evoked and confined in a bronze vessel sealed by magic symbols, and that he obliged to work for him.

The &quot;Ars Goetia&quot; assigns a rank and a title of nobility to each member of the infernal hierarchy, and gives the demons &quot;signs they have to pay allegiance to&quot;, or seals.

===&quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;===
The &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; () is a book on demonology, organised in hellish hierarchies. It was written by Jacques Collin de Plancy and first published in 1818. There were several editions of the book, but perhaps the most famous is the edition of 1863, in which sixty-nine illustrations were added to the book. These illustrations are drawings that depict the descriptions of the appearance of a number of demons. Many of these images were later used in S. L. MacGregor Mathers&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; though some of the images were removed.

The book was first published in 1818 and then divided into two volumes, with six reprints and many changes between 1818 and 1863. This book attempts to provide an account of all the knowledge concerning superstitions and demonology.

CollindePlancy presented a hierarchy of demons based in modern European courts:
* Princes and dignitaries:
**Beelzebub, supreme chief of the empire of hell, founder of the order of the Fly.
**Satan, prince dethroned and chief of the opposition party.
**Eurynome, prince of death, Grand Cross of the order of the Fly.
**Moloch, prince of the country of tears, Grand Cross of the order.
**Pluton, Prince of Fire, also Grand Cross of the order and governor of the regions in flames.
**Pan, prince of incubi.
**Lilith, princess of succubi.
**Leonard, the great lord of the Sabbath, Knight of the Fly.
**Balberith, great pontiff, lord of alliances.
**Proserpina, , princess of evil spirits.
* Ministers of the Office:
**Adrammelech, Grand Chancellor and Grand Cross of the Order of the Fly.
**Ashtaroth, general treasurer, Knight of the Fly.
**Nergal, chief of the secret police.
**Baal, commander in chief of the armies of Hell, Grand Cross of the Order of the Fly.
**Leviathan, Grand Admiral, Knight of the Fly.
* Ambassadors:
**Belfegor, Ambassador of France.
**Mammon, of England.
**Belial, of Italy.
**Rimmon, of Russia.
**Tammuz, of Spain.
**Hutgin, of Turkey.
**Martinet, of Switzerland.
* Justice:
**Lucifer, chief of (in)justice, Knight of the Fly.
**Alastor, executor of his sentences.
* House of the princes:
**Verdelet, master of ceremonies.
**Succorbenoth, chief of the eunuchs of the seraglio.
**Chamos, Grand Chambelain, Knight of the Fly.
**Melchom, payer treasurer.
**Nisroch, chief of the kitchen.
**Behemoth, chief cupbearer.
**Dagon, grand pantler.
**Mullin, first valet.
* Secret expenses:
**Kobal, director of theaters.
**Asmodeus, superintendent of the gambling houses.
**Nybbas, grand buffoon.
**Antichrist, charlatan and necromancer.

Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier used some of these names and ranks for the demons who tormented him, in his autobiographical work &quot;Les farfadets ou Tous les démons ne sont pas de l&#x27;autre monde&quot; (1821).

===&quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;===

LaVey utilized the symbolism of the Four Crown Princes of Hell in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, with each chapter of the book being named after each Prince. &quot;The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe&quot;, &quot;The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment&quot;, &quot;The Book of Belial: Mastery of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Leviathan: The Raging Sea&quot;. This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage&quot;.
* Satan (Hebrew) &quot;Lord of the Inferno&quot;:
The adversary, representing opposition, the element of fire, the direction of the south, and the pentacle (which takes the form of the Sigil of Baphomet) during ritual.
* Lucifer (Latin) &quot;The Morning Star&quot;:
The bringer of light, representing pride and enlightenment, the element of air, the direction of the east, and the stick (which takes the form of candles) during ritual.
* Belial (Hebrew) &quot;Without a Master&quot;:
The baseness of the earth, independence and self-sufficiency, the element of earth, the direction of the north, and the sword during ritual.
* Leviathan (Hebrew) &quot;Serpent of the Abyss&quot;:
The great dragon, representing primal secrecy, the element of water, the direction of the west, and the chalice during ritual.

<text>Microscope image processing is a broad term that covers the use of digital image processing techniques to process, analyze and present images obtained from a microscope. Such processing is now commonplace in a number of diverse fields such as medicine, biological research, cancer research, drug testing, metallurgy, etc. A number of manufacturers of microscopes now specifically design in features that allow the microscopes to interface to an image processing system.

==Image acquisition==
Until the early 1990s, most image acquisition in video microscopy applications was typically done with an analog video camera, often simply closed circuit TV cameras. While this required the use of a frame grabber to digitize the images, video cameras provided images at full video frame rate (25-30 frames per second) allowing live video recording and processing. While the advent of solid state detectors yielded several advantages, the real-time video camera was actually superior in many respects.

Today, acquisition is usually done using a CCD camera mounted in the optical path of the microscope. The camera may be full colour or monochrome. Very often, very high resolution cameras are employed to gain as much direct information as possible. Cryogenic cooling is also common, to minimise noise. Often digital cameras used for this application provide pixel intensity data to a resolution of 12-16 bits, much higher than is used in consumer imaging products.

Ironically, in recent years, much effort has been put into acquiring data at video rates, or higher (25-30 frames per second or higher). What was once easy with off-the-shelf video cameras now requires special, high speed electronics to handle the vast digital data bandwidth.

Higher speed acquisition allows dynamic processes to be observed in real time, or stored for later playback and analysis. Combined with the high image resolution, this approach can generate vast quantities of raw data, which can be a challenge to deal with, even with a modern computer system.

While current CCD detectors allow very high image resolution, often this involves a trade-off because, for a given chip size, as the pixel count increases, the pixel size decreases. As the pixels get smaller, their well depth decreases, reducing the number of electrons that can be stored. In turn, this results in a poorer signal-to-noise ratio.

For best results, one must select an appropriate sensor for a given application. Because microscope images have an intrinsic limiting resolution, it often makes little sense to use a noisy, high resolution detector for image acquisition. A more modest detector, with larger pixels, can often produce much higher quality images because of reduced noise. This is especially important in low-light applications such as fluorescence microscopy.

Moreover, one must also consider the temporal resolution requirements of the application. A lower resolution detector will often have a significantly higher acquisition rate, permitting the observation of faster events. Conversely, if the observed object is motionless, one may wish to acquire images at the highest possible spatial resolution without regard to the time required to acquire a single image.

==2D image techniques==

Image processing for microscopy application begins with fundamental techniques intended to most accurately reproduce the information contained in the microscopic sample. This might include adjusting the brightness and contrast of the image, averaging images to reduce image noise and correcting for illumination non-uniformities. Such processing involves only basic arithmetic operations between images (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The vast majority of processing done on microscope image is of this nature.

Another class of common 2D operations called image convolution are often used to reduce or enhance image details. Such &quot;blurring&quot; and &quot;sharpening&quot; algorithms in most programs work by altering a pixel&#x27;s value based on a weighted sum of that and the surrounding pixels (a more detailed description of kernel based convolution deserves an entry for itself) or by altering the frequency domain function of the image using Fourier Transform. Most image processing techniques are performed in the Frequency domain.

Other basic two dimensional techniques include operations such as image rotation, warping, color balancing etc.

At times, advanced techniques are employed with the goal of &quot;undoing&quot; the distortion of the optical path of the microscope, thus eliminating distortions and blurring caused by the instrumentation. This process is called deconvolution, and a variety of algorithms have been developed, some of great mathematical complexity. The end result is an image far sharper and clearer than could be obtained in the optical domain alone. This is typically a 3-dimensional operation, that analyzes a volumetric image (i.e. images taken at a variety of focal planes through the sample) and uses this data to reconstruct a more accurate 3-dimensional image.

==3D image techniques==

Another common requirement is to take a series of images at a fixed position, but at different focal depths. Since most microscopic samples are essentially transparent, and the depth of field of the focused sample is exceptionally narrow, it is possible to capture images &quot;through&quot; a three-dimensional object using 2D equipment like confocal microscopes. Software is then able to reconstruct a 3D model of the original sample which may be manipulated appropriately. The processing turns a 2D instrument into a 3D instrument, which would not otherwise exist. In recent times this technique has led to a number of scientific discoveries in cell biology.

==Analysis==
Analysis of images will vary considerably according to application. Typical analysis includes determining where the edges of an object are, counting similar objects, calculating the area, perimeter length and other useful measurements of each object. A common approach is to create an image mask which only includes pixels that match certain criteria, then perform simpler scanning operations on the resulting mask. It is also possible to label objects and track their motion over a series of frames in a video sequence.

<text>Frank Anthony Wilczek ( or ; born May 15, 1951) is an American theoretical physicist, mathematician and Nobel laureate. He is the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Founding Director of T. D. Lee Institute and Chief Scientist at the Wilczek Quantum Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), distinguished professor at Arizona State University (ASU) and full professor at Stockholm University.

Wilczek, along with David Gross and H. David Politzer, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004 &quot;for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction&quot;. In May 2022, he was awarded the Templeton Prize for his &quot;investigations into the fundamental laws of nature, that has transformed our understanding of the forces that govern our universe and revealed an inspiring vision of a world that embodies mathematical beauty.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born in Mineola, New York, Wilczek is of Polish and Italian origin. His grandparents were immigrants who &quot;really did work with their hands&quot;, according to Wilczek, but his father took night school classes to educate himself, working as a repairman to support his family. Wilczek&#x27;s father became a &quot;self-taught engineer&quot;, whose interests in technology and science inspired his son.

Wilczek was educated in the public schools of Queens, attending Martin Van Buren High School. It was around this time Wilczek&#x27;s parents realized that he was exceptional, in part as a result of their son having been administered an IQ test.

After skipping two grades, Wilczek started high school in the 10th grade, when he was 13 years old. He was particularly inspired by two of his high school physics teachers, one of whom taught a course that helped students with the national Westinghouse Science Talent Search. Wilczek was a finalist in 1967 and ultimately won fourth place, based on a mathematical project involving group theory.

He received his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and membership in Phi Beta Kappa at the University of Chicago in 1970. During his last year as a math major at Chicago, he attended a course taught by Peter Freund on group theory in physics, which Wilczek later described as being &quot;basically particle physics&quot;, and very influential:
Peter Freund played a big role in my life, though, because he taught this course on group theory, or symmetry in physics that—he was so enthusiastic, and he really gushed—and it&#x27;s beautiful material. Still to this day I think the quantum theory of angular momentum is one of the absolute pinnacles of human achievement. Just beautiful.

Wilczek attended graduate school at Princeton University. After a year and a half, he transferred from mathematics to physics, with David Gross as his thesis advisor. He earned a Master of Arts in Mathematics in 1972 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1974.

==Personal life==
Wilczek met Betsy Devine at Princeton, when both watched the televised 1972 Fisher-Spassky chess matches. They married in 1973, and together they have two daughters. His favorite physicist is James Clerk Maxwell.

===Religious views===
Wilczek was raised Catholic but later &quot;lost faith in conventional religion&quot; although he told &quot;Scientific American&quot; that religion &quot;had meant a lot to me as a teenager&quot;. He has been described as an agnostic but tweeted in 2013 that &quot;&#x27;pantheist&#x27; is closer to the mark&quot;.

Wilczek said that &quot;the world embodies beautiful ideas&quot; but &quot;although this may inspire a spiritual interpretation, it does not require one&quot;.

===Science outreach and activism===
Wilczek is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute, an organization that works to mitigate existential risks facing humanity, particularly existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence.

In 2014, Wilczek penned a letter, along with Stephen Hawking and two other scholars, warning that &quot;Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.&quot;

Wilczek is also a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organization which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

Wilczek is on the board for Society for Science &amp; the Public. He is a co-founding member of the Kosciuszko Foundation of the Collegium of Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry.

Wilczek has appeared on an episode of &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, where Penn referred to him as &quot;the smartest person [they have] ever had on the show&quot;.

==Honors==

In 1982, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

Wilczek was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993, and the American Philosophical Society in 2005.

Wilczek became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 2002. Wilczek won the Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society in 2003. In the same year, he was awarded the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Commemorative Medal from Charles University in Prague. He was the co-recipient of the 2003 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize of the European Physical Society. The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004 was awarded jointly to David J. Gross, H. David Politzer and Frank Wilczek &quot;for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction&quot;. Wilczek was also the co-recipient of the 2005 King Faisal International Prize for Science. In that same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. On January 25, 2013, Wilczek received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Uppsala University, Sweden. He also served on the Physical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, Wilczek gave the George Gamow Memorial Lecture at the University of Colorado Boulder. In 2022 he was awarded the Templeton Prize for the work that reveals &quot;a vision of a universe that he regards as embodying mathematical beauty at the scales of the magnificently large and unimaginably small&quot;.

Wilczek holds the Herman Feshbach Professorship of Physics at MIT Center for Theoretical Physics. He has also worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and was also a visiting professor at NORDITA.

==Research==
Wilczek&#x27;s 2004 Nobel Prize was for asymptotic freedom, but he has helped reveal and develop axions, anyons, asymptotic freedom, the color superconducting phases of quark matter, and other aspects of quantum field theory. He has worked on condensed matter physics, astrophysics, and particle physics.

===Asymptotic freedom===
In 1973, while a graduate student working with David Gross at Princeton University, Wilczek (together with Gross) discovered asymptotic freedom, which holds that the closer quarks are to each other, the less the strong interaction (or color charge) between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. The theory, which was independently discovered by H. David Politzer, was important for the development of quantum chromodynamics. According to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences when awarding Wilczek its Lorentz Medal in 2002, This [asymptotic freedom] is a phenomenon whereby the building blocks which make up the nucleus of an atom – &#x27;quarks&#x27; – behave as free particles when they are close together, but become more strongly attracted to each other as the distance between them increases. This theory forms the key to the interpretation of almost all experimental studies involving modern particle accelerators.

===Axions===

The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle. If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

In 1977, Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn postulated a solution to the strong CP problem, the Peccei–Quinn mechanism. This is accomplished by adding a new global symmetry (called a Peccei–Quinn symmetry.) When that symmetry is spontaneously broken, a new particle results, as shown independently by Wilczek and by Steven Weinberg. Wilczek named this new hypothetical particle the &quot;axion&quot; after a brand of laundry detergent, while Weinberg called it &quot;Higglet&quot;. Weinberg later agreed to adopt Wilczek&#x27;s name for the particle.

Although most experimental searches for dark matter candidates have targeted WIMPs, there have also been many attempts to detect axions. In June, 2020, an international team of physicists working in Italy detected a signal that could be axions.

===Anyons===

In physics, an anyon is a type of quasiparticle that occurs only in &quot;two&quot;-dimensional systems, with properties much less restricted than fermions and bosons. In particular, anyons can have properties intermediate between fermions and bosons, including fractional electric charge. This anything-goes behavior inspired Wilczek in 1982 to name them &quot;anyons&quot;.

In 1977, a group of theoretical physicists working at the University of Oslo, led by Jon Leinaas and Jan Myrheim, calculated that the traditional division between fermions and bosons would not apply to theoretical particles existing in two dimensions. When Daniel Tsui and Horst Störmer discovered the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1982, Bertrand Halperin (1984) expanded the math Wilczek proposed in 1982 for fractional statistics in two dimensions to help explain it.

Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and Robert Schrieffer analyzed the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1984, proving that anyons were required to describe it.

In 2020, experimenters from the Ecole Normale Supérieure and from the Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies (C2N) reported in &quot;Science&quot; that they had made a direct detection of anyons.

===Time crystals===

In 2012 he proposed the idea of a time crystal. In 2018, several research teams reported the existence of time crystals. In 2018, he and Qing-Dong Jiang calculated that the so-called &quot;quantum atmosphere&quot; of materials should theoretically be capable of being probed using existing technology such as diamond probes with nitrogen-vacancy centers.

<text>A tornado watch (SAME code: TOA) is a statement issued by weather forecasting agencies to advise the public that atmospheric conditions in a given region may lead to the development of tornadoes within (or near) the region over a period of several hours. In addition to the potential for tornado development, thunderstorms that develop within the watch area may contain large hail, straight-line winds, intense rainfall and/or flooding that pose a similar damage risk as the attendant tornado threat.

A watch must not be confused with a tornado warning, and encourages the public to remain vigilant for the onset of severe weather, including possible tornadoes. A tornado watch does not mean a tornado has been observed or &quot;will&quot; occur, just that favorable conditions increase the likelihood of such storms happening, and may be issued several hours ahead of the formation or arrival of potentially tornadic thunderstorms.

==Definition==
A &quot;tornado watch&quot; indicates that atmospheric conditions observed in and close to the watch area have created a significant risk for the development and intensification of severe convective thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes, and are normally issued in advance of the onset of severe weather. If severe weather actually does occur, a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning would then be issued. Residents and travelers in the watch area are advised to immediately undertake safety preparations ahead of the arrival of severe weather. A tornado watch is not required for a warning to be issued; tornado warnings are occasionally issued when a tornado watch is not active (i.e., when a severe thunderstorm watch is active or if conditions for tornadic development are not expected to be substantive enough to require a watch), if a severe thunderstorm has a confirmed tornado or developed strong rotation. A tornado watch can replace an existing severe thunderstorm watch, if not merely a portion of it, if conditions that were originally considered marginally conducive, if at all for tornadic development have evolved to permit a greater risk of tornado formation.

Although the risk of tornadoes is emphasized as the primary hazard, depending on storm cell intensity, the probability exists for other hazardous phenomena exceeding regional severe criterion to occur: severe thunderstorms that develop within the watch area will also pose a likelihood of producing large hailstones, intense straight-line winds that can produce serious structural damage equivalent to a lower-category tornado over a comparatively broader areal swath, intense lightning, torrential rainfall and/or flash flooding caused by high rainfall accumulations. A tornado watch therefore implies that it is also a severe thunderstorm watch.

When a tornado watch is issued, people within the region of expected tornado threat are advised to review safety precautions in the event they must seek immediate shelter in a basement, cellar, safe room or a sturdy above-ground room in the center section of a home or building (such as a bathroom or closet) when a tornado warning or severe thunderstorm warning is issued for their area. Residents are also advised to monitor conditions ahead of the developing weather situation, and keep abreast of warnings and updated storm information through local broadcast media, weather radio, weather app alert notifications, SMS notifications and/or automated emergency phone calls. Where present, tornado sirens and local police or fire department dispatch units are also used as an outdoor warning system in the event of a tornado or particularly intense non-tornadic thunderstorm in some tornado-prone regions.

===Regional basis===
====United States====
In the United States, tornado watches are issued by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), a national guidance center of the National Weather Service (NWS), for areas of the lower 48 states where atmospheric conditions favor the development of tornadoes and accompanying severe thunderstorms. Although watch issuances for those states are exceedingly rare as their respective climates are less favorable for the kind of convective conditions capable of tornadogenesis, responsibilities for issuing tornado watches covering Alaska and Hawaii are respectively handled by local NWS forecast offices in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska, and Honolulu, Hawaii. Watches are typically valid for six to nine hours (extending if necessary as long as 12 hours during tropical cyclones or other unusually steady-state or slow-moving severe weather events) after the time of issuance, and are intended to precede the first reported tornado by two hours and the first report of severe hail or wind by one hour. SPC watch boxes—termed because the approximate watch area is represented in weather maps as a quadrilateral for aviation purposes—are usually outlined in the approximate delineation of &quot;x&quot; miles north and south, or east and west, or either side of a line (perpendicular to the center line) from &quot;y&quot; miles &quot;direction&quot; of &quot;city, state&quot;, to &quot;z&quot; miles &quot;another direction&quot; of &quot;another city, state&quot; (e.g., &quot;50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of Columbia, South Carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of Montgomery, Alabama&quot;). Geographic coverage of tornado watches (which ranges from on average, encompassing portions of one or more states) vary based on the size of the land area under threat, the duration of severe weather risk, and the forward motion of the parent storm system and associated surface boundaries.

In situations in which the SPC has outlined a “high risk” or high-end “moderate risk” of severe convective storms within and near the watch area, the intensified wording &quot;particularly dangerous situation&quot; (PDS) can be added into the watch product to highlight high forecaster confidence that atmospheric conditions support the development of multiple strong to violent tornadoes (rated EF2–EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) capable of significant damage, if not total destruction of property and severe injury or death from the intense winds and projectile debris, as well as the possibility of destructive straight-line winds and hail from the parent supercells. (Tornadoes occurring in these situations may develop during the storm&#x27;s maturation stage under typical low-level mesocyclonic tornadogenesis, or by accelerated mesocyclonic maturation generated early in the thunderstorm&#x27;s development from sufficient wind shear and very high convective available potential energy [CAPE] values.) PDS tornado watches—which, based on SPC watch issuance averages between 1996 and 2005, account for ~3% of all tornado watches issued per year in the U.S.—usually suggest the likelihood of a major tornado outbreak, although they can be issued if a significant threat exists of isolated intense tornadoes. The SPC (then the National Severe Storms Forecast Center) conceived the PDS verbiage for use in tornado watches in 1981; it was applied to a public tornado watch product for the first time—encompassing portions of northern Texas and southern Oklahoma—during the outbreak of April 2, 1982. (The indicated threat would be verified, with seven of the 14 significant (F3+) tornadoes observed that day—four rated F3, two rated F4 and one rated F5—occurring within the watch area.) In subsequent years but in earnest since 2011, the SPC and the National Weather Service have applied PDS verbiage to other watch and warning types (including tornado warnings, severe thunderstorm watches and warnings, flash flood warnings and red flag warnings) to emphasize an exceptionally high risk to life and property.

SPC meteorologists utilize WarnGen software integrated into the National Centers Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (N-AWIPS) and/or the SPC Product Generator (PRODGEN) to generate the watch statement, which is disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to NOAA satellites, and over NOAA Weather Radio. The term &quot;red box,&quot; often used in parlance within the meteorological community, refers to the coloring assigned to tornado watch boxes for hazard maps used by the Storm Prediction Center and the National Weather Service; severe weather alert displays used by many local television stations typically assign other colors (most commonly, green, yellow or purple) to highlight tornado watches. (Red, which television alert displays usually reserve as an identifier for tornado warnings, is seldom if ever used to highlight tornado watches.)

The Storm Prediction Center, in conjunction with local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, issues component watch products to communicate the approximate area, primary hazards and other pertinent information about the tornado watch to the public, NOAA meteorologists, emergency management and aviation personnel. The graphical and text Public Watch products—in addition to outlining the approximate affected area, valid time, meteorological and aviation discussions, and other pertinent information—includes language specifying the forecast tornado threat (e.g., &quot;several tornadoes and a few intense tornadoes likely&quot;), and attendant severe wind and hail threats (e.g., &quot;widespread damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely, isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible&quot;) in the primary hazards list. The Watch Probability Table describes probabilities for all modes of severe weather, including probabilities of two or more tornadoes and one or more strong to violent tornadoes. (Currently, the minimum tornado probabilities for a tornado watch issuance require a ~30% chance of two or more tornado reports and, for PDS watches, an 80% chance of one or more strong tornadoes within the watch area over the valid time period, although that criterion was previously lower.)

The SPC produces two separate products listing all counties or equivalent subdivisions (parishes, independent cities, and coastal marine zones) included in the broader watch area: Watch County Lists (WCL), which are produced internally preceding the watch issuance for collaborative use with local NWS offices to outline counties and equivalent subdivisions being proposed for inclusion in the watch, and Watch Outline Update (WOU) messages, a public list of the determined watch subdivisions published upon the initial tornado watch issuance. Local NWS offices concurrently issue Watch County Notification (WCN) messages that list subdivisions within their designated area of responsibility that the office has considered to be in the initial watch; WCN messages—which the SPC uses as the basis for their Watch Outline Update product—are updated to denote changes to the watch by local WFOs, which are provided responsibility for adding or removing counties/subdivisions from the watch, extending its time of expiration, or cancelling the watch entirely if conditions no longer support a severe weather threat (if atmospheric conditions have become less conducive to form tornadoes or were insufficient for tornadic development compared to earlier forecast analysis). The SPC updates Watch Outline Updates at least on an hourly basis to incorporate changes made by the accordant WFOs in their Watch County Notification messages.

The SPC issues Watch Status Messages to designate areas considered to have a continuing severe weather threat, based primarily on the position of surface features (such as cold fronts and drylines)—and the NWS offices decide what counties to remove from the watch (the local offices will almost always follow the SPC recommendation on the status messages). If conditions are no longer favorable for tornadoes in the watch area, a tornado watch may either be replaced by a severe thunderstorm watch or cancelled outright; likewise, a tornado watch may replace a severe thunderstorm watch, if not merely a section of it, should conditions that were originally forecast to be conducive for non-tornadic severe thunderstorms evolve to allow an increased possibility of tornado formation. If no convective development or tornadic activity occurs, this leads to a tornado watch &quot;bust&quot;, which can factor into determinations by the SPC and National Weather Service offices on whether to cancel the watch.

Because the Storm Prediction Center and local National Weather Service WFOs each have roles in the watch issuance process, the subdivisions listed in the Watch Outline Update and Watch County Notification products will sometimes differ from the outlined watch box area, including subdivisions located outside the outlined quadrilateral; however the local Weather Forecast Office is tasked with determining which counties should be included in or, in lieu of a new downstream watch, added to the designated watch area. The WFOs monitoring their sector of the watch area can also consult, via conference call, with the Storm Prediction Center to relay and determine locally dictated changes to the tornado watch, regarding replacement of the watch and extensions of time and areal coverage if conditions warrant.

====Canada====
In Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada issues tornado watches through regional Meteorological Service offices based in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth. Unlike the box/subdivision structure of watches issued by the U.S. Storm Prediction Center, tornado watches issued by the Meteorological Service are issued strictly for groups of census subdivisions, often covering a total area that is relatively smaller than tornado watches in the U.S.). Watches are disseminated to the public through broadcast and online media outlets (including local television stations and The Weather Network/MétéoMédia), and Weatheradio Canada; depending on regional office discretion, the watch may require activation of the National Public Alerting System (Alert Ready) () and feeding provincial alerting systems (such as Alberta Emergency Alert and SaskAlert) to distribute the alert to local broadcast media and cellular phones.

<text>A severe thunderstorm watch (SAME code: SVA) is a statement issued by weather forecasting agencies to advise the public that atmospheric conditions in a given region may lead to the development of severe thunderstorms within (or near) the region over a period of several hours. The criteria for issuing a watch varies by country, and may also include torrential rainfall and tornadoes. A watch may also be issued several hours ahead of the arrival of a mature and organized complex of storms (such as a mesoscale convective system), or more clustered or discrete storm activity (of the single-cell, multicell and/or supercell varieties).

A severe thunderstorm watch, like a tornado watch, is not to be confused with a warning. A watch encourages the public to remain vigilant—to be on the watch, so to speak—for the later onset of severe weather. An area under a watch may even experience deceptively fair weather with few clouds before thunderstorms develop.

==Definition==
A &quot;severe thunderstorm watch&quot; indicates that atmospheric conditions observed in and close to the watch area have created a significant risk for the development and intensification of convective thunderstorms that could exceed regional severe criterion, and are normally issued in advance of the onset of severe weather. (The criteria for thunderstorms to be classified as severe varies by country; e.g., in the United States, severe thunderstorms must produce winds exceeding , and/or hailstones larger than in diameter, and/or one or more tornadoes.) Generally (but not always), thunderstorms that develop within the watch area may contain large hailstones, intense straight-line winds, intense lightning, torrential rainfall and/or flash flooding caused by high rainfall accumulations. Depending on storm cell intensity, severe thunderstorms can cause damage to structures or vehicles; impairment of vehicle and pedestrian travel; flooding to streets, populated neighborhoods, farmlands and other areas of poor drainage; and in extreme cases, injury or possible fatality to people and animals exposed outdoors (from either repeated hail-induced blunt trauma, wind-generated debris or intense flooding).

If severe weather actually does occur, a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning would then be issued. Residents and travelers in the watch area are advised to immediately undertake safety preparations ahead of the arrival of severe weather. A watch is not required for a thunderstorm- or other hydrological-based weather warning to be issued; severe thunderstorm warnings are often issued when a severe thunderstorm watch is not active (i.e., when a tornado watch is active or, less frequently, if severe convective storms are not expected to be of broad enough coverage to require a watch).

While a severe thunderstorm watch does not nominally imply the probability for tornadoes, if modest wind shear and storm-level helicity is conducive for a marginal tornado threat within the convective environment, storm cells that develop within the proximate severe thunderstorm watch area can occasionally exhibit mesocyclonic rotation at the cloud base and may spawn tornadoes if advanced tornadogenesis occurs. An existing severe thunderstorm watch, or merely a portion of it, can also be upgraded to a tornado watch, if conditions that were originally considered marginally conducive if at all for tornadic development have evolved to permit a greater risk of tornado formation; conversely, a section or the entirety of an existing tornado watch area can be replaced by a severe thunderstorm watch, if conditions are no longer considered conducive for tornadogenesis. Straight-line winds in severe thunderstorms created by strong downdrafts, however, can produce serious structural damage as severe as a lower-category tornado or hurricane over a path comparatively wider than a tornado.

When a severe thunderstorm watch is issued, people within the region of expected severe weather risk are advised to monitor conditions ahead of the developing weather situation; review thunderstorm safety precautions in the event they must seek immediate shelter; and use local broadcast media, weather radio, weather app alert notifications and/or SMS notifications to receive warnings and updated storm information.

==United States==
In the United States, severe thunderstorm watches are issued by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), a national guidance center of the National Weather Service (NWS) branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for areas of the lower 48 states where atmospheric conditions favor the development of convective thunderstorm activity reaching severe criteria. Although seldom issued in these states, responsibilities for issuing severe thunderstorm watches covering Alaska and Hawaii are respectively handled by local NWS forecast offices in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska, and Honolulu, Hawaii. Watches are typically valid for six to nine hours (extending if necessary as long as 12 hours during unusually steady-state or slow-moving severe weather events) after the time of issuance, and are intended to precede the first report of severe hail or wind by 45 minutes to one hour. SPC watch boxes—termed because the approximate watch area is represented in weather maps as a quadrilateral for aviation purposes—are usually outlined in the approximate delineation of &quot;x&quot; miles north and south, or east and west, or either side of a line (perpendicular to the center line) from &quot;y&quot; miles &quot;direction&quot; of &quot;city, state&quot;, to &quot;z&quot; miles &quot;another direction&quot; of &quot;another city, state&quot; (e.g., &quot;50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of Columbia, South Carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of Montgomery, Alabama&quot;). Geographic coverage of severe thunderstorm watches (which ranges from on average, encompassing portions of one or more states) vary based on the size of the land area under threat, the duration of severe weather risk, and the forward motion of the parent storm system and associated surface boundaries.

In situations where atmospheric conditions will support the production of very destructive straight-line winds and hail from the convective activity, the intensified wording &quot;particularly dangerous situation&quot; (PDS) can be added into the watch product. PDS severe thunderstorm watches usually suggest conditions over the approximate area present a widespread threat of destructive hail greater than in diameter and winds greater than being generated from the thunderstorm convection, or that downstream conditions favor the development and intensification of a bow echo or derecho moving at or faster. The inclusion of PDS wording (more commonly used for tornado watches in areas where the environment supports the development of strong to violent tornadoes) is rare for severe thunderstorm watches since the tornado threat, in comparison to the much higher threat of extreme wind or hail, must remain low enough to where a standard (non-PDS) tornado watch is not warranted.

SPC meteorologists utilize WarnGen software integrated into the National Centers Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (N-AWIPS) and/or the SPC Product Generator (PRODGEN) to generate the watch statement, which is disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to NOAA satellites, and over NOAA Weather Radio. The terms &quot;blue box&quot; and &quot;yellow box,&quot; often used in parlance within the meteorological community, refer to the coloring assigned to severe thunderstorm watch boxes for hazard maps used by the Storm Prediction Center and the National Weather Service; coloring used by local television outlets to highlight severe thunderstorm watches sometimes vary (in many cases, severe weather alert displays used by many local television stations usually reserve yellow as a highlighter for severe thunderstorm warnings, and blue as a highlighter for severe thunderstorm watches).

The Storm Prediction Center, in conjunction with local NWS Weather Forecast Offices, issues component watch products to communicate the approximate area, primary hazards and other pertinent information about the severe thunderstorm watch to the public, NOAA meteorologists, emergency management and aviation personnel. The graphical and text Public Watch products—in addition to outlining the approximate affected area, valid time, meteorological and aviation discussions, and other pertinent information—includes language specifying the forecast severe weather threat (e.g., &quot;widespread large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3 inches in diameter likely, scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely, a tornado or two possible&quot;) in the primary hazards list. The Watch Probability Table describes probabilities for all modes of severe weather, including probabilities of 10 or more severe wind or hail events and one or more reports of winds exceeding or hailstones exceeding . (Typically, the minimum event probabilities for a severe thunderstorm watch issuance require an ~30% chance of 10 or more wind and hail reports and, for PDS watches, a 70% chance of one or more reports of &gt;65 kt winds and/or &gt;2-inch hail within the watch area over the valid time period.)

The SPC produces two separate products listing all counties or equivalent subdivisions (parishes, independent cities, and coastal marine zones) included in the broader watch area: Watch County Lists (WCL), which are produced internally preceding the watch issuance for collaborative use with local NWS offices to outline counties and equivalent subdivisions being proposed for inclusion in the watch, and Watch Outline Update (WOU) messages, a public list of the determined watch subdivisions published upon the initial severe thunderstorm watch issuance. Local NWS offices concurrently issue Watch County Notification (WCN) messages that list subdivisions within their designated area of responsibility that the office has considered to be in the initial watch; WCN messages—which the SPC uses as the basis for their Watch Outline Update product—are updated to denote changes to the watch by local WFOs, which are provided responsibility for adding or removing counties/subdivisions from the watch, extending its time of expiration, or cancelling the watch entirely if conditions no longer support a severe weather threat (if atmospheric conditions have become less conducive to form severe thunderstorms or were insufficient for severe weather development compared to earlier forecast analysis). The SPC updates Watch Outline Updates at least on an hourly basis to incorporate changes made by the accordant WFOs in their Watch County Notification messages.

The SPC issues Watch Status Messages to designate areas considered to have a continuing severe weather threat, based primarily on the position of surface features (such as cold fronts and drylines)—and the NWS offices decide what counties to remove from the watch (the local offices will almost always follow the SPC recommendation on the status messages). If conditions are no longer favorable for severe convective thunderstorms in the watch area, the severe thunderstorm watch may be cancelled outright; occasionally, a severe thunderstorm watch, if not merely a section of it, may be replaced by a tornado watch should conditions that were originally forecast to be conducive for non-tornadic severe thunderstorms evolve to allow an increased possibility of tornado formation, and likewise may replace a tornado watch if conditions for tornadogenesis are no longer considered favorable. If no convective development or reported severe weather occurs, this leads to a severe thunderstorm watch &quot;bust&quot;, which can factor into determinations by the SPC and National Weather Service offices on whether to cancel the watch.

Because the Storm Prediction Center and local National Weather Service WFOs each have roles in the watch issuance process, the subdivisions listed in the Watch Outline Update and Watch County Notification products will sometimes differ from the outlined watch box area, including subdivisions located outside the outlined quadrilateral; however the local Weather Forecast Office is tasked with determining which counties should be included in or, in lieu of a new downstream watch, added to the designated watch area. The WFOs monitoring their sector of the watch area can also consult, via conference call, with the Storm Prediction Center to relay and determine locally dictated changes to the severe thunderstorm watch, regarding replacement of the watch and extensions of time and areal coverage if conditions warrant.

==Canada==
In Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) issues severe thunderstorm watches through regional Meteorological Service (MSC) offices based in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth. Unlike the box/subdivision structure of watches issued by the U.S. Storm Prediction Center, severe thunderstorm watches issued by the Meteorological Service are issued strictly for groups of census subdivisions, often covering a total area that is relatively smaller than severe thunderstorm watches in the U.S.). Watches are disseminated to the public through broadcast and online media outlets (including local television stations and The Weather Network/MétéoMédia), and Weatheradio Canada; depending on regional office discretion, the watch may require activation of the National Public Alerting System (Alert Ready) () and feeding provincial alerting systems (such as Alberta Emergency Alert and SaskAlert) to distribute the alert to local broadcast media and cellular phones.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), through its regional services divisions, issues thunderstorm watches to alert regions and/or provinces of thunderstorm development within a period of twelve hours. Watches are disseminated to the public through terrestrial television and radio stations, and online media outlets.

<text>The Beauceron () is a herding dog breed originating from the plains of Central France. The Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce (, sheepdog from Beauce) or Bas Rouge (, red-stockings).

==Description==
===Appearance===

This breed stands 61 to 70 cm (24 to 27.5 inches) in height and weighs 30 to 45 kg (66 to 100 pounds) The Beauceron has a hard outer coat and a woolly undercoat that grows thick in cold weather, especially if the dog sleeps outdoors. Its standard colouring is black and tan (the latter colour referred to in French as &quot;rouge ecureuil&quot;, squirrel-red) or, less frequently, grey, black and tan called harlequin. Other colours, such as the once prevalent tawny, grey or grey/black, are now banned by the breed standard. The harlequin coats should have more black than gray with no white. In the black and tan dogs the tan markings should appear in two dots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, fading off to the cheeks, but do not reach the underside of the ears. Also on the throat, under the tail and on the legs and the chest. Tan markings on the chest should appear as two spots but a chest plate is acceptable. Ear cropping is no longer allowed in most countries.

The Beauceron is unusual in having a double dewclaw. In order to be shown, a Beauceron must have double dewclaws that form well-separated &quot;thumbs&quot; with nails on each rear leg; anything less will result in disqualification from dog shows. The Beauceron&#x27;s double dew claws are connected by bone (unlike most breeds) and some dogs are even able to flex each one individually. The Beauceron has no breed-specific health problems.

===Characteristics===
The Beauceron is known in France as a guard dog, a helper around the farm (herding sheep or cattle), and/or a ring sport dog (primarily protection training). This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless. Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. If not well trained, they can be aggressive. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). They have a double smooth coat that is short. They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed. Several five- or ten-minute play-training exercises per day in the early years can achieve better results than long or rigorous training sessions.

== History ==
The breed originated as a herding dog in France. It was first mentioned in 1587, and named as the &quot;Berger de Beauce&quot; in 1809. The first breed club was formed in 1911. During WWII, it was employed as a military dog. In modern France, it is used as a guard or police dog, and as of 1989 was still a popular sheep dog.

<text>A severe thunderstorm warning (SAME code: SVR) is a type of public warning for severe weather that is issued by weather forecasting agencies worldwide when one or more severe thunderstorms have been detected by Doppler weather radar, observed by weather spotters, or reported by an emergency management agency, law enforcement, or the general public. Unlike a watch, a warning is issued to areas in the direct path of active severe thunderstorms, that are expecting a direct impact typically within an hour. Severe thunderstorms can cause property damage and injury due to large hail, high winds, and flooding due to torrential rainfall. The exact criteria to issue a warning varies from country to country.

In the United States, the National Weather Service issues a warning when an observed thunderstorm is producing wind gusts of at least , or hail of at least in diameter. Most forecasting agencies have similar criteria, but some agencies, such as Environment Canada, also include high rainfall rate. Others may instead issue a flood advisory or in the case of the National Weather Service, a flash flood warning.

==Definition==
A severe thunderstorm warning indicates the warned area is in impending danger from hail or wind speeds meeting warning criteria as well as from lightning and hydrological impacts associated with the storm cell. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce tornadoes without warning. While not all severe thunderstorms produce tornadoes, they can produce serious straight line wind damage as severe as a lower-category tornado or hurricane, and can actually cover a much wider area than that exceeded by a tornado&#x27;s comparatively narrow path width.

If a tornado is detected on radar or is sighted visually, a tornado warning will be issued either in replacement of or concurrently to the existing severe thunderstorm warning. Generally, but not always, a severe thunderstorm watch or tornado watch (or a regional equivalent thereof) will precede a warning. If a tornado warning is issued, based on Doppler weather radar, it means strong rotation has been detected within a thunderstorm. Usually, if a thunderstorm is producing only weak rotation, it will only yield hazardous weather warranting a severe thunderstorm warning. However, the public will usually be advised this type of rotation has been detected and that the storm in question should be watched closely in the near future for further intensification.

===Regional basis and criteria===
====United States====
In the United States, the National Weather Service (NWS) defines a severe thunderstorm as having large hail of in diameter or larger, surface wind speeds of or greater, and/or a tornado. Prior to January 2010, the hail size for which a thunderstorm would be considered severe was ; public complacency due to overly frequent issuances of severe thunderstorm warnings and recent studies stating hail did not produce significant damage on the ground until it reached one inch in diameter caused the upgrade in hail criteria. Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued by the National Weather Service through the agency&#x27;s local Weather Forecast Offices, which utilize WarnGen software integrated into the Advance Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) to generate the warning statement; it is then disseminated through various communication routes accessed by the media and various agencies, on the internet, to NOAA satellites, over NOAA Weather Radio and, depending on the storm&#x27;s severity and at the office&#x27;s discretion, via activation of the Emergency Alert System to local broadcast media and Wireless Emergency Alerts for cellular phones.

Local NWS forecast offices outline warnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in polygonal shapes for map-based weather hazard products distributed to the main agency, individual forecast office websites and the Storm Prediction Center (including open-source APIs available for free use to public weather websites and mobile apps), based on the storm&#x27;s projected path as determined by Doppler weather radar at the time of the warning&#x27;s issuance. In NWS text products, warnings are usually illustrated by individual counties, parishes or other county-equivalent jurisdictions (sections or the entirety thereof, and in list format if it covers more than one jurisdiction), particularly dependent on the jurisdiction&#x27;s total land area. Prior to October 2007, warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on a per-county basis. SPC and NWS products, as well as severe weather alert displays used by some television stations, typically highlight severe thunderstorm warnings with a yellow or orange polygon or filled county/parish/equivalent jurisdiction outline.

The NWS has the option of adding enhanced wording to severe thunderstorm warnings and update statements issued as a Severe Weather Statement (SVS)—&quot;particularly dangerous situation&quot; (PDS), &quot;severe thunderstorm emergency&quot;, or, as used by some Central and Southern Region offices as indicative PDS wording, &quot;this is a very dangerous storm&quot;—when an extremely intense severe thunderstorm expected to impact a densely populated area contains very large hailstones and/or intense straight-line winds capable of causing major structural damage (especially to roofs, windows, siding and structures of poor construction such as outbuildings and mobile homes), and severe injury if not death to people and animals exposed outdoors (from either repeated hail-induced blunt trauma or wind-generated debris). Although it is an unofficial alert product, a &quot;severe thunderstorm emergency&quot; statement—an extension of the tornado emergency statements issued to warn of a violent tornado impacting populated areas—is the highest and most urgent level relating to non-tornadic severe thunderstorms. When a threat of tornadic activity exists (especially if a tornado watch is in effect), local NWS forecast offices, particularly those in the Great Plains or Southeastern U.S., will sometimes include a safety precaution action statement indicating &quot;Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with no advance warning...&quot; or similar wording in their severe thunderstorm warnings to advise the public to keep abreast of possible tornado development and any tornado warnings that may be issued.

As part of the agency’s March 2012 implementation of a multi-tier Impact Based Warning (IBW) system to notify the public and emergency management officials of the severity of specific severe weather phenomena, National Weather Service-issued severe thunderstorm warnings and associated Severe Weather Statements providing updated storm information include event tags at the bottom of the product text providing summarical estimates of straight-line wind speeds (sustained or gusts) and hail size and, when applicable, an indication of possible tornadic development. The product text will also provide a summary of impacts to life and property that may be caused by the hailstones and winds being produced by the parent thunderstorm. Initially implemented at six NWS offices in Kansas and Missouri, the categorical threat and damage indicator text—which are applicable to all of the agency’s Weather Forecast Offices, primarily those operating within the agency&#x27;s Central and Southern Region divisions—were expanded to 33 additional Central Region WFOs in March 2013; eight additional offices operating within the Eastern, Southern and Western Region divisions began using the IBW indicators in March 2014. The entire agency began using the format in 2016. The threat indicators consist of three coded taglines, ascending by observational level:
* Tornado – indicates the mesocyclone of the parent severe thunderstorm is producing circulation at or near the cloud base, which may warrant the issuance of a tornado warning if base-level rotation strengthens. When incorporated into the storm impact summary, the tornado tag (appearing in applicable severe thunderstorm warning products as “TORNADO...POSSIBLE”) will precede the wind and hail tags.
* Hail – indicates the estimated size of hail (measured in inches) being produced by the parent severe thunderstorm (e.g., “HAIL...1.25IN”). When included, the “Impact” section of the warning text will describe potential damage impacts from the hailstones, with the impact message varying in severity depending on radar estimated or observed reports of measured large hail (e.g., “Hail damage to vehicles is expected.”) and the “Hazard” section will provide a comparison of the size of hailstones to objects of similar size (e.g., “baseball size hail” for hailstones measuring 2.75&quot;). (If the tag lists either “HAIL...0.00IN”, indicating no hail is accompanying the storm, or “HAIL...&lt;.75IN”, indicating hailstones below severe criteria that may range in equivalent size from peas [.25&quot;] to pennies [.75&quot;], no hail size will be indicated in the “Hazard” row nor will a description of damage risk be included in the “Impact” section.)
* Wind – indicates estimated speed (in miles per hour) of wind gusts produced by the parent thunderstorm (e.g., “WIND...70MPH”). When included, the “Impact” section of the warning text will describe potential damage impacts from the straight-line winds, varying in severity depending on wind strength (e.g., “Expect considerable tree damage. Wind damage is also likely to mobile homes, roofs, and outbuildings.”).

Since July 28, 2021 (or as late as August 2 in certain County Warning Areas), the NWS has incorporated categorical damage threat indicators for higher-end hail and/or wind events at the bottom of text products for severe thunderstorm warnings (including update statements to existing warnings issued as Severe Weather Statements):
* Considerable – to be used when hail of or larger and/or winds at or above is indicated by radar or observed.
* Destructive – to be used when hail of or larger and/or winds at or above is indicated by radar or observed. (Warnings assigned this indicator incorporate the notation &quot;THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE STORM FOR[...]&quot;—which superseded the boilerplate &quot;this is a particularly dangerous situation&quot; wording—between the storm summary and hazard information in the product text to indicate certain areas under greatest threat from the specified wind speeds and/or hail size.)
Similar to the indicators used for tornado warnings since the 2013 implementation of its Impact Based Warning system, the categorical criteria—which will be applicable to all NWS Weather Forecast Offices—was introduced to further explain to the public of the dangers of some thunderstorms, especially those that occur in the Great Plains, that can produce massive hailstones of baseball size () or larger that may fall fast enough to severely injure if not kill a person by repeated blunt trauma, and winds that can cause damage equivalent to hurricanes and tornadoes (especially to roofs and weaker structures such as outbuildings and mobile homes). When deemed necessary, initial warnings and Severe Weather Statement updates containing the &quot;destructive&quot; tag will be disseminated into the Wireless Emergency Alerts system as well.

====Canada====
In Canada, a severe thunderstorm is defined as having wind gusts of greater than , hail with a diameter of greater than , rainfall rates of greater than in one hour or greater than in three hours, or tornadoes. Environment and Climate Change Canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings through regional offices of the Meteorological Service of Canada based in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Dartmouth for specified municipalities and census subdivisions, sometimes including areas adjacent to a particular warned thunderstorm that are not in the immediate approximate path but may experience severe weather from adjacent thunderstorms during the warning timeframe. Warnings are disseminated to the public through broadcast and online media outlets, and Weatheradio Canada; depending on storm severity and regional office discretion, the warning may require activation of the National Public Alerting System (Alert Ready) () and feeding provincial alerting systems (such as Alberta Emergency Alert and SaskAlert) to distribute the alert to local broadcast media and cellular phones.

====United Kingdom====
In United Kingdom, a severe thunderstorm is defined as having hail in excess of and straight-line winds in excess of . The Met Office issues de facto severe thunderstorm warnings through general-purpose weather warning products disseminated by the National Severe Weather Warning Service (classified as yellow, amber or red, depending on storm severity and proximity to the time of expected onset of storm impacts).

====Australia====
In Australia, a severe thunderstorm is defined as having damaging winds in excess of , large hail of or larger, heavy rainfall, and flash flooding. Severe thunderstorm warnings are issued by regional offices of the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) based in Melbourne Docklands, Adelaide, Darwin, Perth and Brisbane. BOM-issued severe thunderstorm warnings are outlined as either a broad-based warning, covering expected impacts within a weather reporting area, or as a detailed warning, when a thunderstorm is within weather-watch radar range and includes a map depicting any existing thunderstorms and the forecast direction of movement for up to 60 minutes.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, a severe thunderstorm is defined by the Meteorological Service of New Zealand (MetService) () as having large hail of , damaging winds of , rainfall rates of at least per hour and/or tornadoes producing winds above (rated F1 or stronger on the Fujita Scale). MetService issues severe thunderstorm warnings to alert regions expected to experience severe weather phenomena meeting regional criteria and utilize the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) to generate the warning statement. The warning is then disseminated to the public through terrestrial television and radio stations, online media, mobile app and SMS messaging through Emergency Mobile Alert (EMA); if a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar within the warned area during the severe thunderstorm warning&#x27;s duration, civil defense sirens, if present, are usually activated within the region to be affected to inform people who are present outdoors of the approaching tornado threat.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, a severe thunderstorm is defined by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) as having strong winds, large hail, torrential rainfall, tornadoes, flash flooding and/or landslides. PAGASA, through its regional services divisions, issue thunderstorm advisories to alert regions and/or provinces expected to experience severe weather phenomena meeting regional criteria within a period of two hours. Warnings are disseminated to the public through terrestrial television and radio outlets, online media, and via SMS messages through the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council&#x27;s Emergency Cell Broadcast System.

<text>In mathematics, deconvolution is the inverse of convolution. Both operations are used in signal processing and image processing. For example, it may be possible to recover the original signal after a filter (convolution) by using a deconvolution method with a certain degree of accuracy. Due to the measurement error of the recorded signal or image, it can be demonstrated that the worse the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the worse the reversing of a filter will be; hence, inverting a filter is not always a good solution as the error amplifies. Deconvolution offers a solution to this problem.

The foundations for deconvolution and time-series analysis were largely laid by Norbert Wiener of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his book &quot;Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series&quot; (1949). The book was based on work Wiener had done during World War II but that had been classified at the time. Some of the early attempts to apply these theories were in the fields of weather forecasting and economics.

== Description ==
In general, the objective of deconvolution is to find the solution &quot;f&quot; of a convolution equation of the form:

: formula_1

Usually, &quot;h&quot; is some recorded signal, and &quot;f&quot; is some signal that we wish to recover, but has been convolved with a filter or distortion function &quot;g&quot;, before we recorded it. Usually, &quot;h&quot; is a distorted version of &quot;f&quot; and the shape of &quot;f&quot; can&#x27;t be easily recognized by the eye or simpler time-domain operations. The function &quot;g&quot; represents the impulse response of an instrument or a driving force that was applied to a physical system. If we know &quot;g&quot;, or at least know the form of &quot;g&quot;, then we can perform deterministic deconvolution. However, if we do not know &quot;g&quot; in advance, then we need to estimate it. This can be done using methods of statistical estimation or building the physical principles of the underlying system, such as the electrical circuit equations or diffusion equations.

There are several deconvolution techniques, depending on the choice of the measurement error and deconvolution parameters:

===Raw deconvolution===

When the measurement error is very low (ideal case), deconvolution collapses into a filter reversing. This kind of deconvolution can be performed in the Laplace domain. By computing the Fourier transform of the recorded signal &quot;h&quot; and the system response function &quot;g&quot;, you get &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, with &quot;G&quot; as the transfer function. Using the Convolution theorem,

: formula_2

where &quot;F&quot; is the estimated Fourier transform of &quot;f&quot;. Finally, the inverse Fourier transform of the function &quot;F&quot; is taken to find the estimated deconvolved signal &quot;f&quot;. Note that &quot;G&quot; is at the denominator and could amplify elements of the error model if present.

===Deconvolution with noise===

In physical measurements, the situation is usually closer to

: formula_3

In this case &quot;ε&quot; is noise that has entered our recorded signal. If a noisy signal or image is assumed to be noiseless, the statistical estimate of &quot;g&quot; will be incorrect. In turn, the estimate of &quot;ƒ&quot; will also be incorrect. The lower the signal-to-noise ratio, the worse the estimate of the deconvolved signal will be. That is the reason why inverse filtering the signal (as in the &quot;raw deconvolution&quot; above) is usually not a good solution. However, if at least some knowledge exists of the type of noise in the data (for example, white noise), the estimate of &quot;ƒ&quot; can be improved through techniques such as Wiener deconvolution.

==Applications==

===Seismology===

The concept of deconvolution had an early application in reflection seismology. In 1950, Enders Robinson was a graduate student at MIT. He worked with others at MIT, such as Norbert Wiener, Norman Levinson, and economist Paul Samuelson, to develop the &quot;convolutional model&quot; of a reflection seismogram. This model assumes that the recorded seismogram &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the convolution of an Earth-reflectivity function &quot;e&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and a seismic wavelet &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) from a point source, where &quot;t&quot; represents recording time. Thus, our convolution equation is

:formula_4

The seismologist is interested in &quot;e&quot;, which contains information about the Earth&#x27;s structure. By the convolution theorem, this equation may be Fourier transformed to

: formula_5

in the frequency domain, where formula_6 is the frequency variable. By assuming that the reflectivity is white, we can assume that the power spectrum of the reflectivity is constant, and that the power spectrum of the seismogram is the spectrum of the wavelet multiplied by that constant. Thus,

: formula_7

If we assume that the wavelet is minimum phase, we can recover it by calculating the minimum phase equivalent of the power spectrum we just found. The reflectivity may be recovered by designing and applying a Wiener filter that shapes the estimated wavelet to a Dirac delta function (i.e., a spike). The result may be seen as a series of scaled, shifted delta functions (although this is not mathematically rigorous):

: formula_8

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of reflection events, formula_9 are the reflection coefficients, formula_10 are the reflection times of each event, and formula_11 is the Dirac delta function.

In practice, since we are dealing with noisy, finite bandwidth, finite length, discretely sampled datasets, the above procedure only yields an approximation of the filter required to deconvolve the data. However, by formulating the problem as the solution of a Toeplitz matrix and using Levinson recursion, we can relatively quickly estimate a filter with the smallest mean squared error possible. We can also do deconvolution directly in the frequency domain and get similar results. The technique is closely related to linear prediction.

===Optics and other imaging===

In optics and imaging, the term &quot;deconvolution&quot; is specifically used to refer to the process of reversing the optical distortion that takes place in an optical microscope, electron microscope, telescope, or other imaging instrument, thus creating clearer images. It is usually done in the digital domain by a software algorithm, as part of a suite of microscope image processing techniques. Deconvolution is also practical to sharpen images that suffer from fast motion or jiggles during capturing. Early Hubble Space Telescope images were distorted by a flawed mirror and were sharpened by deconvolution.

The usual method is to assume that the optical path through the instrument is optically perfect, convolved with a point spread function (PSF), that is, a mathematical function that describes the distortion in terms of the pathway a theoretical point source of light (or other waves) takes through the instrument. Usually, such a point source contributes a small area of fuzziness to the final image. If this function can be determined, it is then a matter of computing its inverse or complementary function, and convolving the acquired image with that. The result is the original, undistorted image.

In practice, finding the true PSF is impossible, and usually an approximation of it is used, theoretically calculated or based on some experimental estimation by using known probes. Real optics may also have different PSFs at different focal and spatial locations, and the PSF may be non-linear. The accuracy of the approximation of the PSF will dictate the final result. Different algorithms can be employed to give better results, at the price of being more computationally intensive. Since the original convolution discards data, some algorithms use additional data acquired at nearby focal points to make up some of the lost information. Regularization in iterative algorithms (as in expectation-maximization algorithms) can be applied to avoid unrealistic solutions.

When the PSF is unknown, it may be possible to deduce it by systematically trying different possible PSFs and assessing whether the image has improved. This procedure is called &quot;blind deconvolution&quot;. Blind deconvolution is a well-established image restoration technique in astronomy, where the point nature of the objects photographed exposes the PSF thus making it more feasible. It is also used in fluorescence microscopy for image restoration, and in fluorescence spectral imaging for spectral separation of multiple unknown fluorophores. The most common iterative algorithm for the purpose is the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution algorithm; the Wiener deconvolution (and approximations) are the most common non-iterative algorithms.

For some specific imaging systems such as laser pulsed terahertz systems, PSF can be modeled mathematically. As a result, as shown in the figure, deconvolution of the modeled PSF and the terahertz image can give a higher resolution representation of the terahertz image.

=== Radio astronomy ===
When performing image synthesis in radio interferometry, a specific kind of radio astronomy, one step consists of deconvolving the produced image with the &quot;dirty beam&quot;, which is a different name for the point spread function. A commonly used method is the CLEAN algorithm.

=== Biology, physiology and medical devices ===
Typical use of deconvolution is in tracer kinetics. For example, when measuring a hormone concentration in the blood, its secretion rate can be estimated by deconvolution. Another example is the estimation of the blood glucose concentration from the measured interstitial glucose, which is a distorted version in time and amplitude of the real blood glucose. 

=== Absorption spectra ===
Deconvolution has been applied extensively to absorption spectra. The Van Cittert algorithm (article in German) may be used.

=== Fourier transform aspects ===
Deconvolution maps to division in the Fourier co-domain. This allows deconvolution to be easily applied with experimental data that are subject to a Fourier transform. An example is NMR spectroscopy where the data are recorded in the time domain, but analyzed in the frequency domain. Division of the time-domain data by an exponential function has the effect of reducing the width of Lorentzian lines in the frequency domain.

<text>In Norse mythology, Óðr (; Old Norse for the &quot;Divine Madness, frantic, furious, vehement, athger&quot;, as a noun &quot;mind, feeling&quot; and also &quot;song, poetry&quot;; Orchard (1997) gives &quot;the frenzied one&quot;) or Óð, sometimes anglicized as Odr or Od, is a figure associated with the major goddess Freyja. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, both describe Óðr as Freyja&#x27;s husband and father of her daughter Hnoss. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; adds that the couple produced another daughter, Gersemi. A number of theories have been proposed about Óðr, generally that he is a hypostasis of the deity Odin due to their similarities.

==Etymology==

The Old Norse theonym &quot;&quot; derives from an identical noun, meaning &#x27;mind, wit, soul, sense&#x27; but also &#x27;song, poetry&#x27;, which in turn stems from Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot;, a substantive of an adjective meaning &#x27;possessed, inspired, delirious, raging&#x27;. It is cognate with other nouns from medieval Germanic languages, such as Old English &quot;&quot; (&#x27;sound, noise; voice, song&#x27;), Old High German &quot;wuot&quot; (&#x27;thrill, violent agitation&#x27;) and Middle Dutch &quot;woet&quot; (&#x27;rage, frenzy&#x27;). &quot;Óðr&quot; is also etymologically related to the Old Norse theonym &quot;Óðinn&quot;, itself deriving from the stem *&quot;wōđa-&quot; attached to the suffix *-&quot;naz&quot; (&#x27;master of&#x27;). 

Philologist Jan de Vries has argued that the Old Norse deities Óðinn and Óðr were probably originally connected (as in the doublet Ullr–Ullinn), with &quot;Óðr&quot; (*&quot;wōđaz&quot;) being the elder form and the ultimate source of the name &quot;Óðinn&quot; (&quot;*wōđa-naz&quot;). He further suggested that the god of rage Óðr–Óðinn stood in opposition to the god of glorious majesty Ullr–Ullinn in a similar manner to the Vedic contrast between Varuna and Mitra.

The adjective &quot;*wōđaz&quot; ultimately stems from a Pre-Germanic form &quot;*uoh₂-tós&quot;, which is related to the Proto-Celtic term , meaning &#x27;seer, sooth-sayer&#x27; (cf. Gaulish , Old Irish &quot;fáith&quot; &#x27;prophet&#x27;) and , meaning &#x27;prophesy, poetic inspiration&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &#x27;prophetic wisdom, maxims&#x27;, Old Welsh &#x27;prophetic verse, panegyric&#x27;). According to some scholars, the Latin term &quot;vātēs&quot; (&#x27;prophet, seer&#x27;) is probably a Celtic loanword from the Gaulish language, making &quot;*uoh₂-tós ~ *ueh₂-tus&quot; (&#x27;god-inspired&#x27;) a shared religious term common to Germanic and Celtic rather than an inherited word of earlier Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin. In the case a borrowing scenario is excluded, a PIE etymon &quot;*(H)ueh₂-tis&quot; (&#x27;prophet, seer&#x27;) can also be posited as the common ancestor of the attested Germanic, Celtic and Latin forms.

==Attestations==
Óðr is attested in the following sources:

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Óðr is mentioned in stanza 25 of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;. The name appears in a kenning for the major goddess Freyja; &quot;Óð&#x27;s girl&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Óðs mey gefna&quot;), pointing to a relation with the goddess.

Stanza 47 of the poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; contains mention of a figure by the name of &quot;Œdi&quot;. There, Hyndla taunts Freyja, stating that Freyja had run to Œdi, &quot;always full of desire&quot;. Scholar Carolyne Larrington says that the identity of Œdi is uncertain; it has been theorized that this may simply be Óðr, or that the figure may be another lover of Freyja&#x27;s. Scholar John Lindow describes this reference as &quot;puzzling&quot; as no other information is provided regarding the situation referred to by Hyndla. Scholar Britt-Mari Näsström says that this reference likely does not refer to Óðr, rather being the product of the amendments of Sophus Bugge, and that the line simply points to Freyja&#x27;s lust. Näsström comments that &quot;perhaps the philologists of the nineteenth century were misled by their romantic intentions&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the enthroned figure of High says that the goddess Freyja &quot;was married to someone named&quot; Óðr. High details that the two produced a daughter, Hnoss, and that this daughter was so fair that the term &quot;hnossir&quot; (meaning &quot;treasures&quot;) derives from her name and is applied to whatever is &quot;beautiful and precious.&quot; High adds that Óðr would go off traveling for extended periods, all the while Freyja would stay behind weeping tears of red gold. However, Freyja would travel &quot;among strange peoples&quot; while looking for Óðr, and so had many names. In chapter 36 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, the stanza of &quot;Völuspá&quot; mentioning Óðr is quoted.

In chapter 20 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, poetic names for the goddess Freyja are listed, including &quot;wife of Óðr&quot;. In chapter 36, a prose narrative points out than an excerpt of a work by the skald Einarr Skúlason refers to Freyja as the wife of Óðr (&quot;Óðr&#x27;s bedfellow&quot;). The same excerpt appears in chapter 49. In chapter 75, Óðr is mentioned a final time in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, where Freyja is cited as having &quot;wept gold&quot; for Óðr.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In chapter 1 of the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson refers to the two in an euhemerized account, stating that Freyja had a husband named Óðr, two daughters named Hnoss and Gersemi, and that they were so beautiful that their names were used for &quot;our most precious possessions&quot; (both of their names literally mean &quot;jewel&quot;).

==Theories==
The name Óðr for Freyja&#x27;s husband appears prominently in Völuspá 25, where it is said that &quot;Óðs mey&quot; was given to the giants. Nothing else is stated of him by this name in the Eddic poems. In Gylfaginning, Snorri briefly states that Óðr traveled to many nations and that Freyja searched for him in earnest, weeping as she went. Óðr is often theorized as somehow connected to Odin (Old Norse: &quot;Óðinn&quot;), the head of the Æsir in Norse mythology, by way of etymological similarities between the two names (Lindow states that the linguistic relationship is identical to that of &quot;Ullr&quot; and &quot;Ullin&quot;—often considered as variant names of a single god), and the fact that both are described as going on long journeys, though Lindow points out that Snorri is careful to keep them apart. All theories regarding him must remain speculative, due to the limited accounts contained in the sources.

Scholar Viktor Rydberg proposed that Freyja&#x27;s husband Oðr is identical with the hero Svipdag from the eddic poems Grougaldr and Fjölsvinsmál. Jacob Grimm and others have long identified Menglad (&quot;the neck-lace lover&quot;), Svipdag&#x27;s love interest in that poem, with Freyja the owner of Brísingamen.

Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson proposes that a cult of the Vanir may have influenced a cult of the Æsir in the waning days of Norse paganism during the Christianization of Scandinavia, potentially resulting in the figure of Óðr in Norse mythology, which she refers to as a &quot;strange double of Odin&quot;.

Scholar Rudolf Simek says that since Óðr appears in a kenning employed by the 11th century skald Einarr Skúlason (in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;) and in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Óðr is not a late invention. Simek says that &quot;the most obvious explanation is to identify Óðr with Odin,&quot; noting the similarity between their names (and agreeing with the Ullr/Ullin parallel), the long absences (comparing them to Odin&#x27;s exile in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;), and Óðr&#x27;s marriage with Freyja.

Simek adds that although these similarities exist, there are things that speak against it, such as that &quot;Freyja&#x27;s tears for Odin and her search are unmotivated,&quot; and that &quot;the reference to Hnoss as their only child is surprising - why, for example, should Baldr not be mentioned?&quot; Simek notes that these issues have resulted in sometimes very different explanations; Sophus Bugge and Hjalmar Falk saw a reflection of the Greek god Adonis in Óðr, Rudolf Much saw a reflection in the god Attis, and Lee Hollander theorizes a reflection of the folktale of Amor and Psyche in Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; account of Óðr and Freyja.

Simek concurs that, if the two gods were identical, Snorri would not have kept them so apart; yet that the names Odin and Óðr are so close that a lack of connection between the two gods isn&#x27;t possible. Some scholars have examined the relationship between the two in an attempt to find &quot;older&quot; and &quot;younger&quot; layers in the figures of Óðr and Odin, but Simek says that this approach has yet to yield any results that are convincing due to the sparsity of sources that mention Óðr.

Scholar Stephan Grundy comments that while it is conceivable that Óðr may have been invented as a separate figure from Odin after Christianization, the notion is implausible because a separate, independent figure by the name of Wod survives in folklore involving the Wild Hunt in areas as far south from Scandinavia as Switzerland. Grundy notes that Óðr appears to date to at least before the Viking Age. Grundy opines that &quot;as pointed out by Jan de Vries and others, there is little doubt&quot; that Óðr and Odin were once the same figure. Grundy says that &quot;Óðinn&quot; is an adjectival form of &quot;Óðr&quot;, and that &quot;Óðr&quot; may be the elder form of the two.

Grundy theorizes that the goddesses Frigg and Freyja did not stem from a single goddess. If they did not, Grundy says, the question of explaining the relationship between Freyja and Óðr becomes central, which has been one of the strongest points made in favor of the descent of Frigg and Freyja from a common goddess. Grundy notes that it is rarely mentioned that the Germanic peoples sometimes practiced polygamy, and cites chapter 18 of Tacitus&#x27; 1st century AD work &quot;Germania&quot;, where Tacitus records that while monogamy has very few exceptions in Germanic society, there are those who actively seek a polygamous marriage &quot;for the sake of high birth.&quot; Grundy contrasts this with accounts of polygynous marriages among the Merovingians and Carolingians, points out that the only Germanic law-code that expressly forbids such relationships is that of the Visigoths, and notes that while polygynous marriages are rarely attested in Scandinavian sources, Harald I of Norway was married to seven wives simultaneously. Grundy concludes that, as &quot;gods tend to reflect the social norms of their worshippers,&quot; it very possible that Odin/Óðr originally &quot;could have rejoiced in Frigg and Freyja simultaneously&quot;. Grundy posits that, over time polygynous marriages dwindled during the Viking Age and into the Christianization of the North Germanic territories and, as a result, such a relationship was less easily reflected in the deities of the people.

<text>Lawrence Alan Agran (born February 2, 1945) is an American lawyer and the current mayor of Irvine, California.

In May 2023, Agran announced that he would be running as a candidate for the 2024 Irvine mayoral election. He won the election with 39% of the vote, making it his sixth non-consecutive term as mayor of Irvine.

== Early life and education ==
Agran was born in Chicago, the son of Selma Elizabeth (Meyerson) and Reuben Agran (originally &quot;Agranowsky&quot;). He was raised in a &quot;politically liberal Jewish household&quot;. He grew up in North Hollywood, Los Angeles and was a baseball player as a child. He later attended North Hollywood High School where he played as a quarterback.

Agran graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Berkeley in 1966 with a Bachelor of Science degree in both history and economics. Agran in 1965, together with Peter and Nacy Madian, lobbied the California Public Utilities Commission for permission to run a holiday bus service between UC Berkeley and San Francisco International Airport, but were denied.

He then earned a juris doctor (with honors) from Harvard Law School in 1969, specializing in public interest law.

He served in the United States Army Reserve from 1962 to 1970.

Agran served as legal counsel to the California State Senate Committee on Health and Welfare and taught legislation and public policy at the UCLA School of Law and the University of California, Irvine Graduate School of Management.

== City government, 1978–1990 ==
===Elected service between 1978 and 1990===
Between 1978 and 1990, Larry Agran served on the Irvine City Council, including six years as mayor (Irvine employs a council-manager government).

By 1978, Larry Agran had become an active member of various community organizations and was a local attorney. Agran supported increased class integration and the use of federal funding for moderate-income housing in Irvine. Agran&#x27;s calls for the use of zoning and changes to Irvine&#x27;s general plan to slow the pace of suburban sprawl and protect open space gained him considerable support from the influential citizen group Irvine Tomorrow, which initiated a door-to-door campaign that helped elect Agran to one of two open seats on the Irvine City Council. Larry Agran won the most votes in his first election for Irvine City Council on March 7, 1978, being elected to his first four-year term in Irvine&#x27;s City Council.

Larry Agran won the most votes again in the regular municipal election on June 8, 1982, and first served as mayor of Irvine in 1982, continuing through 1984, with a second term starting in 1986. Agran garnered support in the 1986 election by calling for restraints on excessive growth in the city and the preservation of hillsides and farmlands, as well as arguing against new freeways in the Irvine area and advocating for the withdrawal of the city from the Transportation Corridor Agencies. In 1988, Agran won the first-ever direct-election for mayor in Irvine. In 1990, Agran was recognized as an elected Democratic Socialists of America &quot;DSAer&quot; by &quot;Democratic Left&quot; magazine. He lost reelection in the subsequent 1990 Irvine mayoral election.

====Municipal diplomacy====
In 1983, then-Mayor Agran established the Local Elected Officials of America (LEO-USA) project, which founded what became a network of over 250 U.S. local officials advocating for municipal priorities that had an international scope, including the end of the arms race, reduction in U.S. defense spending, and the prioritizing of increased federal spending in economically disadvantaged American cities. Meanwhile, in 1982, the non-profit Center for Innovative Diplomacy (CID) was established in San Francisco by Michael Shuman to advocate for citizen diplomacy and local government action to end the nuclear arms race. The organizations prioritized support for the 1981 Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign. Eventually, the organizations aimed at broader diplomatic issues, including sanctuary cities and sister cities in Central America. In the last decade of the Cold War, the networks grew to over 6,000 local officials and activists. CID and LEO-USA merged, under the CID name, and its headquarters moved to Irvine. The merger was followed by the foundation of the &quot;Bulletin of Municipal Foreign Policy&quot;, a journal that focused on the &quot;municipal foreign policy movement.&quot; In 2019, Agran worked with University of California, Irvine doctoral student Ben Leffel to chronicle the role Irvine had to play in establishing CID/LEO-USA its municipal foreign policy network, using original issues of the &quot;Bulletin,&quot; with articles largely written by the Center&#x27;s expansive network.

In 1989, Agran implemented the first city-level CFC ban in the country (see below) and is credited with starting &quot;the world’s largest international environmental city government network, ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability (formerly, International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives).&quot; In September 2020, Larry Agran was recognized by ICLEI as playing a crucial role in founding the international organization that now includes over 1,750 cities, towns, and counties in 84 countries:
A digital archive was created at the University of California, Irvine of CID&#x27;s work, as well as the founding of ICLEI.

====Human rights ordinance====
As Mayor in 1988, Larry Agran led the Irvine City Council to establish the first human rights ordinance of its kind in Orange County, prohibiting discrimination on basis of &quot;race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, physical handicap,&quot; as well as sexual orientation. The city ordinance was patterned on state and federal law, but went further to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Irvine City Council voted 4-0 to pass the ordinance.

In 1989, a ballot measure (Measure N), led by Christina Shea and her husband, struck &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as a protected class from the human rights ordinance. In June 2020, the initiative was repealed by a unanimous vote of the Irvine City Council.

====Municipal action on chlorofluorocarbons====
Agran, Rowland and Molina, championed what was described as one of &quot;the most far reaching measures&quot; in banning commercial process and consumer product use of CFCs. The ordinance is recognized as jumpstarting municipal, state, national, and international efforts to craft legislation that banned CFCs.

== 1992 presidential campaign ==

In 1992, Agran unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for president. He proposed removing all United States troops from Western Europe and Japan and redirecting 150 billion dollars as a &quot;peace dividend&quot; (1992 value) to local cities and towns for local services such as &quot;public health clinics, libraries, police forces, and transportation&quot;, a national health program, and environmental protections. 

Despite holding only a local office and being unknown outside California, in a poll on January 22, 1992, he tied with two well-known national politicians: Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former California governor Jerry Brown.

According to Carole Florman, organizer of the Global Warming Leadership Forum in Tallahassee in February (in which Agran participated), &quot;the audience was more enthusiastic about Larry Agran than about Bill Clinton&quot;. At a debate at Lehman College on 31 March 1992, Agran was arrested after calling out from the audience to be included.

Agran performed poorly in the New Hampshire primary, but did pick up modest support in later primaries as a protest candidate with appeal to those unhappy with the other candidates. He received three votes at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.

Agran was excluded from every television debate, along with some other minor candidates, such as Eugene McCarthy.

== City government, 1998–present ==

=== Return to city government in 1998 ===
In 1998, Agran re-entered public service as an Irvine City Councillor.

He was again elected mayor in the 2000 election (in which he was unopposed), and in 2002. He later, unsuccessfully, sought the mayoralty in 2012.

Agran rejoined the city council in 2004 and has, for many years, served as a councilor, being most recently re-elected in 2020. He chaired the city&#x27;s Great Park board until February 2011. (The board is charged with planning, constructing and operating a new park of nearly at the former Marine Corps Air Base El Toro in Irvine.)

====Orange County Great Park====
As an Irvine City Councilmember, Agran was the chair of the board of directors of the Orange County Great Park project from 2004 to 2010, establishing an international Great Park Master Design Competition that selected landscape architect Ken Smith of New York to create a master design and plan for the 40-year build-out of the Great Park.

Agran supervised removal and clean-up of decades of toxic contamination and building of many of the Great Park&#x27;s iconic features, including the Great Park Balloon and Carousel, the Palm Court and Arts Complex, the Farm + Food Lab, the South Lawn Soccer Complex, the huge North Lawn (the largest uninterrupted lawn in Southern California), and restoration and repurposing of historic World War II airplane hangars. Under Agran&#x27;s leadership, the Great Park also began hosting popular events, including Cirque du Soleil, concerts, movies, air shows, regular farmers markets, and countless other community events, boosting attendance at the Great Park to nearly one million annual visitors. Under Agran&#x27;s tenure, the City of Irvine and the Orange County Great Park also won a national U.S. Department of Energy competition to be the host venue for two U.S. Solar Decathlons, which were ultimately held at the Great Park in 2013 and 2015. Annual financial audits of the Great Park conducted from 2004 through 2010 consistently found that the project was properly managed and that all spending was properly authorized, with no significant irregularities or unaccounted-for funds.

In 2012, the development of the Great Park became politicized. Political opponents of Agran — including newly-elected Mayor Steven Choi and Councilmembers Christina Shea and Jeff Lalloway — won a 3-2 majority on the City Council, and called for another audit of Great Park expenditures. Agran and the other members of the City Council voted for the new audit, specifying that the cost should not exceed $250,000. Councilmembers Christina Shea and Jeff Lalloway were appointed by the city council to a newly constituted City Council Subcommittee charged with overseeing the audit. The committee hired an accounting firm to conduct the audit: Hagen, Streiff, Newton &amp; Oshiro (HSNO).

In January 2014, HSNO issued a preliminary public report declaring that $38 million in Great Park funds were &quot;missing.&quot; The funds were, in fact, sitting in a secure state-mandated housing set-aside account.

The budget for the Great Park audit increased from the original $250,000 that had been authorized to $1.7 million to conduct additional investigations into the Great Park.

These expenditures drew the attention of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee of the California State Legislature, which ordered California State Auditor Elaine Howle to conduct a careful review of the entire Great Park audit and the work of the Shea Subcommittee. That review culminated in California State Auditor Report 2015-116, titled &quot;Poor Governance of the $1.7 Million Review of the Orange County Great Park Needlessly Compromised the Review&#x27;s Credibility.&quot; The California State Auditor&#x27;s report states that the HSNO was hired through a flawed and biased selection process that &quot;cast doubt on the impartiality of Irvine&#x27;s selection of HSNO as the park review consultant and increased the risk that the city did not select the most qualified vendor to meet its needs.&quot; This bidding process all but ensured that HSNO would receive a second, &quot;no-bid&quot; contract. The report is also critical of the Shea Subcommittee&#x27;s failure to properly oversee the work of the outside firms hired to conduct the audit, noting that the audit itself was driven by political motivations rather than by an objective analysis of the readily-available financial data.

In January 2020, the accounting firm hired by the Shea Subcommittee — Hagen, Streiff, Newton &amp; Oshiro (HSNO) — was ordered to surrender their accountancy license and paid $550,000 in costs and penalties when the California Board of Accountancy said that the firm &quot;failed to comply with professional standards, engaged in numerous acts of negligence, and disseminated false and misleading information&quot; in performing the Great Park audit.

====Irvine term limits====
In 2014, Irvine voters had approved a rule to its city charter such that councilmembers and the mayors can serve no more than two full 2 year terms for life. Agran argued against the term limits, calling it the &quot;worst written term limits proposal in history&quot; in a statement on the 2014 ballot, saying that it was a bid by then-Mayor Steven Choi to stay in office for eight more years.

Agran is one of the longest serving city council members in Orange County, having served for over three decades on and off the city council since 1978, alongside serving as mayor for five non-consecutive 2 year terms. In December 2022, Agran had resigned with a week left on his term in order to run for another four years on the city council, which prompted his colleague Vice Mayor Tammy Kim to call it a &quot;slippery power grab&quot; and asking Agran if &quot;40 years on the city council [was] not enough&quot;.

== Orange County Veterans Memorial Park and Cemetery Campaigns ==
In July 2014, the Irvine City Council unanimously passed Councilmember Larry Agran&#x27;s motion to transfer 125-acres (50 hectares) of city-owned land called the Amended and Restated Development Agreement (ARDA) site to the state for development of a Veterans Memorial Park and Cemetery.

A concept plan for the development was released in June 2016. Estimated cost of the facility was $78 million. In April 2017, the Irvine City Council, on a split 3-2 vote, introduced a land-swap alternative with developer Five Point, trading the park-side ARDA site with a similarly sized location near Interstate 405. In June 2017, with another split 3-2 vote, Irvine City Council directed the City to enter the land swap contract with developer Five Point to move the cemetery.

After the Irvine City Council entered the land swap agreement on October 10, 2017, Irvine residents started a petition referendum campaign to halt the zoning ordinance change that was requisite for the land swap, submitting 19,140 signatures gathered within 30 days, which put the zoning change on the June 2018 ballot. The referendum to halt the zoning change was successful, as measure &quot;B&quot;, which would have allowed the relocation of the cemetery, was defeated by 63% to 37%.

In July 2018, the Irvine City Council moved to study a third site for the veterans&#x27; cemetery, dubbed the &quot;golf course site&quot;. Irvine residents initiated a petition initiative, led by Ed Pope and Larry Agran, to designate by zoning the ARDA site to be the only site in the Great Park area to be used for cemetery purposes. Proponents of the initiative to build at the original ARDA site submitted a reported 19,758 signatures to put the initiative on the November 2020 ballot. In May 2020, Irvine City Council voted 4-1 to adopt the initiative as ordinance, designating the ARDA site as the only site in the Great Park area for cemetery uses.

== Personal life ==
Agran met Phyllis Friedman at UC Berkeley in 1964. They were married on 12 June 1966, both at age 21. Their son, Kenneth Agran was born in 1970. Agran lives in the same home in University Park purchased in 1976. His son and grandchildren also reside in Irvine.

<text>A color gel or color filter (Commonwealth spelling: colour gel or colour filter), also known as lighting gel or simply gel, is a transparent colored material that is used in theater, event production, photography, videography and cinematography to color light and for color correction. Modern gels are thin sheets of polycarbonate, polyester or other heat-resistant plastics, placed in front of a lighting fixture in the path of the beam.

Gels have a limited life, especially in saturated colors (lower light transmission) and shorter wavelength (blues). The color will fade or even melt, depending upon the energy absorption of the color, and the sheet will have to be replaced. 

In permanent installations and some theatrical uses, colored glass filters or dichroic filters are used. The main drawbacks are additional expense and a more limited selection.

== History ==
In Shakespearean-era theater, red wine was used in a glass container as a light filter. In later days, colored water or silk was used to filter light in the theater. Later, a gelatin base became the material of choice. Gelatin gel was available at least until 1979. The name &quot;gel&quot; has continued to be used to the present day. Gelatin-based color media had no melting point, and the color was cast in the media as opposed to being coated on the surface. It would, however, char at high temperatures and become brittle once heated, so that it could not be handled once used in the lighting instrument.

By 1945, more heat-tolerant and self-extinguishing acetate-based through-dyed materials were being manufactured (marketed as Chromoid then Cinemoid by Strand Electric). In the U.S., Roscolene (acetate) was developed to deal with higher output light sources. Though cheaper, the acetate filters eventually fell out of favor with professional organizations since they could not withstand the higher temperatures produced by the tungsten halogen lamps that came into widespread use in the late 1960s. 

The acetate-based material was replaced by polycarbonates like Roscolar (mylar polycarbonate) and polyester-based filters. These materials have superior heat tolerance. Polyester having the highest melting point of . 

Often a surface coating was applied on a transparent film. The first dyed polyester gels were introduced by Berkey Colortran in 1969 as Gelatran, the original deep-dyed polyester. The Gelatran process is still used today to produce GAMColor (100% of the line) and Roscolux (about 30% of the line). Other color manufacturers, such as Lee Filters and Apollo Design Technology, use a surface applied dye. (Roscolux is 70% polycarbonate and 30% deep-dyed polyester.)

Almost every color manufacturer today uses either polycarbonate or polyester to manufacture their gels. Even today&#x27;s gels can burn out (to lighten in color starting in the center) easily, rendering them useless. As instrument design improves, it has become a selling point on many lights to have as little heat radiating from the front of the fixture as possible to prevent burn-through, and keep stage equipment and actors cooler.

In the 1930s, Strand Electric of London provided the first numbering system for their swatches and with their agents in New York and Sydney, the numbering system went round the world. Remnants of this original filter color system exist in the color swatches of today (such as Deep Amber = No. 3; Primary Red = No. 6; Middle Rose = No. 10; Peacock Blue = No. 15; Primary Blue = No. 20; Primary Green = No. 39). 

In the theater, gels are typically available in single sheets, which are then cut down to the appropriate size before use. The size originates from the gelatin days: it is the same as a standard baker&#x27;s sheet, which was used to cast the sheets. In the film industry, gels are usually cut straight from rolls wide and long, as the size required may vary from a single practical halogen spotlight in a ceiling to a whole window.

Similar colors may vary between different companies&#x27; formulations. For example, many have a color named &quot;bastard amber&quot;, but the transmitted color spectrum may be different. For this reason it is often misleading to refer to gel colors by name. Even a familiar color name, like Steel Blue, transmits widely differing colored light in each manufacturer&#x27;s line. 

By necessity, color gels are selected by specifying the manufacturer, line, color number, and name: Rosco Cinegel #3202 Full Blue CTB. 

Apollo Design Technology uses a four digit number based on the visible spectrum to designate and locate specific color transmissions. 

The GAMColor line from Rosco employs a three digit numbering system, organized by the wavelength of the principle color in the family, i.e.: Blues in the 800&#x27;s with primary blue at 850 (though the manufacturer&#x27;s numbers do not relate directly to any wavelength, transmission, or frequency). The same applies to Greens in the 600&#x27;s, Reds in the 200&#x27;s, etc. 

Rosco&#x27;s Roscolux line is currently the oldest major line of color media, . They started using only a two-digit numbering system, listing colors in no particular order. As the range demanded by designers increased and many more colors were offered in the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s, two digits quickly proved inadequate. As a result the original scheme was overlayed by three-digit and eventually four-digit numbers in between the original two-digit colors in the line. 

Manufacturers produce swatch books, which contain a small sample of each color, along with the color name and manufacturer&#x27;s catalogue number. Many manufacturers also provide spectral analysis for each color and transmission values, expressed as a percentage of light allowed to pass through the filter from the light source. Swatch books enable designers and technicians to have a true representation of the manufacturers&#x27; range of colors.

Many designers choose a limited color palette for generic applications because it is financially and logistically difficult to have access to all colors for a single show.

There are also gels for color correction, such as CTB (color temperature blue) and CTO (color temperature orange). Color correction gels alter or correct the color temperature of a light to more closely match the color temperature of a film negative or the white balance of a digital imager. Specifically CTB, which is blue in appearance, will correct tungsten lights that typically have a color temperature in the range of 3,200 to 5,700 kelvins to more closely match the color temperature of &quot;daylight&quot; negative, which is usually around 5,400 K (nominal daylight). CTO, which is orange in appearance, will correct a &quot;daylight&quot;-balanced light source (such as many common HMI bulbs) to match the color temperature of tungsten negative, which is typically 3,200 K. There are &quot;half&quot; and &quot;quarter&quot; variations of the common color correction gels. It is common to use color correction gels for artistic purposes and not just for negative-to-lightsource correction.

Most ranges of gels also include non-colored media, such as a variety of diffusion and directional &quot;silk&quot; materials to produce special lighting effects. &quot;Opal&quot; for example is an opalescent or translucent diffusion filter.

It is common for a gel manufacturer to publish the transmission coefficient or even the spectral transmittance curve in the swatch book and catalogs. A low transmittance gel will produce relatively little light on stage, but will cast a much more vivid color than a high transmission gel, because the colorfulness of a light source is directly related to narrowness of its spectral linewidth. Conversely, the flatter its curve becomes, the closer the gel is to a neutral density filter.

<text>Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument is a Utah state monument featuring a rock panel carved with one of the largest known collections of petroglyphs. It is located in San Juan County, along Utah State Route 211, northwest of Monticello and south of Moab.

It is along the relatively well-traveled access road into the Needles district of Canyonlands National Park, from US 191 and from the park boundary. The rock is a part of the vertical Wingate sandstone cliffs that enclose the upper end of Indian Creek Canyon, and is covered by hundreds of petroglyphs—one of the largest, best preserved and easily accessed groups in the Southwest. The petroglyphs feature a mixture of human, animal, material and abstract forms.

Newspaper Rock was designated a State Historical Monument in 1961, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in San Juan County, Utah as Indian Creek State Park in 1976.

==Petroglyphs==
The first carvings at the Newspaper Rock site were made around 2,000 years ago, left by people from the Archaic, Anasazi, Fremont, Navajo, Anglo, and Pueblo cultures.

In Navajo, the rock is called &quot;Tse&#x27; Hone&#x27;&quot; which translates to a rock that tells a story.

The petroglyphs were carved by Native Americans during both the prehistoric and historic periods. There are over 650 rock art designs. The drawings on the rock are of different animals, human figures, and symbols. These carvings include pictures of deer, buffalo, and pronghorn antelope. Some glyphs depict riders on horses, while other images depict past events like in a newspaper. While precisely dating the rock carvings has been difficult, repatination of surface minerals reveals their relative ages. The reason for the large concentration of the petroglyphs is unclear. One suggested explanation is that the rock was used as a place for communication through the petroglyphs between travelers.

The pictures at Newspaper Rock were inscribed into the dark coating on the rock, called desert varnish. Desert varnish is mainly made up (~70%) by clay materials, but gets its blackish color from iron and manganese oxide deposits that gradually form on exposed sandstone cliff faces owing to the action of rainfall and bacteria. The ancient artists produced the many types of figures and patterns by carefully chipping the coated rock surfaces with sharpened tools to remove the desert varnish and expose the lighter rock beneath. The older figures are themselves becoming darker in color as new varnish slowly develops.

== Depiction of Polydactyly ==

Many of the petroglyphs appear to be depicting polydactyly, the condition of having an extra toe or finger. In other Puebloan sites, burial remains with bifid metatarsals have been found near petroglyphs depicting polydactyly, suggesting that the pictures factually represent a real physical abnormality. One team of anthropologists excavated 96 skeletons from the nearby site of Pueblo Bonito and found that 3.1% of the skeletons had an extra toe on the right foot. This is a significantly higher rate of polydactyly than is seen in current Native American populations. There was evidence towards those with six toes being buried with items associated with higher social status, like an ornate bracelet, and turquoise. Polydactyl is also considered a moderately heritable condition, with 30-35% of those displaying the distinction also having a close relative with polydactyl. This means that it may be possible to use polydactyl to reconstruct ancient Puebloan lineages.

In 1984, Garnier started working as a waiter at the French Embassy in London. He started playing with DJ Nelson, a.k.a. DJ Stan, at a French club. He stayed there for a year and a half before moving to Manchester in 1986. Living in England he discovered the booming UK house scene and started DJing, including at the Haçienda.

==Career==
In 1987, he discovered The Haçienda in Manchester, and met Mike Pickering the resident DJ. Chicago house and Detroit techno became popular, and Garnier started mixing there under the name of DJ Pedro.

In 1988, he went back to France to fulfill his military obligations. He also spent some time in New York City where he met Frankie Knuckles. Garnier shifted his attention back to France in the early 1990s, running the Wake Up parties at the Rex Club in Paris for three years, and in Dijon from 1990 to 1994 at L&#x27;An-Fer while in 1992 he played a three-night long Weekender set at the Cork venue, Sir Henry&#x27;s and an Ibiza Foam Party at The Red Box, Dublin. He also mixed in clubs such as Le Palace or Le Boy, DJing in rave parties and gradually moving into recording as well. For the FNAC label, Garnier released &quot;French Connection&quot; and the &quot;A Bout de Souffle&quot; EP. After that label went out of business, he formed the F Communications label with Eric Morand (a friend who had also worked for Fnac).

His first album, &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;, was released in 1995. His second, &quot;30&quot;, appeared in 1997 and included one of Garnier&#x27;s best selling singles, &quot;Crispy Bacon&quot;. &quot;30&quot; was followed by the retrospective &quot;Early Works&quot;. After appearing worldwide with DJ appearances during the late 1990s, Garnier returned to production with &quot;Unreasonable Behaviour&quot;, released in early 2000, which featured one of his best known songs, &quot;The Man with the Red Face&quot;.

<doc id="275651" wikidata="Q1734086" url="?curid=275651" title="Shared-nothing architecture">
<text>A shared-nothing architecture (SN) is a distributed computing architecture in which each update request is satisfied by a single node (processor/memory/storage unit) in a computer cluster. The intent is to eliminate contention among nodes. Nodes do not share (independently access) the same memory or storage. 

One alternative architecture is shared everything, in which requests are satisfied by arbitrary combinations of nodes. This may introduce contention, as multiple nodes may seek to update the same data at the same time. It also contrasts with shared-disk and shared-memory architectures. 

SN eliminates single points of failure, allowing the overall system to continue operating despite failures in individual nodes and allowing individual nodes to upgrade hardware or software without a system-wide shutdown.

A SN system can scale simply by adding nodes, since no central resource bottlenecks the system. In databases, a term for the part of a database on a single node is a &quot;shard&quot;. A SN system typically partitions its data among many nodes. A refinement is to replicate commonly used but infrequently modified data across many nodes, allowing more requests to be resolved on a single node.

== History ==
Michael Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley used the term in a 1986 database paper. Teradata delivered the first SN database system in 1983. Tandem Computers NonStop systems, a shared-nothing implementation of hardware and software was released to market in 1976. Tandem Computers later released NonStop SQL, a shared-nothing relational database, in 1984.

== Applications ==
Shared-nothing is popular for web development.

Shared-nothing architectures are prevalent for data warehousing applications, although requests that require data from multiple nodes can dramatically reduce throughput.

<text>The Peene (; ) is a river in Germany.

== Geography ==
The Westpeene, with the Ostpeene as its longer tributary, and the Kleine Peene/Teterower Peene (with a &quot;Peene &quot; without specification (or &quot;Nordpeene&quot;) as its smaller and shorter affluent) flows into Kummerower See (Lake Kummerow), and from there as Peene proper to Anklam and into the Oder Lagoon.

The western branch of the Oder River, which separates the island of Usedom from the German mainland, is often also called Peene, but actually is considered a part of the Baltic Sea called the Peenestrom. It is one of three channels connecting the Oder Lagoon with the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea. (The other two are the Świna and the Dziwna.)

== Hydrography ==
The Peene river itself has some properties of an inlet. From Kummerower See, inclusively, to the mouth, the ground of the water is five feet and more below sea level. The windkessel effect of the large surface of this lake allows reverse flows that with northern wind may last as long as a week. These reverse flows do not only occur in times of low discharge of its effluent, but also in times of an overflow of precipitation. 

== Ecology ==
The Peene Valley is one of the largest contiguous fen regions in central Europe. Thanks to its wilderness and intact nature, the river Peene and its valley is sometimes grandiloquently referred to as &quot;the Amazon of the North&quot;.

Major towns at the Peene river are Malchin, Teterow, Demmin and Anklam.

Wolgast is on Peenestrom strait.

<doc id="275659" wikidata="Q7289018" url="?curid=275659" title="Ramapough Mountain Indians">
<text>The Ramapough Mountain Indians (also spelled Ramapo), known also as the Ramapough Lenape Nation or Ramapough Lunaape Munsee Delaware Nation or Ramapo Mountain people, are a New Jersey state-recognized tribe based in Mahwah. They have approximately 5,000 members living in and around the Ramapo Mountains of Bergen and Passaic counties in northern New Jersey and Rockland County in southern New York, about 25 miles (40 km) from New York City. 

They were recognized in 1980 by the state of New Jersey as the Ramapough Lenape Nation but are not recognized federally or recognized by the state of New York. Since January 2007, the chief of the Ramapough Lenape Nation has been Dwaine Perry.

The Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation claim a line of descent from the Lenape, whose regional bands included the Hackensack, Tappan, Rumachenanck/Haverstroo, Munsee/Minisink and Ramapo people, while absorbing people with varying degrees of Tuscarora, African, and Dutch and other European ancestry. The Lenape language in this area was Munsee, an Algonquian dialect. The Tuscarora spoke an Iroquoian language. After relations with European colonists began, ancestors of the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation also spoke Jersey Dutch and English. Presently they speak English. The Ramapough are working to restore the Munsee language among their members.

== Nonprofit organization ==
The Ramapough Mountain Indians or the Ramapough Lunaape Nation Inc. incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 1980.

Their executive director is Vince Morgan as of 2023, and their president is Dwaine Perry.

==Petition for recognition==
The Ramapough and two other tribes were recognized as Indian tribes in 1980 by the state of New Jersey by Resolution 3031. The New Jersey citation stated: 

Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1. That the Ramapough Mountain People of the Ramapough Mountains of Bergen and Passaic counties, descendants of the Iroquois and Algonquin nations, are hereby designated by the State of New Jersey as the Ramapough Indians.
The tribe asked its New Jersey Assembly member, W. Cary Edwards, to seek state recognition. After several months of research, Edwards and Assemblyman Kern introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 3031 (ACR3031) on May 21, 1979. It passed the Assembly and was passed by the Senate on January 7, 1980.
Edwards said later that debate in the assembly related to a book written by historian David Cohen (see below); he noted that he and other endorsers of recognition had to demonstrate the historical basis of the Ramapough. At the time, the state had not developed its own criteria or regulations related to tribal recognition. The state resolution also requested federal recognition of the Ramapough, but is non-binding in that regard. The state of New Jersey has also recognized the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape and the Powhatan Renape, descended from the Algonquian-speaking Lenape and Powhatan, respectively. Because of increased issues related to Native Americans, the State of New Jersey created the Commission on Native American Affairs by P.L.1134, c. 295, and it was signed into law on December 22, 1995, by Governor Christine Todd Whitman.

The Ramapough Indians claim to have been recognized by the State of New York by Legislative Resolution 86 in 1979. According to Alexa Koenig and Jonathan Stein, who have reviewed state recognition processes, New York does not have an official, separate process of recognition of Indian tribes and never recognized the Ramapough. It recognized the Shinnecock and one other tribe using independent criteria.
In 2009 the New York legislature had a bill pending to recognize the Ramapough people as Native Americans. It was never passed. 
In 1978 the Ramapough Mountain Indians (RMI) filed a petition for federal recognition as a tribe. They did not submit a documented petition until April 23, 1990. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on June 15, 1990 responded with a letter outlining the deficiencies in the petition. During the process, it repeatedly offered to have representatives meet with the tribe to review topics of research, specifically court records and land deeds, for the period 1750-1820 in which records are scarce. The RMI submitted a partial response on January 28, 1991. A fully revised petition was determined to be ready for active consideration on March 5, 1992. The petition had active consideration status on July 14, 1992. In December 1993, the BIA issued its proposed finding, rejecting the tribe&#x27;s petition. It granted the tribe an opportunity to respond, including extensions. It issued its Final Determination rejecting its petition on December 11, 1995. This Final Determination survived an internal BIA appeal in 1997 and a federal court appeal in 2001.

==Earlier exonym==
The Ramapo people were often referred to historically as the &quot;Jackson Whites&quot;, a term which they regard as being derogatory, and according to legend, was either from the name of the Jackson White heirloom potato or a distortion of &quot;Jacks and Whites&quot;, referring to their multiracial ancestry. Partly because of the people&#x27;s multiracial ancestry, many other people assumed they were descendants of runaway and freed slaves (&quot;Jacks&quot; in slang) and Caucasians. Over time, the latter were believed to have included Dutch settlers (represented by surnames common among the people) and later, Hessian soldiers (German mercenaries who had fought for the British during the American Revolution); that is, people who were considered suspect by the dominant British Americans. The people supposedly fled to frontier areas of the mountains after the end of the Revolutionary War. Thousands of escaped slaves had gone to British-occupied New York City on the promise of freedom, and some left the city for more isolated areas to escape capture after the war. There is not any documentation of slaves, freed or runaway, nor of Hessian soldiers&#x27; marrying into the tribe.

The group rejects this name and its associated legends as pejorative. On July 30, 1880, &quot;The Bergen Democrat&quot; was the first newspaper to print the term Jackson Whites. A 1911 article noted it was used as a title of contempt. Instead, they called themselves &quot;The Mountain People&quot;.

The New Jersey historian David S. Cohen, who wrote his doctoral dissertation at Princeton about the Ramapough Mountain people, has confirmed that the old stories were legends, not history. He said the legend was untrue and was &quot;the continuing vehicle for the erroneous and derogatory stereotype of the Mountain People&quot;. He claims that some of the group&#x27;s ancestors were multiracial, free Afro-Dutch who had migrated from lower Manhattan to the frontier and become landowners in the Tappan Patent during the seventeenth century.

==History==

A number of local historians, genealogists, and archeologists have written about the Ramapough people. Accounts have changed related to research that has revealed more archeological, historical, linguistic, and other evidence, as well as because of changed social attitudes. As with other multiracial peoples seeking recognition as Native American tribes, the Ramapough Mountain Indians have encountered differences of opinion of the significance of their real ethnic ancestry in contrast to cultural and community identity and political efforts to have them recognized as a distinct culture.

The historical tribe named the Ramapo was a Munsee-speaking group of the Lenape, an Algonquian language-speaking people who occupied a large territory throughout coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic states and along the Delaware River valley. Such groups were typically named after their geographic region. Early European colonists thought they were different peoples, but all were Lenape. Ramapo villages were recorded during the late seventeenth century in western Connecticut, near present-day Bethel and Ridgefield. In 1911 an intact dugout canoe was found underwater near Bethel and identified as possibly Ramapo; it is now held at the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History at the University of Connecticut. In 1923 Foster H. Seville, an ethnologist, authenticated two dugout canoes found in Witteck Lake, near Butler, New Jersey, as of Ramapo origin and possibly 1,000 years old. They were exhibited in the American Museum of Natural History and in Hackensack, New Jersey.

During the early 1700s, the Ramapo in present-day western Connecticut had a &quot;sachem&quot; or chief named Katonah. Due to English colonists, they sold their land in the Ridgefield area, a territory estimated at , and relocated away. The Ramapo migrated west and some eventually settled in the mountains in northeastern New Jersey and southwestern New York; this part of the Appalachian Mountains was named for them by colonists as the Ramapo Mountains.

The colonial Dutch referred to the Lenape Indian peoples whom they encountered in this mid-Atlantic region, along the lower Hudson and northern New Jersey areas, as the Hackensack, Tappan, Nyack, and Minsi; these names were from the Lenape words for the bands, who took the names associated with geographic places. The archeologist Herbert C. Kraft says that some of the Ramapough lived in the mountains by the mid to late seventeenth century, and theorizes they were joined by remnants of the Esopus and possibly Wappinger bands after wars with the Dutch. The Dutch allocated land from the Tappan Patent in the Hackensack Valley; it crossed what became the border between New York and New Jersey.

Wynant Van Gelder, the first European landowner in what became Sloatsburg in Rockland County, New York, was noted as having bought land from the Ramapough in 1738. Ramapough Mountain Indians still live in the county, especially in Hillburn, New York.

When colonists entered the areas along Ramapo Creek to develop iron mines and works during the eighteenth century, they noted that Ramapough native people occupied the hills. The founder of the iron mines brought in German and English workers, some of whose descendants settled in the area.

The historian David Cohen found that early settlers in the Hackensack Valley included &quot;free black landowners in New York City and mulattoes with some Dutch ancestry who were among the first pioneers to settle in the Hackensack River Valley of New Jersey.&quot; Among these were Augustine Van Donck, who bought land in the Tappan Patent in 1687. As the border between New York and New Jersey divided the area of the patent in 1798, Cohen theorized that some of these early free people of color relocated west into the mountains. (The surname Van Dunk is common among the Ramapough, as are DeGroat, DeFreese, and Mann.) Cohen thought that, while some free blacks may have married Lenape remnant peoples in the area, the residents of the mountains developed not primarily with Indian culture but as multiracial people with European-American culture and rural traditions. The origin of these surnames could also be from earlier relations with the Colonials. During the late 19th century, such Indians were said to use the names given by the Colonials instead of their real names because of superstition.

Edward J. Lenik, a self-taught private archaeologist, disagrees with Cohen&#x27;s findings about African-European ancestry; he says, 

While the Ramapough&#x27;s origins are controversial, most historians and anthropologists agree that they (Ramapough) are the descendants from local Munsee-speaking Lenape (Delaware) Indians who fled to the mountains in the late seventeenth century to escape Dutch and English settlers. It is a well known fact that displacement of Indian tribes followed European Incursions in the region which resulted in the forced movement and resettlement of Indian peoples.
==Controversy over origins==
The multiracial ancestry of the people in the mountains was noted by their European-American neighbors. Myths, as noted in the section on their name, were derived in part from theories of origins, as well as prejudice related to unions with African descendants because slavery had developed in the colonies as a racial caste. By the mid-nineteenth century, these multi-racial people were concentrated in and near the settlements of Mahwah and Ringwood, New Jersey and Hillburn, New York. Local histories documented traditions of mixed-race descendants from intermarriages with the Lenape in the mountains.

During the twentieth century, some anthropologists classified such isolated mixed-race groups, who tended to be historically endogamous, as tri-racial isolates or simply as mixed bloods. Alanson Skinner of the American Museum of Natural History in 1915 noted the multiracial character of the people in the Ramapo Mountains. He said that Indian descendants had mixed with Africans and whites.

European Americans assumed that Indians wanted only to assimilate to the majority culture and that intermarriage meant a weakening of their cultures; in addition, attitudes associated with slavery tended to classify people of mixed-race as black rather than Indian, regardless of their cultural affiliation. Whites in the Northeast assumed that Indian cultures had largely ended after centuries of interaction with European Americans. By contrast, numerous Native American tribes had a historic tradition of absorbing other peoples by marriage or adoption; people brought up within their cultures generally identified as Native Americans of particular tribes. Thus, during the period of urbanization, high rates of immigration, and suburban development throughout the New York metropolitan area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ramapough Mountain Indians continued to live in their historic areas of settlement in the mountains and there maintained a rural culture.

Cohen noted in 1974 that, as the federal censuses of 1790-1830 were missing for this area, it prevented &quot;establishing positively the exact relationship between many of these colored families in the mountains, and the earlier colored families of the Hackensack River Valley&quot;. He noted the &quot;tradition of Indian ancestry among the Ramapo Mountain People as early as the eighteenth century.&quot; Cohen also said, &quot;Some Indian mixture is possible; however, Indian and colored interracial matings probably were not recorded in the Dutch Reformed Churches.&quot;

Before 1870, the State of New Jersey&#x27;s census had only three racial or ethnic categories for residents: White, Black (free), and Black (slave), the same categories as were used in the slave states. Census enumerators tended to use black as the category for any people of color, including Indians. New Jersey passed a gradual abolition law in 1804 to end slavery; children born to slave mothers were born free. The state retained slaves born before the law in an indentured status. By a law of 1846, it reclassified them as apprentices, &quot;apprenticed for life&quot;. The last slaves in New Jersey were not freed until 1865 and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. In 1870, New Jersey began recording Indians (Native Americans) as a separate category in its census; 16 were identified by census enumerators that year.

A less common theory of ancestry was that the Ramapough were Indian people who had been held as slaves by colonists.

With increasing interest and research in Native American history, a symposium was held during 1984 on the Lenape. James Revey (Lone Bear), then chairman of the New Jersey Indian Office, said that &quot;Mountain Indians&quot; were descendants of Lenape who had retreated into the mountains of western and northeastern New Jersey and southwestern New York during the colonial era. Other scholars, such as Herbert C. Kraft, have documented that some Munsee-speaking Lenape relocated into the Ramapo Mountains to escape colonial encroachment.

Kraft noted, as did Cohen (see below), that there was a gap in &quot;the genealogical record between about 1790-1830 that prevented his assembling with exactitude individual relationships between most of the Hackensack Valley settlers and those of the Ramapo Mountains.&quot; In his own work, Kraft has not attempted to establish genealogical links between the present-day Ramapough and colonial-era Indian tribes.

According to Catalano and Planche, consultants for the tribe for its recognition process, Cohen&#x27;s work has been criticized by the genealogists Alcon Pierce and Roger Joslyn. Catalano said that Cohen had no professional credentials in genealogy, and that the BIA found much of his genealogical work lacking.

Edward J. Lenik, an archeologist and author of a 1999 book about the Ramapo Indians, writes:

The archaeological record indicates a strong, continuous and persistent presence of Indian bands in the northern Highlands Physiographic Providence-Ramapos well into the 18th century. Other data, such as historical accounts, record the presence of Indians in the Highlands during the 19th and 20th centuries. Oral traditions, and settlement and subsistence activities are examined as well. Native American people were a significant element among the primary progenitors of the Ramapo Mountain People...
The historian Evan T. Pritchard (Mi&#x27;kmaq), wrote 

The Ramapough, or &quot;mountaineer Munsee&quot;, on the other hand, never disappeared. Their people still occupy the southwest portion of the point of Rockland County, on all sides of Ramapo Mountain. ... Whites have always tried, and continue to try to portray the Ramapough as foreigners: Dutch, blacks, Tuscarora, Gypsies, or Hessians. However, they are the only actual non-foreigners to be found still living in community in and around New York&#x27;s metropolitan region. ... The main Ramapough Lenape villages in New York were Hillburn, Johnsontown, Furmanville, Sherwoodville, Bulsontown, Willowgrove, Sandyfields, and Ladentown. Better known, however, as Native American strongholds, are the towns just south of the border, namely Stagg Hill [Mahwah] and Ringwood.
The archeologist C.A. Weslager noted that the Delaware were joined in the eighteenth century by some migrating Tuscarora families migrating from South Carolina. They never continued to Iroquois country in New York, where most of the Tuscarora settled alongside the Oneida.

==Governance==
The Ramapo Mountain Indians have had a chief and council form of government. In 1978 they organized a non-profit. That year they filed a petition with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs of intent to gain federal recognition as a tribe. They further organized into clans for self-government: the Wolf, the Turtle and the Deer, related to their three main settlements of Mahwah and Ringwood, New Jersey; and Hillburn, New York.

Chief Vincent Mann is the Turtle Clan chief. An activist and educator, he has spoken at Ramapo College and Ohio&#x27;s University of Dayton on the effects of toxic waste dumping and the Indigenous right to a healthy environment. He has specifically advocated against the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s toxic dumping on Ramapough land and waters in Ringwood, New Jersey. He created the Three Sisters Farm in Andover, New Jersey in an effort to heal through regenerative farming, cultural reclamation, and food sovereignty.

== Petition for federal recognition==
During August 1978 the tribe filed a petition of intent for federal recognition. The Ramapough Mountain Indians submitted its petition for recognition with supporting documentation in 1990.

Roger D. Joslyn, a certified genealogist and one of the consultants to the tribe in this process, has traced Ramapough members to people of the 18th century. He stated that tribal members were descended from the historical Munsee tribe.

In April 1993, Donald Trump (a casino owner) and two Bergen County United States Representatives said that &quot;the Ramapo would bring in Indian gaming associated with organized crime&quot;. U.S. Representative Marge Roukema testified to the US Senate Subcommittee on Native American Affairs on October 5, 1993 about the Ramapough Lenape Indian efforts to gain recognition. She said that, since tribal representatives had approached her during the 1980s seeking a private federal bill for recognition, their &quot;sole interest&quot; appeared to be to establish casino gambling in Bergen County. She said she feared that Indian gaming in New Jersey would bring organized crime with it. The Ramapough do not currently possess any land as a reservation that could be used for a gambling site.

The BIA gave the Tribe an opportunity to respond to its Proposed Finding of December 8, 1993, which said its documented petition did not satisfy all the regulatory criteria. It identified areas of weakness and provided extensions requested by the Tribe. Finally in December 1995, the agency issued its Final Determination, which concluded that the Ramapough Mountain Indians had failed to meet three of seven criteria for recognition; namely, that it did not provide adequate proof of descent from a historical tribe, nor of genealogical, social and political continuity since 1950. The latter two issues were of concern since 1950, when the BIA felt that the tribe had not demonstrated a distinct Indian culture different from its neighbors. They said: 
The Ramapough activists, who claimed they were opposed to gambling, appealed the BIA&#x27;s decision. In November 2001, the Ramapough presented their case to the Court of Appeals. The BIA conceded that the Ramapough are Native American: 

At oral argument before the Court of Appeals, the BIA conceded that the RMI (Ramapough Mountain Indians) are Indians, but asserted that the Tribe provided no evidence of descent from the Aboriginal Lenape Indians, who are the only tribal group ever to have occupied the region.
John &quot;Bud&quot; Shapard was the former chief of the Bureau of Research at the BIA from 1978 to 1987, when the regulations were written. Asked to review the Ramapough&#x27;s case after the BIA declined their petition, in 1999 he said, &quot;It&#x27;s pretty clear they&#x27;ve got an Indian community as strong as some that have been recognized. There&#x27;s no question about that.&quot;
Alexa Koenig and Jonathan Stein wrote an article published in 2007 in which they reviewed the process of federal and state recognition, and factors affecting both. They noted the effect of the development of Indian gambling. They wrote, 

The current political environment threatens to further slow the achievement of federal recognition, as legislators and citizens in various communities band together to oppose recognition for fear that newly recognized tribes will establish a casino in their community. This opposition is sometimes financed by competing Indian casinos, adding additional money and political muscle to an already uphill fight. Unfortunately, this is unfairly hindering recognition opportunities for longstanding tribes and standing in the way of such tribes acquiring much needed non-casino related benefits, such as federal grants and governmental immunities.
They noted that many states had initiated their own processes of recognition of tribes and are building new relationships with the peoples. The Ramapough Lenape Indians had been recognized by New Jersey but not by New York, which as a policy matter does not separately recognize tribes.

==Recent events==

In 1995, New Jersey established a Commission on American Indian Affairs (then termed the Commission on Native American Affairs) with two seats each for the recognized tribes of the Ramapough Mountain Indians, the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape, and the Powhatan Renape (the latter two groups are located in southern New Jersey.) In addition, two seats were reserved for Inter-Tribal Members, persons who belonged to other tribes but lived in New Jersey. The Commission has been placed in the Department of State.

During the spring of 2006, Emil Mann, a Ramapough Lenape man, was killed by gunshots from a New Jersey State Parks Police ranger in a confrontation with people on all-terrain vehicles in Ringwood State Park. His family filed a civil suit against the state. Governor Jon Corzine&#x27;s staff met with the Ramapough Lenape and other Native Americans in the state to identify problem areas and improve relations. The state investigated the shooting, and a grand jury indicted one of the rangers.

During August 2006, Governor Corzine formed the New Jersey Committee on Native American Community Affairs to investigate issues of civil rights, education, employment, fair housing, environmental protection, health care, infrastructure and equal opportunity confronting members of New Jersey&#x27;s three indigenous Native American tribes and other New Jersey residents of Native American descent. The Committee&#x27;s report was delivered on December 17, 2007 and cited &quot;lingering discrimination, ignorance of state history and culture, and cynicism in the treatment of Indian people&quot;.

State and federal officials have worked with the tribes on other issues related to their people. For instance, in preparation for the 2010 census, state and federal officials consulted with the recognized tribes on means to get accurate counts of their people. The Census Bureau has created local partnerships. It recognizes State Designated Tribal Statistical Areas, which are established by state consultation with local tribes to identify significant areas of American Indian populations outside reservations (these had not been examined during the twentieth century). In New Jersey, these are identified as Passaic and Bergen counties for the Ramapough Mountain Tribe, and Cumberland County for the Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape. The Rankokus Indian Reservation no longer qualifies, as the state has taken back much of the land it had earlier leased to the Powhatan Renape.

==Tribal enrollment==
The tribe has required members to be descended directly from an identified Ramapough parent listed in tribal records. People must provide certified birth certificates and documentation of at least three generations to a listed Ramapough ancestor.

==Environmental concerns==

The tribe has experienced environmental controversies in relation to corporate efforts on or near their land.

===Ford Motor Company paint contamination controversy===

Members of the community have participated with litigation (&quot;Mann v. Ford&quot;) against the Ford Motor Company regarding poisoning from a former toxic waste landfill. Portions of this site were used during the 1970s as sites for affordable housing where many Ramapough people lived.

During the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Ringwood Mines landfill site as a Superfund site for cleanup. Ford had operated an automobile assembly plant in Mahwah and its contractors dumped industrial paints and other hazardous wastes in a landfill owned by the company in an area where many Ramapough Mountain Indians live. The EPA identified further remediation three more times as additional sludge sites were found. Following further investigation, The EPA returned the community to the Superfund list, the only site to be so treated.

During late winter 2006, some 600 Ramapough Lenape Indians, led by Turtle Clan chief Wayne Mann and with the aid of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., filed a mass tort suit (&quot;Mann v. Ford&quot;) against the &quot;Ford Motor Company and its contractors, as well as the borough of Ringwood, for the dumping of toxic waste.&quot; They were represented by Vicki Gilliam of The Cochran Group. The suit was filed about the time of publication of &quot;Toxic Legacy&quot;, a five-part investigative series by &quot;The Record&quot;, which had found lead and antimony levels in excess of 100 times the safety limit near some Ramapough residences.

The paint sludge has been linked to contamination of food and water sources with lead and benzene. The contamination has been linked to nosebleeds, leukemia, and other ailments among the community.

The HBO documentary &quot;Mann v. Ford&quot; (2011) examines the lawsuit.

The EPA has directed the removal of an additional 47,000 tons of sludge and soil up to 2011, with cleanup continuing.

===The Pilgrim Pipeline and Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp===

As of 2017, the tribe is fighting against the Pilgrim Pipeline. Pilgrim Pipelines Holdings, LLC plans to run a duel pipeline through the tribe&#x27;s land which would carry refined products like gasoline, diesel, kerosene, aviation fuel and home heating oil north and Bakken formation crude oil south between Albany, New York and the Bayway Refinery on the Chemical Coast in Linden, New Jersey.

The line would also pass through the Ramapo Mountains and Ramapo Pass. In solidarity with Standing Rock, tribal members founded the Split Rock Sweetwater protest encampment in Mahwah, New Jersey in 2016 near the New York border to protest the Pilgrim Pipeline.

==Representation in art, entertainment, and media==

===Movies===
*&quot;Mann v. Ford&quot; (2011) is a documentary about the lawsuit filed by the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation against Ford. It is regularly shown on HBO. Directed by Maro Chermayeff and Mica Fink, it features Paul Mann of the Ramapough and Vicki Gilliam of The Cochran Firm, which represented the tribe. It portrays the five years of the Ramapough pursuing the suit and how they reached settlement with the company.
*&quot;American Native&quot; (2013) is a documentary that details the Ramapough Lenape Nation&#x27;s efforts to gain federal recognition as a Native American nation and the difficulties it has encountered due to loss of lands and records and alleged racism.
*The movie &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; (2013) is a fictional drama dealing partly with communities living in the Ramapough Mountains, featuring Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson and Willem Dafoe. Tribal leaders and town officials from Mahwah urged a boycott of the movie due to negative depictions of the Ramapough Lenape Nation, which Dwaine Perry termed a hate crime. Relativity Media responded that the movie &quot;is not based on any one person or group&quot; and is &quot;entirely fictional&quot;. Nine members of the group, eight of whom have the surname DeGroat, which is given to the movie&#x27;s antagonist, filed suit against the makers and other involved parties. They claimed that &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; portrays a gang of criminals living in the Ramapo Mountains who are &quot;lawless, drug-addicted, impoverished and violent&quot;. On May 16, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge William Walls, in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed the lawsuit, saying that the movie did not refer directly to any of the plaintiffs.
*&quot;The Way of the Ramapough&quot; (2022), a 30-minute documentary by Elliott Ruga, produced by the New Jersey Highlands Coalition, based on an interview with Turtle Clan Chief Vincent Mann, who discusses tribal history from the era of first contact through contemporary times and the effects of colonialism, including the dispossession of Native lands and the resulting diaspora, massacres, rejection of native identity, the attempt at federal recognition and the continuing federal and state failures to address the toxic contamination by the Ford Motor Company that continues to poison the Turtle Clan&#x27;s community in Ringwood, NJ. Despite these and other challenges Chief Mann is optimistic that the Clan will be relocated, the Tribe will receive federal recognition and the Ramapough people will find a vital role in a society confronted with a drastically changing climate.

<text>The Irvine Company LLC is an American private company focused on real estate development. It is headquartered in Newport Beach, California, with a large portion of its operations centered in and around Irvine, California, a planned city of more than 300,000 people mainly designed by the Irvine Company. The company was founded by the Irvine family and is currently wholly owned by Donald Bren.

Since the company is private, its financials are not released to the public. However, Bren is the wealthiest real estate developer in the United States with a net worth of $15.3 billion as of April 2021.

==History==
The Irvine Company traces its history to a ranch founded by James Irvine I, Benjamin and Thomas Flint, and Llewellyn Bixby in 1864 by combining three adjoining Mexican land grants. A drought in 1864 killed the livestock of Jose Antonio Sepulveda, forcing him to sell his coastal Rancho San Joaquin to Irvine and his partners. In 1866 they purchased Rancho Lomas de Santiago from William Wolfskill; largely unfarmable due to its steep, hilly terrain, it had been used mainly as a sheep ranch. In 1868 Flint, Bixby and Irvine were among the claimants of a title lawsuit that divided Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana.

Unlike other early Newport Beach landowners, Irvine and his partners had no interest in subdividing and selling, intent, instead, upon identifying the most lucrative agricultural uses for their enormous . The Irish-born Irvine met Collis Huntington, soon to become one of the Central Pacific Railroad (CPR) magnates, on a trip across the Atlantic. Rather than cementing a friendship, a disagreement that lasted throughout their lives resulted. When Huntington&#x27;s Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) needed Irvine&#x27;s land for its route between Orange County and San Diego, Irvine refused. When SP crews began laying tracks on Irvine land without permission, ranch hands with shotguns confronted the crews. Eventually, Irvine gave the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway permission to build on his ranch. 
When Irvine died in 1886, trustees, left in control of the ranch until his son James II (b.1867) turned 25, tried to sell it at auction. When this auction was declared illegal, James II took over the reins of the ranch and accelerated efforts to increase its agricultural production. In 1894, he incorporated the land holdings as the Irvine Company. Between the late 1800s to the 1970s, the Irvine Company continued to also run cattle operations on the property, with &quot;Bommer Canyon Cattle Camp&quot; serving as its center. They also ran sheep. James Irvine remarked in 1867 that he and his men &quot;rode about [the Irvine Ranch] a good deal, sometimes coming home in the evening after a thirty- or forty-mile ride pretty thoroughly tired out, but we had to do it in order to see much of the ranch and the flock.&quot; At the time, his Irvine Company had been purchasing further adjoining parcels of land, &quot;[so] there [was] considerable riding to be done, if one [was] to see much of [the ranch].&quot; After James Irvine&#x27;s death, majority control of the company passed to the James Irvine Foundation.

In 1953, the National Scout Jamboree was held on Irvine Ranch land in the area of what is now Fashion Island Shopping Center. Jamboree Road, running from Newport Beach to Orange, was built to allow people to travel to the jamboree from nearby train stations. In 1961, the Irvine Company sold 990 acres to the University of California system for $1.00 to develop a new campus, which became the University of California, Irvine. The school was named in honor of the Irvine family, not the city of Irvine, which did not yet exist. Three years later, the company sold, at a discounted price, an additional 510 acres to the university. During the early 1960s, the university and company, together with architect William Pereira, designed the Irvine Ranch Master Plan for developing the surrounding area. The city of Irvine, officially incorporated in 1971, grew around the campus.

By the late 1970s, the Irvine Company had ceased its cattle business. The foundation needed to sell the company after the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1969. In 1977, a group led by A. Alfred Taubman and including real estate developer Donald Bren bought the company from the Irvine Foundation. The Bommer Canyon area was sold to the City of Irvine between 1981 and 1982, purchased with grants obtained from the 1974 California Bond Act. By 1983, Bren was the majority owner of the Irvine Company. By 1996, he had purchased all outstanding shares and was sole owner.

==Operations==

The Irvine Company develops suburban master-planned communities throughout central and southern Orange County, California and residential buildings in Santa Monica, Silicon Valley, and San Diego County. The company also owns and manages office buildings in Milpitas, San Jose, Sunnyvale, downtown San Diego, Mission Valley, San Diego, La Jolla Village/University City, Sorrento Mesa, Del Mar Heights, Newport Center, UCI locations, West Los Angeles, Pasadena, Chicago, and New York City.

The Irvine Ranch remains the core holding of The Irvine Company. It encompasses almost one fifth of Orange County, from the Pacific Ocean and Newport Harbor, Laguna Beach, and Santa Ana Canyon, to the boundary of the Cleveland National Forest. Of the total ranch area, is retained for development whilst the remainder - principally rugged canyons, wetlands, and water districts - are maintained as wilderness and recreational preserves collectively known as the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks.

In August 2014, the Irvine Company announced plans to donate and preserve 2,500 additional acres of land previously approved for housing.

In part because of its land preservation grants, in 2018 Irvine Company was named Business Philanthropist of the Year by the Greater Irvine Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber also cited gifts of more than $220 million to city schools and universities.

A partial list of cities within the boundaries of the Irvine Ranch includes:
*Irvine
*Laguna Beach
*Anaheim (Anaheim Hills)
*Tustin (Tustin Ranch)
*Orange
*Newport Beach

The Irvine Company owns several large retail centers, including The Market Place and Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, and Fashion Island in Newport Beach, which is surrounded by the Newport Center commercial area. The Irvine Company also holds several office properties, particularly in Irvine and Newport Center, the 20th Century Studios Plaza in Century City, Los Angeles, the MetLife Building in New York City, and nearly 550 total properties throughout Coastal California.

Among the company properties are apartment units in Santa Clara and San Jose, including ~800 in Santa Clara Square and ~800 and Monticello in Santa Clara; and ~500 in RiverView, 2,188 in North Park, and ~500 in Crescent Village in San Jose.

The company laid off 1,700 staff in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which mostly affected three hotels and resorts.

Irvine Company purchased Symphony Towers in San Diego for $134 million in 2003. They sold the 34-story office tower to Taiwanese company Formosa, Ltd. for $45.7 million, 70% less, in September 2024.

<doc id="275671" wikidata="Q1987731" url="?curid=275671" title="List of electronic music genres">
<text>This is a list of electronic music genres, consisting of genres of electronic music, primarily created with electronic musical instruments or electronic music technology. A distinction has been made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. Genre, however, is not always dependent on instrumentation.

In its early development, electronic music was associated almost exclusively with Western art music, but from the late 1960s, the availability of affordable music technology—particularly of synthesizers—meant that music produced using electronic means became increasingly common in the popular domains of rock and pop music and classical music, resulting in major electronically based subgenres. After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio, the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler. As a result, synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s. In the late 1980s, electronic dance music (EDM) records made using only electronic instruments became increasingly popular, resulting in a proliferation of electronic genres, subgenres, and scenes. In the new millennium, as computer technology became even more accessible and music software advanced, interacting with music production technology made it possible to create music that has some similarities and some differences to traditional musical performance practices, leading to further developments and rapidly evolving subgenres.

<doc id="275673" wikidata="Q17145784" url="?curid=275673" title="Non-commercial educational station">
<text>A non-commercial educational station (NCE station) is a radio station or television station that does not accept on-air advertisements (TV ads or radio ads), as defined in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and was originally intended to offer educational programming as part, or whole, of its programming. NCE stations do not pay broadcast license fees for their non-profit uses of the radio spectrum. Stations which are almost always operated as NCE include public broadcasting, community radio, and college radio, as well as many religious broadcasting stations.
Nearly all non-commercial radio stations derive their support from listener support, grants and endowments, such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) that distributes supporting funds provided by Congress to support public radio.

==Reserved channels==
On the FM broadcast band, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has reserved the lowest 20 channels, 201~220 (88.1~91.9 MHz) for NCE stations only. This is known as the reserved band, sometimes known by the term &quot;left of the dial&quot; (taken from the Replacements&#x27; song of the same name), which refers to the college and other non-commercial stations that broadcast from those frequencies. It also includes channel 200 (87.9 MHz), but only for class D NCE stations unable to find another frequency; the frequency has been unused for its intended purpose in the United States since KSFH shut down in 2021.

Many of the reserved-band channels are used by stations bordering the United States, such as with broadcasting in the San Diego/Tijuana metropolitan area. Additionally, neither the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission nor Mexico&#x27;s Federal Telecommunications Institute have such a reserved band. (In Mexico, individual stations belonging to state and federal governments, educational institutions, and non-profit groups are licensed under permits or &quot;permisos&quot;, which are non-commercial, non-profit licenses that do not permit advertising. Canada, in practice, generally keeps most of the U.S. NCE band as noncommercial or with limited advertising based on each individual licence, but there are exceptions, such as CIXL, a fully commercial station that operates on 91.7.)

NCE stations may also operate on a non-reserved channel. However this was rare in the United States due to the high cost of buying a commercial broadcasting station, and because for years the FCC failed to maintain a process that would ensure that non-commercial applicants would have a chance against those who could afford to bid at spectrum auctions. Two such stations are WGPB FM in Rome, Georgia and WNGH-FM in Chatsworth, Georgia, former commercial stations purchased in 2007 and 2008 and operated by Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB), serving the mountains northwest of Atlanta which previously had no GPB radio service. In addition, there were at least four stations with commercial licenses that formerly operated as PBS member stations (WNYC-TV in New York City, WMHX in Albany, New York, KAUT-TV in Oklahoma City, and KCPQ-TV in Seattle are a few examples of this); most of those stations now broadcast as affiliates of commercially owned networks. This is also rare in Mexico, though XEIMT-TV, a cultural channel in Mexico City, and XEWH-TV, the main station of the state network of Sonora, operate under commercial concessions and not permits. A number of new low power FM (LPFM) NCE stations operating in the non-reserved part of the spectrum have been licensed by the FCC since the Local Community Radio Act was enacted in 2010.

==Definition of &quot;commercial&quot;==
The FCC defines several different activities as being commercial in nature. Sponsorship of NCE stations is called underwriting, and stations may make announcements of these grants on-air. However, they may not accept money for such mentions, only goods and services, unless the sponsor itself is a non-profit, such as a charitable organization or public college. Money can be accepted if there is no on-air mention of the sponsor. NCE stations may also not mention prices or qualities of commercial products or services in any situation which would be construed as promoting or endorsing any company, regardless of whether it sponsors the station.

Underwriting spots are brief and to-the-point, as they must not be disruptive to programming. Additionally, underwriting spots on public TV are at the beginning or end of the TV show rather than in the middle, as they have increasingly become on commercial stations.

Retransmission consent has often been chosen over must-carry by the major commercial television networks. Under the present rules, a new agreement is negotiated every three years, and stations must choose must-carry or retransmission consent for each cable system they wish their signal to be carried on. Non-commercial stations (such as local PBS stations) may not seek retransmission consent and may only invoke must-carry status.

==Multichannel obligations==
Like commercial stations, NCE stations are allowed to lease subcarriers in exchange for money, essentially making the station a common carrier. This may be for a commercial audio, video, or data service, or a non-commercial one like a radio reading service for the blind.

NCE stations broadcasting in digital TV or HD Radio may lease part of their bandwidth (actually bitrate) in a similar manner, however, the commercial use is limited. The main program must always be non-commercial, and must not have its quality diminished excessively by increased lossy compression done in order to fit the auxiliary service within the allowable bit rate. NCE digital television (DTV) stations do not pay the FCC a percentage of their revenue from these leases as commercial DTV stations do. No such datacasting fee is levied on any analog or FM/AM station, whether commercial or NCE.

<doc id="275675" wikidata="Q61489" url="?curid=275675" title="Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf">
<text>Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf (; 19 January 1757 – 16 November 1831), was by marriage the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She was the grandmother and godmother of both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband and cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

==Family==

Augusta was born on 19 January 1757, the second child of Heinrich XXIV, Count Reuss of Ebersdorf and Countess Karoline Ernestine of Erbach-Schönberg. Her birthplace, Ebersdorf, was a center of Pietism in Thuringia and Augusta&#x27;s grandparents were ardent admirers of this religious movement.

Augusta&#x27;s grandaunt, Countess Erdmuthe Dorothea of Reuss-Ebersdorf, was married to Count Nicholas Louis von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf, leader of the revivalist Moravian Church. This background explains the deep religious feelings of Duchess Augusta in later years.

==Marriage==

Her father commissioned a portrait of Augusta as &quot;Artemisia&quot; by the painter Johann Heinrich Tischbein. Count Heinrich XXIV showed this painting during the Perpetual Diet so potential marriage candidates were aware of his beautiful daughter.

In Ebersdorf on 13 June 1777, Augusta married Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who previously acquired the &quot;Artemisia&quot; painting for four times the original price because he was deeply in love with Augusta, but he was already obliged to marry his relative Princess Sophie of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Princess Sophie died 7 months after the wedding, so the young Duke was free to wed again.

During her marriage, Augusta bore her husband 10 children, though only seven of them survived to adulthood; some of their children played important roles in European history: Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold I of Belgium.

== Issue ==
== Notable descendants ==
Countess Augusta was the grandmother of many notable monarchs of Europe, including both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (through her mother Victoria) and her husband, Prince Albert (through his father Ernst), King Consort of Portugal Ferdinand II (through his father Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), and also Empress Carlota of Mexico and her brother Leopold II of Belgium (through their father Leopold I who was elected King of the Belgians on 26 June 1831).

<text>Fever Pitch: A Fan&#x27;s Life is a 1992 autobiographical essay by British author Nick Hornby. The book is the basis for two films: &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1997, UK) and &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (2005, US). The first edition was subtitled &quot;A Fan&#x27;s Life&quot;, but later paperback editions were not.

== Book ==
&quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, first published in 1992, is a memoir and Hornby&#x27;s second book. It tells the story of the author&#x27;s relationship with football, and with Arsenal Football Club in particular. It consists of several chapters in chronological order, from the time the author first became a football fan as a child until his early thirties. Each chapter is about a football match that he remembers watching, most but not all at Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, and how it related to the events that were going on with his life. As well as recounting Arsenal&#x27;s highs and lows, Hornby talks about other football clubs that play in London, and his interest in the contrasting surroundings of Cambridge United and Cambridge City, whose matches he attends while at university.

&quot;Fever Pitch&quot; sold over a million copies in the United Kingdom. It won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year in 1992 and was reprinted with a new cover and made available as part of the 2005–06 Arsenal F.C. membership pack as part of the &quot;Final Salute&quot; to Highbury Stadium. The book was made a Penguin Modern Classic in August 2012.

==Adaptations==
=== 1997 film ===

A 1997 film version of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, with a screenplay adapted by Hornby, fictionalised the story, concentrating on Arsenal&#x27;s First Division championship-winning season in 1988–89 and its effect on the protagonist&#x27;s romantic relationship. Paul Ashworth, played by Colin Firth, the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in North London and his burgeoning romance with Sarah Hughes (Ruth Gemmell), a new teacher who joins Ashworth&#x27;s school. The film culminates with Arsenal playing title rivals Liverpool in the final game of the season on 26 May 1989, in which a last minute Michael Thomas goal gives Arsenal the 2–0 win they need to win the title. &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; compares Hornby&#x27;s life at Arsenal and other football clubs.

=== 2005 film ===
A 2005 film remake of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;, directed by the Farrelly Brothers with Hornby as an executive producer, starred Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore. In this adaptation (based on the 1997 film, not the 1992 book), the action is moved from London to Boston, the focus of the protagonist&#x27;s obsession is shifted from football to baseball and the story is based on the 2004 Boston Red Sox season, which culminated with the team&#x27;s first Major League Baseball World Series victory in 86 years. This championship was entirely coincidental; the 2005 version was being filmed during the 2004 regular season, including scenes filmed at Fenway Park during actual games. As the Red Sox continued to progress through the playoffs, the Farrellys rewrote the script to include the historic moment. The movie was renamed &quot;The Perfect Catch&quot; outside North America to avoid confusion with the 1997 film.

<text>Ansett Australia, originally Ansett Airways, was a major Australian airline group based in Melbourne, Victoria. The company operated domestically within Australia, and from the 1990s, to destinations in Asia. Following 65 years of operation, the airline went into administration in 2001 following a financial collapse and subsequent liquidation in 2002, subject to a deed of company arrangement. Ansett’s last flight touched down on 5 March 2002.

==History==
===Beginning===
The company was founded by Reginald &quot;Reg&quot; Ansett in 1935 as Ansett Airways Pty Ltd. This was an offshoot of his road transport business, which had become so successful it was threatening the freight and passenger revenue of Victorian Railways. This led the state government to legislate to put private road transport operators out of business. Reg Ansett countered by establishing an airline, as aviation was under control of the federal government and beyond the reach of the state government.

Ansett&#x27;s first route between Hamilton and Melbourne operated by a Fokker Universal monoplane commenced on 17 February 1936. The rapid success of the airline led Ansett to float the business in 1937. As the route network expanded, Ansett Airways imported Lockheed Electra aircraft. During World War II, Ansett opted to suspend all scheduled services, except the Hamilton service, in favour of more lucrative work for the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, Ansett battled to re-establish his domestic routes using war-surplus Douglas DC-3s, converted from C-47s and the remaining Lockheed Electras.

At this time, the Australian domestic airline travel sector was dominated by Australian National Airways (ANA), established in 1936 by a consortium of British-financed Australian shipowners. The Chifley federal government was determined to establish a state-owned airline to operate all domestic and international services. It was eventually thwarted in this aim by the High Court of Australia, so it established Trans-Australia Airlines (TAA) to operate in competition with ANA.

===Towards a duopoly===
 



Ansett Airways remained a big player as ANA and TAA battled for supremacy in the 1940s and 1950s. Ansett operated around the big two, maintaining budget-fare interstate operations with DC-3s and later Convair CV-340s previously operated by Braniff International Airways in the United States. The airline was backed up by extensive road transport operations, including Ansett Freight Express and Ansett Pioneer Coaches, as well as the Ansair coach-building operation.

The Menzies government, while supporting TAA, because of the excellent dividends it paid to the government, wanted to avoid TAA having a monopoly on domestic services if ANA collapsed, as seemed likely. The only alternative, as it transpired, was for Ansett to buy the ANA operation. Ansett&#x27;s bid had a number of financial supporters, most prominent of these being the Shell Oil Company. Douglas Aircraft Company was also concerned about ANA&#x27;s demise, as TAA had ceased to be a customer for their aircraft. The ANA directors fiercely resisted this initially, but in October 1957, succumbed to Ansett&#x27;s offer of £3.3 million for their airline. The new entity was called Ansett-ANA, the name it retained until 1 November 1968, when it became Ansett Airlines of Australia.
Ansett-ANA&#x27;s excellent profit record was, at least in part, courtesy of the Menzies government&#x27;s Two Airlines Policy. The policy effectively blocked any other domestic interstate operators by way of a ban on importation of aircraft without a government licence. From 1957 until the 1980s, under the strict rules set down by the Two Airlines Policy, Ansett and TAA operated as virtual carbon copies of each other, operating the same aircraft at the same times, to the same destinations, at fares, which were identical (under strict federal government policy). If either airline wished to change its fares, they had to obtain federal government approval.

Reg Ansett then set out to ensure no other competitors could rise up to challenge his airline. He took control of Adelaide-based Guinea Airways (renamed Airlines of South Australia) and Sydney-based Butler Air Transport (renamed Airlines of New South Wales). The takeover of Butler was achieved with covert support from the Menzies government and by Ansett engineering his employees&#x27; purchases of Butler shares (in a similar way as had just been attempted by Butler). He then flew the employees to a general meeting in Sydney and forced a vote in favour of selling out to Ansett. Ansett later purchased Perth-based MacRobertson Miller Airlines, buying 70% of the shares in 1963 and completing the takeover in November 1968. Unlike Ansett&#x27;s other regional acquisitions MMA retained its own identity (aircraft flew in Ansett livery but with MMA logotypes) for many years, finally becoming Airlines of Western Australia in 1981.

Following the takeover of ANA, Reg Ansett lobbied the government to block TAA&#x27;s purchase of Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft. He was concerned about his airline&#x27;s ability to finance equivalent jet aircraft, and the major engineering leap required to go from an all-piston fleet direct to pure jet aircraft, TAA had been operating prop-jet Vickers Viscounts since 1954, so had expertise in jet technology. Ansett was successful in convincing the government to authorise the importation of more Viscounts and the new Lockheed L-188 Electra, marketed as the &quot;Golden Jet&quot; as with other turboprop airliners of the day. This action delayed the introduction of pure jet aircraft to Australian domestic airlines until 1964, when the Boeing 727–100 &quot;Fan Jet&quot; began flying. In keeping with the Two Airlines Policy, both TAA and Ansett started domestic jet services with the 727 on the same date (October 16), at the same time, on the same route (Sydney to Melbourne). However Ansett won a draw to be the first to land, thus becoming the airline to officially inaugurate jet operations to Australian domestic aviation, seven years after Reg Ansett had moved to block TAA&#x27;s attempt to first purchase jet airliners.

An unusual feature of Ansett&#x27;s operations was the flying-boat service from Rose Bay in Sydney to Lord Howe Island. This was operated by Ansett Flying Boat Services using Short Sandringham four-engined aircraft. The service ceased in 1974 when the Lord Howe Island Airport was completed.

===Unification, deregulation and expansion===
Ansett lost control of the company to Peter Abeles&#x27; TNT and Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation in 1979, with Abeles taking operational control of the airline. The airline prospered in the 1980s, and its various operating divisions were progressively unified both operationally and in terms of corporate identity. Following the change of ownership, Ansett introduced a new livery designed by Landor Associates, featuring plain white fuselages, simple Ansett logotypes in a serif typeface and a blue tailfin with a stylised Southern Cross logo. Through the mid-1980s, this livery was rolled out to the regional parts of the Ansett system which were also rebranded as the new colours were rolled out, becoming Ansett NSW, Ansett NT, Ansett WA etc..

The Southern Cross livery first appeared on newly purchased long-range versions of the Boeing 727–200, capable of direct flights between Sydney and Perth. Ansett&#x27;s new owners placed multiple orders for new aircraft in the 1980s, buoyed up by strong business year-on-year and the passing of the Airlines Agreement Act of 1981 which maintained the closely regulated domestic airline system in Australia until at least the end of the decade, thus ensuring Ansett Transport Industries&#x27; profits for the foreseeable future. New Boeing 737s and five of the newly introduced Boeing 767 were purchased – the latter to a unique specification retaining a flight engineer in the cockpit by agreement with Ansett&#x27;s crew unions. Despite being an existing operator of the Boeing 737 (and long-standing Boeing customer in general), Ansett placed an order worth over $1 billion in 1985 for the Airbus A320, which gradually replaced the 727s in the late 1980s/early 1990s and were branded by the airline as the &#x27;Skystar&#x27;. Two years later Ansett ordered 21 new Boeing 737s (in -300 and −500 form) to phase out the older 737 models.

This diverse fleet of similar aircraft from different manufacturers was unusual in the airline industry. The new Boeing 767s were also beset by mechanical and maintenance issues, leading them to be out of service during several key periods of heavy traffic and operating for the airline at a loss. These issues were further reflected in Ansett&#x27;s regional operations which had a wide range of regional airliners of piston-, turboprop and jet-power types. Many of these were only operated in small numbers, adding to crew, training and maintenance costs and several key types were approaching 15 or 20 years old. This incurred increased costs to Ansett. In 1985, the same year the Airbus order was placed, Ansett became a launch customer for the Fokker 50 turboprop, ordering ten aircraft with a view to replacing its successful but ageing fleet of Fokker F27s. Ansett also ordered a total of 11 British Aerospace 146s, which gradually replaced Fokker F28 Fellowship jets from 1990.

In addition to these heavy spending costs on fleet renewal, a number of substantial investments performed badly, including a share in the US America West Airlines (which filed for bankruptcy and survived) and its Hamilton Island resort (which went into receivership). In 1984, Ansett was embroiled in controversy after it banned HIV-positive individuals from travelling on their planes to protect their staff. The Australian Flight Attendants Association ultimately rejected the bans.

In October 1987, the Australian parliament voted to repeal the Airlines Agreement Act with effect from October 31, 1990. This deregulated the airline industry in Australia and exposed Ansett to direct competition for the first time. Ansett had anticipated this change and in July of that year had acquired East-West Airlines, a regional airline that had gradually expanded from its origins in New South Wales to become an inter-state operator. East-West had circumvented the regulations of the Two Airlines Policy by flying between the regulated state capitals via smaller intermediate airports, allowing it both offer a denser and more accessible service pattern and much lower fares than the ones set by regulation charged by Ansett and TAA. East-West had become Ansett&#x27;s main competitor in many of its regional services and the airline&#x27;s growth played a large part in the successful campaign to overturn the Two Airlines Policy. In preparation for deregulation East-West&#x27;s owners sold the company but within weeks the new owner, Stan Perron, sold the airline to Ansett. At this stage the East-West brand was retained, but with an updated livery. 

Similar deregulation of the airline industry had been introduced in New Zealand in the late 1980s, and Ansett pursued this opportunity to expand its operations internationally. In 1987 Ansett entered into an agreement with the owners of the struggling New Zealand domestic airline Newmans Air which saw Ansett Transport Industries take on a 50 per cent stake in a recapitalised and expanded company renamed Ansett New Zealand. Ansett NZ adopted the same white Landor livery as its parent company, but with the four red stars of the New Zealand flag on the tail in place of the six white ones (as per the flag of Australia) on the Ansett livery, and therefore also lacking the green and orange &#x27;speed stripes&#x27; on the tail.

In its own preparation for the new deregulated industry, Ansett rebranded itself in mid-1990, taking on the name Ansett Australia and adopting a new livery with the Australian flag on the tail. This change also saw the end of the East-West name, being replaced by &#x27;Ansett Express&#x27;, which was adopted for the short-haul and commuter services in New South Wales formerly operated by Ansett NSW and East-West. This rebranding also followed a period of debt restructuring and by the start of 1994 the company was reported to be back to making an operating profit. By this point all the regional branding had been dropped, with all aircraft carrying the same Ansett scheme, and a new tail logo called the &#x27;Starmark&#x27; (combining the Southern Cross of the previous livery, the blue of the flag livery and a stylised &#x27;A&#x27; as a nod to Ansett&#x27;s 1960s scheme) had been introduced. This final change also saw the withdrawal of the Ansett Express branding, with these services now being flown under the corporate Ansett Australia title.

The deregulation of the industry also opened up possibilities for Ansett to move into international flights for the first time. On September 11, 1993, the first international Ansett flight was made to Bali using a Boeing 767. To further expand its international operations, Ansett Australia leased a pair of Boeing 747-300s from Singapore Airlines in August 1994 to inaugurate services to Osaka and Hong Kong. Two more B747s were leased from Singapore Airlines the next year to enable services to Jakarta in January 1996 and to Shanghai in the summer of 1997. Ansett branded its B747s as &#x27;Spaceships&#x27;.
In the late 1990s, Ansett paid millions of dollars for the right to be official airline of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, an investment generally regarded as unwise. Ansett saw this tie-in as a key marketing opportunity to expand its presence in southern and eastern Asia. Five Boeing 747-400s were leased (four dry leased from Singapore Airlines and one wet leased from Qantas) to add further services and new routes to Seoul, Taipei, and Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft were branded with &#x27;Sydney 2000&#x27; livery. Neither the Olympic Games nor the new routes generated the expected traffic, and several of these new routes were withdrawn shortly after the Games concluded. This destabilised the finances of the company considerably, in tandem with other industrial and internal factors (see below) right before the September 11 attacks affected the global airline industry and economy.

===Air New Zealand merger and collapse===


Ansett had expanded into New Zealand in 1987 through its subsidiary Ansett New Zealand after the government of New Zealand opened its skies to the airline. After the government of Australia reneged on an agreement to reciprocate, Air New Zealand tried to acquire a share of Qantas when it was floated in 1995, but was not allowed. Instead, it bought TNT&#x27;s 50% stake in Ansett Australia for A$475 million in 1996, though managerial control remained in the hands of News Corporation. Ansett Australia then had to divest itself of Ansett New Zealand to avoid creating a monopoly.
In February 2000, Air New Zealand acquired full ownership of Ansett, buying out News Corporation&#x27;s stake for A$680 million, surpassing Singapore Airlines&#x27;s A$500 million bid.

Competition from Qantas and a succession of low-cost airlines (Impulse Airlines and Virgin Blue), top-heavy and substantially overpaid staff, an ageing fleet, and grounding of the Boeing 767 fleet due to maintenance irregularities left Ansett seriously short of cash, losing $1.3 million a day.

Air New Zealand attempted to cut Ansett&#x27;s costs while expecting to maintain the same level of revenue. This did not work, as the cost cutting hurt Ansett. Additionally, Ansett&#x27;s fleet had been allowed to deteriorate, a situation that came to a head with a partial grounding of its Boeing 767 fleet during the Christmas 2000 season and a full grounding in Easter 2001. Ansett was thus unable to compete with the low-cost carriers and Qantas, which were able to run at a loss on some routes, as they could not maintain revenue while cutting their costs, which included laying off staff.

A deal made in April 2001 for Ansett to purchase Virgin Blue was repudiated by Virgin chief Richard Branson in August, and Singapore Airlines, which was initially blocked from buying Ansett, was also prevented from investing further in Air New Zealand/Ansett by the New Zealand government. It then declined to take up an earlier proposed deal to inject over $500 million into Air New Zealand and Ansett after talks collapsed.

In early September 2001, as the trouble worsened, the New Zealand government prepared to rescue Air New Zealand (eventually buying 83% of the company for NZ$885 million), but cut Ansett adrift. Despite public pleas, the Australian government refused to bail out Ansett.

Quickly running out of both lines of credit and options, Air New Zealand on 12 September 2001 placed the Ansett group of companies into voluntary administration with PriceWaterhouseCoopers. On 14 September, the administrator determined that Ansett was not viable to continue operations (primarily due to the apparent lack of any funds to cover fuel, catering, or employee wages) and grounded the fleets of Ansett and its subsidiaries Hazelton Airlines, Kendell, Skywest, and Aeropelican. Flights already in the air at the time the decision was made continued on to their destinations. Customers and almost all employees had no warning of the stoppage in operations. An Ansett Boeing 767–200 operating on behalf of Ansett Airfreight due to depart Melbourne for Launceston, Tasmania, was the first aircraft to be stopped from flying. It was unable to be unloaded until midday the next day, as no paid staff were on duty. Everyone had been told in the days leading up to 14 September that flights would continue on schedule, and most Ansett employees did not find out until they showed up for work at dawn that day. Thousands of passengers were left stranded and more than 16,000 people found themselves out of a job, making this the largest mass job-loss event in Australian history. Widespread protests were held by workers, including the blockade of an Air New Zealand plane about to carry then New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark home from Melbourne.

The then Ansett administrators alleged that Air New Zealand had engaged in asset stripping of Ansett, and had sustained excessive fuel costs for Ansett due to Air New Zealand&#x27;s failure to hedge them, leaving Ansett susceptible to major fluctuations in fuel charges during 2000. These claims were denied by Air New Zealand, noting it had funded Ansett&#x27;s loss of A$180 million in the last year. Ansett&#x27;s administrators later admitted no evidence of any asset stripping was found.

===Ansett Mark II and Tesna===
After receiving a federal government guarantee, Ansett resumed limited services between major cities on 1 October 2001, using only the Airbus A320 Skystar fleet. This was referred to as Ansett Mark II, an operation run and financed by Ansett Australia under administration. The purpose of getting Ansett back into the air was to attract a buyer for the business and to generate positive cash flow. Attempts by Ansett&#x27;s Voluntary Administrators to re-engage Singapore Airlines to consider a role in resurrecting Ansett through a meeting on 6 October 2001 resulted in SA agreeing to play a consultancy role in this effort.

The revived and scaled-back operation ran on a tight budget, and its service reflected that. It consisted of single-class seating with no catering, interlining baggage, valet parking, or frequent flyer points. After a month back in the air, the Golden Wing Club Lounges reopened, but like the scaled-back flying operation, provided no refreshments or other amenities apart from coffee and water. Ansett was essentially in &quot;lock down&quot; mode, while the administrators tried to source buyers in a very challenging market. Ansett Mark II traded only as &quot;Ansett&quot; in a different font to separate it from the former operation. It traded from Ansett terminals, with Ansett ground staff, crew, and baggage handlers working around the clock to make it a success with limited resources. Designated gates at each of Ansett&#x27;s terminals were used for the operation, while aircraft not being used were moved away to more distant gates, with the disused concourses being sealed off.

In November 2001, Ansett creditors voted to allow the Tesna consortium, led by Melbourne businessmen Solomon Lew and Lindsay Fox, to purchase Ansett&#x27;s mainline assets. The plan involved creating a whole &quot;new&quot; Ansett out of the ashes of the old, but the trademark font and &quot;Star Mark&quot; logo reinstated. It would be a full-service, two-class, single fleet-type domestic airline. It included very reduced staff numbers and an all new Airbus A320 fleet. The new Ansett would operate out of the old Ansett terminals, and temporarily lease the former Ansett&#x27;s A320 fleet until newer replacements arrived. Loyalty products such as the Golden Wing Club and Global Rewards frequent-flyer program would be relaunched.

Those members of Golden Wing Club at the time of the collapse would have their memberships reinstated for a six-month period if they used the new Ansett. A new CEO was sourced and hired, and began to put together a new management team. A new head office was planned, and Airbus showcased a new A320 to the consortium. A new catering company was selected, with new Business and Economy Class in-flight meals trialed on passengers on select Mark II services in readiness for the new operation.

The agreement with Ansett&#x27;s administrators, although well-advanced, collapsed in late February 2002. Without any prior warning, the administrators announced on 27 February that Fox and Lew had withdrawn their bid, citing &quot;[i]nability to complete the transaction on legal advice&quot;. At a press conference the same day, Fox and Lew announced that they had received no financial support from the government for their bid, and were therefore withdrawing.

With no other saviours, and no realistic chance for Ansett to be revived as a viable concern, the administrators had no choice but to cease all flying operations at 23:59 on 4 March 2002, with the last commercial flight, AN152 from Perth to Sydney, operated by A320-211 VH-HYI, touching down at 06:53 on 5 March. Staff filled Golden Wing Lounges across the country for mass wakes as the final flights came in to land.

===Entitlements===
By this point, the administration of the company had transferred to newly formed insolvency firm KordaMentha. The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission began an investigation of whether Ansett had traded while insolvent, and eventually determined in July 2002 that it would be too expensive and difficult to proceed with an action which would, in any case, need to be many separate actions on behalf of individual creditors rather than just one.

With Ansett now grounded again, the administrators began selling off Ansett&#x27;s assets. This included its regional subsidiary airlines, which still continued to trade despite Ansett being grounded. A creditors meeting post March 2002 voted in favour of an organised wind-up of the operation, under a deed of company arrangement, as opposed to an immediate liquidation. It was viewed that a deed of arrangement would give creditors a greater return than liquidation would provide.

Laid-off Ansett workers were eventually paid most of their entitlements, partly from an A$150 million compensation package offered by Air New Zealand in return for having the ASIC inquiry dropped, but mostly through asset sales and leasing revenue. The Federal Government did provide an A$350 million loan which is being repaid by the Administrators at the same time as the staff are being repaid however, to ensure that there is no exposure to taxpayers, a $10 per seat levy was imposed by the Federal Government on Australian airline passengers. Employees ended up receiving 96% of their entitlements.

===Administration and asset sales===

Ansett&#x27;s administrators, KordaMentha, initially advised creditors that it was unlikely that much more money would be realised, due to the depression of the global aviation industry after the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, DC, had the effect of reducing the value of aircraft from A$300 million to A$70 million. In the months following the final flight, the administrators negotiated the sale of the terminal leases back to the airport owners, recouping millions. Auctions were held to sell Ansett&#x27;s airport furniture and equipment. Its headquarters at 465/489 and 501 Swanston Street, Melbourne were sold to PDG Corporation. Some aircraft stored in heavy maintenance were broken up, as it was not cost-effective to restore them to an airworthy state.

The disposal of the former fleet did not progress quickly, given the depressed aviation market and the subsequent lack of demand by other carriers around the world whose operations had been crippled by the 9/11 attacks only months before. Following the final flight, nearly all of the A320 fleet was ferried back empty to Melbourne, where they sat at abandoned gates in storage. The Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 fleets ultimately found new owners first, and departed Australia between March 2002 and December 2006 as the banks finally reclaimed them, or as new owners were found.

The two Boeing 747s that were leased from Singapore Airlines were reclaimed within weeks of the collapse and returned to Singapore Airlines, which restored the original colours. They subsequently found new lives and were leased to Fiji&#x27;s national carrier Fiji Airways, then known as Air Pacific. The more modern Boeing 767–300, of which Ansett had two, were reclaimed by the lessors in the following months, while two new Boeing 767–300 aircraft which arrived too late to enter service with Ansett, departed soon after. One aircraft was wet leased on a short-term basis by Qantas to bring additional aircraft to cover the loss of Ansett, but the aircraft retained its Ansett registration while under lease to it. Another new 767-300, which was halfway through its ferry from Canada, never made it to Australia and returned to Canada. The Kendell CRJ-200 jets returned to Canada within twelve months of the initial collapse.

With the newer aircraft gone, most of the older Boeing 767–200 fleet were moved from the Melbourne terminal gates as Virgin Blue moved into the former Ansett Terminal, and were placed into long-term storage at the Ansett Engineering Base until late 2004, when most were sold off to Aeroturbine and flown to the United States to be broken up into spare parts. Many of the British Aerospace 146 aircraft were also stored but broken up at Melbourne. As of 2008 the remains of one BAe 146 sit derelict at Brisbane Airport, and another BAe 146 remains at Perth Airport, although neither of them are still owned by Ansett or expected to fly again. A lone Boeing 767–200 survived the scrappers cull, was sold and continues to fly in the United States as a charter aircraft.

As of 2006, there were still in excess of 217,000 items and two properties belonging to the airline remaining for sale. In June 2011, it was announced that the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett employees had finished making payments to former staff and the administration of Ansett had come to an end. Staff received roughly 96% of their entitlements.

==Fleet==

The Ansett Australia fleet as of 13 September 2001 (last day of trading) was made up of the following aircraft:

Only the Airbus A320 was utilised from Ansett&#x27;s original fleet during the brief re-launch of operations as &quot;Ansett Mark II&quot; from October 2001 to March 2002. The Boeing 737, Boeing 767, and Boeing 747 fleets were grounded from September 2001 onwards as were the BAe 146 fleet, with the exception of a one-off revenue flight from Cairns to Brisbane in November 2001, operating off the back end of a charter flight for the government. Two other Ansett BAe 146 aircraft were chartered by the federal government in late 2001 during the federal election campaign.

Several of the defunct fleet types did operate ferry flights back to Melbourne from wherever they ended up across Australia in the months after the collapse, and operated the occasional test flight around Melbourne to retain currency.

Of the subsidiary fleets, only the Kendell Bombardier CRJ200 did not return to active flying. The Fokker 50, Saab 340, Twin Otter and Metro 23 regional aircraft were all back flying for Skywest, Kendell, Hazelton and Aeropelican in the weeks following the collapse. Both Kendell and Hazelton merged to create Regional Express Airlines. As of 2013, five former Kendell Saab 340s are in service with Regional Express with the others phased out. Three of the former Hazelton Airlines Saab 340s are in service with Regional Express.

===Historical fleet===
At various times Ansett Australia and its predecessors, Ansett Airways and Australian National Airways and partnering carriers operated the Boeing 727, −100, −200 Advanced and the purpose-built 727 LR, Bristol Freighter, Cessna 550, Convair 340, Convair 440, de Havilland Dragon, de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, de Havilland Canada Dash 7, de Havilland Heron, Douglas DC-3 and C-47 Skytrain, Douglas DC-4, Douglas DC-5, Douglas DC-6, Fokker F-27, Fokker F-28, Fokker Universal, Lockheed Model 10 Electra, Lockheed L-188 Electra, LET L-200A Morava, Douglas DC-9, Mohawk 298, Piaggio P.166 and Vickers Viscount.

Ansett Flying Boat Services operated the Consolidated PBY Catalina, Short Sandringham and Short Sunderland.

At various times the Ansett-ANA helicopter division operated the Bell 47J Ranger, Bell 206, Bristol Sycamore, Sikorsky S-61 and Sikorsky HH-52 Seaguard.

Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services owned the Airbus A300, Airbus A310 and Boeing 757 for leasing.

One of the most unusual aircraft that was operated by Ansett was the Aviation Traders ATL-98 Carvair from the 1960s. Three of the airline&#x27;s own DC-4s were delivered to the United Kingdom for conversion by Aviation Traders Limited, the company run by Sir Freddie Laker as managing director.

Historically, whichever aircraft carried the registration VH-RMA (the initials of Reginald Miles Ansett) was the unofficial flagship of the airline. The code was carried by a Douglas C-47 Skytrain from 1948 to 1956, a Lockheed L-188 Electra from 1959 to 1984 and a Boeing 767–200 (Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services) from 1992 to 1997. The registration VH-RMA was purchased by Tesna Holdings in January 2002 but never used.

== Cabin services ==

Ansett Australia offered up to three cabin classes (First, Business and Economy Classes) in varied seat configurations throughout its 66-year run. At the time of its collapse, this had reverted to just two travel classes (Business and Economy), both domestically and internationally:

International fleet: (B747-300/B747-400/B767-300ER)
* International Business Class
* International Economy Class

Domestic Fleet: (B767-200/B767-300ER/B737-300/A320-200/BAe-146-200)
* Domestic Business Class
* Domestic Economy Class

===International business class===
Ansett International&#x27;s last business class was introduced with the arrival of the Boeing 747-400. It offered 42 single recliner seats in a 2-2-2 configuration on the main deck, with around 160 degrees of recline. Ansett Australia&#x27;s retrofitted two Boeing 747–400 series aircraft equipped with these recliner seats mostly served the Australia-Asia (Hong Kong and Osaka) international flights. The recliner seats were equipped with inflight entertainment including personal televisions/touch screens with AVOD, personal telephones in every seat and laptop 110 V AC power outlets.

On Ansett International&#x27;s 767 fleet, Business seating was in a 1-2-2 configuration, with recliner seats and AVOD similar, but not identical to those on the B747.

===Domestic business class===
Originally launched as &quot;BusinessFirst&quot; in 1997, and then reverting to just &quot;Business Class&quot; in 1999, Ansett Domestic&#x27;s last business class offered 24 single lounge chair seats grouped in groups of two allowing a more spacious area on its domestic configured 767-300ER and 200ER/200 fleet in a 2-2-2 configuration. Ansett Australia&#x27;s domestic business class seats were also installed on the Airbus A320-200 series, the Boeing 737–300 series, and the BAe-146 fleet in a 2–2 layout. These aircraft mostly served Australian domestic flights, however select 767-200ER, A320 and 737 services were also used on the Australia-Asia/Fiji (Denpasar, Hong Kong and Nadi) international flights as demand dictated.

===International economy class===
The new international economy class was introduced with the arrival of the Boeing 747-400. It offered 398 seats equipped with adjustable wings in the headrest and an adjustable footrest to provide extra comfort. Ansett Australia&#x27;s international economy class seats were also installed on some of the Boeing 767–200s, and some of the Boeing 767–300s. Seat rows were in a 3-4-3 configuration on the Boeing 747-400s lower deck and mostly a 3–3 configuration on the upper deck, a 2-3-2 configuration on the Boeing 767–200 and Boeing 767-300s. The Airbus A320 and Boeing 737s retained their domestic configuration for international service. These aircraft mostly served Australian domestic flights and some of the Australia-Asia/Fiji (Denpasar, Hong Kong, Osaka and Nadi) international flights. The seats were equipped with inflight entertainment including personal televisions and personal telephones in every seat.

===Domestic economy class===
The new domestic economy class was also introduced with the arrival of the Boeing 767-300ER, offering 224 seats. Ansett Australia&#x27;s domestic economy class seats were also installed on some of the Airbus A320s, some of the BAe-146 series, some of the Boeing 737–300 series, some of the Boeing 767–200 series and some of the Boeing 767–300 series aircraft. Seat rows were in a 3–3 configuration on the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-300s, a 2–3 configuration on the BAe 146 series aircraft and a 2-3-2 configuration on the Boeing 767–200 and Boeing 767-300s. These aircraft mostly served Australian domestic flights and some of the Australia-Asia/Fiji (Denpasar, Hong Kong and Nadi) international flights.

===Ansett Mark II cabin===
Following Ansett&#x27;s limited re-launch under administration, it operated only Economy Class with a scaled back no-frills service. The A320s with convertible Business Class seating were configured back to all Economy, while the A320 cabins with fixed Business Class seating retained the Business seat but was considered all one cabin. Bottled water was offered throughout the flight.

===Star Alliance===
On 30 March 1999 Ansett Australia joined the Star Alliance, a global network of carriers, opening up interline agreements with a dozen different carriers connecting to over 100 countries across the world. Reciprocal rights for certain Star Alliance membership tiers was offered, including earning frequent flyer points and a wide selection of lounge access. The Star Alliance logo was added to every aircraft in the Ansett fleet, as well as its regional subsidiary airlines. Other Star member carriers like United Airlines benefited greatly by Ansett&#x27;s membership, with seamless feeder connections from its trans-Pacific services. Membership in the Star Alliance was suspended upon the Ansett Group entering administration. Upon sale to the Tesna Consortium it was planned for the airline to rejoin Star Alliance, however the 4 March shutdown rendered this meaningless.

==Services==
Ansett Australia offered travellers a range of services up to the time of 14 September 2001:

===Golden Wing Club===
Golden Wing Club was the airport lounge service owned and operated by Ansett. Members received a bi-monthly magazine called &quot;Travelling Life&quot;, as well as many other features. Golden Wing Club Lounges were located throughout Australia in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Alice Springs, and Hamilton Island. Ansett also ran international Golden Wing Clubs at Sydney and Perth, with an added &quot;First Class&quot; section of the Sydney Club for those travelling International First Class from 1994 to 1998. Access was available to Golden Wing Club members travelling on an Ansett or subsidiary service (e.g. Kendell, Aeropelican and Skywest) on the day of travel. Complimentary access was granted for Global Rewards Diamond and Sapphire members, as well as Star Alliance Gold (and above) members.

Lounges were for a time, located in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch with members being able to access all Star Alliance Lounges as well. The lounges initially closed following the appointment of administrators and subsequent grounding of the group in September 2001, however select lounges re-opened in a scaled-back capacity in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth only from November 2001 until March 2002 while Ansett Mark II was operating.

Following Ansett&#x27;s final flights in March 2002, the lounges permanently closed. In the weeks that followed they were emptied of their expensive artwork and other items of value in subsequent auctions, leaving behind furniture and a variety of fittings, most of which was purchased by the various airport owners who bought the terminals back from Ansett&#x27;s administrators. Today, many of the former Golden Wing Clubs in Australia live on as new lounges, occupied by Virgin Australia as its member lounge in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, through leases secured with the airport owners. The former Golden Wing in Cairns was used initially by Australian Airlines as a crew training facility followed by Qantas as a temporary Qantas Club while the Cairns terminal underwent redevelopment, before being demolished in the terminal redevelopment. The Perth Golden Wing was used by charter airline Alliance, and then became Virgin&#x27;s sixth lounge before being vacated in late 2015 when Virgin relocated to the new Domestic T1 terminal. The Canberra Lounge was used by Virgin Blue and eventually closed and demolished to make way for the new Canberra Terminal redevelopment. The Adelaide and Gold Coast lounges have both, in the process of terminal redevelopments, been demolished.

===Ansett Executive Lounge===
The Ansett Executive Lounge, also known as &quot;Ansett Pass&quot; and &quot;Ansett Managers Lounge&quot; was an exclusive airport lounge service owned and operated by Ansett. Membership was by invitation only, and offered luxury rivaling that of the world&#x27;s finest five-star hotels. As membership was quite select, the lounges were significantly smaller than those of Golden Wing Clubs. Executive lounges were located throughout Australia (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra, and Perth) and New Zealand (Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch).

These lounges closed at time of administration and did not reopen. In the years since the collapse, many of the former executive lounges were demolished after the airport owners purchased the leasing rights from Ansett&#x27;s administrators. For a time, regional carrier Regional Express Airlines used the former Canberra lounge as a lounge area for its passengers. Virgin Blue used the former Executive Lounge in Sydney for its initial &quot;Blue Room&quot; and later on &quot;The Lounge&quot; product, but relocated to the former Golden Wing Club lounge in 2008. The former lounges are still in existence in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, but are now used for other purposes and not accessible to passengers.

===Global Rewards===
Global Rewards was Ansett Australia&#x27;s Frequent Flyer Program from 1991 to 2001. It was formerly known simply as &quot;Ansett Frequent Flyer&quot;. Points could be used for services from Ansett Australia and their partners including flights, upgrades, holidays, hotel stays and car rentals. Diners Club was a significant financial services partner in Global Rewards. Points held at the time of the airline&#x27;s collapse lost their value as no other airline took over the program as had taken place with the collapse of some other airlines.

===Chauffeur drive===
Ansett offered a limousine service, for those wishing to hire for journeys to and from the airport to the CBD in Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. It also offered airport-to-suburb service in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.

===Valet parking===
Ansett offered a valet parking service in major Australian and New Zealand airports. This also offered the convenience of kerbside check-in, and car cleaning for additional cost.

===Capital Shuttle===
Ansett&#x27;s Capital Shuttle operated between Sydney and Canberra. This service mainly used Saab 340 and Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft, with small use of A320 and 737 aircraft mostly in peak periods. &#x27;Capital Shuttle&#x27; services departed from a specially marked gate at Sydney Airport, Gate 14.

===Air cargo===
Also known as Ansett Air Freight during its time, Ansett ran a significant freight operation which specialised in the transport of items too large for normal carriage, along with heavy-freight contracts with numerous suppliers and contractors.

===Terminal transfers===
Ansett ran a scheduled terminal transfer service at Sydney Airport, which offered seamless connection from its Domestic terminal to the International terminal for Ansett Australia services connecting to Ansett International. An Ansett bus operated the shuttle service which departed from a transfer lounge located between its two domestic concourses. The shuttle would route across the airside tarmac and runways and arrive near customs at Terminal 1.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 17 May 1946, VH-UZP Lockheed 10B Electra &quot;Ansalanta&quot;, Essendon to Parafield (Ansett Airways inaugural direct service). Controlled flight into terrain on an instrument approach, aircraft ended inverted – 12 on board survived without serious injury.
*On 18 June 1950, VH-BZK, a Douglas DC-3 was involved in a ground collision with an empty coal train while taxiing. The aircraft collided with the train on the level crossing that existed at the time on Runway 22 at Kingsford-Smith Airport. The DC-3 was severely damaged and the aircraft&#x27;s first officer received minor injuries, while 5 of the train&#x27;s coal wagons derailed.
*On 30 November 1961, Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount, crashed into Botany Bay shortly after take-off from Kingsford-Smith Airport, Sydney, New South Wales. The starboard wing failed in a thunderstorm. All 15 people on board were killed.
*On 22 September 1966, Ansett-ANA Flight 149, a Vickers Viscount, crashed at Winton, Queensland after a mid-air fire caused structural failure of the port wing. All 24 people on board were killed.
*On 19 October 1994, Ansett Australia Flight 881, a Boeing 747–300 registered as VH-INH, operating Sydney to Osaka, returned and landed at Sydney without the nose wheel extended. Approximately one hour after departure the crew shut down the number one engine because of an oil leak. They returned the aircraft to Sydney where the approach proceeded normally until the landing gear was selected. With selection of the landing gear and selection of the flap beyond a setting of flaps 20, the landing gear warning horn began to sound because the nose landing gear had not extended. The flight crew unsuccessfully attempted to establish the reason for the warning. Believing the gear to be down, the crew elected to complete the landing, with the result that the aircraft was landed with the nose gear retracted. There was no fire and the pilot in command decided not to initiate an emergency evacuation. All 274 passengers and crew were evacuated safely.
*On 19 May 2000, a Boeing 767–200, registered as VH-RMO, suffered a nose wheel collapse at Sydney Terminal during an overnight service. The aircraft was not occupied by passengers or crew at the time.

==Sponsorship==

===Sport===
Ansett Australia was one of the major sponsors of the Australian Football League, holding the naming rights to the AFL pre-season competition, the Ansett Australia Cup. It was also a major sponsor of Waverley Park. The logo was visible around the stadium.

Ansett was also a Major Sponsor of Australian Cricket, with the Ansett Australia Test Series a prominent fixture of the Australian summer. Ansett&#x27;s logo (called the StarMark) appeared on all players&#x27; training and game shirts, as well as around the boundary and on the field during Test Series.

The airline was the official airline of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Boeing 767–300 ER VH-BZF carried the Olympic Flame from Athens to Guam for the start of the torch relay through Oceania. An A320-211 carried the Olympic Torch from Auckland to Uluru, to commence the Olympic Torch relay in Australia.

Since Qantas&#x27;s Take over of Australian Airlines in 1992, Ansett acquired the rights to selective sponsorship of various teams involved in the Australian Touring Car Championship and Seven Networks commentary team between various airports close to racing venues around Australia from 1994 to Ten Network&#x27;s takeover of V8 Supercar Series AVESCO (V8 Supercars Australia) launched the new series in 1997, but the insignia remained on various cars until Ansett folded in 2001.

It was also the sleeve / major sponsor of the Brisbane Broncos National Rugby League team from 1996 until 2001.

===Film and television===
Ansett Australia sponsored the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; in the late 1980s, having previously received publicity when its aircraft were used in the filming of another production by Reg Grundy—1977&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Ansett often sponsored Channel 9&#x27;s Nightline late night news program from 1994 to 1997.

The airline also held a sponsorship deal with &quot;Prisoner&quot; (or &quot;Prisoner Cell Block H&quot; in the United Kingdom), which was another Grundy production.

Ansett also offered on-board News and movies, entitled (&quot;Ansett Sky Show&quot;). It consisted of a twice daily 30-minute news service (AM and PM), which was recorded by Channel 7 studios in Sydney entitled &quot;Seven Ansett News&quot;, which was then transmitted by satellite to all Ansett capital city, and some regional airport locations. The news service was then dubbed to video cassettes, and was then distributed onto Ansett aircraft first thing in the morning and exchanged halfway during the operational day for the second afternoon/evening broadcast. For the domestic fleet, movies and television shows were recorded to tape and distributed to each aircraft once a month.

On international aircraft, the news was available in one edition (usually morning). Movies and television shows were recorded onto a central data system on both 747-400 and one 767-300ER aircraft, which was changed monthly.

Ansett&#x27;s safety demonstration was done via TV screens throughout the aircraft as well as in person, at the time of its demise.

===Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS)===

Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services or simply Ansett Worldwide was one of the world&#x27;s largest commercial jet aircraft leasing companies. It was Ansett Australia&#x27;s subsidiary and leasing arm from 1985 until February 2000. AWAS was acquired by Dubai Aerospace Enterprise in 2017.

===Ansett Flight Simulator Centre / Ansett Aviation Training===
The Ansett Australia Flight Simulator Centre located in Melbourne had continued trading under administration, following the company&#x27;s insolvency as it was one of the few Ansett businesses that could operate profitably, independent of the airline. An agreement was reached by the Deed Administrators in October 2004 for its sale to Aviation Training Australasia Pty Ltd. The sale included the business, related buildings, land and the Ansett owned Flight Simulators. Nineteen former Ansett Australia employees jobs were saved in the sale, and Aviation Training Australasia elected to operate the centre under the trading name of Ansett Flight Simulator Centre and later Ansett Aviation Training, dropping the &quot;Australia&quot; off the end of Ansett, but retaining the well recognised Ansett Star Mark logo, reflective of Ansett&#x27;s last livery.

In April 2008, it announced that it was undergoing a major expansion and will be getting simulators for the current-generation Boeing 737, Fokker 100, Beechcraft King Air and Embraer EMB-120 Brasília, as well as a second Airbus A320 simulator due an extension to centre&#x27;s existing building.

From 2008 Ansett Aviation Training continued growing to become the biggest Australian Training provider in the Asia Pacific Region, adding D level full flight simulators:

* Airbus A320 I, II &amp; III 
* Airbus A320 CEET 
* BAe 146 
* Boeing 737 Classic 
* Dash 8 100/200/300 
* Embraer 120 
* Fokker 100 
* King Air 200

===John Holland Aviation Services===
With the demise of Ansett airline operations in 2002, the engineering services business, formerly known as the Ansett Australia Maintenance Base located at Melbourne Airport, was retained under the name of Ansett Aviation Engineering Services (AAES), primarily to care for the Ansett aircraft held in storage having mandatory ongoing maintenance, and also for other airlines supplying third party maintenance. Through five years of administration, AAES continued to operate despite Ansett Australia no longer trading.

New business was secured and the engineering skills base continued to grow. The AAES business was acquired by the John Holland Group in June 2007 under the banner of John Holland Aviation Services. As part of the sale to John Holland Group, 155 AAES staff and management had the opportunity for ongoing employment.

<text>Digital imaging or digital image acquisition is the creation of a digital representation of the visual characteristics of an object, such as a physical scene or the interior structure of an object. The term is often assumed to imply or include the processing, compression, storage, printing and display of such images. A key advantage of a digital image, versus an analog image such as a film photograph, is the ability to digitally propagate copies of the original subject indefinitely without any loss of image quality.

Digital imaging can be classified by the type of electromagnetic radiation or other waves whose variable attenuation, as they pass through or reflect off objects, conveys the information that constitutes the image. In all classes of digital imaging, the information is converted by image sensors into digital signals that are processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image. For example, the medium of visible light allows digital photography (including digital videography) with various kinds of digital cameras (including digital video cameras). X-rays allow digital X-ray imaging (digital radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT), and gamma rays allow digital gamma ray imaging (digital scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET). Sound allows ultrasonography (such as medical ultrasonography) and sonar, and radio waves allow radar. Digital imaging lends itself well to image analysis by software, as well as to image editing (including image manipulation).

==History==
Before digital imaging, the first photograph ever produced, View from the Window at Le Gras, was in 1826 by Frenchman Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. When Joseph was 28, he was discussing with his brother Claude about the possibility of reproducing images with light. His focus on his new innovations began in 1816. He was in fact more interested in creating an engine for a boat. Joseph and his brother focused on that for quite some time and Claude successfully promoted his innovation moving and advancing him to England. Joseph was able to focus on the photograph and finally in 1826, he was able to produce his first photograph of a view through his window. This took 8 hours or more of exposure to light.

The first digital image was produced in 1920, by the Bartlane cable picture transmission system. British inventors, Harry G. Bartholomew and Maynard D. McFarlane, developed this method. The process consisted of &quot;a series of negatives on zinc plates that were exposed for varying lengths of time, thus producing varying densities&quot;. The Bartlane cable picture transmission system generated at both its transmitter and its receiver end a punched data card or tape that was recreated as an image.

In 1957, Russell A. Kirsch produced a device that generated digital data that could be stored in a computer; this used a drum scanner and photomultiplier tube.

Digital imaging was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, largely to avoid the operational weaknesses of film cameras, for scientific and military missions including the KH-11 program. As digital technology became cheaper in later decades, it replaced the old film methods for many purposes.

In the early 1960s, while developing compact, lightweight, portable equipment for the onboard nondestructive testing of naval aircraft, Frederick G. Weighart and James F. McNulty (U.S. radio engineer) at Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California co-invented the first apparatus to generate a digital image in real-time, which image was a fluoroscopic digital radiograph. Square wave signals were detected on the fluorescent screen of a fluoroscope to create the image.

===Digital image sensors===
The charge-coupled device was invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching MOS technology, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting.

Early CCD sensors suffered from shutter lag. This was largely resolved with the invention of the pinned photodiode (PPD). It was invented by Nobukazu Teranishi, Hiromitsu Shiraki and Yasuo Ishihara at NEC in 1980. It was a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency and low dark current. In 1987, the PPD began to be incorporated into most CCD devices, becoming a fixture in consumer electronic video cameras and then digital still cameras. Since then, the PPD has been used in nearly all CCD sensors and then CMOS sensors.

The NMOS active-pixel sensor (APS) was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid-1980s. This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication, with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub-micron levels. The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura&#x27;s team at Olympus in 1985. The CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) was later developed by Eric Fossum&#x27;s team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993. By 2007, sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors.

===Digital image compression===
An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform (DCT). DCT compression is used in JPEG, which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992. JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes, and has become the most widely used image file format on the Internet.

===Digital cameras===
These different scanning ideas were the basis of the first designs of digital camera. Early cameras took a long time to capture an image and were poorly suited for consumer purposes. It was not until the adoption of the CCD (charge-coupled device) that the digital camera really took off. The CCD became part of the imaging systems used in telescopes, the first black-and-white digital cameras in the 1980s. Color was eventually added to the CCD and is a usual feature of cameras today.

==Changing environment==

Great strides have been made in the field of digital imaging. Negatives and exposure are foreign concepts to many, and the first digital image in 1920 led eventually to cheaper equipment, increasingly powerful yet simple software, and the growth of the Internet.

The constant advancement and production of physical equipment and hardware related to digital imaging has affected the environment surrounding the field. From cameras and webcams to printers and scanners, the hardware is becoming sleeker, thinner, faster, and cheaper. As the cost of equipment decreases, the market for new enthusiasts widens, allowing more consumers to experience the thrill of creating their own images.

Everyday personal laptops, family desktops, and company computers are able to handle photographic software. Our computers are more powerful machines with increasing capacities for running programs of any kind—especially digital imaging software. And that software is quickly becoming both smarter and simpler. Although functions on today&#x27;s programs reach the level of precise editing and even rendering 3-D images, user interfaces are designed to be friendly to advanced users as well as first-time fans.

The Internet allows editing, viewing, and sharing digital photos and graphics. A quick browse around the web can easily turn up graphic artwork from budding artists, news photos from around the world, corporate images of new products and services, and much more. The Internet has clearly proven itself a catalyst in fostering the growth of digital imaging.

Online photo sharing of images changes the way we understand photography and photographers. Online sites such as Flickr, Shutterfly, and Instagram give billions the capability to share their photography, whether they are amateurs or professionals. Photography has gone from being a luxury medium of communication and sharing to more of a fleeting moment in time. Subjects have also changed. Pictures used to be primarily taken of people and family. Now, we take them of anything. We can document our day and share it with everyone with the touch of our fingers.

In 1826 Niepce was the first to develop a photo which used lights to reproduce images, the advancement of photography has drastically increased over the years. Everyone is now a photographer in their own way, whereas during the early 1800s and 1900s the expense of lasting photos was highly valued and appreciated by consumers and producers. According to the magazine article on five ways digital camera changed us states the following:The impact on professional photographers has been dramatic. Once upon a time a photographer wouldn&#x27;t dare waste a shot unless they were virtually certain it would work.&quot;The use of digital imaging( photography) has changed the way we interacted with our environment over the years. Part of the world is experienced differently through visual imagining of lasting memories, it has become a new form of communication with friends, family and love ones around the world without face to face interactions. Through photography it is easy to see those that you have never seen before and feel their presence without them being around, for example Instagram is a form of social media where anyone is allowed to shoot, edit, and share photos of whatever they want with friends and family. Facebook, snapshot, vine and twitter are also ways people express themselves with little or no words and are able to capture every moment that is important. Lasting memories that were hard to capture, is now easy because everyone is now able to take pictures and edit it on their phones or laptops. Photography has become a new way to communicate and it is rapidly increasing as time goes by, which has affected the world around us.

A study done by Basey, Maines, Francis, and Melbourne found that drawings used in class have a significant negative effect on lower-order content for student&#x27;s lab reports, perspectives of labs, excitement, and time efficiency of learning. Documentation style learning has no significant effects on students in these areas. He also found that students were more motivated and excited to learn when using digital imaging.

==Field advancements==
In the field of education. 
* As digital projectors, screens, and graphics find their way to the classroom, teachers and students alike are benefitting from the increased convenience and communication they provide, although their theft can be a common problem in schools. In addition acquiring a basic digital imaging education is becoming increasingly important for young professionals. Reed, a design production expert from Western Washington University, stressed the importance of using &quot;digital concepts to familiarize students with the exciting and rewarding technologies found in one of the major industries of the 21st century&quot;.
The field of medical imaging
* A branch of digital imaging that seeks to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, is growing at a rapid rate. A recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that proper imaging of children who may have appendicitis may reduce the amount of appendectomies needed. Further advancements include amazingly detailed and accurate imaging of the brain, lungs, tendons, and other parts of the body—images that can be used by health professionals to better serve patients.
* According to Vidar, as more countries take on this new way of capturing an image, it has been found that image digitalization in medicine has been increasingly beneficial for both patient and medical staff. Positive ramifications of going paperless and heading towards digitization includes the overall reduction of cost in medical care, as well as an increased global, real-time, accessibility of these images. 
* There is a program called Digital Imaging in Communications and Medicine (DICOM) that is changing the medical world as we know it. DICOM is not only a system for taking high quality images of the aforementioned internal organs, but also is helpful in processing those images. It is a universal system that incorporates image processing, sharing, and analyzing for the convenience of patient comfort and understanding. This service is all encompassing and is beginning a necessity.

In the field of technology, digital image processing has become more useful than analog image processing when considering the modern technological advancement. 
* Image sharpen &amp; reinstatement –
** Image sharpens &amp; reinstatement is the procedure of images which is capture by the contemporary camera making them an improved picture or manipulating the pictures in the way to get chosen product. This comprises the zooming process, the blurring process, the sharpening process, the gray scale to color translation process, the picture recovery process and the picture identification process.
* Facial Recognition –
** Face recognition is a PC innovation that decides the positions and sizes of human faces in self-assertive digital pictures. It distinguishes facial components and overlooks whatever, for example, structures, trees &amp; bodies.
* Remote detection –
** Remote detecting is little or substantial scale procurement of data of article or occurrence, with the utilization of recording or ongoing detecting apparatus which is not in substantial or close contact with an article. Practically speaking, remote detecting is face-off accumulation using an assortment of gadgets for collecting data on particular article or location.
* Pattern detection –
** The pattern detection is the study or investigation from picture processing. In the pattern detection, image processing is utilized for recognizing elements in the images and after that machine study is utilized to instruct a framework for variation in pattern. The pattern detection is utilized in computer-aided analysis, detection of calligraphy, identification of images, and many more.
* Color processing –
** The color processing comprises processing of colored pictures and diverse color locations which are utilized. This moreover involves study of transmit, store, and encode of the color pictures.

== Augmented reality ==
Digital Imaging for Augmented Reality (DIAR) is a comprehensive field within the broader context of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. It involves the creation, manipulation, and interpretation of digital images for use in augmented reality environments. DIAR plays a significant role in enhancing the user experience, providing realistic overlays of digital information onto the real world, thereby bridging the gap between the physical and the virtual realms.

DIAR is employed in numerous sectors including entertainment, education, healthcare, military, and retail. In entertainment, DIAR is used to create immersive gaming experiences and interactive movies. In education, it provides a more engaging learning environment, while in healthcare, it assists in complex surgical procedures. The military uses DIAR for training purposes and battlefield visualization. In retail, customers can virtually try on clothes or visualize furniture in their home before making a purchase.

With continuous advancements in technology, the future of DIAR is expected to witness more realistic overlays, improved 3D object modeling, and seamless integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). The incorporation of haptic feedback in DIAR systems could further enhance the user experience by adding a sense of touch to the visual overlays. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are expected to further improve the context-appropriateness and realism of the overlaid digital images.

==Theoretical application==
Although theories are quickly becoming realities in today&#x27;s technological society, the range of possibilities for digital imaging is wide open. One major application that is still in the works is that of child safety and protection. How can we use digital imaging to better protect our kids? Kodak&#x27;s program, Kids Identification Digital Software (KIDS) may answer that question. The beginnings include a digital imaging kit to be used to compile student identification photos, which would be useful during medical emergencies and crimes. More powerful and advanced versions of applications such as these are still developing, with increased features constantly being tested and added.

But parents and schools aren&#x27;t the only ones who see benefits in databases such as these. Criminal investigation offices, such as police precincts, state crime labs, and even federal bureaus have realized the importance of digital imaging in analyzing fingerprints and evidence, making arrests, and maintaining safe communities. As the field of digital imaging evolves, so does our ability to protect the public.

Digital imaging can be closely related to the social presence theory especially when referring to the social media aspect of images captured by our phones. There are many different definitions of the social presence theory but two that clearly define what it is would be &quot;the degree to which people are perceived as real&quot; (Gunawardena, 1995), and &quot;the ability to project themselves socially and emotionally as real people&quot; (Garrison, 2000). Digital imaging allows one to manifest their social life through images in order to give the sense of their presence to the virtual world. The presence of those images acts as an extension of oneself to others, giving a digital representation of what it is they are doing and who they are with. Digital imaging in the sense of cameras on phones helps facilitate this effect of presence with friends on social media. Alexander (2012) states, &quot;presence and representation is deeply engraved into our reflections on images...this is, of course, an altered presence...nobody confuses an image with the representation reality. But we allow ourselves to be taken in by that representation, and only that &#x27;representation&#x27; is able to show the liveliness of the absentee in a believable way.&quot; Therefore, digital imaging allows ourselves to be represented in a way so as to reflect our social presence.

Photography is a medium used to capture specific moments visually. Through photography our culture has been given the chance to send information (such as appearance) with little or no distortion. The Media Richness Theory provides a framework for describing a medium&#x27;s ability to communicate information without loss or distortion. This theory has provided the chance to understand human behavior in communication technologies.
The article written by Daft and Lengel (1984,1986) states the following: 

Communication media fall along a continuum of richness. The richness of a medium comprises four aspects: the availability of instant feedback, which allows questions to be asked and answered; the use of multiple cues, such as physical presence, vocal inflection, body gestures, words, numbers and graphic symbols; the use of natural language, which can be used to convey an understanding of a broad set of concepts and ideas; and the personal focus of the medium (pp. 83).

The more a medium is able to communicate the accurate appearance, social cues and other such characteristics the more rich it becomes. Photography has become a natural part of how we communicate. For example, most phones have the ability to send pictures in text messages. Apps Snapchat and Vine have become increasingly popular for communicating. Sites like Instagram and Facebook have also allowed users to reach a deeper level of richness because of their ability to reproduce information. Sheer, V. C. (January–March 2011). Teenagers&#x27; use of MSN features, discussion topics, and online friendship development: the impact of media richness and communication control. Communication Quarterly, 59(1).

== Methods ==
A digital photograph may be created directly from a physical scene by a camera or similar device. Alternatively, a digital image may be obtained from another image in an analog medium, such as photographs, photographic film, or printed paper, by an image scanner or similar device. Many technical images—such as those acquired with tomographic equipment, side-scan sonar, or radio telescopes—are actually obtained by complex processing of non-image data. Weather radar maps as seen on television news are a commonplace example. The digitalization of analog real-world data is known as digitizing, and involves sampling (discretization) and quantization. Projectional imaging of digital radiography can be done by X-ray detectors that directly convert the image to digital format. Alternatively, phosphor plate radiography is where the image is first taken on a photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate which is subsequently scanned by a mechanism called photostimulated luminescence.

Finally, a digital image can also be computed from a geometric model or mathematical formula. In this case, the name image synthesis is more appropriate, and it is more often known as rendering.

Digital image authentication is an issue for the providers and producers of digital images such as health care organizations, law enforcement agencies, and insurance companies. There are methods emerging in forensic photography to analyze a digital image and determine if it has been altered.

Previously digital imaging depended on chemical and mechanical processes, now all these processes have converted to electronic. A few things need to take place for digital imaging to occur, the light energy converts to electrical energy – think of a grid with millions of little solar cells. Each condition generates a specific electrical charge. Charges for each of these &quot;solar cells&quot; are transported and communicated to the firmware to be interpreted. The firmware is what understands and translates the color and other light qualities. Pixels are what is noticed next, with varying intensities they create and cause different colors, creating a picture or image. Finally, the firmware records the information for a future date and for reproduction.

== Advantages ==
There are several benefits of digital imaging. First, the process enables easy access of photographs and word documents. Google is at the forefront of this &#x27;revolution,&#x27; with its mission to digitize the world&#x27;s books. Such digitization will make the books searchable, thus making participating libraries, such as Stanford University and the University of California Berkeley, accessible worldwide. Digital imaging also benefits the medical world because it &quot;allows the electronic transmission of images to third-party providers, referring dentists, consultants, and insurance carriers via a modem&quot;. The process &quot;is also environmentally friendly since it does not require chemical processing&quot;. Digital imaging is also frequently used to help document and record historical, scientific and personal life events.

Benefits also exist regarding photographs. Digital imaging will reduce the need for physical contact with original images. Furthermore, digital imaging creates the possibility of reconstructing the visual contents of partially damaged photographs, thus eliminating the potential that the original would be modified or destroyed. In addition, photographers will be &quot;freed from being &#x27;chained&#x27; to the darkroom,&quot; will have more time to shoot and will be able to cover assignments more effectively. Digital imaging &#x27;means&#x27; that &quot;photographers no longer have to rush their film to the office, so they can stay on location longer while still meeting deadlines&quot;.

Another advantage to digital photography is that it has been expanded to camera phones. We are able to take cameras with us wherever as well as send photos instantly to others. It is easy for people to us as well as help in the process of self-identification for the younger generation

== Criticisms ==
Critics of digital imaging cite several negative consequences. An increased &quot;flexibility in getting better quality images to the readers&quot; will tempt editors, photographers and journalists to manipulate photographs. In addition, &quot;staff photographers will no longer be photojournalists, but camera operators... as editors have the power to decide what they want &#x27;shot&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="275684" wikidata="Q2267374" url="?curid=275684" title="How to Be Good">
<text>How to Be Good is a 2001 novel by the English writer Nick Hornby. It centers on characters Katie Carr, a doctor, and her husband, David Grant. The story begins when David stops being &quot;The Angriest Man In Holloway&quot; and begins to be &quot;good&quot; with the help of his spiritual healer, DJ GoodNews (who also shows up briefly in Hornby&#x27;s &quot;A Long Way Down&quot;). The pair go about this by nominally convincing people to give their spare bedrooms to the homeless, but as their next scheme comes around, &quot;reversal&quot; (being good to people one has not been good to in the past), this proves to be fruitless and thus David gives up his strivings and his plans for a book on how to be good, appropriately named &quot;How to be Good.&quot;

The protagonist, Katie, briefly encounters a minor character named Dick whose description and attitude towards music are reminiscent of the character of the same name from Hornby&#x27;s first novel, &quot;High Fidelity&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;How to Be Good&quot; was generally well-received among British press. 
==Audiobook==

&quot;How to be Good&quot; is available on audiobook, both abridged and unabridged. The abridged version is read by Frances Barber and the unabridged version is read by Clare Higgins.

<doc id="275686" wikidata="Q556024" url="?curid=275686" title="Sasha (DJ)">
<text>Alexander Paul Coe (born 4 September 1969), known professionally as Sasha, is a Welsh DJ and record producer. He is best known for his live events and electronic music as a solo artist, as well as his collaborations with British DJ John Digweed as Sasha &amp; John Digweed. He was voted as World No.⁠ ⁠1 DJ in 2000 in a poll conducted by &quot;DJ Magazine&quot;. He is a four-time International Dance Music Awards winner, four-time DJ Awards winner and Grammy Award nominee.

Sasha began his career playing acid house music in the late 1980s. He partnered with John Digweed in 1993, touring internationally and producing a series of mix albums (compilations of other artists&#x27; work played in a continuous fashion).

Sasha has remixed tracks for artists such as D-Ream, Madonna, Moby, the Chemical Brothers and Hot Chip. Sasha&#x27;s remixing and production often combine electronic music genres, making it difficult for critics to pinpoint his musical style. As well as remixes and compilation albums, Sasha has produced three albums of original works: &quot;The Qat Collection&quot; in 1994, &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Scene Delete&quot; in 2016.

After achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as BT and James Zabiela. His use of live audio engineering equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on records and turntables. In 2007, he formed a record label with Renaissance Records called emFire, which is the exclusive outlet for his new music.

== Early years ==
Sasha was born in Bangor, Wales, on 4 September 1969. His early musical taste was primarily Top 40 pop music like The The and The Police. After what he described as an &quot;idyllic childhood&quot;, Sasha passed the entrance exam for Hatfield College at age 17. However, he did not like Epsom and left before completing his A-Level examinations. Instead of continuing his schooling, Sasha moved to Bangor to live with his father and stepmother. Sasha&#x27;s stepmother forced him to take piano lessons which, although he disliked them at the time, he ultimately found to be beneficial to his music career.

Sasha became aware of electronic dance music in 1988 at The Haçienda, a Manchester dance venue. Drawn to the rough sound of acid house music and the rebellious attitude he associated with it, he visited Manchester weekly and soon moved to nearby Disley. Sasha purchased records and began to teach himself how to mix. A local DJ at a club Sasha frequented announced that he was looking for other DJs to travel with him on a regional tour; Sasha volunteered and made his first live appearance in nearby Stockport. He recalled of his debut, &quot;I&#x27;d never even touched a Technics: I thought the pitch control was the volume, I didn&#x27;t even know where to plug my headphones in! I&#x27;m sure I was absolutely horrendous.&quot;

Sasha soon found himself in debt due to low-paying performances and the many records he bought. To finance his record collection, he performed at illegal warehouse raves in the Blackburn and Blackpool areas. With the assistance of another local DJ, Jon DaSilva, Sasha secured work at The Haçienda, where he learned key mixing (matching melodic keys) from DaSilva and refined his ability to beatmatch (to synchronize the beats of two simultaneously playing records). Though he enjoyed playing at The Haçienda, in 1990 Sasha left for a club called Shelley&#x27;s Laserdrome in Stoke-on-Trent. There, he established part of his signature sound by mixing euphoric acid house music with Italian piano house and emotional a cappellas. Because of his increased popularity and visibility at Shelley&#x27;s, &quot;Mixmag&quot; featured Sasha on its first cover, under the headline &quot;SASHA MANIA – THE FIRST DJ PINUP?&quot;. While continuing to DJ, Sasha began to produce several of his own dance tracks. This, he later noted, was contrary to the career paths of many successful DJs, for whom it was more common to start out as producers. Upon signing a recording contract, he also set up an entire recording studio at the same time, which led to a &quot;painful learning curve&quot; at the outset. He released his first Remix single, &quot;Appolonia&quot;, The Sasha Mixes of the Italo House Track By Indie, under the name &quot;BM:Ex&quot; (the name is short for The Barry Manilow Experience, a joke in reference to Sasha&#x27;s love of the piano), with producer Tom Frederikse on Union City Recordings. After DJing at Shelley&#x27;s for several years, Sasha left his position because of increasing gang violence in and around the club. As a result of his growing reputation, Sasha was offered work in several London and Australian clubs. He accepted, instead, a spot in the DJ rotation at Renaissance, a club night started by Geoff Oakes at Venue 44 in Mansfield, England.

Later in 1993, Sasha, collaborating with Danny Campbell for Pete Tong&#x27;s FFRR, produced &quot;Together&quot;, his first single under the name &quot;Sasha&quot;. &quot;Together&quot; peaked on the UK Singles Chart at #57. With this success, Sasha began a series of records for Deconstruction Records with the singles &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Magic&quot; (for which Digweed produced a remix) and &quot;The Qat Collection&quot; with Frederikse and vocalist Sam Mollison.

== Career ==
=== Digweed era ===

In early 1993, Sasha partnered with fellow Renaissance DJ John Digweed. Sasha and Digweed honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances, and had the duo compile the triple-CD mix album &quot;&quot;, releasing it on the club&#x27;s own Renaissance Records label. The album featured tracks from such artists as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed. &quot;The Mix Collection&quot; was released soon after Sasha&#x27;s departure from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his success at Renaissance, Sasha was again featured on &quot;Mixmag&quot; with the tagline &quot;SON OF GOD?&quot;, though he resented the accolade. After touring together for two years, the duo became &quot;true superstars&quot; with the release of their double CD &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; on mega-label Ministry of Sound. Around this time, Sasha began a recurring mentorship and partnership with fellow producer BT with the album &quot;Ima&quot;. As well as providing guidance for BT, Sasha produced a &quot;euphoric&quot; and &quot;introspective&quot; 42-minute rendition of the album which formed the centrepiece of the UK release and appeared as a &quot;bonus&quot; second disc on the US release. He continued to advance his own production work by pairing with vocalist Maria Nayler to produce the single &quot;Be as One&quot;, which reached #17 on the UK singles chart.

In 1997, Ministry of Sound released &quot;Northern Exposure 2&quot;, Sasha and Digweed&#x27;s next double-CD entry in their Northern Exposure series. To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s. After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City&#x27;s famous Twilo nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night. In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the Global Underground series: Digweed&#x27;s &quot;Global Underground 006: Sydney&quot;, and Sasha&#x27;s &quot;Global Underground 009: San Francisco&quot;, which drew from his experience touring on the West Coast of the United States. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency Excession: The Agency LTD. Excession remains a booking agency for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.

Sasha reached a more mainstream audience with his remixes of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and GusGus&#x27;s &quot;Purple&quot; for those artists&#x27; single releases. His success in pop music led him to score the music for the PlayStation video game &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;. In 1999, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third edition in the Northern Exposure series, &quot;Northern Exposure: Expeditions&quot;. In addition to mixing and DJing, Sasha joined Charlie May of Spooky to produce the &quot;Xpander EP&quot;, the title track of which many clubbers still view as &quot;one of the greatest trance tracks of all time&quot;. He used the title track as a centerpiece for &quot;Global Underground 013: Ibiza&quot;, his second Global Underground release. Sasha continued his collaborations with BT on the track &quot;Ride&quot;, which was released as a single on Yoshitoshi Records and on BT&#x27;s &quot;Movement in Still Life&quot;. Soon after, he worked with Underworld&#x27;s Darren Emerson on the single &quot;Scorchio&quot;, Sasha&#x27;s first charting single in four years. In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album &quot;Communicate&quot; in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. &quot;Communicate&quot; had mixed reviews: &quot;Spin&quot; stated that despite a &quot;few stellar moments, [&quot;Communicate&quot;] is ultimately a let-down&quot;. LAUNCHcast, too, described &quot;Communicate&quot; as &quot;boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats&quot;.

During the late 1990s, the increased popularity and visibility of &quot;superstar DJs&quot; led to the creation of superclubs such as Liverpool&#x27;s Cream and Sheffield&#x27;s Gatecrasher. By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s pop critic, Alexis Petridis, attributed the &quot;terminal decline&quot; of dance music to its over-commercialisation by big-name DJs, such as Sasha, and to their demands for increased fees for performances. Though dance music had been declared &quot;dead&quot; by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour—despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club Twilo in May 2001.

After the closing of Twilo, Sasha and Digweed embarked on their ambitious Delta Heavy Tour of the United States in 2002. Featuring veteran tour producer Kevin Lyman and opening act Jimmy Van M, the tour covered 31 cities and played to 85,000 people. The appearances, complete with laser shows and video production, were more akin to rock concerts than to typical DJ events. This development was new to the DJing scene, and compelled other DJs to host similar concerts. A DVD of performance highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage was released as &quot;Sasha &amp; John Digweed present Delta Heavy&quot; by System Recordings. Ben Turner, creator of the DanceStar awards, retrospectively described the Delta Heavy tour as &quot;a landmark moment for electronic music&quot;. Though the duo of Sasha and Digweed never explicitly split up, demanding schedules and frequent independent touring prevented any substantial collaboration for a long period after Delta Heavy.

=== Post-Digweed ===

During the latter half of 2002, Sasha collaborated with big beat artist Junkie XL on the single &quot;Breezer&quot;. Junkie XL, along with Charlie May, also assisted Sasha on his second album of original material, &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot;. &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; took several years to produce due to Sasha&#x27;s desire for the album to be &quot;as near to perfection as possible.&quot; That March, Sasha suffered a perforated eardrum in a traffic accident, further delaying the album&#x27;s production. Though the accident temporarily impaired his hearing, he drew inspiration for the album from his ordeal. &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; was finally released, in August 2002, to much fanfare. However, the album was &quot;received with a lot of head scratching&quot;, according to Sasha, which he attributed to its unexpected mix of genres. The album did not feature the heavier &quot;club sound&quot; of Sasha&#x27;s previous mix albums, bearing a closer resemblance to ambient music. &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; generally received favorable reviews, though critics noted that it was not as consistent and well produced as his DJ mixes. Sasha himself described it as &quot;a selfish, slightly self-indulgent record&quot;, though he maintains that he is &quot;happy with it to this day&quot;. Some critics, however, called it &quot;sleepy&quot;; &quot;E!Online&quot; described it as being &quot;more in league with Yanni than Moby&quot;. To encourage listeners&#x27; interest, Sasha held an amateur remix contest for the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Wavy Gravy&quot;. Due to the contest&#x27;s success, Sasha released all the tracks from &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; on his website, so that fans could download and create their own versions.

After the release of &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot;, Sasha took the young DJ James Zabiela &quot;under his wing&quot;. He introduced Zabiela to the CDJ1000 turntable, and signed Zabiela to the Excession talent agency. The two toured the United States together, which extended Sasha&#x27;s influence to already-popular American DJs such as Kimball Collins.
In 2004, Sasha signed with Global Underground to produce another mix album. However, he found the process of creating a standard mix album unrewarding, and decided to apply his production and DJing skills to a mix compilation that resembled a &quot;real&quot; album—that is, one featuring original material. Sasha&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Involver&quot;, was &quot;a fusion of mix album and &quot;, consisting entirely of Sasha&#x27;s reworkings of tracks by other artists. &quot;I tried to take all the separate sounds to all the tracks [and recombine them]&quot;, he later explained, &quot;and it allowed me to mix the tracks together on a much deeper level.&quot; He accomplished this by sequencing the album using Ableton Live and Logic Pro. Ableton Live is a music loop-based software package that Sasha uses to engineer tracks in real-time, whereas he used Logic Pro primarily for premeditated edits to audio tracks.

In 2005, Sasha produced his next mix album, &quot;Fundacion NYC&quot;, based on his nights DJing in New York at the Crobar club. &quot;Fundacion NYC&quot; received positive reviews for its originality, though &quot;JIVE Magazine&quot; found it &quot;too complicated for the ear&quot;. Sasha is pleased with the album, and plans to make a series of Fundacion albums. The next year, Sasha released 10,000 copies of a June 2006 DJ set for sale using Instant Live, making him the first DJ to use Instant Live&#x27;s licensing and publishing services. In August 2007, Sasha announced the formation of his record label, Emfire, which will be the exclusive outlet for his new material in both vinyl and digital formats. Its first release was &quot;COMA&quot;, a collaborative track by a group of the same name, which features Sasha, Barry Jamieson, Charlie May, and Duncan Forbes. While continuing to regularly DJ, Sasha began work on another &quot;Involver&quot; mix and the next &quot;Fundacion&quot; mix. Sasha&#x27;s &quot;Invol2ver&quot; was released in September 2008, and &quot;Invol&lt;3r&quot; was released in March 2013.

=== Reuniting with Digweed ===
Though frequent performing kept them apart for several years, Sasha and Digweed announced that they would reunite for a few Australian performances. In November 2006, the duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates throughout 2007. In 2008, Sasha and Digweed kicked off an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference. The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750–1000 people) shows on weekdays. Sasha described their music as &quot;driving and dark&quot; with &quot;a little throwback of Twilo sounds&quot;.

Sasha runs a music studio and lives in New York City, and maintains a house in London. He brings his wife with him on his frequent tours. Sasha finds the constant touring to be physically tiring, though he also feels that he thrives on it. While fans may regard Sasha to be a DJ &quot;hero&quot;, he is uneasy with fame; Sasha considers himself &quot;shy at heart&quot; and is typically uncomfortable discussing his personal life. He has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is so busy with DJing and production that he rarely has any free time. However, he enjoys watching football, cooking, and sampling the cuisine of the countries he visits.
The movie &quot;New Emissions of Light &amp; Sound&quot; won the Best Original Score at the X-Dance Film Festival. The score was made up of new and previously unreleased tracks.

Sasha and Digweed have re-united again in recent years. The iconic duo Sasha &amp; John Digweed performed a Back to Back set at the Ministry of Sound in London on 24 March 2016. Shortly thereafter, the duo announced a list of tour dates for September 2016 to re-launch themselves in a series of gigs and performing Back to Back.

== Musical genres ==

Influenced by the early sound of The Haçienda, Sasha began his career playing records of the rough, danceable genre of acid house. By the early 1990s, he had moved towards a more dark European house music style, though by the time of his Shelley&#x27;s residency he had begun to experiment more with American house. His tastes further developed as he moved to Renaissance, and he began to incorporate the pop-based sounds of Moby, Spooky, and Leftfield. Sasha&#x27;s second Digweed collaboration, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, was described as &quot;epic house&quot;, and subsequent releases featured the spacey and atmospheric trance house sound of artists such as Sven Väth, Matt Darey, Tilt, and Armin Van Buuren. A rhythmic and bassy progressive house influence distinguished his &quot;Xpander EP&quot; and the mix albums of the late 1990s. At the time, Sasha&#x27;s music rotation included records by artists such as Space Manoeuvres, BT, and Breeder, and Sander Kleinenberg&#x27;s single &quot;My Lexicon&quot;.

With the 2000 album &quot;Communicate&quot;, the duo&#x27;s work moved towards a deeper and darker house music sound. The album featured tracks by Morel, Mainline, and Jimmy Van M. The focus shifted from the melodic themes of previous releases in favour of a stronger emphasis on the bassline. The Delta Heavy Tour and &quot;Airdrawndagger&quot; marked a dramatic shift in style, and reflected the influences of relaxed ambient and breakbeat music on Sasha&#x27;s work. These influences inspired the album&#x27;s strong melodies, occasional breakbeat loops, and limited use of percussion. &quot;Involver&quot; was primarily a fusion of the musical style of house and ambient breakbeat music characterised by UNKLE and Lostep. With 2005&#x27;s &quot;Fundacion&quot;, Sasha&#x27;s style was mostly progressive house and electro house music, with work by James Holden, Tiefschwarz, and Swayzak. With his success in progressive house, Sasha has commented that he feels people try to &quot;pigeon-hole&quot; him into playing that genre. Rather than calling it progressive house, Sasha considers his most recent material to be between house, trance, and breaks, though he has stated that he prefers not to associate himself with a specific genre of music.

== Techniques and technology ==

Sasha attributes his success to his technical skill and ability to &quot;connect with his dancers&quot;. During performances, he balances new and experimental material, while ensuring that &quot;the party is still rockin&#x27;&quot;. His spontaneity carries over to studio work; he typically has only a vague idea of the track listing when beginning work on a new mix album. Because of this, his albums never turn out quite as he expects.
Sasha is known for applying new music technologies to both his studio and live work. Both Sasha and Digweed used Pro Tools on Mac computers when mixing their compilation albums, and used turntables and records during live performances. For their remixes, however, they used an Atari ST—an obsolete personal computer from the early 1990s—with Notator, a music sequencer used for arranging audio tracks. For more recent albums such as &quot;Fundacion NYC&quot;, Sasha used Ableton Live for sequencing, partially because of Pro Tools&#x27; higher price. In live performances up to the late 1990s, Sasha performed exclusively using records. Before he started using the CDJ1000, a &quot;turntable&quot; used for CDs, he had his digital music specially cut to acetate records before each tour. Once he integrated CDs into his live act, Sasha operated CDJ1000s with Allen &amp; Heath mixers and FireworX.
Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, using it in tandem with turntables. Having explored its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live. He then co-developed the Maven controller, which he uses as a physical interface to the Live software. (DJing with a mouse alone, he has said, is &quot;not going to look right or feel right&quot;.) &quot;Fundacion NYC&quot; was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller. During DJ sets, clubbers often believe Sasha is playing new, unheard remixes; in fact, he is often playing modifications of tracks created in Ableton. Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton plugins, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins. For the first public performance of &quot;Involver&quot; material, he used a PowerBook running Ableton, but has since shifted to a setup that includes an iMac G5 and Ableton Live.

The Internet has affected how Sasha obtains and uses tracks for performance. While he once hunted through record shops for new records on a regular basis, Sasha now regularly receives new tracks from producers and labels via the Internet. These tracks, which number in the hundreds each week, are edited by Sasha and others for use in his live DJ sets. He still buys hundreds of records on vinyl, which are then recorded and converted into music files prior to being edited in Ableton by his team of engineers.

In February 2013, Sasha spoke to Resident Advisor about his decision to change from using Live and the Maven controller to a combination of Native Instruments&#x27; Traktor and CDs in his DJ sets. He felt that whilst Ableton Live had developed significantly as production software, it had become less successful as a DJing tool.

==Awards and nominations==
In 2005, the Grammy committee debated whether his mix compilation album, &quot;Involver&quot;, was eligible for nomination as Best Electronic/Dance Album. The Recording Academy decided that the album was eligible, but &quot;Involver&quot; did not receive a nomination. Sasha did receive a Grammy nomination for his remix of Felix da Housecat&#x27;s &quot;Watching Cars Go By&quot;, which was featured on &quot;Involver&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Stoddert (1751 – 18 December 1813) was the first United States Secretary of the Navy from 1 May 1798 to 31 March 1801.

==Early life and education==
Stoddert was born in Charles County, Maryland in 1751, the son of Captain Thomas Stoddert. He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and then worked as a merchant. He served as a captain in the Pennsylvania cavalry and later as secretary to the Continental Board of War during the American Revolutionary War. He was severely injured in the Battle of Brandywine and was subsequently released from active military service. In 1781, he married Rebecca Lowndes, daughter of Christopher Lowndes, a Maryland merchant, and they had eight children. They resided at the home of his father-in-law, Bostwick, located at Bladensburg, Maryland.

==Career==
In 1783, Stoddert established a tobacco export business in Georgetown, with business partners Uriah Forrest and John Murdock.

After George Washington was elected President, he asked Stoddert to purchase key parcels of land in the area that would become the nation&#x27;s capital before the formal decision to establish the federal city on the banks of the Potomac drove up prices there. Stoddert then transferred the parcels to the government. During the 1790s, he also helped found the Bank of Columbia to handle purchases of land in the District of Columbia for the federal government.

===Secretary of the Navy===

In May 1798, President John Adams appointed Stoddert, a loyal Federalist, to oversee the newly established Department of the Navy. As the first Secretary of the Navy, Stoddert soon found himself dealing with an undeclared naval war with France, which would come to be known as the Quasi-War. Stoddert realized that the infant U.S. Navy possessed too few warships to protect a far-flung merchant marine by using convoys or patrolling the North American coast. Instead, he concluded that the best way to defeat the French campaign against American shipping was by offensive operations in the Caribbean, where most of the French cruisers were based. Thus at the very outset of the conflict, the Department of the Navy adopted a policy of going to the source of the enemy&#x27;s strength. American successes during the conflict resulted from a combination of Stoddert&#x27;s administrative skill in deploying his limited forces and the initiative of his seagoing officers. Under Stoddert&#x27;s leadership, the reestablished United States Navy acquitted itself well and achieved its goal of stopping the depredations of French ships against American commerce.

Stoddert concerned himself with the Navy&#x27;s daily administration and operations and the service&#x27;s future strength. He established the first six navy yards and advocated building twelve 74 gun ships of the line. Congress initially approved construction of these ships in 1799. A design was prepared by Joshua Humphrey, who had prepared the initial designs for the 44 gun frigates of 1797 and lumber collected at the new Navy Yard.

Following the peace accord with France, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s personnel strength and the number of active vessels were reduced. The Jefferson Administration reduced active naval strength to three frigates (twelve were built between 1797 and 1800) and sold off or used the collected supplies in the Navy Yards for gunboat construction. This policy left the United States unprepared to respond to the later threats of the Barbary pirates and failed to prevent war with England in 1812.

Stoddert established the Navy Department Library due to instructions received from President Adams in a letter dated 31 March 1800.

==Post-Navy life==

He left office in March 1801 to return to commercial life. Following his term as Secretary of the Navy, Stoddert&#x27;s final years witnessed a decline in his fortunes: as Stoddert lost heavily in land speculation, Georgetown declined as a commercial center, and the Embargo and the War of 1812 brought American overseas trade to a halt. During this period, he lived at Halcyon House, on the corner at 3400 Prospect Street NW.

Stoddert died on the 18th of December 1813 and is buried in the graveyard at Addison Chapel, Seat Pleasant, Maryland.

<doc id="275701" wikidata="Q1274664" url="?curid=275701" title="Scaphe">
<text>The scaphe (; also known as a skaphe, scaphion (diminutive) or ) was a sundial said to have been invented by Aristarchus of Samos (3rd century BC). There are no original works still in existence by Aristarchus, but the adjacent picture is an image of what it might have looked like; only his would have been made of stone. It consisted of a hemispherical bowl which had a vertical gnomon placed inside it, with the top of the gnomon level with the edge of the bowl. Twelve gradations inscribed perpendicular to the hemisphere indicated the hour of the day.

== Inventor ==

Aristarchus of Samos (; , &quot;Aristarkhos&quot;; c. 310 – c. 230 BC) was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician who presented the first known model that placed the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it (see Solar System). He was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but he identified the &quot;central fire&quot; with the Sun, and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy.

== History ==

Greeks and Romans used large stone sundials based on &quot;a partial sphere or scaphe,” the shadow of the tip of the gnomon was the time-telling index. These dials could in theory tell time accurately if carved to a true sphere and correctly calibrated for a given site.
It took a skilled stone worker and a great deal of time and money to create a sundial. So only wealthy citizens could afford this elaborate contraption, and it was often for their villas or as donations for erection in the town forum. There was a need for cheaper dials that ordinary laborer could construct. But even if it were easier to make, the question of calibrating the scaphe still posed a problem.

The problem of projecting the three-dimensional scaphe dial upon a vertical or horizontal plane was addressed by a number of distinguished nineteenth-century mathematicians, each of whom presumably solved it to his own personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, their publications are so complex, long-winded, and obscure that they were virtually inaccessible to antiquaries and—it would appear from the replication of effort—even to their own (unacknowledged) colleagues. The spherical trigonometry required for the latter endeavor is really quite basic, and the calculations tedious rather than difficult. The availability of computer-generated graphics has, of course, completely altered the situation. A Fortran program was written for the VAX computer at the University of Leicester that enabled vertical or horizontal dials to be plotted for any latitude.

<doc id="275704" wikidata="Q908620" url="?curid=275704" title="Certification mark">
<text>A certification mark on a commercial product or service is a registered mark that enables its owner (&quot;certification body&quot;) to certify that the goods or services of a particular provider (who is not the owner of the certification mark) have particular properties, e.g., regional or other origin, material, quality, accuracy, mode of manufacture, being produced by union labor, etc. The standards to which the product is held are stipulated by the owner of the certification mark. 

There are essentially three general types of certification marks:
# certifying that goods or services had originated in a particular geographic region (e.g., Roquefort cheese);
# certifying that goods or services meet particular standards for quality, materials, methods of manufacturing, for example, tests by the Underwriter Laboratories;
# certifying that the manufacturer has met certain standards or belong to a certain organization or union (e.g., &quot;union made&quot; in clothing). 

The term &quot;certification mark&quot; is very recent, so while discussing historical certification marks, terms &quot;guild sign&quot;, &quot;quality mark&quot;, &quot;hallmark&quot;, and &quot;trade mark&quot; are used by researchers.

A certification mark indicates a property standard or regulation and a claim that the manufacturer has verified compliance with those standards or regulations. The specific specification, test methods, and frequency of testing are published by the standards organization. Certification listing does not necessarily guarantee fitness-for-use. Validation testing, proper usage, and field testing are often needed.

== Certification marks distinguished from other marks ==
Certification marks can be owned by independent companies absolutely unrelated in ownership to the companies, offering goods or rendering services under the particular certification mark.

=== Certification marks and trademarks ===
The USPTO states that a certification mark is &quot;a type of trademark&quot;. However, it &quot;is a special creature, created for a purpose uniquely different from that of a trademark or service mark&quot;, since:
* its owner cannot use it (it is used only by providers of certified goods or services);
* the mark does not define the source of the product. Instead, it identifies properties of the good or service (regional or other origin), material, quality, accuracy, etc.

However, what is meant by a collective trade marks or certification mark differs from country to country. However, a common feature of these types of marks is that they may be used by more than one person, as long as the users comply with the regulations of use or standards established by the holder. Those regulations or standards may require that the mark be used only in connection with goods that have a particular geographical origin or specific characteristics. In some jurisdictions, the main difference between collective marks and certification marks is that the former may only be used by members of an association, while certification marks may be used by anyone who complies with the standards defined by the holder of the mark. The holder, which may be a private or a public entity, acts as a certifier verifying that the mark is used according to established standards. Generally, the holder of a certification mark does not itself have the right to use the mark. 

For various reasons, usually relating to technical issues, certification marks are difficult to register, especially in relation to services. One practical workaround for trademark owners is to register the mark as an ordinary trademark in relation to quality control and similar services.

=== Certification marks and approvals ===
Certification is often mistakenly referred to as an &quot;approval&quot;, which is not true. Organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories, TÜV Rheinland, NTA Inc, and CSA International will test the products according to standard procedures and &quot;list&quot; them as compliant to that standard. They do not &quot;approve&quot; anything except the use of the mark to show that a product has been certified for compliance with such specific standard. Thus, for instance, a product certification mark for a fire door or for a spray fireproofing product does not signify its universal acceptance for use within a building. Approvals are up to the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), such as a municipal building inspector or fire prevention officer.

== Regulations ==
Trademark laws in countries, such as the United States, Australia, and others that provide for the filing of applications to register certificate marks also usually require the submission of regulations, which define a number of issues, including:

* People authorized to use the certification mark
* Characteristics that the certification mark certifies
* How the certification or standards tests these characteristics and supervises use of the mark
* What the dispute resolution procedures are

The main purpose of the regulations is to protect consumers against misleading practices.

== Examples ==
== International treaties and certification marks ==
Many jurisdictions have been required to amend their trade mark legislation to accommodate protection of certification marks under the TRIPs treaty.

Some jurisdictions recognise certification marks from other jurisdictions. This means good manufactured in one country may need not go through certification in another. One example is the European Union recognition of Australia and New Zealand marks based on an International treaty.

== Cases ==
Cases involving certification marks include:
* &quot;Re Legal Aid Board&#x27;s Trade Mark Application&quot; (unreported 3 October 2000, UK CA)
*the Sea Island Cotton case [1989]RPC 87

<doc id="275705" wikidata="Q195487" url="?curid=275705" title="Parry (fencing)">
<text>A parry is a fencing bladework maneuver intended to deflect or block an incoming attack.
==Execution==
To execute a parry, fencers strike the opponent&#x27;s foible, or the area near the tip of the blade, with their forte, or the part of the blade near the bell guard (or handle) of the weapon. This deflects the opponent&#x27;s blade away from them, protecting them and placing them in a good position to strike back. Approximations of the precise parries are made often during bouts, but are usually accurate enough to be classed as parries.

In épée, because of absence of priority rules (see right-of-way), a parry can be classed as any deflection of the blade that prevents the opponent&#x27;s attack from landing.

==Use==
The primary function of a parry is to prevent an opponent&#x27;s attack from landing. During a bout, parries are commenced from the &quot;en garde&quot; (neutral) position, when an opponent&#x27;s attack is considered threatening. 

A parry is usually followed by a &quot;riposte&quot;, which is an attack back against the original attacker. More advanced fencers can, instead of immediately riposting after successfully taking a parry, initiate a prise de fer (&quot;taking of the blade&quot;) in which they move the opponent&#x27;s blade to a different position and then hit them.

In foil and sabre, the rules governing the parry give it tactical significance as well: there is a rule known as priority, or &quot;right-of-way.&quot; The first fencer to commence an attack gains the priority.
If the attack results in a successful hit, only the fencer who has the priority is awarded a touch (regardless of whether the fencer without right of way has made a touch). A successful parry causes the attack to fail, and hence the priority is transferred to the defender (who is now the attacker). Taking a parry, therefore, means that the attacker is in an awkward position (with their arm extended and sometimes off-balance), having just committed to attacking, &quot;and&quot; the defender has the priority, as well as the best position to riposte, or strike after parrying.

==Classification==
There are eight parries in the classical systems of épée and foil fencing. Parries are classified based on three attributes: 1) The direction of the blade in relation to the hand: up or down. 2) The position of the blade in relation to the fencing line: inside or outside. 3) The rotation of the wrist in the hand holding the weapon: supinated (palm up) or pronated (palm down).

The parries are numbered from one to eight, with the numbers often referred to by the old French terms: &quot;prime, seconde, tierce, quarte, quinte, sixte, septième, octave.&quot;

For a right-handed fencer, the inside line is to the left, and the outside line is to the right; thus the parries &quot;prime&quot;, &quot;quarte&quot;, and &quot;septime&quot; deflect the opponent&#x27;s blade to the left (inside), while the parries &quot;seconde&quot;, &quot;tierce&quot;, &quot;sixte&quot;, and &quot;octave&quot; deflect the opponent&#x27;s blade to the right (outside), as shown.

The phrase &quot;counter-parry&quot; indicates a parry that is done in response to an opponent&#x27;s parry (that is, to block the riposte which follows up the opponent&#x27;s parry.) This is not to be confused with the contra- (or &quot;circular&quot;) parry, in which a semicircular motion is used to make a parry from the opposite side from the attack.

Because sabre parries defend against both cuts (attacks with the edge) as well as thrusts (attacks with the point), the sabre parries are slightly different from the corresponding épée or foil parries; most notably the parry 5 (&quot;quinte&quot;), which defends against a head cut in sabre (an attack that is not allowed in foil or épée).

<doc id="275707" wikidata="Q7796652" url="?curid=275707" title="Thoroughbred racing in Australia">
<text>Thoroughbred horse racing is a spectator sport in Australia, and gambling on horse races is a very popular pastime with A$14.3 billion wagered in 2009/10 with bookmakers and the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB). The two forms of Thoroughbred horseracing in Australia are flat racing, and races over fences or hurdles in Victoria and South Australia. Thoroughbred racing is the third most attended spectator sport in Australia, behind Australian rules football and rugby league, with almost two million admissions to 360 registered racecourses throughout Australia in 2009/10. Horseracing commenced soon after European settlement, and is now well-appointed with automatic totalizators, starting gates and photo finish cameras on nearly all Australian racecourses.

On an international scale Australia has more racecourses than any other nation. It is second to the United States in the number of horses starting in races each year. Australia is third, after the U.S. and Japan for the amount of prize money that is distributed annually.
==Racing industry==

Racing in Australia is administered by the Australian Racing Board, with each state&#x27;s Principal Racing Authority agreeing to abide by, and to enforce, the Australian Rules of Racing.

Besides being a spectator sport, horseracing is also an industry, which provides full- or part-time employment for almost 250,000 people, the equivalent of 77,000 jobs. About 300,000 people have a direct interest as individual owners of, or members of syndicates which own, the 30,000 horses in training in Australia. There are bookmakers, over 3,600 registered trainers and more than 1,000 jockeys, plus farriers and veterinarians involved at race meetings alone. Race meetings are oraganised by approximately 374 race clubs that conduct about 2,694 meetings on 360 racecourses around Australia for over $427,245,000 in prize money.

==Important races==
Public interest in Thoroughbred racing, especially during the main spring and autumn racing carnivals, has been growing in recent years with over 100,000 attracted to the running of the Melbourne Cup, the Victoria Derby, the VRC Oaks and the Champions Stakes race meets. The Golden Slipper Stakes, Caulfield Cup and W. S. Cox Plate are also major attractions.

==History==

===Horses===
The first horses that came to Australia arrived on the &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot; with the First Fleet on 26 January 1788. It is thought that they consisted of one stallion, one colt, three mares, and two fillies from Cape Town, South Africa. (Young) Rockingham was one of the first bloodhorses to be imported into Australia, . In 1802, the stallion Northumberland and an English mare were imported, followed shortly thereafter by Washington, a stallion from America. (Old) Hector, was an important Arabian horse that was imported to Australia and whose bloodlines have survived in Australian Thoroughbred pedigrees. Northumberland and Hector were the two leading sires in Australia until 1820. These sires and a number of other Arabian stallions contributed to the breeding up of the bloodhorse population prior to 1825. Manto, imported in 1825, was the first &quot;General Stud Book&quot; recorded Thoroughbred mare known by name to arrive in Australia. Her family is still producing winners. In 1826 the Thoroughbred stallion Peter Fin, and mares Cutty Sark and Spaewife, were imported.

The first recorded public auction of bloodstock took place in 1805. After the 1830s more English bred horses were imported for racing, as more racing clubs were formed in the country areas of New South Wales.

Malua, foaled in 1879, was the most versatile Australian Thoroughbred racehorse, winning classic races on the flat and the VRC Grand National Hurdle before becoming a good sire. The New Zealand bred Carbine was one of the early champions of the Australian turf, and was later inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame and the New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame. His descendants, the New Zealand-bred horses Phar Lap and Tulloch (the first horse to win more than £100,000 in Australia) also became champions of the Australian turf. Bernborough, Kingston Town, Heroic, Makybe Diva (bred in England) and Winx were other champions that have been inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. On 31 March 2011 Black Caviar was rated the best Thoroughbred racehorse in the world by Timeform (with a 135 rating) for the period of 1 October 2010 to 27 March 2011.

Australian Thoroughbred breeding has long been involved in the importation of horses, especially from Europe and later the US. Initially the British importations were identified on records with (imp) or an asterisk (*) added as a suffix to indicate that they were not locally bred. With the advent of importations from other countries and the use of shuttle stallions that stand at stud in Australia during the northern hemisphere&#x27;s winter, these suffixes were replaced by an abbreviated country suffix. These took the format of, e.g., (USA), (GB), (IRE) and (FR) etc.

Australian-bred stallions exported to America have proved very successful at stud there. Some of these exported horses include, Bernborough, Shannon, Sailor&#x27;s Guide, Noholme, Tobin Bronze and Royal Gem.

Annually, about 8,500 horses are retired from racing, many of which are slaughtered for an export market in human consumption.

Throughout its history, horseracing has become part of the Australian culture and has developed a rich and colourful language.

===Early race meetings and clubs===

Horseracing had become well established in and around Sydney by 1810. The first official race meeting was organised by officers of Governor Macquarie&#x27;s visiting 73rd Regiment and held at Hyde Park, Sydney in October 1810, starting on Monday 15th and continuing on the Wednesday and the Friday. The Australian Jockey Club (AJC) held its meetings at Homebush from 1842 to 1859, before moving to Randwick in 1860. The AJC has its headquarters at Randwick where it plays a major role in the regulation of the sport. The Sydney Turf Club (STC) was formed in 1943 and held races on the Rosehill Gardens track and at Canterbury. This club was the initiator of the world&#x27;s richest race for two-year-olds, the Golden Slipper Stakes. The Australian Jockey and Sydney Turf Clubs Merger Act 2010 merged the two clubs under the name of the Australian Turf Club.

In Victoria the first official races were held in March 1838 on a specially marked out course at Batman&#x27;s Hill in Melbourne. The Victorian Racing Club (VRC) was formed from the amalgamation in 1864 of the Victoria Jockey Club and Victoria Turf Club.

Queensland&#x27;s first recorded race meeting was held at Cooper&#x27;s Plains in 1843. The major race club, the Queensland Turf Club (QTC), was formed in 1863, followed by the Brisbane Amateur Turf Club (BATC) in 1923.

South Australia&#x27;s first meeting was held at Adelaide in 1843. The principal race club, the South Australian Jockey Club (SAJC), was founded in 1856.

Organised racing was first held in Tasmania in 1814 at Newtown, near Hobart. The Tasmanian Turf Club (TTC) was formed in 1871, but the major club, the Tasmanian Racing Club (TRC), was not established until 1874.

Thoroughbred racing commenced in Western Australia in 1836. The Western Australian Turf Club (WATC) was established in 1852.

By 1883, 192 country clubs were registered to race under Australian Jockey Club rules.

In the Northern Territory, the Darwin Turf Club was established in May 1955.

===Breeders and stud farms===
The early breeders of Australian bloodstock were men of historical significance such as Robert Campbell, William Lawson, John Macarthur, John Piper, Richard Rouse of Rouse Hill and D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth.

Charles Smith established Bungarribee stud at Doonside, New South Wales, shortly after 1830, which only had pure-bred English horses. It was Charles Smith who bred the great colonial stallion, Sir Hercules who was foaled in 1843.

James White (1828–1890), owner of Kirkham Stud, was one of the most successful owner/breeders in Australian racing with his horses winning two Melbourne Cups, six Victoria Derbies and five AJC Derbies.

The three eastern mainland states supply 85% of Australian racehorses with the Hunter Valley being the favoured region for thoroughbred horses in New South Wales. In Queensland the Darling Downs is the major nursery. Hurtle Fisher&#x27;s Maribyrnong Stud was a famous stud in Victoria where expensive imported horses were used until it was dispersed in 1866. The St Albans Stud at Geelong was established in the 1850s and was still operating over 100 years later. Tranquil Star was bred here and Briseis was bred, owned and trained by James Wilson at this stud.

The Widden Stud in the Hunter Valley, NSW was established by John Thompson in 1867. Since then Widden Stud has been home to some of the finest stallions and broodmares including the following who were all at various times Australia&#x27;s champion sire; Lochiel (four times leading sire), Grafton (four times), Maltster (five times), Bletchingly (three times), Vain (once) and Marscay (twice). Heroic, Ajax and Todman were other famous Widden stallions. The stud has had a seven generation unbroken chain of ownership under the Thompson family.

Percy Miller (1879–1948) in 1914 established Kia Ora Stud just east of Scone. Miller imported the leading sire, Magpie (GB) who ran second in the English 2,000 Guineas Stakes. This stallion sired Windbag, Amounis and Talking. Kia Ora Stud had the leading imported sires, Midstream and Delville Wood who sired champions, Shannon (exported to the United States), Delta, Hydrogen and Evening Peal etc., plus a superb band of brood mares.

Stanley Wootton exerted a major influence on Australian racing when he imported the stallion Star Kingdom, now recognised as the most influential sire line in this country. Wootton also bred the outstanding Biscay and Bletchingly.

===Jockeys===

Australian jockeys are some of the best in the world and were among the first in the world to experiment with the crouched riding style. In the late 19th century Tot Flood and James Barden pioneered this crouch style in Australia independently of the American, Tod Sloan, after whom the style was named. Australian jockeys have successfully ridden on racecourses across the world. Some of the notable jockeys include, Scobie Breasley (four times British champion jockey), Edgar Britt, Mick Dittman, Roy Higgins, George T. D. Moore, Nash Rawiller, Neville Sellwood, Harry White and Bill Williamson.

In the 1850s amateur &quot;ladies only&quot; events were held in Victoria, Australia but women were not permitted to ride as professional jockeys or on professional tracks. Although women jockeys were still barred from riding in the mid-20th century Wilhemena Smith rode as Bill Smith at north Queensland racecourses.

In the 1920s Hilda Thomas (b 1905) is reported to have raced in Western Australia, on special race-day granted permits, as she wasn&#x27;t eligible for a jockey&#x27;s licence . There&#x27;s little record of this except a 1927-28 West Australian Turf Guide, where she was named the jockey of an unplaced horse. Unofficial records suggest that her brother may have been given the placing in the records.
During 1974 the VRC permitted female jockeys to be registered for professional &quot;ladies only&quot; events. Pam O&#x27;Neill and Linda Jones, in 1979, were the first women jockeys that were licensed to compete in registered races against men.

===Trainers===
Historically, the most notable trainers in Australia are Bart Cummings (trainer of 12 Melbourne Cup winners) and Tommy Smith who had won 30 successive Sydney Trainers&#x27; Premierships prior to his death. Other successful trainers include Jack Denham, Lee Freedman, Colin Hayes, David Hayes, Etienne L. de Mestre, James Scobie and Gai Waterhouse. In recent years, Chris Waller and Darren Weir have experienced success.

In the 2015/16 Season, Weir broke John Hawkes&#x27; record for most winners in a season.

In 1962 Betty Lane applied to the AJC for a metropolitan trainer&#x27;s licence but was refused as &quot;it&#x27;s not our policy to license women.&quot; After the refusal she became a successful premiership winning trainer in the Western Districts of NSW, where she was permitted to train. In 1982 Betty Lane became the first woman trainer with a Number One Trainers Licence.

In 2019, Victoria Police raided properties owned by Darren Weir in Warrnambool and near Ballarat, and arrested Weir, 48, and two other men relating to the corruption of betting results and animal cruelty. Police found what was believed to be cocaine and four devices known as &quot;jiggers&quot;, which can deliver electric shocks. &quot;In relation to the conducted energy devices, or the jiggers, clearly the allegation is that they may be used against a horse with the aim of improving their performance on a particular race day&quot; Assistant Commissioner Neil Paterson said.

===Stud books and registrations===
The Stud Book of New South Wales by Fowler Boyd Price was published in 1859, and was the first official attempt to document the pedigrees of the colony&#x27;s bloodhorses. The Victorian Stud Book was then published in Volumes 1-2 which were edited by William Levey to the year 1864 and volumes 3-4 edited by William Cross Yuille to the year 1874. The Australian Stud Book (ASB) began in 1878 as a private venture by A. &amp; William C. Yuille, Melbourne bloodstock agents who published nine volumes. New Zealand horses were included in the ASB until Volume VII appeared in 1900. The copyright was sold in 1910 to the AJC and VRC who now administer matters concerning the breeding of racehorses.

The outstanding ASB online database contains the records of over 860,000 horses, which includes every Australian foal born since 1972. This database includes 28,000 winners of major races in Australia and around the world. A 3,000 plus pages, printed version of volume 42 of the ASB contains the breeding records of 43,000 mares and 70,000 of their named offspring.

In the 1880s it was decided that all Thoroughbreds in Australasia should have their official ages calculated from 1 August.

The Registrar of Racehorses controls the naming, registration, leasing and transfers of all horses racing in Australia. Racehorses must be registered to race, but do not have to be purebred Thoroughbreds in order to be registered and race in Australia. Prior to 1980 it was not uncommon to see a racehorse registered as &quot;by an unidentified sire out of a station mare&quot;. During 1980 it was regulated that horses without registered parents could not be officially named.

The registration of racing colours is also handled by the Registrar of Racehorses.

===EI outbreak===
Equine influenza (EI) was initially discovered in a metropolitan Sydney horse complex in late August 2007, and spread to many areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland. This immediately stopped all equine pursuits nationwide, but soon racing in those states without EI cases resumed. The entire racing industry was put under great pressure because of a lack of racing for Standardbreds and Thoroughbreds.

==Administration of racing in Australia==

===Australia===
Racing in the Australian continent is governed by the Australian Racing Board. This body supersedes the power of the principal clubs, which were once the sovereign body of racing in every state until government reforms introduced separate governing bodies for the industry. The board is constituted of the various principal racing bodies in each state. The board is directly responsible for establishing the rules of racing (subject to additional local rules), the establishment and maintenance of the pattern racing committees, responsible for grading races and allocating black type status, as well as establishing a number of advisory groups to attempt to maintain uniformity in procedures between states and establish an accepted national racing calendar.
===Victoria===
Victoria is considered to be the home of racing in Australia, with international races like the Melbourne Cup and Cox Plate. The governing body is Racing Victoria Limited. The principal club is the Victoria Racing Club, which races at Flemington; the two other metropolitan clubs are the Melbourne Racing Club, which races at Caulfield and Sandown, and the Moonee Valley Racing Club, home of the Weight for Age championship of Australasia, the Cox Plate. The state boasts many top-class provincial and country racecourses including Pakenham, Cranbourne, Mornington, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Mildura, Stony Creek, Wangaratta, Warrnambool, Moe and Tatura.

===New South Wales===
Racing in New South Wales is governed by Racing NSW. The principal club is the Australian Turf Club, which races at Randwick, Warwick Farm, Rosehill Gardens and Canterbury Park. The state&#x27;s major provincial tracks are Newcastle and Kembla Grange, which alternate their meetings every second Saturday. Other notable tracks include Hawkesbury, Gosford and Grafton which hosts the largest race carnival in Australia outside of a capital city.

===South Australia===
Racing in South Australia is governed by Thoroughbred Racing S.A. Limited. The principal club is the South Australian Jockey Club, which races at Morphettville (and previously Cheltenham until its closure in 2009, and Victoria Park until 2008). Additionally, the Oakbank Racing Club holds the highly popular Oakbank Easter Racing Carnival with its two meetings on Easter Saturday and Easter Monday.

===Queensland===
Racing in Queensland is governed by Racing Queensland, with the principal club being the Brisbane Racing Club, formed out of a merger between the Queensland Turf Club (Eagle Farm) and the Brisbane Turf Club (Doomben). The most significant Queensland race is the Stradbroke Handicap, held at Eagle Farm over 1,400 metres. The BRC hosts the vast majority of metropolitan meetings in Queensland. Outside of Brisbane, meetings are held each Saturday at the Gold Coast and Toowoomba racecourses. The Sunshine Coast Turf Club operates a considerable facility at Caloundra, Queensland. Country racing is also popular in Queensland, with several country cups attracting large crowds throughout the year - the most notable being the Roma Cup in November.

===Western Australia===

Racing in Western Australia is governed by Racing and Wagering Western Australia, which is a government-owned body. The main racing club, Western Australian Turf Club now known as Perth Racing, holds racing at Belmont Park and Ascot Racecourse. Other popular courses with feature races in Western Australia are Bunbury, Pinjarra, York, Geraldton, Albany, Kalgoorlie and Northam.

The most popular race is the Perth Cup, held each New Year&#x27;s Day at Ascot. There are three Group One (G1) races contended, being the Railway Stakes, the Kingston Town Classic, and the Winterbottom Stakes.

===Tasmania===
Racing in Tasmania is governed by the Tasmanian Thoroughbred Racing Council and the principal club is the Tasmanian Turf Club. There are Tasmanian meetings every Sunday usually alternating between Elwick Racecourse near Hobart, Tasman Park near Launceston and Spreyton, Devonport. Race meetings also occur at the King Island Racing Club

===Northern Territory===
Racing in the Northern Territory is now governed by Thoroughbred Racing NT (formerly the Darwin Turf Club, which races at Fannie Bay.)

===Australian Capital Territory===
Racing in the Australian Capital Territory is governed by the principal club, the Canberra Racing Club.

==Betting==
There are four main avenues for race betting in Australia. Licensed on-track bookmakers offer fixed-odds betting, mostly on wins and places. Off-track betting was traditionally controlled by the various state government through organisation called &quot;Totalisator Agency Boards&quot; (TAB), which offered mainly parimutuel betting - that is, the odds were not fixed but involved &quot;the house&quot; taking a fixed cut and distributing the remainder amongst people who made a winning bet. Many of these &quot;TABs&quot; have now been privatised, and many pubs now offer betting services linked to the privatised offshoots of the companies. In some parts of Australia there was a tradition of illegal off-course bookmaking, known as SP bookmaking. This became a large area of vice, intimately associated with police corruption and racetrack rigging. Several Royal Commissions investigated the practice, and there were many attempts to eradicate it. Once a common sight in suburban pubs and bars, the introduction of telephone and internet betting at fixed prices by licensed on-course bookmakers has made it largely redundant. Finally, there is online person to person exchange betting, where members set their own prices and pay a percentage of their winnings in commission.

In 1913 one of the major developments in race wagering, the automatic totalisator, which allowed the automatic calculation of race odds given betting patterns, was invented in Australia by George Julius (later Sir).

In recent years, corporate bookmakers operating online and through mobile apps have become increasingly popular through various specials, promotion and ease of use.

==Elite and black type racing in Australia==
The Australian Pattern Racing Committee is responsible for grading races under the auspices of the Australian Racing Board. Traditionally, until the late 1970s, a series of stakes races were recognised as black type but there was no grading of races within this grouping. Historically, handicaps have been extremely popular among Australian punters, owners and industry participants. As a result, a large number of handicap races still exist within the list of group and listed races. Small efforts have been made to downgrade handicaps and promote set weights and weight for age races however the strength of fields that most handicaps attract make them better punting races than possible under even conditions.

As the largest racing country in the world, Australia has 66 of the world&#x27;s 193 Group One races, recognised by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.

By tradition many state races have maintained higher gradings than they would otherwise be entitled to because of the poor quality of horses participating in them. The rapid growth in the Victorian and to a lesser extent, New South Wales racing carnivals has made the leading races of the other states less competitive in prize money and as a result prestige.

Given the self-interest of each state forming the Australian Racing Board, progress in properly grading races has been slow and controversy is often found in the decisions taken by the Pattern Racing Committee. In recent years, change has been occurring as the Pattern Racing Committee has taken a more scientific approach.

Criticism is also often made of a trend towards the promotion of sprint races over staying races. Many traditional staying races have been reduced in distance significantly over the last 30–40 years. Many parties have called for staying races to be given special dispensation in on-going reviews of race classifications to allow for a current lack of depth to encourage breeding and thus further depth in future.

The group 1 races (and selected other races) in Australia can generally be split into 3 groups, Australian races, state/city/track races and historically significant races.

<doc id="275709" wikidata="Q1024747" url="?curid=275709" title="Cabaret Voltaire (band)">
<text>Cabaret Voltaire were an English music group formed in Sheffield in 1973 and initially composed of Stephen Mallinder, Richard H. Kirk, and Chris Watson. Named for the Zürich nightclub that fostered the early Dada movement, the band are often characterized as among the most innovative and influential electronic acts of their era.

The band&#x27;s early work consisted of experimentation with DIY electronics and tape recorders, as well as Dada-influenced performance art, helping to pioneer industrial music in the mid-1970s. Finding an audience during the post-punk era, they gradually incorporated more conventional elements of synthpop, dance, house and funk styles. After Watson&#x27;s departure in 1981, the group continued as a two-piece until disbanding in 1994. Kirk revived the name as a solo project from 2009 until his death in 2021.

==History==
===Formation===
By the early 1970s, Chris Watson of Sheffield, England, began experimenting with electronic devices to make &quot;music without musical instruments.&quot; Inspired by Brian Eno of Roxy Music, and helped along by his work as a telephone engineer, Watson&#x27;s experimentation with tape loops evolved to include custom-built kit oscillators obtained by mail order by the time he met fellow Sheffield local and Eno devotee Richard Kirk. Kirk and Watson began exploring the intersection of technology and music, producing tapes loops to generate sound collages and unusual sound structures. Kirk began to add traditional instrumentation, including clarinet and guitar. In late 1973, they brought in Kirk&#x27;s friend Stephen Mallinder to provide vocals and bass guitar. Some of these early experiments were first documented on the Industrial Records cassette &quot;1974-1976&quot; (1980), then later on the triple album CD set &quot;Methodology &#x27;74/&#x27;78: The Attic Tapes&quot; (Mute 2002).

The band eventually turned to live performance, often sharing the bill with Joy Division, though much of their earliest public performance tended more towards being unconventional and provocative stunts rather than conventional shows. The trio would deploy to various parts of Sheffield with their portable tape recorders and play their experimental compositions in places as diverse as public toilets and on the streets from loudspeakers on the top of a friend&#x27;s van. This raucous and punkish attitude followed the band onstage to great effect; their first live concert in May 1975 ended in a fight between the band and the audience that sent Mallinder to hospital. In another incident, Mallinder was hospitalised with a chipped backbone after objects were thrown at the band. However, the arrival of punk rock brought a more accepting audience for their industrial, electronic sound and they were championed by Sheffield punk fanzine &quot;Gunrubber&quot; edited by Paul Bower of local band 2.3.

In 1977, Watson financed the establishment of the band&#x27;s own recording studio on the second floor of a building called the Western Works on Portobello Street in Sheffield. The &quot;Western Works&quot; studio served as the band&#x27;s studio for many years as well as providing a social gathering spot for the local Sheffield scene. Western Works produced some of the earliest recordings of pioneering local bands including Clock DVA, The Human League, and New Order.

===Emergence: &quot;Mix-Up&quot; to &quot;Red Mecca&quot; (1979–1981)=== 
In 1978, Cabaret Voltaire signed to Rough Trade Records. Manchester-based Factory Records had offered to sign the band, and Throbbing Gristle were also interested in signing the band to Industrial Records, but it was with an offer of a four-track Revox tape machine (in lieu of an advance) that Rough Trade secured the deal. With Rough Trade, they released several acclaimed, musically experimental singles and EPs, including &quot;Extended Play&quot; and &quot;Nag Nag Nag&quot;, and albums such as &quot;Three Mantras&quot;, &quot;The Voice of America&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Red Mecca&quot; in 1981.

In the 27 June 1978 edition of &quot;NME&quot;, Andy Gill said &quot;I firmly believe Cabaret Voltaire will turn out to be one of the most important new bands to achieve wider recognition this year. Wait and see&quot;. Subsequently, &quot;Nag Nag Nag&quot; sold 10,000 copies, despite poor reviews, and reached as far afield as France and Belgium, while the debut album &quot;Mix-Up&quot; reached number 12 on the UK Indie charts. Their success continued with &quot;The Voice of America&quot; and &quot;Red Mecca&quot;, reaching number three and number one on the UK Indie charts respectively.

===Watson departs, Kirk and Mallinder continue (1981–1982)===
Watson left the band in 1981 to work for Tyne Tees Television and went on to found The Hafler Trio with Andrew M. McKenzie before becoming a BBC sound engineer and then a soloist. On 25 June 1981, John Peel broadcast a session on the BBC, recorded previously by the band, which included four songs: &quot;Black Mask&quot;, &quot;Greensborough&quot;, &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; and &quot;Jazz the Glass&quot;.

During this time, Cabaret Voltaire toured Europe, Japan, and the United States without major record label support, releasing &quot;Hai!&quot;, a live album recorded in Japan, in 1982.

In late 1982, Cabaret Voltaire decided consciously to turn in a more commercial direction. Introduced by New Order to the American dance music producer John Robie, Cabaret Voltaire enlisted him to remix &quot;Yashar&quot;, a track from their 1982 album &quot;2x45&quot;. The 12-inch single was released by Factory Records in May 1983, and received extensive play in dance clubs.

===The Virgin years: &quot;The Crackdown&quot; to &quot;The Covenant&quot; (1983–1985)===
In 1983, Stevo Pearce signed the duo to his Some Bizzare label and leveraged a licensing deal with Virgin. The £50,000 advance from Some Bizzare allowed Kirk and Mallinder to significantly improve their operation at Western Works, but came with the stipulation of having to record their next LP in London and making certain production changes to their music. The relationship with Some Bizzare and Virgin resulted in greater exposure and promotion for the band. In August 1983, the album &quot;The Crackdown&quot; was released and reached number 31 in the UK Albums Chart – over 60 places higher than their previous (and, at the time, only) chart placement. The album&#x27;s single for &quot;Just Fascination&quot; peaked at number 74.

In 1984, the singles &quot;Sensoria&quot; and &quot;James Brown&quot; from the album &quot;Micro-Phonies&quot; charted on the UK Indie Chart, as well as getting play in the underground dance scene. The 12&quot; mix of &quot;Sensoria&quot;, co-produced by Robin Scott of the new wave band M, was a vastly improved melding of two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Sensoria&quot; and &quot;Do Right&quot;. The video for the single was directed by Peter Care and earned significant air time and acclaim including a Los Angeles Times Best Video award for 1985.

1985 proved to be a busy year for the band with numerous releases as well as an American tour. &quot;Gasoline in your Eye&quot; was released that year, which was a compendium of singles videos along with prototype footage for the band&#x27;s unfinished film &quot;Earthshaker&quot; and other band-filmed footage put to unreleased Cabaret Voltaire music. A double 12&quot; release was derived from the video and released as &quot;Drinking Gasoline&quot;. The band rounded-out 1985 with a new album, &quot;The Covenant, The Sword and the Arm of the Lord&quot; and its single, &quot;I Want You,&quot; which would be the last releases for the band on Virgin.

===The EMI years begin: &quot;Code&quot; and an identity crisis (1986-1987)===
By 1986, Virgin offered to extend Cabaret Voltaire&#x27;s record contract, but EMI group signalled an intent to invest more in the group and the lure of increased resources through a major label proved irresistible. One of these resources was access to producer Adrian Sherwood, who produced 1987&#x27;s &quot;Code&quot; and its singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Argue&quot; and &quot;Here to Go&quot;. &quot;Code&quot; also featured additional musicians including on guitar and Mark Brydon on bass.

While 1987 proved to be a successful year musically, in other respects the band was faltering. The decision was made to abandon the original Western Works studio after a series of break-ins and the emergence of financial issues due to accounting problems from years before threatened to force a sale of their new studio. Additionally, Mallinder moved to London and took on more of a socialite lifestyle while Kirk remained in Sheffield. This formed a schism between the band members characterized by the extroverted Mallinder and the reluctant Kirk that was a mirror of the identity crisis of an experimental/unconventional band on the verge of going pop.

===Solo excursions and house/techno era (1988–1994)===
Prior to 1988, each member of Cabaret Voltaire had released several solo recordings under their own names, and Kirk had worked with Peter Hope of The Box on an album and single. The band&#x27;s physical separation — with Kirk in Sheffield and Mallinder in London — and the burgeoning house and acid house movements opened new opportunities for solo collaborations. In 1988, Mallinder collaborated with Robert Gordon, co-founder of Warp Records, and David Ball of Soft Cell on a one-off house album under the name Love Street, and Kirk produced a solo acid house 12&quot; as Wicky Wacky.

The band&#x27;s interest in house music created new connections for the band in America. After trying in vain to contact New York producer Todd Terry, an introduction was made by an Atlantic Records executive to Chicago house producer Marshall Jefferson. The introduction led to a cross-Atlantic collaboration, with the members of Cabaret Voltaire spending a month in Chicago to produce material for their 1990 album &quot;Groovy, Laidback and Nasty&quot;. Marshall brought numerous guest artists into the album&#x27;s production including Ten City and Kym Mazelle, and the lead single from the album — &quot;Hypnotised&quot; — featured remix talent from Fon Force (Mark Brydon and Robert Gordon), A Guy Called Gerald, and Daniel Miller.

Despite the newfound energy and direction, the band amassed significant debt under EMI and the label dropped Cabaret Voltaire from their roster. Released from the label, Kirk began a series of projects between 1990 and 1992, including Sweet Exorcist with Richard Barratt, The Technocrats with Ralf Dörper, XON with Robert Gordon, Citrus with Steve Cobby, and solo as Sandoz.

Cabaret Voltaire returned to Les Disques Du Crépuscule to release the &quot;Body and Soul&quot; album in 1991. The album featured a more minimal sound than &quot;Groovy, Laidback and Nasty&quot; and was the last Cabaret Voltaire release to feature Mallinder on vocals. In 1991, the band entered an agreement with Mute Records to release new and past works from the band&#x27;s own Plastex label imprint in the US. Between 1992 and 1994, the band released a trio of instrumental works.

===Parting ways and rumours of revival (1995–2009)===
In 1995, Mallinder moved to Perth, Australia, and effectively left Cabaret Voltaire in order to step away from the commercial and financial pressures of what had become of his music career. Opting instead to make music with less emphasis on product, Mallinder set up his own music company in Perth, OffWorld Sounds, while he pursued an academic career. Eventually Mallinder returned to music collaboration with a number of projects including Sassi &amp; Loco and Kuling-Bros. Mallinder also contributed to synthesizer and programming on Shaun Ryder&#x27;s solo album &quot;Amateur Night at the Big Top&quot;.

Meanwhile, Kirk remained in England and continued in the vein of where Cabaret Voltaire left off through the remainder of the &#x27;90s and into the 2000s with more releases under his own name, as Sandoz, and as a new solo project, Electronic Eye.

Hopes of a Cabaret Voltaire reunion were raised when Kirk dropped hints in the late 1990s, the most significant being in the notes of a reissue of &quot;Radiation&quot;, but this never happened. In a special &#x27;Depeche Mode/History of Electro-pop&#x27; edition of &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Kirk suggested he was still considering resurrecting the Cabaret name, but this time he planned to &quot;Get some young people involved&quot;.

===Kirk revives the band (2009–2021)===
In 2009, Kirk resurrected the Cabaret Voltaire name and released an album with New Zealand band Kora called &quot;Kora! Kora! Kora!&quot; and another with Sheffield band The Tivoli called &quot;National Service Rewind&quot;. The new material was recorded at Western Works studios.

In July 2014, Berlin Atonal reported that Cabaret Voltaire were to perform at the festival. The performance – the first in twenty years – saw a set list of all new material performed by a line-up &quot;consisting solely of machines, multi-screen projections and Richard H. Kirk&quot;, the lone remaining member of the &#x27;group&#x27;.

In early August 2016, Cabaret Voltaire performed an hour long set of otherwise unreleased material at the Dekmantel festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Circa 2017, the Coachella Festival made a significant offer to Kirk to reform the original Cabaret Voltaire for a reunion show. Kirk refused, stating that &quot;Cabaret Voltaire was always about breaking new ground and moving forward. It would be so sad to see it as a nostalgia act.&quot;

In August 2020, Cabaret Voltaire announced a new studio album &quot;Shadow of Fear&quot;. Backed by the first single &quot;Vasto,&quot; the album was released on 20 November 2020. These are the first strictly Cabaret Voltaire recordings with Richard H. Kirk as the group&#x27;s sole member. These were followed in 2021 by the release of a new EP, &quot;Shadow of Funk&quot;, and two albums, &quot;Dekadrone&quot; and &quot;BN9Drone&quot;.

Richard Kirk died in September 2021 at the age of 65.

==Legacy and influence==
New Order lead singer and guitarist, Bernard Sumner, said that Cabaret Voltaire influenced his songwriting, having helped him understand that one &quot;could make music without guitars&quot;. In Alan Cross&#x27;s 2012 biography of Skinny Puppy, Cabaret Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;industrial-grade thumping and noise terrorism&quot; was cited as an influence on the band. In 2012, Trent Reznor stated that the Cabaret Voltaire was a major influence when working on his debut studio album with How to Destroy Angels. Others who have cited Cabaret Voltaire as an influence include Horrid Red, Fluke and Front Line Assembly. Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore once listed Cabaret Voltaire among his favourite bands. David J of Bauhaus named the group as one of the &quot;few bands on the [post-punk] scene at the time to whom we related&quot;.

As well as helping pioneer industrial music in the 1970s, Cabaret Voltaire have been considered influential on the industrial techno movement of the 1990s. Alain Jourgensen, while working with the band on the Acid Horse project, observed the irony of Cabaret Voltaire&#x27;s turn towards house music circa 1989 as closing the circle on a genre they helped influence:
Jourgensen&#x27;s assertion was an echo of Mick Fish&#x27;s observation in his 1989 book &quot;Cabaret Voltaire: The Art of the Sixth Sense&quot;:

&quot;Alternative Press&quot; included Cabaret Voltaire in their 1996 list of &quot;100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.&quot;

The experimental Sensoria Music &amp; Film Festival is named after the Cabaret Voltaire song, and has become an annual event held in Sheffield since 2008.

<text>A cleanroom or clean room is an engineered space that maintains a very low concentration of airborne particulates. It is well isolated, well controlled from contamination, and actively cleansed. Such rooms are commonly needed for scientific research and in industrial production for all nanoscale processes, such as semiconductor device manufacturing. A cleanroom is designed to keep everything from dust to airborne organisms or vaporised particles away from it, and so from whatever material is being handled inside it.

A cleanroom can also prevent the escape of materials. This is often the primary aim in hazardous biology, nuclear work, pharmaceutics and virology.

Cleanrooms typically come with a cleanliness level quantified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a predetermined molecule measure. The ambient outdoor air in a typical urban area contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm and bigger, equivalent to an ISO 9 certified cleanroom. By comparison, an ISO 14644-1 level 1 certified cleanroom permits no particles in that size range, and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller. Semiconductor facilities often get by with level 7 or 5, while level 1 facilities are exceedingly rare.

==History==
The modern cleanroom was invented by American physicist Willis Whitfield. As an employee of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960. Prior to Whitfield&#x27;s invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable airflows. Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered airflow to flush out impurities. Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield&#x27;s modern cleanroom had generated more than US$50 billion in sales worldwide (approximately $ billion today).

By mid-1963, more than 200 U.S. industrial plants had such specially constructed facilities—then using the terminology “White Rooms,” “Clean Rooms,” or “Dust-Free Rooms”—including the Radio Corporation of America, McDonnell Aircraft, Hughes Aircraft, Sperry Rand, Sylvania Electric, Western Electric, Boeing, and North American Aviation. RCA began such a conversion of part of its Cambridge, Ohio facilities in February 1961. Totalling 70,000 square feet, it was used to prepare control equipment for the Minuteman ICBM missiles.

The majority of the integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley were made by three companies: MicroAire, PureAire, and Key Plastics. These competitors made laminar flow units, glove boxes, cleanrooms and air showers, along with the chemical tanks and benches used in the &quot;wet process&quot; building of integrated circuits. These three companies were the pioneers of the use of Teflon for airguns, chemical pumps, scrubbers, water guns, and other devices needed for the production of integrated circuits. William (Bill) C. McElroy Jr. worked as an engineering manager, drafting room supervisor, QA/QC, and designer for all three companies, and his designs added 45 original patents to the technology of the time. McElroy also wrote a four-page article for MicroContamination Journal, wet processing training manuals, and equipment manuals for wet processing and cleanrooms.

==Overview==
A cleanroom is a necessity in the manufacturing of semiconductors, rechargeable batteries, pharmaceutical products, and any other field that is highly sensitive to environmental contamination.

Cleanrooms can range from the very small to the very large. On the one hand, a single-user laboratory can be built to cleanroom standards within several square meters, and on the other, entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. Between the large and the small, there are also modular cleanrooms. They have been argued to lower costs of scaling the technology, and to be less susceptible to catastrophic failure.

With such a wide area of application, not every cleanroom is the same. For example, the rooms utilized in semiconductor manufacturing need not be sterile (i.e., free of uncontrolled microbes), while the ones used in biotechnology usually must be. Vice versa, operating rooms need not be absolutely pure of nanoscale inorganic salts, such as rust, while nanotechnology absolutely requires it. What then is common to all cleanrooms is strict control of airborne particulates, possibly with secondary decontamination of air, surfaces, workers entering the room, implements, chemicals, and machinery.

Sometimes particulates exiting the compartment are also of concern, such as in research into dangerous viruses, or where radioactive materials are being handled.

== Basic construction ==

First, outside air entering a cleanroom is filtered and cooled by several outdoor air handlers using progressively finer filters to exclude dust.

Within, air is constantly recirculated through fan units containing high-efficiency particulate absorbing filters (HEPA), and/or ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filters to remove internally generated contaminants. Special lighting fixtures, walls, equipment and other materials are used to minimize the generation of airborne particles. Plastic sheets can be used to restrict air turbulence if the cleanroom design is of the laminar airflow type.

Air temperature and humidity levels inside a cleanroom are tightly controlled, because they affect the efficiency and means of air filtration. If a particular room requires low enough humidity to make static electricity a concern, it too will be controlled by, e.g., introducing controlled amounts of charged ions into the air using a corona discharge. Static discharge is of particular concern in the electronics industry, where it can instantly destroy components and circuitry.

Equipment inside any cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination. The selection of material for the construction of a cleanroom should not generate any particulates; hence, monolithic epoxy or polyurethane floor coating is preferred. Buffed stainless steel or powder-coated mild steel sandwich partition panels and ceiling panel are used instead of iron alloys prone to rusting and then flaking. Corners like the wall to wall, wall to floor, wall to ceiling are avoided by providing coved surface, and all joints need to be sealed with epoxy sealant to avoid any deposition or generation of particles at the joints, by vibration and friction. Many cleanrooms have a &quot;tunnel&quot; design in which there are spaces called &quot;service chases&quot; that serve as air plenums carrying the air from the bottom of the room to the top so that it can be recirculated and filtered at the top of the cleanroom.

=== Airflow principles ===
Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent airflow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, airflow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar airflow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar airflow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non-unidirectional, airflow uses both laminar airflow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down stringent guidelines and limits to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products. Plenums between air handlers and fan filter units, along with sticky mats, may also be used.

In addition to air filters, cleanrooms can also use ultraviolet light to disinfect the air. UV devices can be fitted into ceiling light fixtures and irradiate air, killing potentially infectious particulates, including 99.99 percent of airborne microbial and fungal contaminants. UV light has previously been used to clean surface contaminants in sterile environments such as hospital operating rooms. Their use in other cleanrooms may increase as equipment becomes more affordable. Potential advantages of UV-based decontamination includes a reduced reliance on chemical disinfectants and the extension of HVAC filter life.

=== Cleanrooms of different kinds ===

Some cleanrooms are kept at a positive pressure so if any leaks occur, air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in. This is most typically the case in semiconductor manufacturing, where even minute amounts of particulates leaking in could contaminate the whole process, while anything leaking out . The opposite is done, e.g., in the case of high-level bio-laboratories that handle dangerous bacteria or viruses; those are always held at negative pressure, with the exhaust being passed through high-efficiency filters, and further sterilizing procedures. Both are still cleanrooms because the particulate level inside is maintained within very low limits.

Some cleanroom HVAC systems control the humidity to such low levels that extra equipment like air ionizers are required to prevent electrostatic discharge problems. This is a particular concern within the semiconductor business, because static discharge can easily damage modern circuit designs. On the other hand, active ions in the air can harm exposed components as well. Because of this, most workers in high electronics and semiconductor facilities have to wear conductive boots while working. Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes, with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a cleanroom suit, including the necessary machinery.

In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous, the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower. An anteroom (known as a &quot;gray room&quot;) is used to put on cleanroom clothing. This practice is common in many nuclear power plants, which operate as low-grade inverse pressure cleanrooms, as a whole.

Recirculating vs. one pass cleanrooms

Recirculating cleanrooms return air to the negative pressure plenum via low wall air returns. The air then is pulled by HEPA fan filter units back into the cleanroom. The air is constantly recirculating and by continuously passing through HEPA filtration removing particles from the air each time. Another advantage of this design is that air conditioning can be incorporated.

One pass cleanrooms draw air from outside and pass it through HEPA fan filter units into the cleanroom. The air then leaves through exhaust grills. The advantage of this approach is the lower cost. The disadvantages are comparatively shorter HEPA fan filter life, worse particle counts than a recirculating cleanroom, and that it cannot accommodate air conditioning.

== Aseptic Practices/Processing ==
Aseptic practices are critical in environments where contamination control is paramount, particularly in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Aseptic processing involves maintaining a sterile environment to prevent the introduction of contaminants during the manufacturing of products, such as sterile injectable medications and sterile medical equipment. This requires stringent control over personnel behavior, equipment sterilization, and the cleanroom environment.

There are different classifications for aseptic or sterile processing cleanrooms. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) classifies cleanrooms into four grades (A, B, C, and D) based on their cleanliness level, particularly the concentration of airborne particles and viable microorganisms.

== Operating procedure ==

In order to minimize the carrying of particulate by a person moving into the cleanroom, staff enter and leave through airlocks (sometimes including an air shower stage) and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.

Common materials such as paper, pencils, and fabrics made from natural fibers are often excluded because they shed particulates in use.

Particle levels are usually tested using a particle counter and microorganisms detected and counted through . Polymer tools used in cleanrooms must be carefully determined to be chemically compatible with cleanroom processing fluids as well as ensured to generate a low level of particle generation.

When cleaning, only special mops and buckets are used. Cleaning chemicals used tend to involve sticky elements to trap dust, and may need a second step with light molecular weight solvents to clear. Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and is easy to clean.

A cleanroom is as much a process and a meticulous culture to maintain, as it is a space as such.

=== Personnel contamination of cleanrooms===

The greatest threat to cleanroom contamination comes from the users themselves. In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, control of microorganisms is important, especially microorganisms likely to be deposited into the air stream from skin shedding. Studying cleanroom microflora is of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel to assess changes in trends. Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the &quot;norm&quot; such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices.

In assessing cleanroom microorganisms, the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower number. Common bacterial genera include &quot;Micrococcus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus&quot;, and fungal genera include &quot;Aspergillus&quot; and &quot;Penicillium&quot;.

== Cleanroom classification and standardization ==

Cleanrooms are classified according to the number and size of particles permitted per volume of air. Large numbers like &quot;class 100&quot; or &quot;class 1000&quot; refer to FED-STD-209E, and denote the number of particles of size 0.5 μm or larger permitted per cubic foot of air. The standard also allows interpolation; for example SNOLAB is maintained as a class 2000 cleanroom.

A discrete, light-scattering airborne particle counter is used to determine the concentration of airborne particles, equal to and larger than the specified sizes, at designated sampling locations.

Small numbers refer to ISO 14644-1 standards, which specify the decimal logarithm of the number of particles 0.1 μm or larger permitted per m3 of air. So, for example, an ISO class 5 cleanroom has at most 105 particles/m3.

Both FS 209E and ISO 14644-1 assume log-log relationships between particle size and particle concentration. For that reason, zero particle concentration does not exist. Some classes do not require testing some particle sizes, because the concentration is too low or too high to be practical to test for, but such blanks should not be read as zero.

Because 1 m3 is about 35 ft3, the two standards are mostly equivalent when measuring 0.5 μm particles, although the testing standards differ. Ordinary room air is around class 1,000,000 or ISO 9.

=== ISO 14644-1 and ISO 14698 ===
ISO 14644-1 and ISO 14698 are non-governmental standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The former applies to cleanrooms in general (see table below), the latter to cleanrooms where biocontamination may be an issue. Since the strictest standards have been achieved only for space applications, it is sometimes difficult to know whether they were achieved in vacuum or standard conditions.

ISO 14644-1 defines the maximum concentration of particles per class and per particle size with the following formula

formula_1

Where formula_2 is the maximum concentration of particles in a volume of 1mformula_3 of airborne particles that are equal to, or larger, than the considered particle size which is rounded to the nearest whole number, using no more than three significant figures, formula_4 is the ISO class number, formula_5 is the size of the particle in formula_6m and 0.1 is a constant expressed in formula_6m. The result for standard particle sizes is expressed in the following table.

===US FED STD 209E===
US FED-STD-209E was a United States federal standard. It was officially cancelled by the General Services Administration on November 29, 2001, but is still widely used.

Current regulating bodies include ISO, USP 800, US FED STD 209E (previous standard, still used).

* Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) created in Nov. 2013 in response to drug compounding deaths and serious adverse events. 
* The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) created specific guidelines and policies for human compounding.
** 503A addresses compounding by state or federally licensed facility by licensed personnel (pharmacist/ physicians)
** 503B pertaining to outsourcing facilities need direct supervision from a licensed pharmacist and do not need to be a licensed pharmacy. Facility is licensed through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

===EU GMP classification===
EU GMP guidelines are more stringent than others, requiring cleanrooms to meet particle counts at operation (during manufacturing process) and at rest (when manufacturing process is not carried out, but room AHU is on).


===BS 5295===
BS 5295 is a British Standard.
BS 5295 Class 1 also requires that the greatest particle present in any sample can not exceed 5 μm. BS 5295 has been superseded, withdrawn since the year 2007 and replaced with &quot;BS EN ISO 14644-6:2007&quot;.

=== USP &lt;800&gt; standards ===
USP 800 is a United States standard developed by the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) with an effective date of December 1, 2019.

== Ramifications and further applications ==

In hospitals, theatres are similar to cleanrooms for surgical patients&#x27; operations with incisions to prevent any infections for the patient.

In another case, severely immunocompromised patients sometimes have to be held in prolonged isolation from their surroundings, for fear of infection. At the extreme, this necessitates a cleanroom environment. The same is the case for patients carrying airborne infectious diseases, only they are handled at negative, not positive pressure.

Since larger cleanrooms are very sensitive controlled environments upon which multibillion-dollar industries depend, sometimes they are even fitted with numerous seismic base isolation systems to prevent costly equipment malfunction.

<text>Caveat emptor (; from &quot;caveat&quot;, &quot;may he/she beware&quot;, a subjunctive form of &quot;cavēre&quot;, &quot;to beware&quot; + &quot;ēmptor&quot;, &quot;buyer&quot;) is Latin for &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot;. It has become a proverb in English. Generally, &quot;caveat emptor&quot; is the contract law principle that controls the sale of real property after the date of closing, but may also apply to sales of other goods. The phrase &quot;caveat emptor&quot; and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arises from the fact that buyers typically have less information than the seller about the good or service they are purchasing. This quality of the situation is known as &#x27;information asymmetry&#x27;. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.

It is a short form of &quot;Caveat emptor, quia ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit&quot; (&quot;Let a purchaser beware, for he ought not to be ignorant of the nature of the property which he is buying from another party.&quot;) I.e. the buyer should assure himself that the product is good and that the seller had the right to sell it, as opposed to receiving stolen property.

A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding warranty, such as a guarantee of satisfaction.

== Explanation ==
Under the principle of &quot;caveat emptor&quot;, the buyer could not recover damages from the seller for defects on the property that rendered the property unfit for ordinary purposes. The only exception was if the seller actively concealed latent defects or otherwise made material misrepresentations amounting to fraud.

Before statutory law, the buyer had no express warranty ensuring the quality of goods. In the UK, common law requires that goods must be &quot;fit for the particular purpose&quot; and of &quot;merchantable quality&quot;, per Section 15 of the Sale of Goods Act but this implied warranty can be difficult to enforce and may not apply to all products. Hence, buyers are still advised to be cautious.

==By country==
=== United States ===

==== Real estate ====
The modern trend in the U.S. is that the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose applies in the real-estate context to only the sale of new residential housing by a builder-seller and that the &quot;caveat emptor&quot; rule applies to all other real-estate sale situations (e.g. homeowner to buyer). Other jurisdictions have provisions similar to this.

==== Chattel property ====

Under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the sale of new goods is governed by the &quot;perfect-tender&quot; rule unless the parties to the sale expressly agree in advance to terms equivalent to &quot;caveat emptor&quot; (such as describing the goods as sold &quot;as is&quot; and/or &quot;with all faults&quot;) or other limitations such as the below-discussed limitations on remedies. The perfect-tender rule states that if a buyer who inspects new goods with reasonable promptness discovers them to be &quot;nonconforming&quot; (failing to meet the description provided or any other standards reasonably expectable by a buyer in his/her situation) and does not use the goods or take other actions constituting acceptance of them, the buyer may promptly return or refuse to accept (&quot;reject&quot;) them and demand that the defect be remedied (&quot;cured&quot;). When goods fitting the same description and expectations are available for sale (&quot;e.g.&quot;, when the vendor has other instances of the same mass-produced merchandise in stock inventory), either the vendor or the buyer may insist on an &quot;even exchange&quot; for other, &quot;conforming&quot; instances of the product. When conforming goods are not available in stock but are available for the dealer to purchase (usually on the open or &quot;spot&quot; market), the buyer may require that the seller obtain the goods elsewhere, even at a higher price, with the seller having to incur a loss equivalent to the price difference. If the vendor still does not or cannot provide the goods and the dispute proceeds to litigation (as opposed to renegotiation or settlement), then as in all cases of vendor breaches of contract, the buyer may recover only the damages that s/he would have suffered had s/he taken all feasible steps to minimize (&quot;mitigate&quot;) his/her damages suffered.

As a default rule, the perfect-tender rule may be &quot;contracted around&quot; in ways that specify or limit a buyer&#x27;s remedies (and that accordingly reduce the market price that rational buyers are willing to pay for the goods). In many cases, the vendor will not provide a refund but will provide store credit. In the cases of software, movies, and other copyrighted material, many vendors will offer only a direct exchange for another copy of the same title, with the effect that the initial transfer or license of intellectual-property rights is preserved. Most stores require proof of purchase and impose time limits on exchanges or refunds. Some larger chain stores, such as F.Y.E., Staples, Target, or Walmart, will, however, do exchanges or refunds at any time, with or without proof of purchase, although they usually require a form of picture identification and place per-transaction and/or per-person quantity or dollar limitations on such returns.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, consumer law has moved away from the &quot;caveat emptor&quot; model, with laws passed that have enhanced consumer rights and allow greater leeway to return goods that do not meet legal standards of acceptance. Consumer purchases are regulated by the Consumer Rights Act 2015, whilst business-to-business purchases are regulated by the Sale of Goods Act 1979.

In the UK, consumers have the right to a full refund for faulty goods. However, traditionally, many retailers allow customers to return goods within a specified period (typically two weeks to two months) for a full refund or an exchange, even if there is no fault with the product. Exceptions may apply for goods sold as damaged or to clear.

Goods bought through &quot;distance selling,&quot; for example online or by phone, also have a statutory &quot;cooling off&quot; period of fourteen calendar days during which the purchase contract can be cancelled and treated as if not done.

Although no longer applied in consumer law, the principle of &quot;caveat emptor&quot; is generally held to apply to transactions between businesses unless it can be shown that the seller had a clear information advantage over the buyer that could not have been removed by carrying out reasonable due diligence.

==Variations==

=== &quot;Caveat venditor&quot; === 
&quot;Caveat venditor&quot; is Latin for &quot;let the seller beware.&quot;

In the landmark case of &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot; (1916), New York Court Appeals Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo established that privity of duty is no longer required in regard to a lawsuit for product liability against the seller. This case is widely regarded as the origin of &quot;caveat venditor&quot; as it pertains to modern tort law in US.

=== &quot;Caveat lector&quot; ===
&quot;Caveat lector&quot; is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;let the reader beware&quot;. It means that when reading something, the reader should take careful note of the contents, and undertake due diligence on whether the contents are accurate, relevant, reliable and so forth. 
=== &quot;Caveat auditor&quot; ===
Another variant is &quot;Caveat Auditor&quot;, or &quot;let the listener beware&quot;, where caution is urged regarding all messages, in particular spoken messages, such as a radio advertisement.

*Hamilton, W.H. &quot;The Ancient Maxim &quot;Caveat Emptor&quot;&quot; (1931) 40 &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; 1133, argues that &quot;caveat emptor&quot; never had any place in Roman law, civil law, or &quot;lex mercatoria&quot; and was probably a mistake when implemented into the common law. Rather, there was a duty of good faith.

<text>Marsaxlokk () is a small, traditional fishing village in the South Eastern Region of Malta. It has a harbour, and is a tourist attraction known for its views, fishing and history. As of March 2014, the village had a population of 3,534. The village is also known for the Marsaxlokk Market, which is mainly a large fish market which takes place along the seafront on Sundays, and a tourist market during all other days of the week. Inhabited and well-known since antiquity, Marsaxlokk was used as a port by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and also has the remains of a Roman-era harbour. Originally a part of the city of Żejtun, the fishing village became a separate parish in the late nineteenth century.

Traditional luzzi and other larger and more modern vessels line the sheltered inner harbour. The village is also popular among locals and tourists alike for its walks around the coast and harbour, its restaurants, as well as for its swimming zones. Marsaxlokk Bay also includes a container freeport towards Birżebbuġa, a power station complex towards Delimara, and a small ship-repair facility for fishermen.

Marsaxlokk is sometimes referred to as &quot;Portus Herculis&quot;, due to the association of Marsaxlokk Bay with the Roman and Punic remains at Tas-Silġ.

== Etymology ==
The name Marsaxlokk comes from the Arabic word &quot;marsa&quot;, which means &quot;port&quot; and &quot;xlokk&quot;, which is the Maltese word for &quot;south-east&quot;. The word is related to the name for the dry sirocco wind that blows from the Sahara, comparable to the equivalent Catalan word, &quot;xaloc&quot;. The inhabitants of the village are called the &quot;Xlukkajri&quot; and are, traditionally, fishermen by trade.

== Topography ==
Situated in the south-east end of the main island of Malta, Marsaxlokk bay is fed by a valley that drains the Marnisi and Ħal Ġinwi areas. The Marsaxlokk floodplain is one of the smaller ones on Malta. Today, a small marsh survives at the head of the bay, named &quot;Tal-Magħluq&quot;. This may indicate that the bay may have been larger in the past and gradually silted up since antiquity. Although there are no sources from the medieval and early modern period to prove the existence of marshes in the area, a marshy environment survives at the head of the fishing harbour.

Sediment deposition over recent century has silted the bay, making it significantly more shallow than in antiquity. Researchers hypothesize that vessels of all sizes could once have sought shelter here. A sandy beach may have provided a landing place for small boats. A freshwater supply exists in the valley that lies between two of the three hills dominating the bay - namely to the north-east, north and north-west. Access to plains around Żejtun would have been easy via this same valley, with a meandering road linking the bay to the Żejtun Roman Villa. While the bay could only have been used as a temporary anchorage without human intervention, a simple sea wall may have enabled the harbour to be used as an all-weather anchorage. In antiquity, its main function would have been to serve the agricultural sites in the surrounding areas. It may also have enjoyed links with the Tas-Silġ sanctuary overlooking the bay.

==History==
To the north-east of the village, on the rounded hilltop of Tas-Silġ, there is a multi-period sanctuary site covering all eras from the Neolithic to the fourth century AD. The Tas-Silġ site includes megalithic remains, scattered edifices belonging to three distinct temples. Cicero describes the temple of Juno in Malta in his &quot;In Verrem&quot;. The temple, long associated with the remains at Tas-Silġ, contained &quot;a large number of ornaments among which was a carefully and supremely crafted ancient ivory statue of Victory.&quot; The presence of such ornaments is a clear indication of the importance of this temple not just locally but also on a Mediterranean scale. Recent studies of the ceramics from Tas-Silġ led to conclusions that the sanctuary was used as a centre of exchange for both local and imported goods. The remains atop the hill also include a more recent Byzantine basilica and monastery.

Little is known about the area during the Middle Ages, with all the casalia of the south-eastern side of the island being exposed to frequent raids and attacks by Saracen pirates and, later, raiders from the Barbary coast. Modern historical studies and topology confirm that the area between Żejtun and Marsaxlokk was covered in vegetation and pasture land. In the later Middle Ages, Marsaxlokk was included in medieval portolani. At least three of these medieval sailing instructions, dating as far back as the 13th century mention, Marsaxlokk (as , and ). The Rizo portolan of 1490 gives sailing distances from Marsaxlokk to a variety of other ports in the Mediterranean including Tunis, Cephalonia and Tripoli in Libya. This reflects the port&#x27;s connectivity with other parts of the medieval Mediterranean.

The invading Ottoman navy anchored at Marsaxlokk during the Great Siege of 1565, before they completed the attack on Fort Saint Elmo. The whole harbour area was systematically fortified over successive centuries, with towers, batteries and fortresses ringing Marsaxlokk bay. This chain of fortifications was intended to protect the vulnerable harbour, and included Vendôme Tower, Fort Delimara, Delimara Tower, Ta&#x27; Bettina Tower, and Fort Tas-Silġ on Delimara point, on the north arm of Marsaxlokk Bay, Fort San Lucian on Kbira point in the middle of the bay, and the Pinto and Ferretti batteries on the shores of the bay towards Birżebbuġa. The most prominent fortification of this chain, Fort San Lucian was built by 1611 and may have prevented a landing in the bay by Ottoman forces in 1614. Napoleon&#x27;s navy entered Marsaxlokk, and landed an army on the coast during the French invasion of 1798. During the Maltese uprising - British, Neapolitan and Portuguese forces operated from here. Horatio Nelson and his lover Emma Hamilton also stayed here from April to June 1800, visiting parts of the island.

Most of the fishermen who worked out of Marsaxlokk bay hailed from Żejtun, commuting back and forth from the shore. Around 1846, the first houses began to be built in Marsaxlokk, as fishermen from Żejtun settled there permanently. At the end of the nineteenth century, a church was built to minister to the spiritual needs of the fishermen and their families. Eventually, the fishing village of Marsaxlokk was separated from Żejtun and became a distinct parish in January 1897. The construction of the parish church started in 1890. It was built as a fulfillment of a promise made by Marquess Rosalia Apap Viani Testaferrata after she was saved from a violent storm at sea. The church was originally built in a rectangular form with the designs attributed to Dun Ġużepp Diacono. Marsaxlokk became an independent parish in 1897. The feast of our lady is held on the last Sunday of July. It includes a procession with the statue and a firework display.

In the 1930s, Marsaxlokk bay was used as a staging post by four-engined Short C-Class flying boats of Britain&#x27;s Imperial Airways as they pioneered long-distance air travel to across the British Empire. During the Second World War, Marsaxlokk Bay was the base for the Fleet Air Arm with a base at Kalafrana. In 1989, the famous summit meeting between Soviet and US leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush was held on board a ship anchored in the bay. Today, the village is framed by the fuel tanks and chimneys of the 537.8-megawatt Delimara Power Station, and the huge cranes of the Malta Freeport Container Terminal.

In recent years, Marsaxlokk has also developed as a modern seaside resort. The village includes a natural park at Xrobb l-Għaġin.

== Cultural tradition ==
Marsaxlokk is also famous for the national boats which are the luzzu and the kajjik. They serve the fisherman on fishing near the shore and for fishing away from the shore they use another type of boat. Tourists also can take boat trips from Marsaxlokk to Delimara and Birzebbuġa.

Most of Malta&#x27;s fish supplies are caught by fishermen coming from this port as about 70% of the Maltese fishing fleet is based there. Swordfish, tuna, and &#x27;lampuki&#x27; are caught in abundance between spring and late autumn. On weekdays, the catch is taken to the fish-market in Marsa, but on Sundays, fresh fish is sold by fishermen directly on the quay.

==Zones in Marsaxlokk==
==Sports==
Marsaxlokk F.C., formed in 1949, is the village&#x27;s main football team. It plays in the Maltese 2nd Division, with home games taking place at the Ta&#x27; Qali Stadium. Marsaxlokk also has a water polo team, which dates to 1952.

<text>Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM; &quot;mondiale&quot; being Italian and French for &quot;worldwide&quot;) is a set of digital audio broadcasting technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including AM broadcasting—particularly shortwave—and FM broadcasting. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of bandwidth, using xHE-AAC audio coding format. Various other MPEG-4 codecs and Opus are also compatible, but the standard now specifies xHE-AAC.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international non-profit consortium that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. Radio France Internationale, TéléDiffusion de France, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, Voice of America, Telefunken (now Transradio) and Thomcast (now Ampegon) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limiting factor, and computer processing power is cheap; modern CPU-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==
DRM can broadcast on frequencies below 30 MHz (long wave, medium wave and short wave), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies were previously known as &quot;DRM30&quot;. In the VHF bands, the term &quot;DRM+&quot; was used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300 MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68 MHz), band II (87.5 to 108 MHz) and band III (174 to 230 MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue transmitter facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with digital signal processing, so that a low-cost embedded system with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels (datacasting) — as well as RDS-type metadata or program-associated data as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a single-frequency network (SFN) or multi-frequency network (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
In the United States, this standard faces fierce competition with some other stereophonic standards on AM.

The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the ETSI, and the ITU has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for ITU region 2 is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in Geneva, Switzerland, at the ITU&#x27;s World Radio Conference.

Current broadcasters include Akashvani (formerly All India Radio), BBC World Service, funklust (formerly known as BitXpress), Radio Exterior de España, Radio New Zealand International, Vatican Radio, Radio Romania International and Radio Kuwait.

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a personal computer. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

Chengdu NewStar Electronics is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.

The General Overseas Service of Akashvani broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95 MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC. All India Radio is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM. The project which began in 2012 is scheduled to complete during 2015.

The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC has trialled the technology in the United Kingdom by broadcasting BBC Radio Devon in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The trial lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008). 
The BBC also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the Craigkelly transmitting station in Fife, Scotland, over an area which included the city of Edinburgh. In this trial, a 10 kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1 kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes, and coverage compared with FM. Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 Ofcom consultation on the future of radio in the United Kingdom for the AM medium wave band.

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252 kHz LW transmitter in Trim, County Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after Atlantic 252 closed.

The Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits IIS offers a package for software defined radios which can be licensed to radio manufacturers. Software package for car radios with DRM – Digital Radio Mondiale

===International regulation===
On 28 September 2006, the Australian spectrum regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, announced that it had &quot;placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed&quot; &quot;those bands being &quot;5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100 kHz.

Since 2005, the United States Federal Communications Commission states in that: &quot;For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed.&quot; Part 73, section 758 is for HF broadcasting only.

==Technological overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10 kHz bandwidth (±5 kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20 kHz (±10 kHz) wide channel. (For comparison, pure digital HD Radio can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10 kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20 kHz channels.) Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors (error coding)
* power needed (modulation scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions (multipath propagation, doppler effect), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format MPEG-4 HE-AAC (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
* MPEG-4 HE-AAC (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24 kHz or 12 kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48 kHz and 24 kHz when using SBR oversampling.
* MPEG-4 CELP which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
* MPEG-4 HVXC which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of MPEG-4 xHE-AAC, which is an implementation of MPEG Unified Speech and Audio Coding, the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the HE-AAC coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt xHE-AAC.

DRM30, unlike HD Radio on the medium wave, allows multiprogramming.
==== Opus ====

Opus is an open-source codec not included in the DRM standard, but commonly supported by popular software implementations. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), the codec is royalty-free and not subject to patent licensing. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

* Since version 2.1, Dream can broadcast using Opus format.
* Spark supports CELT transmissions, which is a subset of Opus.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:
* 4.5 kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a simulcast and use the lower-sideband area of a 9 kHz raster channel for AM, with a 4.5 kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
* 5 kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a simulcast and use the lower-sideband area of a 10 kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5 kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7 kbit/s for 5 kHz). This technique could be used on the shortwave bands throughout the world. 
* 9 kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region 1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
* 10 kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region 2 broadcast channel, and could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s).
* 18 kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region 1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
* 20 kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region 2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72 kbit/s).
* 100 kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and Doppler effect.

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
* A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
* B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
* C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
* D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-bit rate digital information is modulated using COFDM. It can run in simulcast mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., DAB or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on shortwave, mediumwave (with 9 as well as 10 kHz channel spacing) and longwave.
There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF - note that it is &quot;not&quot; compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5 kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

This table shows an example of useful bitrates depending on protection classes:
* OFDM propagation profiles (A or B)
* carrier modulation (16QAM or 64QAM)
* and channel bandwidth (9 or 10 kHz)

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30 MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108 MHz.

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30 MHz up to 174 MHz.

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100 kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute mobile TV over DRM+ rather than DMB or DVB-H. However, DRM+ (DRM Mode E) as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3 kbit/s depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100 kHz bandwidth.

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II (FM-band) and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicates the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30 MHz to 3 GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F, respectively.

In 2011, the pan-European organisation Community Media Forum Europe has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

<text>The All Indian Rodeo Cowboys Association (AIRCA) (formerly &quot;All Indian Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association&quot;) is a Native American organization that promotes Indian rodeo. It sponsors a schedule of local rodeos mostly in Arizona, the Indian Pro Rodeo Tour, leading up to a National Finals rodeo each year in which Native American rodeo performers compete. They cooperate closely with the Central Navajo Rodeo Association (CNRA) and the New Mexico Rodeo Association (NMRA). To compete in the Finals a performer must have competed in at least 30 rodeos during that year.

The Indian National Finals Rodeo (INFR) is a competing national organization and event.

<text>Indian rodeo is the rodeo subculture of Native-American rodeo athletes and, in Canada, First Nations athletes. In the United States, there are a number of regional associations and at least two national finals. In Canada, Indian rodeos share a major role in small aboriginal communities and are also featured events in larger centres with aboriginal populations. Some major rodeos in British Columbia such as the Williams Lake Stampede are, while not aboriginally-organized and unlike some Indian rodeos open to non-natives, heavily &quot;Indian&quot; in character and in the ranks of competitors.

<text>Resolution in Western tonal music theory is the move of a note or chord from dissonance (an unstable sound) to a consonance (a more final or stable sounding one).

Dissonance, resolution, and suspense can be used to create musical interest. Where a melody or chordal pattern is expected to resolve to a certain note or chord, a different but similarly suitable note can be resolved to instead, creating an interesting and unexpected sound. For example, the deceptive cadence.

== Basis ==
Resolution has a strong basis in tonal music, since atonal music generally contains a more constant level of dissonance and lacks a tonal center to which to resolve.
The concept of &quot;resolution&quot;, and the degree to which resolution is &quot;expected&quot;, is contextual as to culture and historical period. In a classical piece of the Baroque period, for example, an added sixth chord (made up of the notes C, E, G and A, for example) has a very strong need to resolve, while in a more modern work, that need is less strong - in the context of a pop or jazz piece, such a chord could comfortably end a piece and have no particular need to resolve.

== Example ==

An example of a single dissonant note which requires resolution would be, for instance, an F during a C major chord, C–E–G, which creates a dissonance with both E and G and may resolve to either, though more usually to E (the closer pitch). This is an example of a suspended chord. In reference to chords and progressions for example, a phrase ending with the following cadence IV–V, a half cadence, does not have a high degree of resolution. However, if this cadence were changed to (IV–)V–I, an authentic cadence, it would resolve much more strongly by ending on the tonic I chord.

<text>Digital radio is the use of digital technology to transmit or receive across the radio spectrum. Digital transmission by radio waves includes digital broadcasting, and especially digital audio radio services.

== Types ==
In digital broadcasting systems, the analog audio signal is digitized, compressed using an audio coding format such as AAC+ (MDCT) or MP2, and transmitted using a digital modulation scheme. The aim is to increase the number of radio programs in a given spectrum, to improve the audio quality, to eliminate fading problems in mobile environments, to allow additional datacasting services, and to decrease the transmission power or the number of transmitters required to cover a region. However, analog radio (AM and FM) is still more popular and listening to radio over IP (Internet Protocol) is growing in popularity.

In 2012, four digital wireless radio systems are recognized by the International Telecommunication Union: the two European systems Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), the Japanese ISDB-T and the in-band on-channel technique used in the US and Arab world and branded as HD Radio.

An older definition, still used in communication engineering literature, is wireless digital transmission technologies, i.e. microwave and radio frequency communication standards where analog information signals as well as digital data are carried by a digital signal, by means of a digital modulation method. This definition includes broadcasting systems such as digital TV and digital radio broadcasting, but also two-way digital radio standards such as the second generation (2G) cell-phones and later, short-range communication such as digital cordless phones, wireless computer networks, digital micro-wave radio links, deep space communication systems such as communications to and from the two Voyager space probes, etc.

==One-way (broadcasting) systems==

===Broadcast standards===
Digital audio radio service standards may provide terrestrial or satellite radio service. Digital radio broadcasting systems are typically designed for handheld mobile devices, like mobile-TV systems and unlike other digital TV systems which typically require a fixed directional antenna. Some digital radio systems provide in-band on-channel (IBOC) solutions that may coexist with or simulcast with analog AM or FM transmissions, while others are designed for designated radio frequency bands. The latter allows one wideband radio signal to carry a multiplex of several radio-channels of various bitrates as well as data services and other forms of media. Some digital broadcasting systems allow single-frequency network (SFN), where all terrestrial transmitters in a region sending the same multiplex of radio programs may use the same frequency channel without self-interference problems, further improving the system spectral efficiency.

While digital broadcasting offers many potential benefits, its introduction has been hindered by a lack of global agreement on standards and many disadvantages. The DAB Eureka 147 standard for digital radio is coordinated by the World DMB Forum. This standard of digital radio technology was defined in the late 1980s, and is now being introduced in some European countries. Commercial DAB receivers began to be sold in 1999 and, by 2006, 500 million people were in the coverage area of DAB broadcasts, although by this time sales had only taken off in the UK and Denmark. In 2006 there are approximately 1,000 DAB stations in operation. There have been criticisms of the Eureka 147 standard and so a new &#x27;DAB+&#x27; standard has been introduced.

The DRM standard has been used for several years to broadcast digitally on frequencies below 30 MHz (shortwave, mediumwave and longwave). Also there is now the extended standard DRM+, which is designed for VHF bands. Tests of DRM+ has been made in countries such as in Brazil, Germany, France, India, Sri Lanka, the UK, Slovakia, Italy (incl. the Vatican), as well as Sweden.

DRM+ is regarded as a more transparent and less costly standard than DAB+ and thus a better choice for local radio ; commercial or community broadcasters. Although DAB+ has been introduced in Australia the government concluded in 2011 that a preference for DRM and DRM+ above HD Radio could be used to supplement DAB+ services in (some) local and regional areas. 

To date the following standards have been defined for one-way digital radio:

===Status by country===

====DAB adopters====

Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), also known as Eureka 147, has been adopted by around 20 countries worldwide. It is based on the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II audio coding format and this has been co-ordinated by the WorldDMB.

WorldDMB announced in November 2006 that DAB would be adopting the HE-AACv2 audio coding format, also known as eAAC+. Also being adopted are the MPEG Surround format, and stronger error correction coding called Reed–Solomon coding. The update has been named DAB+. Receivers that support the new DAB standard began being released during 2007 with firmware updated available for some older receivers.

DAB and DAB+ cannot be used for mobile TV because they do not include any video codecs. DAB related standards Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) and DAB-IP are suitable for mobile radio and TV both because they have MPEG 4 AVC and WMV9 respectively as video coding formats. However a DMB video sub-channel can easily be added to any DAB transmission - as DMB was designed from the outset to be carried on a DAB subchannel. DMB broadcasts in Korea carry conventional MPEG 1 Layer II DAB audio services alongside their DMB video services.

==== Australia ====

Australia commenced regular digital audio broadcasting using the DAB+ standard on 4 May 2009, after many years of trialling alternative systems. Normal radio services operate on the AM and FM bands, as well as four stations (ABC and SBS) on digital TV channels. The services are currently operating in five state capital cities: Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, and is being trialled in Canberra and Darwin.

====Canada====
Canada has begun allowing experimental HD Radio broadcasts in December 2012 and digital audio subchannels on a case-by-case basis, with the first stations in the country being CFRM-FM in Little Current, CING-FM in Hamilton, and CJSA-FM in Toronto (with a fourth, CFMS-FM in the Toronto suburb of Markham applying to operate HD Radio technology), all within the province of Ontario.

====Germany====
In 2020, DAB+ signals cover more than 90% of Germany. A national multiplex contains three public stations by Deutschlandfunk and 12 commercial stations. In most areas, additional multiplexes with public broadcasters and regional commercial stations are available.

The first DAB station network was deployed in Bavaria since 17 October 1995 until full coverage in 1999. Other states had funded a station network but the lack of success led them to scrap the funding - the MDR switched off in 1998 already and Brandenburg declared a failure in 2004. Instead Berlin/Brandenburg began to switch to digital radio based on an audio-only DVB-T mode given the success of the DVB-T standard in the region when earlier analogue television was switched off in August 2003 (being the first region to switch in Germany). During that time the DVB-H variant of the DVB family was released for transmission to mobile receivers in 2004. During 2005 most radio stations left the DAB network with only one public service broadcaster ensemble to remain in the now fully state-funded station network. At last the (&quot;commission to determine the financial needs of broadcasters&quot;) blocked federal funding on 15. July 2009 until economic viability of DAB broadcasting would be proven - and pointing to DVB-T as a viable alternative.

Digital radio deployment was rebooted during 2011 - a joint commission of public and private radio broadcasters decided upon &quot;DAB+&quot; as the new national standard in December 2010. The new station network started as planned on 1. August 2011 with 27 stations with 10 kW each giving a coverage of 70% across the nation. A single &quot;Bundesmux&quot; (&quot;fed-mux&quot;: short for &quot;federal multiplex&quot;) was created on band 5C as a single-frequency network on channel 5C (see ). With the initial market success of DAB+ the contractors decided on an expansion of the digital radio station network in November 2012.

====Korea====

On 1 December 2005 South Korea launched its T-DMB service which includes both television and radio stations. T-DMB is a derivative of DAB with specifications published by ETSI. More than 110,000 receivers had been sold in one month only in 2005.

====Hong Kong====
Hong Kong replaced DAB with DVB-T2 Lite.

====Norway====
Norway was the first country where analog FM radio was switched off in 2017 being replaced by nationwide DAB+ distribution.

Local stations can continue broadcasting in FM.

====Other European Countries====
With DAB being available across Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Northern Italy there is good coverage across the European Backbone area (see countries using DAB/DMB) indicating a sufficient momentum on the market. France, Spain, Sweden and Poland use DAB+ only in the big cities.

Portugal and Finland abandoned DAB. Finland is requesting the EU to mandate that automakers support FM similarly to DAB.

====Japan====

Japan has started terrestrial sound broadcasting using ISDB-Tsb and MobaHO! 2.6 GHz Satellite Sound digital broadcasting

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, 44.3% of the population now has a DAB digital radio set and 34.4% of listening is to different digital platforms. Because of the early success of the old DAB standard, the transition to the more efficient DAB+ takes more time. If DAB was switched off, older receivers would become worthless. In 2020, about half of the stations in the UK use DAB+.

26 million people, or 39.6% of the population of 65.64 million, now tune into digital radio each week, up 2.6 million year on year, according to RAJAR in Q1 2013. But FM listening has increased to 61% and DAB decreased to 21% DAB listeners may also use AM &amp; FM too.

The UK currently has the world&#x27;s biggest digital radio network, with about 500 transmitters, two nationwide DAB ensembles and 48 local and regional DAB ensembles, broadcasting over 250 commercial and 34 BBC radio stations; about 100 stations can be received in London. On DAB digital radio most listeners can receive around 30 additional stations.

Digital radio stations are also distributed on digital television platforms such as Sky, Virgin Media and Freeview, as well as internet radio.

The Government will make a decision on a radio switchover subject to listening and coverage criteria being met. A digital radio switchover would maintain FM as a platform, while moving some services to DAB-only distribution.

DAB+ devices in the UK has been available to the public by 2010

====United States====
The United States has opted for the proprietary HD Radio technology, a type of in-band on-channel (IBOC) technology. According to iBiquity, &quot;HD Radio&quot; is the company&#x27;s trade name for its proprietary digital radio system, but the name does not imply either high definition or &quot;hybrid digital&quot; as it is commonly incorrectly referenced.

Transmissions use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, a technique which is also used for European terrestrial digital TV broadcast (DVB-T). HD Radio technology was developed and is licensed by iBiquity Digital Corporation. It is widely believed that a major reason for HD radio technology is to offer some limited digital radio services while preserving the relative &quot;stick values&quot; of the stations involved and to ensure that new programming services will be controlled by existing licensees.

The FM digital schemes in the U.S. provide audio at rates from 96 to 128 kilobits per second (kbit/s), with auxiliary &quot;subcarrier&quot; transmissions at up to 64 kbit/s. The AM digital schemes have data rates of about 48 kbit/s, with auxiliary services provided at a much lower data rate. Both the FM and AM schemes use lossy compression techniques to make the best use of the limited bandwidth.

Lucent Digital Radio, USA Digital Radio (USADR), and Digital Radio Express commenced tests in 1999 of their various schemes for digital broadcast, with the expectation that they would report their results to the National Radio Systems Committee (NRSC) in December 1999. Results of these tests remain unclear, which in general describes the status of the terrestrial digital radio broadcasting effort in North America.

While traditional terrestrial radio broadcasters are trying to &quot;go digital&quot;, most major US automobile manufacturers are promoting digital satellite radio. HD Radio technology has also made inroads in the automotive sector with factory-installed options announced by BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Jaguar, Lincoln, Mercedes, MINI, and Volvo.

Satellite radio is distinguished by its freedom from FCC censorship in the United States, its relative lack of advertising, and its ability to allow people on the road to listen to the same stations at any location in the country. Listeners must currently pay an annual or monthly subscription fee in order to access the service.

Sirius Satellite Radio launched a constellation of three Sirius satellites during the course of 2000. The satellites were built by Space Systems/Loral and were launched by Russian Proton boosters. As with XM Satellite Radio, Sirius implemented a series of terrestrial ground repeaters where satellite signal would otherwise be blocked by large structures including natural structures and high-rise buildings.

XM Satellite Radio has a constellation of three satellites, two of which were launched in the spring of 2001, with one following later in 2005. The satellites are Boeing 702 comsats, and were put into orbit by Sea Launch boosters. Back-up ground transmitters (repeaters) will be built in cities where satellite signals could be blocked by big buildings.

On February 19, 2007, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio merged, to form Sirius XM Radio.

The FCC has auctioned bandwidth allocations for satellite broadcast in the S band range, around 2.3 GHz.

Terrestrial broadcasting has advantages in being free and local. Satellite radio is neither of these things; however, in the early 21st century it has grown by providing uncensored content (most notably, the crossover of Howard Stern from terrestrial radio to satellite radio) and commercial-free, all-digital music channels that offer similar radio formats to local stations.

The &quot;HD Radio&quot; signal of an FM broadcast station in the US has a limited listening distance from the broadcast tower site. FCC regulations currently limit the power of the digital part of the station&#x27;s transmission to 10% of the existing analog power permitted the station. Even at this power level, the presence of the digital signal right next to the station&#x27;s analog signal can result in older radios picking up noise due to trouble rejecting the adjacent digital signal. &quot;There are still some concerns that HD Radio on FM will increase interference between different stations even though HD Radio at the 10% power level fits within the FCC spectral mask.&quot; HD Radio HD Radio#cite note-14.

&quot;HD Radio&quot; allows each existing broadcast station to add additional &quot;channels&quot; in the US by transmitting a digital signal on both sides of its channel, just beyond their existing analog Frequency Modulation signal. The HD Radio signal occupies the 0.1 MHz that begins 0.1 MHz above and below the carrier frequency station. For instance, if a station&#x27;s analog signal&#x27;s carrier frequency is 93.3 MHz, the digital signal will fill 93.1–93.2 MHz and 93.4–93.5 MHz within the FM Broadcast Band. Several digital audio streams, or &quot;subchannels&quot;, can be carried within this single digital data stream, with the number of audio of subchannels and bandwidth allocations at the choice of the station. On the radio tuner, these will appear as (in the above case) &quot;93.3-2&quot;, &quot;93.3-3&quot;, and so on. The frequencies that are used do not change as more channels are added to the one radio station (93.3 MHz in the example above). Instead, a fixed total amount of bandwidth is simply reallocated across the audio streams such that each now receives less bandwidth, and therefore lower audio quality, than before.

There is no federally mandated transition to HD Radio for both FM and AM stations. However, on October 27, 2020, the FCC approved voluntary all-digital AM operation nationwide.

====Developing nations====

Digital radio is now being provided to the developing world. A now defunct satellite communications company named WorldSpace was setting up a network of three satellites, including &quot;AfriStar&quot;, &quot;AsiaStar&quot;, and &quot;AmeriStar&quot;, to provide digital audio information services to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. AfriStar and AsiaStar are in orbit. AmeriStar could not be launched from the United States as Worldspace transmitted on the L-band and would interfere with USA military as mentioned above.. in its heyday provided service to over 170,000 subscribers in eastern and southern Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia with 96% coming from India. Timbre Media along with Saregama India plan to relaunch the company. As of 2013 Worldspace is defunct, but two satellites are in orbit which still have a few channels. See main WorldSpace article.

Each satellite provides three transmission beams that can support 50 channels each, carrying news, music, entertainment, and education, and including a computer multimedia service. Local, regional, and international broadcasters were working with WorldStar to provide services.

A consortium of broadcasters and equipment manufacturers are also working to bring the benefits of digital broadcasting to the radio spectrum currently used for terrestrial AM radio broadcasts, including international shortwave transmissions. Over seventy broadcasters are now transmitting programs using the new standard, known as Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM), and / commercial DRM receivers are available (though there are few models on the DRM website and some are discontinued). DRM&#x27;s system uses the MPEG-4 based standard aacPlus to code the music and CELP or HVXC for speech programs. At present these are priced too high to be affordable by many in the third world, however. Take-up of DRM has been minuscule and many traditional Shortwave broadcasters now only stream on Internet, use fixed satellite (TV set-boxes) or Local Analogue FM relays to save on costs. Very few (expensive) DRM radio sets are available and some Broadcasters (RTE in Ireland on 252 kHz) have ceased trials without launching a service.

Low-cost DAB radio receivers are now available from various Japanese manufacturers, and WorldSpace has worked with Thomson Broadcast to introduce a village communications center known as a Telekiosk to bring communications services to rural areas. The Telekiosks are self-contained and are available as fixed or mobile units

==Two-way digital radio standards==
The key breakthrough or key feature in digital radio transmission systems is that they allow lower transmission power, they can provide robustness to noise and cross-talk and other forms of interference, and thus allow the same radio frequency to be reused at shorter distance. Consequently, the spectral efficiency (the number of phonecalls per MHz and base station, or the number of bit/s per Hz and transmitter, etc.) may be sufficiently increased. Digital radio transmission can also carry any kind of information whatsoever — just as long at it has been expressed digitally. Earlier radio communication systems had to be made expressly for a given form of communications: telephone, telegraph, or television, for example. All kinds of digital communications can be multiplexed or encrypted at will.

<text>A shackle (or shacklebolt), also known as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a quick-release locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. 

A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks. A carabiner is a type of shackle used in mountaineering.

== Types ==
===Bow shackle ===
With a larger &quot;O&quot; shape to the loop, this shackle can take loads from many directions without developing as much side load. However, the larger shape to the loop does reduce its overall strength. Also referred to as an anchor shackle.

===D-shackle===
Also known as a chain shackle, D-shackles are narrow shackles shaped like a loop of chain, usually with a pin or threaded pin closure. D-shackles are very common and most other shackle types are a variation of the D-shackle. The small loop can take high loads primarily in line. Side and racking loads may twist or bend a D-shackle.

===Headboard shackle===
This longer version of a D-shackle is used to attach halyards to sails, especially sails fitted with a headboard such as on Bermuda rigged boats. Headboard shackles are often stamped from flat strap stainless steel, and feature an additional pin between the top of the loop and the bottom so the headboard does not chafe the spliced eye of the halyard.

===Pin shackle===
A pin shackle is closed with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, in a manner similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often referred to, in industrial jargon, as &quot;clevises&quot;. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.

===Snap shackle===
As the name implies, a snap shackle is a fast action fastener which can be implemented single-handedly. It uses a spring-activated locking mechanism to close a hinged shackle, and can be unfastened under load. This is a potential safety hazard, but can also be extremely useful at times. The snap shackle is not as secure as any other form of shackle, but can come in handy for temporary uses or in situations which must be moved or replaced often, such as a sailor&#x27;s harness tether or to attach spinnaker sheets. Note: When this type of shackle is used to release a significant load, it will work rather poorly (hard to release) and is likely to have the pin assembly or the split ring fail.

===Threaded shackle===
The pin is threaded and one leg of the shackle is tapped. The pin may be &quot;captive&quot;, which means it is mated to the shackle, usually with a wire. The threads may gall if overtightened or have been corroding in salty air, so a liberal coating of lanolin or a heavy grease is not out of place on any and all threads. A shackle key or metal marlinspike are useful tools for loosening a tight nut.

For safety, it is common to mouse a threaded shackle to keep the pin from coming loose. This is done by looping &quot;mousing wire&quot; or a nylon zip tie through the hole in the pin and around the shackle body. For pins that have a cross-hole in the threaded end a cotter pin can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where the shackle is exposed to air and water. Nylon is not recommended for use where significant movement of the shackle is expected.

===Twist shackle===
A twist shackle is usually somewhat longer than the average, and features a 90° twist so the top of the loop is perpendicular to the pin. One of the uses for this shackle include attaching the jib halyard block to the mast, or the jib halyard to the sail, to reduce twist on the luff and allow the sail to set better.

===Soft shackle===
Modern strong fibers such as PBO (IUPAC name: poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole), aramids (Kevlar, Technora, Twaron), Vectran, carbon fibers, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, Dyneema, Spectra) and other synthetic fibers are used to make extra strong ropes which can also be tied into lockable loops called soft shackles.

According to sailmagazine.com, &quot;a soft shackle can handle just about every function performed by a metal shackle, in many cases better. Soft shackles articulate better, don’t rattle around when not under load, don’t chew up toe rails or beat up masts and decks, don’t hurt when they whack you on the head, are easier to undo and don’t have pins that fall overboard at a critical moment&quot;. A modern rope can lift as heavy loads as a steel wire 3 times as thick and much heavier. Metal shackles may be preferred because soft shackles can be cut by sharp edges, burned, or deteriorate in some environments.

One disadvantage of soft shackles made of Dyneema and other modern fibers is their susceptibility to be weakened by heat, also heat caused by friction. It is advisable to subject it to medium level loads for a while to remove any slack that may cause friction heat when loaded to its maximum.

The stopping knot of a soft shackle may be a true lover&#x27;s knot, a diamond knot, a double line celtic button knot or a chinese button knot (ABOK #600, ABOK #601, ABOK #603 doubled as one tail-end reverse-trails the other, emerging tail-ends preferably buried in the opposing main part as it emerges together from the knot for Chinese finger trap attachment). Another preferred stopping knot is a two rope combined wall+crown+wall+crown knot (a two string rose knot). The latter ones with the added thickness of the returning tail ends have the advantage of less of a sharp curvature at their weakest spot, the eye around the neck of the button.

<text>Megavoltage X-rays are produced by linear accelerators (&quot;linacs&quot;) operating at voltages in excess of 1000 kV (1 MV) range, and therefore have an energy in the MeV range. The voltage in this case refers to the voltage used to accelerate electrons in the linear accelerator and indicates the maximum possible energy of the photons which are subsequently produced. They are used in medicine in external beam radiotherapy to treat neoplasms, cancer and tumors. Beams with a voltage range of 4-25 MV are used to treat deeply buried cancers because radiation oncologists find that they penetrate well to deep sites within the body. Lower energy x-rays, called orthovoltage X-rays, are used to treat cancers closer to the surface.

Megavoltage x-rays are preferred for the treatment of deep lying tumours as they are attenuated less than lower energy photons, and will penetrate further, with a lower skin dose. Megavoltage X-rays also have lower relative biological effectiveness than orthovoltage x-rays. These properties help to make megavoltage x-rays the most common beam energies typically used for radiotherapy in modern techniques such as IMRT.

==History==
The use of megavoltage x-rays for treatment first became widespread with the use of Cobalt-60 machines in the 1950s. However prior to this other devices had been capable of producing megavoltage radiation, including the 1930s Van de Graaff generator and betatron.

<text>The Saab 35 Draken (; &quot;The Kite&quot;, ambiguous with &quot;The Dragon&quot;) is a Swedish fighter-interceptor developed and manufactured by Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB) between 1955 and 1974. Development of the Saab 35 Draken started in 1948 as the Swedish air force future replacement for the then also in development Saab 29 Tunnan day fighter and Saab 32B Lansen all-weather fighter. It featured an innovative but unproven double delta wing, leading to the creation of a sub-scale test aircraft, the Saab 210, which was produced and flown to test this previously unexplored aerodynamic feature. The full-scale production version entered service with frontline squadrons of the Swedish Air Force on March 8, 1960. It was produced in several variants and types, most commonly as a fighter-interceptor.

The Saab 35 Draken is known for, among other things, its many &quot;firsts&quot; within aviation. It was the first Western European-built combat aircraft with true supersonic capability to enter service and the first fully supersonic aircraft to be deployed in Western Europe. Designwise it was one of, if not the first, combat aircraft designed with double delta wings, being drawn up by early 1950. The unconventional wing design also had the side effect of making it the first known aircraft to be capable of and perform the Cobra maneuver. It was also one of the first Western-European-built aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in level flight, reaching it on January 14, 1960.

The Draken functioned as an effective supersonic fighter aircraft of the Cold War period, although it was never used in conflict. Even though the type was designed and intended as an interceptor, it was considered to be a very capable dogfighter for the era. In Swedish service, it underwent several upgrades, the ultimate of these being the J 35J model. By the mid-1980s, the SAF&#x27;s Drakens had largely been replaced by the more advanced JA 37 Viggen fighter, while the introduction of the more capable Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter was expected in service within a decade, although delayed. As a consequence of cutbacks and high maintenance costs, the SAF opted to retire the Draken during December 1999. The type was also exported to the air forces of Austria, Denmark and Finland. Danish aircraft have been exported, post-service, to the United States where they have seen use as training aircraft for test pilots.

== Naming ==
The Swedish word &quot;Draken&quot; has a double meaning, translating either as &quot;The Dragon&quot; or &quot;The Kite&quot;. It is said that the name was derived from the appearance of the prototype, like a paper kite, when seen from above.

The number &quot;35&quot; comes from the aircraft&#x27;s Swedish Air Force-designation: &quot;flygplan 35&quot; (fpl 35), meaning “aeroplane 35”. Depending on the given role, the aircraft received a prefix to indicate its type, the most common being &quot;J 35&quot; to indicate &quot;jaktflygplan&quot; (pursuit-aircraft), the Swedish term for fighter aircraft.

== Development ==
As jet fighter technology developed after World War II, Sweden foresaw a need for a supersonic fighter that could intercept bombers at high altitude as well as engage other fighters. During September 1949, the Swedish Air Force, via the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, released its recently formulated requirement for a cutting-edge interceptor aircraft that was envisioned to be capable of attacking hostile bomber aircraft in the transonic speed range. The original requirement specified a top speed of Mach 1.4 to 1.5, but this was revised upwards in 1956 to Mach 1.7 to 1.8 and then again in 1959 to Mach 2.0.

It had to be flown by a single pilot, yet be capable of conducting combat operations under all weather conditions, night or day, while operating from relatively austere airstrips, carrying all equipment needed to neutralize modern jet bombers. Although other interceptors like the US Air Force&#x27;s F-104 Starfighter were being conceived at the time, this fighter would have to undertake a role unique to Sweden; the ability to operate from reinforced public roads, which were to be used as part of wartime airbases. The aircraft also needed to be refueled and rearmed in no more than ten minutes by conscripts with minimal training.

SAAB commenced work on producing an aircraft to meet these requirements. Preliminary studies found that the majority of critical issues posed by these requirements could be met with a delta wing configuration. However, to obtain an aerodynamically desirable location, the forward fuselage needed to be extended, making the aircraft too heavy. The optimum solution was thought to be a double delta wing. However, this wing configuration was new and untested, so SAAB&#x27;s design staff, headed by aircraft engineer Erik Bratt, and a team of more than 500 technicians, constructed a small test aircraft to explore the behaviour of the new wing.

A sub-scale test aircraft constructed in Sweden, the Saab 210 (formally &quot;flygplan 210&quot;, &quot;aircraft 210&quot;), unofficially nicknamed &quot;Lilldraken&quot; (the little dragon), comprised a test of the double delta wing, and performed its first flight on January 21, 1952. Results produced by these test flights led to an order for three full-size Draken prototypes. On October 25, 1955, the first of these prototypes, not fitted with an afterburner, conducted its maiden flight. According to aircraft publication Flight International, an atypically intensive flight test program was conducted to define and test the type&#x27;s exceptional speed, range, and complicated systems. The second prototype, equipped with an afterburner, unintentionally broke the sound barrier during its first flight while climbing.

During 1956, the first operational version of the Draken, designated as the J 35A, was ordered into quantity production and the first production aircraft flew for the first time on February 15, 1958. Mach 2 was reached on January 14, 1960 with test pilot Erik Dahlström at the controls of the J 35B prototype. The engine used was a slightly modified British made Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.48A (Swedish designation RM6BE), engine number 3459.

== Design ==

The Saab 35 Draken is a fighter aircraft, equipped with a distinctive double delta wing. According to Flight International, it is difficult to differentiate between the fuselage and the wing. The design anticipates what would later be known as a ‘blended wing-body’. The fuselage has a circular section, and the inboard portion of the wing is a large-chord surface which extended almost to the engine intakes. It was possible to dispense with a tailplane, resulting in a clean, simple overall design. The leading edge of the inner wing was swept back 80° for high-speed performance, and the outer wing 60° for good performance at low speeds.

The cockpit of the Draken featured mostly Swedish-sourced instrumentation. Successive models introduced various improvements to the cockpit fittings, such as the revised canopy and new avionics. For export customers, the Draken was outfitted with a Ferranti-built Airpass II fire-control radar, which was effective for acquiring various air-to-air or air-to-surface targets, along with a ground-mapping mode working in conjunction with the aircraft&#x27;s navigation systems. Typically, two separate radio units would be installed, along with a high-speed data link and two navigation systems. As there is no natural feedback placed upon the stick, artificial forces were generated by a q-feel system. The Draken was also fitted with a three-axis autopilot.
The fuselage of the Draken consisted of two sections, front and rear, joined by bolts. The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside the rest of the inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with inboard and outboard elevons, the outer sections being fitted with mass-balance weights. Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 210 kp/cm2 (20.6 MPa), which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan.

Propulsion was provided by a single Svenska Flygmotor RM6B/C turbojet engine, a licence-built model of the Rolls-Royce Avon 200/300 engine (also known as Avon Mk.48A and Mk.60). A ram turbine, positioned under the aircraft&#x27;s nose, provided emergency power, while the engine also featured a built-in emergency starter unit. To reduce its landing distance when required, the Draken was equipped with a drogue parachute. The principal armament was carried externally, up to four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles were carried on hard points beneath the wings and fuselage; alternative payloads include a variety of bombs and rockets, along with provisions for the installation of a pair of 30 mm cannons, located within each of the inboard wing panels. In place of the cannons, additional fuel tanks could be fitted in the same space. For aerial reconnaissance missions, a variety of camera pods could be carried underneath the fuselage.

=== Instability ===

Due to a lack of knowledge regarding the then historically unproven design of the J 35&#x27;s tailless double delta wing configuration, the plane encountered problems at the start of its service life. The unstable design of the double delta wing made it difficult to land early versions of the J 35 as they had to be manually stabilized during landing. The design also allowed the plane to enter a &quot;super stall&quot;; which can be described as an uncontrollable stall affecting aircraft with specific wing configurations when experiencing high alpha numbers. Due to this, J 35 pilots were trained to prevent super stalls, and this training led to the development of the cobra maneuver. The cobra is performed by entering into a controlled super stall state, gaining high alpha and then quickly negating the angle of attack to counter the stall. This forces the airframe to act as an air brake for a few seconds, which rapidly reduces the speed.

The Swedish Air Force is the first air force to have discovered and developed the cobra maneuver. The Swedish named it (short parry) after the fencing maneuver of the same name, in English known as ‘beat parry’. Initially it was used during training to teach pilots how to counter super stalls, however it also saw secondary use as a combat maneuver which would cause a pursuing enemy fighter overshoot, allowing the pilot to riposte.

== Operational history ==

At the end of 1959, deliveries of the J 35A Draken commenced to the SAF, the first unit to receive the type being fighter wing F13, stationed at Norrköping. During March 1960, the Drakens of unit F13 participated in a three-day long exercise, flying by night and day while operating under a state of &quot;highest readiness&quot; throughout. According to Flight International, the introduction to service of the J 35A was &quot;very smooth&quot;, and that the scramble and turn-round times had been found to be &quot;most satisfactory&quot;. By the end of 1960, multiple wings had been equipped with the Draken and had attained operational status.

Although the J 35 Draken was designed as a high altitude interceptor and not as a dog fighter, it proved to have a good quick-turn capability and high speed at all altitudes, making it a very capable fighter plane. The early models were intended purely to perform the air defense mission. However, to assist pilots in converting to the type, Saab produced a small number of twin-seat J 35C trainer aircraft, the first of which having been completed during December 1959. During 1959, an improved air defence fighter model, designated as the J 35B, was developed, which featured improved performance and equipment over the J 35A. Among other things, it was powered by an improved engine fitted with an enlarged afterburner, a redesigned rear fuselage, a new Saab-built S-7 collision-course gunsight and fire-control radar, and integration with Sweden&#x27;s STRIL 60 air defence control network.

A total of 651 Drakens were manufactured by Saab. Sweden&#x27;s fleet of Drakens comprised a total of six different versions, while two additional models of the Draken were offered to prospective export customers. The final model of the Draken to be produced was the J 35F, which was also the final version to remain in Swedish service, then modified to J 35J standard. Its export customers included Denmark and Finland. In May 1985, the Austrian Air Force purchased 24 J 35Ds, which had been refurbished by Saab.

The J 35 Draken design underwent several upgrades. The last of these was the J 35J version, which was produced during the late 1980s; by this point, the Draken had been almost entirely replaced by the Saab 37 Viggen in SAF service. The Draken J 35J was effectively a service life extension programme, which had been initiated as a result of the impending delivery of the new Saab JAS 39 Gripen having suffered several delays. The extension program was intended to keep the Draken flying into the 2000s but, as a consequence of budgetary cutbacks and high maintenance costs being incurred with the type, the Draken was phased out of Swedish service in December 1999, although the aircraft has since remained operational in limited numbers within both military and civilian roles.
All Drakens functioned as interceptors with limited air-to-ground capability; the sole exception to this rule was the Danish Drakens, which functioned as strike aircraft and were capable of carrying a mixture of AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missiles, electronic countermeasures, and increased internal and external fuel storage. The Danish Drakens were the heaviest of the series to have flown. During 1993, the last of the Danish J 35 fleet were retired.

During the 1990s, Finland updated its 35XS fleet with new avionics, cockpit displays, navigational/attack systems, and electronic countermeasures; these were finally retired in 2000 to be replaced by F/A-18 Hornets.

Austria was the last country to have the Draken in active military service. The first refurbished Draken J-35Ö&#x27;s was handed over to the Austrian Air Force by 1987. These Drakens were initially armed solely with two 30mm air-to-air cannons, which have proved to be inadequate. This was due to a &quot;missile ban&quot; which stemmed from the Austrian State Treaty of 1955. By 1991, with the start of the Yugoslavian Civil War to its neighbor down south. There were numerous airplace violations along the southern border caused by the Yugoslavian Federal Army. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Austria declared the relevant article to be obsolete. Thus in 1993, a contract for the purchase of AIM-9 Sidewinder was signed with the Swedish Air Force. They were followed from 1998 by a number of improved AIM-9P5&#x27;s from Loral Corporation In 2005, these Drakens were retired, having been replaced by former Swiss Air Force F-5 Tiger IIs, while waiting for new Eurofighter Typhoons to take their place in the long term.

In the United States, the National Test Pilot School (NTPS) operated six Drakens that were formerly in Danish service. They were retired in 2009.

== List of prototypes and test aircraft ==
Several prototypes and test aircraft of the Saab 35 have existed over the years. Some have been prototypes for new variants while others have been test platforms for other aircraft.
;Fpl 210 &quot;Lilldraken&quot;:
:Flygplan 210 (fpl 210; &quot;aircraft 210&quot;), also known as &quot;Lilldraken&quot; (Little Kite), was a scaled-down proof of concept experimental aircraft to evaluate the double delta wing configuration; though not strictly a Draken variant, it is included here as the first in a series of prototypes.

:Existed in two stages:
:*Fpl 210A – air intakes on the nose
:*Fpl 210B – air intakes moved to the sides of the fuselage

;Fpl 35-1 &quot;Stordraken&quot;:Fpl 35–1, also known as &quot;Stordraken&quot; (Big Kite), was the first original full-scale prototype. It featured an original Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.21 (RM5A) engine with no afterburner and was unarmed.

;Fpl 35-2:Fpl 35-2 was the second full-scale prototype. It was similar to the 35-1 and was unarmed. It was used for testing ejection seats among other things. Tests with a tailhook were also performed at some point.

;Fpl 35-3:Fpl 35-3 was the third prototype and was the first prototype with cannon armament.

;Fpl 35-4:Fpl 35-4 was the series prototype for the Saab 35A.

;Fpl 35-5:Fpl 35-5 was the first aircraft built to Saab 35A-series specifications. It featured an original Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.48A (RM6BE) engine and had the same afterburner and tail as the J 35A1 (Adam short) variant. Later it was modified to Saab 35D standard and acted as the Saab 35H demonstrator during the Swiss trials.

;Fpl 35-6:Fpl 35-6 was the series prototype for the Saab 35D. It later also served as the prototype for the Saab 35F.
:;Fpl 35-7:Fpl 35-7 was a test aircraft for the Saab 35F-series. It was outfitted with special recording equipment.

:;Fpl 35-8:Fpl 35-8 was a test aircraft for the Saab 35F-series but with the earlier non-bird-proof cabin. It was used for rb 28 missile tests and later for testing different radios.

:;Fpl 35-9:Fpl 35-9 was a test aircraft for the Saab 35F-series but with the earlier non-bird-proof cabin. It was used for among other things ground tests.

:;Fpl 35-10:Fpl 35-10 was a test aircraft based on the Saab 35B-series but it was originally a J 35A series aircraft. The aircraft was modified with the outer wings of the Saab 37 Viggen strike fighter later in its service life for trials with the Rb 05 (then RB 305) air-to-ground missile.

:;Fpl 35-11:Fpl 35-11 was a test aircraft based on the Saab 35B-series. It was used for several Saab 35F trials featuring rb 27 and rb 28 missile mockups.

:;Fpl 35-12:Fpl 35-12 was similar to the 35-11 and was used to trial different components for the Saab 35D and Saab 35F series.

:;Fpl 35-13:Fpl 35-13 was a test aircraft for the Saab 35D-series. From 1967 it was used for testing several types of countermeasures for the Saab 37 Viggen strike fighter.



== Swedish air force variants ==
=== Saab 35A (Adam) ===

Fighter version designated J 35A (&quot;Adam&quot;). 90 aircraft (35001–35090), including test aircraft, delivered between March 1960 and December 1961. 29 J 35A were ordered on August 24, 1956, with a further 60 J 35A being ordered on February 7, 1958. The initial 40 aircraft delivered in 1960 were delivered without a radar and gunsight. This was corrected in 1961 and 65 Adam were equipped with radar and gunsight in the end. 25 Adam were converted to Saab 35C unarmed two-seat trainers between April 1961 to August 1962.

The Saab 35A was fitted with a license produced Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.48A (Avon 200 series) engine (Swedish designation RM6BS) from SFA (today Volvo Aero) fitted with a Swedish developed afterburner. Two types of afterburners came to be used on the J 35A, resulting in two primary variants:
*J 35A1 (J 35 A:1) / J 35A kort (short) – initial version with a short afterburner (EBK65) and short tail. Nicknamed &quot;Adam kort&quot; (Adam short). 65 built.
*J 35A2 (J 35 A:2) / J 35A long (long) – later version with lengthened tail section to house a new afterburner (EBK66) for additional thrust. Nicknamed &quot;Adam lång&quot; (Adam long). The longer tail cone unexpectedly reduced drag, but did force the installation of a retractable tail-wheel. 25 built.

The radar on the J 35As was a French Cyrano RA 423 radar from Thompson-CSF (Swedish designation PS-02/A) as the originally planned Swedish radar (PS-03) from LME hadn&#x27;t been developed in time. The gunsight was an advanced gyro gunsight developed by Saab for both the Saab 32B and Saab 35A called S-6 (later named S-6B). It used data from the aircraft&#x27;s yaw and pitch axis, as well as other sources to give accurate aim for the weaponry. Range data could be taken from the radar or set manually by the pilot.

Weaponry on the J 35A consisted of two fixed 30 mm ADEN cannons (Swedish designation 30 mm akan m/55) in the wings with 90 rounds per gun. For external ordnance the J 35A had nine hardpoints, eight under the wings and one on the belly. Six of the wing hardpoints were for mounting 13.5 cm srak m/56 high-explosive air-to-ground rockets. The other two wing hardpoints were for mounting AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (Swedish designation rb 24). Rockets and missiles could not be mounted simultaneously on the wings. The belly hardpoint could mount either two rb 24 Sidewinders or a 530-liter drop tank.

=== Saab 35B (Bertil) ===

Fighter version designated J 35B (&quot;Bertil&quot;). 73 aircraft (35201–35273), including test aircraft, were built and delivered between February 1962 and March 1963. The J 35B was initially planned to be designated J 35B1, before being renamed to just J 35B in January 1960. 72 J 35B1 were ordered on February 28, 1958. 25 of these were to receive the 25 Saab 35A front sections left over from the Saab 35C conversion, but modified to Saab 35B standard.

Due to manufacturing issues, delivery delays occurred for some J 35B subsystems, resulting in that the J 35B initially being delivered with only parts of the planned avionics installed. This resulted in there being two primary sub-variants of the J 35B historically:
*J 35B′ – initial day fighter version of the J 35B. It lacked a radar and featured old Ferranti gyro gunsights taken from scrapped Saab J 29A and B fighters called Reflexsikte 4E/35. These aircraft were designated &quot;J 35B′&quot; (i.e. &quot;prime&quot;, ) to indicate that they were not completed vehicles. However some sources calls these aircraft &quot;J 35B1&quot; instead of &quot;J 35B′&quot;. Even though it lacked a radar it was fully armed with cannons, rockets and missiles. It was also compatible with STRIL 60. 72 built between February 1962 and March 1963.
*J 35B – later all-weather fighter version of the J 35B. Featured a PS-03/A radar and S-7A-2 radar gunsight, as well as the rest of the initially planned equipment and avionics. 69 aircraft converted from the remaining J 35B´(prim) between 1964 and 1966. Aircraft were sent to Saab for conversion between 1964 and 1965 and re-delivered between January 1965 to June 1966.

The base aircraft of the Saab 35B was identical to the J 35A2 and featured the same engine and afterburner, the RM6BS and EBK66. Distinctive from the J 35A, however, was that the J 35B was fully integrated into the Swedish STRIL 60 system; a combat guidance and air surveillance system. As part of STRIL 60 it was also the first Swedish aircraft fitted with a &#x27;control data system&#x27; () which allowed ground-control to send digital orders to the aircraft. These orders were then stored in the aircraft&#x27;s computers so the pilot could read the order several times and didn&#x27;t have to memorize the content.

The radar on the J 35B was a Swedish developed radar from LME designated PS-03/A. It was superior and more advanced compared to the French PS-02 used on the J 35A. The gunsight was an advanced radar gunsight developed by Saab for both the J 35B and J 35D called S-7A-2. It used data from, among others, the aircraft&#x27;s yaw and pitch axis, as well as the PS-03/A radar. It was specifically designed for head-on attacks with air-to-air rockets, something the J 35A did not have access too. Weaponry on the J 35B was for the most part equivalent to the J 35A, but the fixed 30 mm akan m/55 ADEN cannons in the wings had 100 rounds per gun and the aircraft had gained the ability to use 75 mm srak m/57 air-to-air rockets. The rockets were fired from Rakkaps m/57 rocket pods mounted in pairs on the Sidewinder belly pylon, each holding 19 rockets.

=== Saab 35C (Cesar) ===

Twin-seat trainer version designated SK 35C (&quot;Cesar&quot;). 25 aircraft (35801–35825), converted from J 35A1s (Adam kort) between April 1961 to August 1962 by rebuilding the front section of the aircraft, not including the prototype (35800), which flew on December 30, 1959, and was privately owned by Saab. The SK 35C was initially planned to be designated J 35C, before being renamed to &quot;SK 35C&quot; in January 1960. The twenty five SK 35C (J 35C) front sections were ordered on August 24, 1956.

The Cesar-version lacked armament but the minor modification meant that the aircraft could easily be converted back to J 35A standard if necessary. However, the prototype (35800) was used by Saab to trial the Rb 05 air-to-ground missile.

=== Saab 35D (David) ===

Fighter version designated J 35D (&quot;David&quot;). 120 aircraft (35274–35393) delivered between May 1963 and April 1965 in 3 series. The J 35D was initially planned to be designated J 35B2, before being renamed to J 35D in January 1960. 62 J 35B2 were ordered on November 15, 1958, with a further 60 aircraft, meant to be converted to S 35B2 (S 35E) reconnaissance aircraft, being planned to be ordered in November 1960. In the end, only 30 Davids (all of series 1) was converted to S 35E standard, having first served as a fighter aircraft between May 1963 and January 1964.

Due to manufacturing issues, delivery delays occurred for some J 35D subsystems, resulting in that the two initial J 35D series being delivered with only parts of the planned avionics installed. Series 3, however, was delivered with complete avionics, resulting in there being two primary sub-variants of the J 35D initially:
*J 35D1 – initial day fighter version of the J 35D. It lacked a radar and featured old Ferranti gyro gunsights taken from scrapped Saab J 29A and B fighters called Reflexsikte 4E/35. Even though it lacked a radar it was fully armed with cannons, rockets and missiles. It was also compatible with STRIL 60. 30 aircraft delivered as series 1 between May 1963 to January 1964, but quickly put aside for S 35E conversion and 24 aircraft delivered as series 2 between January 1964 to May 1964.
*J 35D2 – later all-weather fighter version of the J 35D. Featured a PS-03/A radar and S-7A-2 radar gunsight, as well as the rest of the initially planned equipment and avionics. 66 aircraft delivered as series 3 between June 1964 to May 1965. Remaining J 35D1 from series 2 were modified to J 35D2 standard throughout 1967 to 1968 by CVV Hässlö (Centrala Flygverkstaden Västerås) and respective air units, after which, the D1 and D2 suffixes were dropped in favour of just D.

The Saab 35D base aircraft differed quite a lot compared to previous variants. For one, it was fitted with the much stronger Rolls-Royce Avon Mk.60 (Avon 300 series) engine (Swedish designation RM6CS), which was license produced by SFA (today Volvo Aero) and fitted with a Swedish developed afterburner (EBK67), which could deliver 77.3 kN of thrust when using its afterburner. Secondly, the David featured increased internal fuel capacity for longer range. It also featured two hardpoints on the belly to be able to mount two 500-liter external drop tanks for even longer range missions (compared to one 530-liter drop tank for the 35A, B and C). Despite having more fuel than its predecessors, the David was the fastest Draken version, capable of accelerating until out of fuel.

In terms of armament and avionics, the J 35D was almost identical to the J 35B. It was fully integrated into the Swedish STRIL 60 system and was also fitted with a &#x27;control data system&#x27;, allowing the aircraft to receive digital orders from ground control. It also featured the same PS-03/A radar and S-7A-2 radar gunsight as the J 35B. Weaponry on the J 35D was at least initially equivalent to the J 35B. It had two 30 mm akan m/55 ADEN cannons in the wings with 100 rounds per gun, 4 inward hardpoints, 1 under each wing and 2 on the belly, for external air-to-air ordnance, as well as 6 outer hardpoints for air-to-ground rockets. In 1977, however, a new type of air-to-ground rocket became available to the J 35D, the 14.5 cm psrak m49/56 high-explosive anti-tank rocket and in 1978, a new type of air-to-air missile, the AIM-9J Sidewinder (Swedish designation &quot;rb 24J&quot;), later modified with an Ericsson laser proximity fuze, making it equivalent to the AIM-9P-3. Something noteworthy is that the J 35D was the last Swedish Draken variant fitted with 2 guns.

=== Saab 35E (Erik) ===

Reconnaissance version of the Saab 35D designated S 35E (&quot;Erik&quot;). 60 aircraft (35901–35960), including test aircraft, built between 1963 and 1968 in 2 series. The S 35E was initially planned to be designated S 35B2, before being renamed to S 35E in January 1960. In 1958 the SAF planned to order 60 J 35B2 (J 35D) fighters in November 1960, which were intended to be converted to S 35B2 (S 35E) reconnaissance aircraft at a later date. In the end, 30 S 35E were produced as new aircraft (35902–35931) and delivered between July 1965 to May 1966 as series 1, while 28 S 35E were converted from J 35D (35932–35959) and delivered between October 1966 to January 1968 as series 2. Two more aircraft, S 35E (35901) and S 35E (35960) were also converted from Davids but never delivered to the SAF.

The base aircraft of the Saab 35E was almost identical to the J 35D and featured the same engine and afterburner, the RM6CS and EBK67. It differed however in that it had no armament or radar, as to make space for 9 Vinten cameras, five in the nose and four in the fuselage, some mounted upright, others mounted obliquely. The aircraft was however fitted with a radar warning receiver and could mount a countermeasure pod named Kapsel KB with chaff and flare dispensers under the wings to increase its survivability. The aircraft had 4 primary hardpoints in total for external ordnance, 1 under each wing and 2 on the belly. For long range missions it was possible to mount up to 4 drop tanks on these hardpoints. For night missions it could carry an active infrared reconnaissance system of EG&amp;G design in a pod fitted to a belly hardpoint.

=== Saab 35F (Filip) ===

Fighter version designated J 35F (&quot;Filip&quot;). Delivered between 1965 and 1972, total production: 230. This variant had improved electronics and avionics, e.g. integrated radar, aim and missile systems, introducing the capability to use semi-active radar homing (SARH) and infrared homing (IR) versions of the Hughes Falcon missile, rb 27 (HM-55 / AIM-26B export) and rb 28 (HM-58 / AIM-4C export) respectively, originally intended for the J 35D. To make space for more avionics, the left cannon was removed, with ammunition increased to 120 rounds for the right cannon as compensation.

The J 35F existed in two primary variants:
*J 35F1 – initial version without an infrared search and track sensor under the nose.
*J 35F2 – later version with a Hughes N71 infrared search and track sensor under the nose (&quot;IR-spanare 71N&quot;). This was a change in the production line from the no. 35501 airframe. The Hawé mods I &amp; II were carried out on the P/S-01/011 radar sets in the early 1980s to improve resistance to ECM.

=== Saab 35G (Gustav) ===
Attacker version designated J 35G (&quot;Gustav&quot;). 70 aircraft suggested to be converted from J 35Ds but the project was cancelled early on.

The Gustaf version was specifically going to be able to carry the Saab Rb 05 air-to-ground missile.

=== Saab 35J (Johan) ===

Fighter version designated J 35J (&quot;Johan&quot;). In 1985 the Swedish government decided to modify 67 J 35F2s to the J 35J standard. The aircraft received a longer lifespan, modernized electronics, a modernized cannon, two additional hardpoints under the intakes for extra AIM-9 Sidewinder pylons (&quot;balk G&quot;, &quot;pylon G&quot;) and increased external fuel capacity. The modification took place between 1987 and 1991. The final operational J 35J flew for the last time in 1999.

=== Proposed modifications ===
Before it was decided to develop the JAS 39 Gripen in the 1970s, studies were undertaken on modification for low flight hour J 35F airframes.
*35 MOD Level 1b – Essentially the aircraft that became the J 35J.
*35 MOD Level 4 – The most ambitious modification in the program. The proposed modifications were new outer wing, additional weapon stations, RBS 15 capability, the addition of canards by the air intakes for increased maneuverability and maximum take-off weight increased to 15 000 kg.

== Export variants ==
Export attempts of the Saab 35 started even before the aircraft had finished development in Sweden. During the late 1950s, Saab would offer the aircraft to, among others, the West German Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Swiss Air Force.

=== Saab 35H (Helvetia) ===
&quot;Saab 35H&quot; (&quot;Helge&quot;) was a proposed export version of the J 35D for the Swiss Air Force in 1958. H stands for Helvetia, Switzerland in Latin. One demonstrator built from the Fpl 35-5 prototype. Competed and lost out against the Dassault Mirage IIIS. None sold or delivered. The trial and procurement of the Mirage III was however faulty, leading to a scandal after severe budget overruns. The Swiss Air Force commander, the chief of the general staff and the minister of defence were forced to resign as a result. During trials the Saab 35H demonstrated a climb rate 20–40% superior to the Mirage III and had a 35% shorter take-off run.

=== Saab 35X (Export) ===
&quot;Saab 35X&quot; (&quot;Xerxes&quot;) was a series of export variants of the J 35D and J 35F that Saab offered throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. X stands for export. The Saab 35X were offered to Belgium in 1967, Argentina in 1968, Venezuela in 1969, Chile in 1971, Singapore in 1975, Tunisia in 1976 and Malaysia in 1980. However, none of the aforementioned countries purchased the Saab 35 in the end.

=== Saab 35XD (Export Danmark) ===
&quot;Saab 35XD&quot; (&quot;Xerxes David&quot;) was an export fighter bomber version of the Saab 35F for the Royal Danish Air Force. X stands for export and D for Denmark. It competed and won against the Mirage III and the Northrop F-5 in 1968.

Three variants of the Saab 35XD were produced, all with similar ordnance capabilities:
*F-35 (&quot;Saab A 35XD&quot;) – single-seat attack version. 20 built
*RF-35 (&quot;Saab S 35XD&quot;) – single-seat reconnaissance version with a camera nose similar to the Saab 35E. Could not equip the AGM-12B Bullpup. 20 built
*TF-35 (&quot;Saab SK 35XD&quot;) – two-seat trainer aircraft with only one cannon. 11 built (6 initially, 5 later)

Denmark wanted to acquire a third and fourth Saab 35XD squadron (23–46 aircraft) following the initial purchase and prices were handed over August 14, 1970. Negotiations continued during the spring of 1971 and an offer was made on May 1, 1971. The Danish interest focused on a radar by LME called SAX 500, a new navigation system and an effective ordnance amining system, such as the Saab BT-9. However, due to cutbacks of the Danish Air Force made during he winter 1970/1971 (from 7 squadrons to 4) it was not possible to acquire these aircraft.

Following the cancellation of more Danish 35XD aircraft, Saab offered the Danish Air Force 2 low-price Draken ground attack variants based on the Saab 35F in 1971:
*Saab 35FD – single-seat attack version for Denmark based on the Saab 35F. The suffix FD stands for F version, Denmark. Unknown differences to the HÖG variant below.
*Saab 35FD HÖG – single-seat attack version for Denmark based on the Saab 35F. The suffix HÖG is Swedish for High. This version was planned to be fitted with a Weapon Delivery and Navigation System (WDNS).

The Saab 35FD project was cancelled in October 1971 and no aircraft were acquired.

The Saab 35XD was heavily modified to make it into a fighter bomber aircraft; compared to the Swedish versions the outer wings where completely redesigned and the aircraft featured 9 hardpoints in total. It could carry a wide array of NATO ordnance, such as of NATO bombs, but also Mighty Mouse rockets and AGM-12B Bullpup missiles. For air defence it featured two 30 mm ADEN cannons and could also mount two AIM-9B Sidewinders (later AIM-9N2s) on the utmost hardpoints. It lacked a radar and had a counterweight in the nose instead. The Saab 35XD was however fitted with a ballistic computer from Saab called BT-9R. It worked with both bombs and rockets and even allowed for toss bombing.

During the 1970s the Danish Drakens received new altimeters, US ALR-45 radar warning receivers (later upgraded to ALR-65) and chaff and flare dispensers in their tail cones. During the 1980s the Danish Drakens got an upgrade called &quot;WDNS&quot; (Weapon Delivery and Navigation System). This upgrade most notably included a Marconi 900 Series HUD and a Ferranti LRMTS (laser rangefinder and marked target seeker) which required a new nose to be installed on the F-35 and TF-35. This nose was the same as the one used on the RF-35 but lacked camera windows on the side. Electronic warfare capability was also improved as the Danish Drakens were fitted with ALR-69 radar warning receivers (with six antennas on the vertical fin, two on each wingtip and two under the nose) and the ability to carry ALQ-162 jammer pods under the wingtips. The last upgrade was completed in 1986 and updated the systems for weapon aiming and navigation accuracy to a similar capacity to those of the Danish Air Force&#x27;s General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons. Somewhere during its service life the Danish Drakens also lost their ability to mount AGM-12B Bullpups.

=== Saab 35XS (Export Suomi) ===

&quot;Saab 35XS&quot; (&quot;Xerxes Sigurd&quot;) was an export variant of the Saab 35F interceptor for the Finnish Air Force. X stands for export and S stands for Suomi (Finland in Finnish). The Saab 35XS was sold as part of larger Finnish-Swedish collaboration program to provide the Finnish Air Force with Saab 35 aircraft, starting from 1970. Sweden would provide the Finnish Air Force with second hand J 35F1s, J 35Bs and SK 35Cs, with the Saab 35XS being produced by Saab in Sweden as kits to be assembled under licence by Valmet in Finland. Valmet also got a license to produce spare parts.

The Finnish Air Force gave the Saab 35 the type designation DK (from Draken), although for practical use they reused the Swedish designations, but with the prefixes omitted and with an S added at the end (&quot;35BS&quot;, &quot;35CS&quot;, &quot;35FS&quot;), with the exception of the Saab 35XS, which was simply named &quot;35S&quot;. On rare occasions the DK designation received a third letter to indicate model (&quot;DKS&quot; for &quot;35S&quot;, etc.). As part of the Saab 35-adoption, Finland also bought Swedish produced Falcon missiles, rb 27 (Hughes HM-55) and rb 28 (Hughes HM-58). These were designated &quot;7S&quot; och &quot;8S&quot; respectively.

The Finnish Air Force received the following Saab 35 variants:
*DKB / 35BS – ex-Swedish J 35B interceptors sold to Finland. 8 sold and used as advanced trainers, with the exception of one which was used for schooling mechanics. Flew without missiles.
*DKC / 35CS – ex-Swedish SK 35C two-seat trainers sold to Finland. 5 sold and used as trainers.
*DKF / 35FS – ex-Swedish J 35F1 interceptors sold to Finland. 24 sold and used as fighters.
*DKS / 35S – dedicated export version of the Saab 35F for Finland. 12 copies built by Saab and assembled under licence by Valmet in Finland.

The initial delivered second hand Saab 35s entered service with the Finnish Air Force in 1972, with the first Saab 35XS assembled by Valmet – DK-201 – being completed on March 12, 1974. The initial flight trials of the Saab 35XS was flown by Swedish Saab test pilot KG Liljeqvist.

Unique among Saab 35s, the Finnish DKS and DKF were at times outfitted with Soviet R-13M missiles. By the mid-1980s, the DKF and DKS were upgraded with the same extra pylons as the Swedish J 35J. By 1993 the DKS also received countermeasures by installation of two Saab BOY 402 dispensers, capable of launching flares, chaff and expendable active decoys (EAD).
=== Saab 35XV (Export Venezuela) ===
&quot;Saab 35XV&quot; (&quot;Xerxes Viktor&quot;) was an export variant of the J 35D that Saab offered to Venezuela in 1971. X stands for export and V for Venezuela. Venezuela had shown interest for the Saab 35 since 1966 and in 1971 the Draken was test flown by Venezuela against the French Dassault Mirage III and British English Electric Lightning.

On April 23, 1971, the Venezuelan Air Force made an offer for 3 Saab 35 variants:
*Saab 35G1 – single-seat fighter version equal to the Saab 35F; 6 aircraft in the offer
*Saab 35G2 – single-seat attacker version based on the Saab 35XD but without extra internal fuel; 12 aircraft in the offer
*Saab 35GT – two-seat trainer aircraft; 2 aircraft in the offer

A variant of the Saab 105XT, designated Saab 105G, was also included in this offer. 24 Saab 105G proposed. The offer also included a preliminary weapons package with Falcon missiles, bombs, rockets and cannon ammunition, as well as &#x27;Product Support&#x27; and extra equipment such as weapons pylons and drop tanks.

Due to budget cuts the Venezuelan offer later changed to only include 15 Saab 35s and 15 Saab 105s but in the end the entire project fell apart due to US pressure and intervention.

=== Saab 35Ö (Österreich) ===

&quot;Saab 35Ö&quot; (&quot;Östen&quot;) or &quot;Saab 35OE&quot; (international name) was an export version of the Saab 35D for the Austrian Air Force. The Ö-suffix stands for Austria (, ). Since the Austrian Air Force lacks a proper designation system the Saab 35Ö got the name J 35Ö in Austria. The J prefix is a remnant of the Saab J 29F that Austria operated during the 1960s. The Austrians called their Saab 105Ö as &quot;J 105Ö&quot; for example. Saab re-purchased 24 J 35D aircraft from the Swedish Air Force in the mid-1980s and converted them into the Saab 35Ö version for export to Austria.

The Saab 35Ö was more or less equal to the Saab 35D but featured the updated bird-proof cockpit from the Saab 35F. Austria was offered the Saab 35F as an option but as Austria was forbidden to use missiles after World War II there was no point in choosing the F model with one cannon over the D model with two cannons. It quickly became apparent however that the Austrian Drakens needed missiles to protect their airspace and after the fall of the USSR and outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars Austria was permitted to use missiles. This was followed by Austria adopting several types of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, such as the AIM-9P3.

In 1992 the Austrian Drakens received an upgrade giving them a radar warning receiver (RWR), chaff and flare countermeasures and the AIM-9P5 all aspect missile. The RWR and countermeasure system was developed in collaboration with the Royal Danish Air Materiel Command FMK (Flyvematerielkommandoen) and looked very similar to the systems used on the Danish WDNS Drakens. The upgrade was performed by Valmet in Finland. This version is commonly called &quot;J 35Ö mark 2&quot; under a variety of spellings: &quot;J 35Ö Draken MK2&quot;, &quot;J-35 Oe Draken Mk.II&quot;.

<text>A radiation therapist, therapeutic radiographer or radiotherapist is an allied health professional who works in the field of radiation oncology. Radiation therapists plan and administer radiation treatments to cancer patients in most Western countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, most European countries, and Canada, where the minimum education requirement is often a baccalaureate degree or postgraduate degrees in radiation therapy. Radiation therapists (with master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees) can also prescribe medications and radiation, interpret tests results, perform follow ups, reviews, and provide consultations to cancer patients in the United Kingdom and Ontario, Canada (possibly in Australia and New Zealand in the future as well).
In the United States, radiation therapists have a lower educational requirement (at least an associate degree of art, though many graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree) and often require postgraduate education and certification (CMD, certified medical dosimetrist) in order to plan treatments.

==Roles &amp; Responsibilities==

Radiation therapists use advanced computer systems to operate sophisticated radiation therapy equipment such as linear accelerators. The therapist works closely with the radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the health care team. They effectively design and treat the course of radiation treatment, in addition to managing the patient&#x27;s well-being. Radiation therapists primarily treat cancer although certain other conditions may require irradiation. After the radiation oncologist has consulted with the patient and a decision has been reached that the application of radiation will benefit the patient, it then becomes the responsibility of the radiation therapist to interpret the prescription and develop a treatment plan for treatment delivery. The process of producing the final plan rests with a group of specialized radiation therapists called dosimetrists.

Since the course of radiation therapy can extend over several weeks, the radiation therapist is responsible for monitoring the condition of the patient and assessing if changes to the treatment plan are required. This is accomplished through patient re-positioning, dose calculations or other specialized methods to compensate for the changes. The therapist is responsible for quality assurance of the radiation treatment. This involves acquiring and recording all parameters needed to deliver the treatment accurately. The therapist first ensures that the patient is correctly set up for treatment; this may involve immobilization and surface-marker alignment with lasers. The therapist takes imaging studies of the targeted treatment area and reproduces the patient positioning and plan parameters daily. The therapist is responsible for the accuracy of the treatment and uses their judgment to ensure quality with regard to all aspects of treatment delivery. During the course of radiation treatment, the patient is likely to develop side effects. In such situations, the therapists will communicate these side effects with the radiation oncologist, who may adjust treatment or give medications; in some jurisdictions, specialist radiation therapists may prescribe these medications themselves. Radiation therapists &amp; medical dosimetrists (in many countries these two professions are often indistinguishable, e.g., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK) have training in gross anatomy, physiology, radiation protection, and medical physics. They are highly skilled, highly regarded health care professionals who are integral members of the cancer care team. Radiation therapists call upon their judgment to either continue or cease radiation treatment and ensure patient safety at all times and are regulated by a governing body within their jurisdiction.

===United Kingdom===
Therapeutic radiographers play a vital role in the treatment of cancer as the only healthcare professionals qualified to plan and deliver radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is used either on its own or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. They manage the patient pathway through the many radiotherapy processes, as outlined below, providing care and support for patients throughout their radiotherapy treatment.

Therapeutic radiographers are trained in all the many aspects of radiotherapy including:

Simulation - using specialist x-ray fluoroscopy machines to target the area to be treated whilst minimising the amount of exposure to surrounding healthy tissue;

CT/MR Simulation - producing scans to be used for the planning of a course of radiotherapy;

Computer planning - producing a 3D plan of the dose distribution across the area to be treated;

External beam treatment - using ionizing radiation, such as high-energy x-rays, the radiographer delivers accurate doses of radiation to the tumour;

Mold Room - radiographers and technicians in the Mold Room produce immobilization/beam attenuation devices for those receiving radiotherapy to the head or neck, as well as other custom devices for a patient&#x27;s treatment;

Brachytherapy - the use of small radioactive sources placed on or in tumors to treat to a high dose while avoiding normal tissues;

On treatment review - radiation therapists regularly assess patients while they are undergoing radiotherapy, prescribing drugs to counteract side effects where necessary or referring them on to other health professionals if needed.*

===Canada===
Specialist radiation therapists in Ontario are given with prescription rights. Some of the roles of the CSRT (Clinical Specialist Radiation Therapist) include pain management specialists, mycosis fungoides specialists, palliative care specialists, planning image definition, and contouring specialists.*

==Qualifications &amp; Registration==
Vary by Country.

===Canada===
In Canada, most radiation therapy programs are second entry and the majority of the students have had at least one full year of university courses before entering the programs (many have finished a science or physics degree). In Alberta, a BScRT (Bachelor of Science Radiation Therapy) is being offered at the University of Alberta. In Ontario, a BSRT (Bachelor of Science Radiation Therapy) is being offered at the University of Toronto and Laurentian University, and a BMRSc (Bachelor of Medical Radiation Science) in Radiation Therapy is being offered at McMaster University. In British Columbia, British Columbia Institute of Technology offers a BT (Bachelor of Technology) in Radiation Therapy. In Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg is offering a BSc Physics (Radiation Therapy). And in New Brunswick, the University of New Brunswick offers a BHSc (Bachelor of Health Science) in Radiation Therapy. In Quebec Radiation Oncology technology is offered in three year cegep programs. The CAMRT certifies therapists across Canada, but certain provinces, like Quebec, do not require the national certification if practitioners are certified with the provincial body. The first Master of Health Science (Radiation Therapy) in Canada is being offered at the University of Toronto, which prepares practitioners for advanced roles in the radiation therapy clinic.

In Canada, there is no real distinction between Radiation Therapists and Medical Dosimetry. The title &quot;treatment planner&quot;, or just &quot;planner&quot; commonly replaces &quot;dosimetrist&quot;. Dosimetrists are commonly radiation therapists with several years of experience and have undergone in-house training. The national professional association has recently introduced a Dosimetry Specialty Certificate program to address the fact there is no specific credential (DSp). Many employers recognize the Certified Medical Dosimetrist qualification from the US (Certified Medical Dosimetrist, CMD), but neither are required for practice.

===Australia===
A bachelor or graduate degree in radiation therapy is required in order to register and practice. In Australia, radiation therapists are often being addressed as &quot;Medical Radiation Practitioners&quot; or &quot;Medical radiation scientists&quot;.

===Malta===

Bachelor (Hons) degree in Radiography

===New Zealand===
A bachelor&#x27;s degree in radiation therapy is required in order to practice and be registered by the Medical Radiation Technologist Board (www.mrtboard.org.nz). Post graduate opportunities in advanced practice, Msc. and doctoral programmes are also available for Radiation Therapists in New Zealand.

===Ireland===
To practice as a radiation therapist in Ireland, a degree in Radiation Therapy that has been validated by the Irish Institute of Radiography and Radiation Therapy (http://www.iirrt.ie) is required. Taught and research MSc. and doctoral programmes are also available for Radiation Therapists in the Ireland.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK an approved course in Therapeutic Radiography must be undertaken prior to registration by the UK regulatory authority, the Health and Care Professions Council. This will usually be in the form of a Bachelor of Science degree in Therapeutic Radiography, Radiotherapy, or Radiotherapy and Oncology, however a small number of post-graduate pre-registration courses (at Post-graduate diploma or Masters level) are offered. UK radiographers are eligible for membership of the Society &amp; College of Radiographers.

Post-graduate studies at Masters level (PgD and MSc) are available, where graduates from such programs can move into Advanced Practice roles and can undertake duties previously done by physicians. Practitioners can build further on their skills and knowledge to work as Consultant Radiographers, who are considered as experts in clinical practice, research, education and leadership in their area of expertise, and will often possess a PhD or equivalent award.

===United States===
The minimum Education requirement is an associate degree of science, some programs offer bachelor or master&#x27;s degrees of science. In addition, there are also alternate pathways to becoming certified in the form of secondary degrees. These certifications are one year programs which require another degree, such as radiologic technology.

===Chile===
A bachelor&#x27;s degree and a 5-year college study program is required. By law (DS-18), in order to practice, at least 6 months of clinical demonstrable experience and a performance authorization is also required.

==Salary==
In 2008, the mean annual wage of radiation therapists in the United States was $78,290 according to the &quot;National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates&quot; from the &quot;United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics&quot;.

According to ASRT&#x27;s national wage survey done in 2003&quot;&quot;, the state that had the highest mean income for radiation therapists was New Mexico($120,250), followed by Arkansas ($109,000). The states which had the lowest average pays were Texas ($57,500) and Rhode Island ($58,400).

The average salary of American board certified medical dosimetrists is well over $100,000 according to the AAMD salary report. The typical salary range is from $90,000 (South) to $130,000 (West coast).

<doc id="275741" wikidata="Q6085399" url="?curid=275741" title="Isocentric technique">
<text>An isocentric technique is where all beams used in a radiation treatment have a common focus point, a.k.a. the isocenter. Isocentric techniques require less patient repositioning as multiple field arrangements can be delivered with gantry and collimator movements, reducing treatment times. 

==Definition==
The idealized intersection point of the gantry axis of rotation with that of the collimator and treatment table is known as the mechanical isocenter

In practice, due to the heavy weight and mechanical imperfections of the system, the isocenter is not a single point and its location changes with the rotation of the gantry, collimator or couch. This causes small uncertainties in the determination of isocenter position, typically less than 2 millimetres

==Working==
The movements of the linear particle accelerator (or linac) are threefold:
# the gantry rotates (like a big crane arm)
# the collimator twists in the head of the gantry
# the bed swings around on the floor

All of these movements in the modern linac occur around an axis that runs through the isocenter. In this way, if the centre of the target area in the patient&#x27;s body is moved to coincide with the isocenter, then all motions of the machine will remain centred on the target. This way, non-target areas will only receive short durations of radiation, reducing damage to them, while the target area receives constant radiation.

<doc id="275743" wikidata="Q1192606" url="?curid=275743" title="Motoi Sakuraba">
<text>is a Japanese composer and keyboardist. He is known for his numerous contributions in video games, including the &quot;Tales&quot;, &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, &quot;Golden Sun&quot;, and &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series, as well as several other anime series, television dramas, and progressive rock albums.

==Career==
Sakuraba was born on August 5, 1965, in Akita Prefecture, Japan. While attending Meiji University, Sakuraba began to take music composition seriously and formed the progressive rock band &quot;Clashed Ice&quot; in 1984, consisting of him on keyboards and Genta Kudo on drums and vocals. After the duo had graduated the following year, they were noticed by music producer Shingo Ueno, and ending up signing with Made in Japan Records. The band had then added bassist Tetsuya Nagatsuma, and was renamed as &quot;Deja Vu&quot;. In 1988, the band would release their only studio album, &quot;Baroque in the Future&quot;, composed by Sakuraba. Although the band disbanded in 1989, Sakuraba would later go on to release another solo album, &quot;Gikyokuonsou&quot;, in 1991.

In late 1989, Sakuraba began working as a composer for Wolf Team, joining Masaaki Uno and Yasunori Shiono. The professional friendships formed here in Sakuraba&#x27;s early years have resulted in a great demand for his composing and arranging abilities. In 1994, former Wolf Team director and composer Masaaki Uno started working at Camelot Software Planning as a coordinator and sound director, developing games for Sony, Sega and Nintendo. Sakuraba has been called upon as a composer for many Camelot games, including all of the games in the &quot;Mario Golf&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, and &quot;Golden Sun&quot; series.

In 1995, Wolf Team developed the breakthrough game &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; for Namco. This and other early games in the &quot;Tales&quot; series primarily featured Sakuraba and fellow Wolf Team co-worker Shinji Tamura as composers. Also in 1995, former Wolf Team director and producer Jun Asanuma, as well as &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; writer and programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, founded tri-Ace with financial backing from Enix. The &quot;Star Ocean&quot; and &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot; games have been their main franchises. Sakuraba has been the composer for nearly all of their games.

In 1999, long time Sakuraba sound designer and programmer Hiroya Hatsushiba, a former member of Wolf Team and tri-Ace, founded tri-Crescendo. While initially continuing to contribute sound work to tri-Ace games, tri-Crescendo began game development in 2001. Together with Monolith Soft, tri-Crescendo started working on &quot;Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean&quot;; Namco provided the financial backing. Hatsushiba, as director and main programmer of the project, again called upon Sakuraba&#x27;s composing services. This has extended to the sequel, &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;, and &quot;Eternal Sonata&quot;. The remnants of Wolf Team later morphed into the Namco Telenet joint subsidiary Namco Tales Studio in 2003.

In 2007, Sakuraba was selected to join a long list of video game composers to arrange music for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. He chose to arrange the famous &quot;Menu Theme&quot; from the game&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. He also arranged &quot;Gourmet Race&quot; from &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;, &quot;Jungle Level Ver.2&quot; from &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis / Mario Golf&quot; from &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot; and &quot;Mario Power Tennis, &quot;Victory Road&quot; from &quot;Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire&quot;, the &quot;Airship Theme&quot; from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, the &quot;Battlefield Theme&quot;, &quot;Final Destination&quot;, and &quot;Battle Scene / Final Boss (Golden Sun)&quot; from &quot;Golden Sun: The Lost Age&quot;.

Sakuraba then continued to write music for games in franchises he has worked with before, including &quot;Star Ocean: The Last Hope&quot;, &quot;Golden Sun: Dark Dawn&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis Open&quot;, &quot;Mario Golf: World Tour&quot;, and many &quot;Tales&quot; series games, including &quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Graces&quot;, &quot;Xillia&quot;, &quot;Xillia 2&quot;, &quot;Zestiria&quot;, and &quot;Berseria&quot;. He has also contributed to other well known games such as the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series, &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot;, and &quot;Phantasy Star Nova&quot;. In 2014, he was selected to provide musical arrangements for Brawl&#x27;s successor, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. For this title, Sakuraba arranged &quot;Theme from Area 6 / Missile Slipstream&quot; from &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; and &quot;Star Fox Command&quot;, &quot;Battle! (Team Flare)&quot; from &quot;Pokémon X and Y&quot;, and &quot;The valedictory elegy&quot; from &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;.

In addition, Sakuraba has continued to write for non-gaming and anime projects, including solo albums such as &quot;Forest of Glass&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot;, and &quot;Passage&quot;, as well as performing on several arrange albums. In the 2020s, he composed for games such as &quot;One Piece Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes&quot;.

===Live performances===
During July 2003, Sakuraba held a live concert in Tokyo, Japan. He performed progressive rock interpretations of his music from games &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;, &quot;Star Ocean: The Second Story&quot;, &quot;Star Ocean: Blue Sphere&quot; and &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot;. His bandmates for this concert were bassist Atsushi Hasegawa (a member of the band Gerard) and drummer Toshihiko Nakamura. As noted, this concert was released on DVD and CD. At the same time as they were rehearsing for the concert, Hasegawa and Nakamura assisted in recording new material for the Director&#x27;s Cut of &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;.

The following year, the trio performed another concert. The venue was smaller, but included music from &quot;Baten Kaitos&quot; and a couple of new, non-game-related pieces. This concert was not officially recorded and released, however. However, in 2006, a new concert was given in celebration of tri-Ace&#x27;s &quot;Valkyrie Profile: Silmeria&quot;.

In September 2011, Sakuraba and his band joined up with the Earthbound Papas in Kawasaki, led by former &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series composer Nobuo Uematsu, to perform at Fantasy Rock Fest 2011. The event featured game music performances, along with new progressive rock pieces from both bands. The first six tracks that Sakuraba and his band played were sold at the event as a preview CD for his then-upcoming solo album &quot;After all...&quot;, which was released by Strange Days Records on October 19, 2011.

In June 2015, Sakuraba performed at the &quot;Tales of&quot; Festival at the Yokohama Arena, being the first time he performed tracks from the &quot;Tales&quot; series at a live event. A selection of Sakuraba&#x27;s music from the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; and &quot;Tales&quot; series was performed live at the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris in February 2017. The event, known as &quot;Orchestral Memories&quot;, featured a guest appearance by Sakuraba. The 2020 &quot;Tales of&quot; Festival featured an original song by him called &quot;Endless Journey&quot;, dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the series.

<text>A list comprehension is a syntactic construct available in some programming languages for creating a list based on existing lists. It follows the form of the mathematical &quot;set-builder notation&quot; (&quot;set comprehension&quot;) as distinct from the use of map and filter functions.

==Overview==
Consider the following example in mathematical set-builder notation.

:formula_1
or often
:formula_2

This can be read, &quot;formula_3 is the set of all numbers &quot;2 times formula_4&quot; SUCH THAT formula_4 is an ELEMENT or MEMBER of the set of natural numbers (formula_6), AND formula_4 squared is greater than formula_8.&quot;

The smallest natural number, x = 1, fails to satisfy the condition x2&gt;3 (the condition 12&gt;3 is false) so 2 ·1 is not included in S. The next natural number, 2, does satisfy the condition (22&gt;3) as does every other natural number. Thus x consists of 2, 3, 4, 5... Since the set consists of all numbers &quot;2 times x&quot; it is given by S = {4, 6, 8, 10...}. S is, in other words, the set of all even numbers greater than 2.

In this annotated version of the example:
:formula_9
* formula_4 is the variable representing members of an input set.
* formula_6 represents the input set, which in this example is the set of natural numbers
* formula_12 is a predicate expression acting as a filter on members of the input set.
* formula_13 is an output expression producing members of the new set from members of the input set that satisfy the predicate expression.
* formula_14 braces indicate that the result is a set
* formula_15 formula_16 the vertical bar is read as &quot;SUCH THAT&quot;. The bar and the colon &quot;:&quot; are used interchangeably.
* commas separate the predicates and can be read as &quot;AND&quot;.

A list comprehension has the same syntactic components to represent generation of a list in order from an input list or iterator:
* A variable representing members of an input list.
* An input list (or iterator).
* An optional predicate expression.
* And an output expression producing members of the output list from members of the input iterable that satisfy the predicate.
The order of generation of members of the output list is based on the order of items in the input.

In Haskell&#x27;s list comprehension syntax, this set-builder construct would be written similarly, as:

s = [ 2*x | x &lt;- [0..], x^2 &gt; 3 ]
Here, the list codice_1 represents formula_6, codice_2 represents the predicate, and codice_3 represents the output expression.

List comprehensions give results in a defined order (unlike the members of sets); and list comprehensions may generate the members of a list in order, rather than produce the entirety of the list thus allowing, for example, the previous Haskell definition of the members of an infinite list.

==History==

The existence of related constructs predates the use of the term &quot;List Comprehension&quot;. The SETL programming language (1969) has a set formation construct which is similar to list comprehensions. E.g., this code prints all prime numbers from 2 to :
 print([n in [2..N] | forall m in {2..n - 1} | n mod m &gt; 0]);
The computer algebra system AXIOM (1973) has a similar construct that processes streams.

The first use of the term &quot;comprehension&quot; for such constructs was in Rod Burstall and John Darlington&#x27;s description of their functional programming language NPL from 1977. In his retrospective &quot;Some History of Functional Programming Languages&quot;, David Turner recalls:

&lt;/pre&gt;

In a footnote attached to the term &quot;list comprehension&quot;, Turner also notes

Burstall and Darlington&#x27;s work with NPL influenced many functional programming languages during the 1980s, but not all included list comprehensions. An exception was Turner&#x27;s influential, pure, lazy, functional programming language Miranda, released in 1985. The subsequently developed standard pure lazy functional language Haskell includes many of Miranda&#x27;s features, including list comprehensions.

Comprehensions were proposed as a query notation for databases and were implemented in the &quot;Kleisli&quot; database query language.

== Examples in different programming languages ==

==Similar constructs==

===Monad comprehension===
In Haskell, a monad comprehension is a generalization of the list comprehension to other monads in functional programming.

===Set comprehension===
The Python language introduces syntax for set comprehensions starting in version 2.7. Similar in form to list comprehensions, set comprehensions generate Python sets instead of lists.

»&gt; s = {v for v in &#x27;ABCDABCD&#x27; if v not in &#x27;CB&#x27;}
»&gt; print(s)
{&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;}
»&gt; type(s)
&lt;class &#x27;set&#x27;&gt;


Racket set comprehensions generate Racket sets instead of lists.

(for/set ([v &quot;ABCDABCD&quot;] #:unless (member v (string-&gt;list &quot;CB&quot;)))
 v))
===Dictionary comprehension===
The Python language introduced a new syntax for dictionary comprehensions in version 2.7, similar in form to list comprehensions but which generate Python dicts instead of lists.

»&gt; s = {key: val for key, val in enumerate(&#x27;ABCD&#x27;) if val not in &#x27;CB&#x27;}
»&gt; s
{0: &#x27;A&#x27;, 3: &#x27;D&#x27;}


Racket hash table comprehensions generate Racket hash tables (one implementation of the Racket dictionary type).

(for/hash ([(val key) (in-indexed &quot;ABCD&quot;)]
 #:unless (member val (string-&gt;list &quot;CB&quot;)))
 (values key val))
===Parallel list comprehension===
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler has an extension called parallel list comprehension (also known as zip-comprehension) that permits multiple independent branches of qualifiers within the list comprehension syntax.
Whereas qualifiers separated by commas are dependent (&quot;nested&quot;), qualifier branches separated by pipes are evaluated in parallel (this does not refer to any form of multithreadedness: it merely means that the branches are zipped).

-- regular list comprehension
a = [(x,y) | x &lt;- [1..5], y &lt;- [3..5]]
-- [(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4) ...

-- zipped list comprehension
b = [(x,y) | (x,y) &lt;- zip [1..5] [3..5]]
-- [(1,3),(2,4),(3,5)]

-- parallel list comprehension
c = [(x,y) | x &lt;- [1..5] | y &lt;- [3..5]]
-- [(1,3),(2,4),(3,5)]
Racket&#x27;s comprehensions standard library contains parallel and nested versions of its comprehensions, distinguished by &quot;for&quot; vs &quot;for*&quot; in the name. For example, the vector comprehensions &quot;for/vector&quot; and &quot;for*/vector&quot; create vectors by parallel versus nested iteration over sequences. The following is Racket code for the Haskell list comprehension examples.

&gt; (for*/list ([x (in-range 1 6)] [y (in-range 3 6)]) (list x y))
&#x27;((1 3) (1 4) (1 5) (2 3) (2 4) (2 5) (3 3) (3 4) (3 5) (4 3) (4 4) (4 5) (5 3) (5 4) (5 5))
&gt; (for/list ([x (in-range 1 6)] [y (in-range 3 6)]) (list x y))
&#x27;((1 3) (2 4) (3 5))
In Python, we could do as follows:

»&gt; # regular list comprehension
»&gt; a = [(x, y) for x in range(1, 6) for y in range(3, 6)]
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), ...
»&gt; # parallel/zipped list comprehension
»&gt; b = [x for x in zip(range(1, 6), range(3, 6))]
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]
In Julia, practically the same results can be achieved as follows:

# regular array comprehension
»&gt; a = [(x, y) for x in 1:5 for y in 3:5]

# parallel/zipped array comprehension
»&gt; b = [x for x in zip(1:3, 3:5)]

with the only difference that instead of lists, in Julia, we have arrays.

=== XQuery and XPath ===
Like the original NPL use, these are fundamentally database access languages.

This makes the comprehension concept more important, because it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the entire list and operate on it (the initial &#x27;entire list&#x27; may be an entire XML database).

In XPath, the expression:

/library/book//paragraph[@style=&#x27;first-in-chapter&#x27;]

is conceptually evaluated as a series of &quot;steps&quot; where each step produces a list and the next step applies a filter function to each element in the previous step&#x27;s output.

In XQuery, full XPath is available, but FLWOR statements are also used, which is a more powerful comprehension construct.

for $b in //book
where $b[@pages &lt; 400]
order by $b//title
return
 &lt;shortBook&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;{$b//title}&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;firstPara&gt;{($book//paragraph)[1]}&lt;/firstPara&gt;
 &lt;/shortBook&gt;

Here the XPath //book is evaluated to create a sequence (aka list); the where clause is a functional &quot;filter&quot;, the order by sorts the result, and the XML snippet is actually an anonymous function that builds/transforms XML for each element in the sequence using the &#x27;map&#x27; approach found in other functional languages.

So, in another functional language the above FLWOR statement may be implemented like this:

map(
 newXML(shortBook, newXML(title, $1.title), newXML(firstPara, $1...))
 filter(
 lt($1.pages, 400),
 xpath(//book)
)
=== LINQ in C# ===

C# 3.0 has a group of related features called LINQ, which defines a set of query operators for manipulating object enumerations.
var s = Enumerable.Range(0, 100).Where(x =&gt; x * x &gt; 3).Select(x =&gt; x * 2);
It also offers an alternative comprehension syntax, reminiscent of SQL:
var s = from x in Enumerable.Range(0, 100) where x * x &gt; 3 select x * 2;
LINQ provides a capability over typical list comprehension implementations. When the root object of the comprehension implements the codice_4 interface, rather than just executing the chained methods of the comprehension, the entire sequence of commands are converted into an abstract syntax tree (AST) object, which is passed to the IQueryable object to interpret and execute.

This allows, amongst other things, for the IQueryable to
* rewrite an incompatible or inefficient comprehension
* translate the AST into another query language (e.g. SQL) for execution

=== C++ ===
C++ does not have any language features directly supporting list comprehensions but operator overloading (e.g., overloading codice_5, codice_6, codice_7) has been used successfully to provide expressive syntax for &quot;embedded&quot; query domain-specific languages (DSL). Alternatively, list comprehensions can be constructed using the erase-remove idiom to select elements in a container and the STL algorithm for_each to transform them.

#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;list&gt;
#include &lt;numeric&gt;

using namespace std;

template&lt;class C, class P, class T&gt;
C comprehend(C&amp;&amp; source, const P&amp; predicate, const T&amp; transformation)
 // initialize destination
 C d = forward&lt;C&gt;(source);

 // filter elements
 d.erase(remove_if(begin(d), end(d), predicate), end(d));

 // apply transformation
 for_each(begin(d), end(d), transformation);

 return d;

int main()
 list&lt;int&gt; range(10);
 // range is a list of 10 elements, all zero
 iota(begin(range), end(range), 1);
 // range now contains 1, 2, ..., 10

 list&lt;int&gt; result = comprehend(
 range,
 [](int x) { return x * x &lt;= 3; },
 [](int &amp;x) { x *= 2; });
 // result now contains 4, 6, ..., 20

There is some effort in providing C++ with list-comprehension constructs/syntax similar to the set builder notation.
* In Boost. Range library there is a notion of adaptors that can be applied to any range and do filtering, transformation etc. With this library, the original Haskell example would look like (using Boost.Lambda for anonymous filtering and transforming functions) (Full example):
counting_range(1,10) | filtered( _1*_1 &gt; 3 ) | transformed(ret&lt;int&gt;( _1*2 ))

* This implementation uses a macro and overloads the « operator. It evaluates any expression valid inside an &#x27;if&#x27;, and any variable name may be chosen. It&#x27;s not threadsafe, however. Usage example:

list&lt;int&gt; N;
list&lt;double&gt; S;

S « list_comprehension(3.1415 * x, x, N, x * x &gt; 3)

* This implementation provides head/tail slicing using classes and operator overloading, and the | operator for filtering lists (using functions). Usage example:

bool even(int x) { return x % 2 == 0; }
bool x2(int &amp;x) { x *= 2; return true; }

list&lt;int&gt; l, t;
int x, y;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
 l.push_back(i);

(x, t) = l | x2;
(t, y) = t;

t = l &lt; 9;
t = t &lt; 7 | even | x2;

* Language for Embedded Query and Traversal (LEESA) is an embedded DSL in C++ that implements X-Path-like queries using operator overloading. The queries are executed on richly typed xml trees obtained using xml-to-c++ binding from an XSD. There is absolutely no string encoding. Even the names of the xml tags are classes and therefore, there is no way for typos. If a LEESA expression forms an incorrect path that does not exist in the data model, the C++ compiler will reject the code.&lt;br&gt;Consider a catalog xml.

&lt;catalog&gt;
 &lt;book&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Hamlet&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;price&gt;9.99&lt;/price&gt;
 &lt;author&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;country&gt;England&lt;/country&gt;
 &lt;/author&gt;
 &lt;/book&gt;
 &lt;book&gt;...&lt;/book&gt;
&lt;/catalog&gt;

LEESA provides codice_6 for XPath&#x27;s / separator. XPath&#x27;s // separator that &quot;skips&quot; intermediate nodes in the tree is implemented in LEESA using what&#x27;s known as Strategic Programming. In the example below, catalog_, book_, author_, and name_ are instances of catalog, book, author, and name classes, respectively.

// Equivalent X-Path: &quot;catalog/book/author/name&quot;
std::vector&lt;name&gt; author_names = 
evaluate(root, catalog_ » book_ » author_ » name_);

// Equivalent X-Path: &quot;catalog//name&quot;
std::vector&lt;name&gt; author_names = 
evaluate(root, catalog_ » DescendantsOf(catalog_, name_));

// Equivalent X-Path: &quot;catalog//author[country==&quot;England&quot;]&quot;
std::vector&lt;name&gt; author_names = 
evaluate(root, catalog_ » DescendantsOf(catalog_, author_)
 » Select(author_, [](const author &amp; a) { return a.country() == &quot;England&quot;; })
 » name_);

<doc id="275752" wikidata="Q3362247" url="?curid=275752" title="Franco-Swedish War">
<text>The Franco-Swedish War or Pomeranian War was the first involvement by Sweden in the Napoleonic Wars. The country joined the Third Coalition in an effort to defeat France under Napoleon Bonaparte.

==Background==
In 1803, the United Kingdom had declared war on France, and Sweden remained neutral, together with Denmark–Norway and Prussia. However, after the execution of Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé in 1804, the Swedish government broke all diplomatic ties with France and concluded a convention to allow the British to use Swedish Pomerania as a military base against France in exchange for payments. Russia also promised Sweden that 40,000 men would come to the aid of the country if it was threatened by French forces. Therefore, on 9 August 1805 Sweden joined the Third Coalition and declared war on France on 31 October.

==The war==
===Offensive against Hanover===
In early November 1805, a combined British, Russian and Swedish force of about 12,000 men were sent from Swedish Pomerania to liberate French-held Hanover. The offensive against Hanover was repeatedly delayed because of Prussia&#x27;s partial reluctance for the Swedes and the Russians to move troops through Prussian territory. However, in December 1805, after the Battle of Austerlitz, the British and the Russian forces started to evacuate Hanover and left only a small Swedish force alone to face the French. In April 1806, the Swedes were also forced to retreat to Swedish Pomerania after an agreement had been concluded between Prussia and France.

===Fourth Coalition===
However, during the summer of 1806 Prussia formed the Fourth Coalition against France, which gave Sweden the right to occupy Saxe-Lauenburg. In the autumn, the French forces advanced rapidly and soon much of the western German regions were occupied, which forced the Swedish troops on a retreat towards Lübeck. The plan was for the troops from there to take the sea route to Stralsund to avoid the advancing French forces. The Swedes were still caught by the French on the 6 November while they loaded their ships at Lübeck, and after the Battle of Lübeck, about 1,000 Swedish soldiers had to surrender to the numerically-superior French forces.

The French Army began its offensive towards Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and besieged Stralsund on 15 January. That began a seven-month siege, and since the French forces were engaged in warfare elsewhere as well, the number of troops stationed around Stralsund was gradually reduced. When the Swedes were reinforced on 1 April, a decision was made to attempt to break the siege. That was done with some success since the Swedes managed to take Usedom and Wolin, but the French chose to counterattack, and a force of 13,000 men attacked the Swedes from Stettin on 16 April and forced the left section of the Swedish army to withdraw. Another division in Ueckermünde was then cut off and later captured. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed on a ceasefire according to which the French were to leave Pomerania. However, the Swedish government refused to join the Continental System and denounced the armistice under the influence of British diplomacy on 8 July.

On 6 August 1807, 50,000 French, Spanish and Dutch troops under Marshal Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune began an assault on Swedish Pomerania and besieged Stralsund again. On 20 August 1807, the defenders of the city capitulated and the remains of the Swedish Army were surrounded at Rügen. However, Swedish General Johan Christopher Toll managed to conclude the Convention of Schlatkow with Marshal Brune on favourable terms, and his forces withdrew to Sweden, along with all of their war munitions, on 7 September.

===Treaty of Tilsit===

The Franco-Russian Treaty of Tilsit left Britain and Sweden without other allies in the war against France. On 21 February 1808, Russia joined the war against Sweden by invading Finland and on 14 March the same year, Denmark-Norway also declared war on Sweden. Danish, French and Spanish troops began preparations for an invasion of Skåne in Sweden, but the plan was soon aborted, and the war was instead directed to the Norwegian-Swedish border. Sir John Moore&#x27;s expedition, sent by the British government to protect Sweden from possible French-Danish attack, arrived on 3 May 1808 and stayed until July, when it was redirected to Portugal.

Napoleon&#x27;s plans to invade Sweden were never executed because of the British activity on the Baltic Sea, the weakness of the Danish military and the hesitations of French Marshal Bernadotte, whose actions made him popular enough to be elected as a Swedish Crown Prince after the coup d&#x27;etat in March 1809. On 30 August 1809, the new Swedish government was to conclude the Treaty of Fredrikshamn with Russia, which legitimised the Russian annexation of Finland and Åland. A peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark-Norway was signed with no territorial adjustments on 10 December 1809.

==Aftermath==
On 6 January 1810, Sweden signed a Russian-mediated Treaty of Paris with France, regaining Pomerania at a cost of joining the Continental System. On 17 November 1810, Sweden was forced to declare war on Britain, and all British goods in Swedish Pomerania were seized. The government-supported smuggling continued, however, over the North Sea, and the Royal Navy was informed that it would be a phantom war. The war lasted until 1812, but no military action was taken.

<text>The Ozark Patriots were based in Ozark, Alabama. In 2002 they were members of the Southeastern League of Professional Baseball. They played their home games in Ozark, Alabama, at historic Eagle Stadium, which was constructed in 1946. A few Patriot standouts were Sergio Cairo, Matt Morrison, Junior Braddy, Cortney Jenkins, Steve Crampton, and Ty Ryburn.

==History==
Eagle Stadium is a baseball stadium where the Ozark Patriots played here before folding midway through the 2002 season. Professional baseball was also played here in the 1940s and 1950s as part of the Alabama-Florida League. The park features a small, covered grandstand that contains all bench seating and seats about 1,200. The dimensions of the field are huge here as center field is 440 feet from home plate. It is currently used for high school, American Legion, and special event baseball games.

<text>The Treaty of Paris, signed on 6 January 1810, ended the Franco-Swedish War after Sweden&#x27;s defeat by Russia, an ally of France, in the Finnish War of 1808–1809. 

==History==
Russia had been an ally of Sweden in the Third and Fourth Coalitions against France but, after Russia&#x27;s defeat at Friedland, joined France and attacked Sweden to compel it to join Napoleon I&#x27;s Continental System. The primary result of the treaty was Sweden&#x27;s agreement to join the Continental System so that Sweden would not trade with the United Kingdom. 

Shortly after the treaty was signed, on 21 August 1810, one of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, was elected crown prince of Sweden, and he went on to found the House of Bernadotte, which remains the Royal House of Sweden. The peace resulting from the treaty lasted until Napoleon&#x27;s refusal to permit Sweden to annex Norway, which was then under the sovereignty of Denmark, an ally of France. That was followed in January 1812 by the French occupation of Swedish Pomerania for violating the Continental System since Sweden was still trading with the United Kingdom. In April 1812, Sweden signed the Treaty of Petersburg with Russia against France.

<text>The Dendermonde–Puurs Steam Railway (&quot;Stoomtrein Dendermonde-Puurs&quot;) is a heritage railway situated in the Belgian provinces of East Flanders (&quot;Oost-Vlaanderen&quot;) and Antwerp (&quot;Antwerpen&quot;).

It runs from the town of Dendermonde to the town of Puurs over about 14 km of (standard gauge) track. The railway is maintained by SDP, a non-profit historical railway society. SDP, which stands for &quot;Stoomtrein Dendermonde Puurs&quot;, or &quot;Steam train Dendermonde Puurs &quot;, has a depot at the railway station in Baasrode-Noord. The trains are pulled by both steam and diesel locomotives.

The railway has been used occasionally by various film and television production companies to shoot movie scenes that are too elaborate to be filmed on the Belgian national railway network because of the potential disruption to traffic. The best known example of a movie that includes several scenes shot on the railway is &quot;Toto le Héros&quot;.
