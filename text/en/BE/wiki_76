<text>Irene Maxine Pepperberg (born April 1, 1949) is an American scientist noted for her studies in animal cognition, particularly in relation to parrots. She has been a professor, researcher and/or lecturer at multiple universities, and she is currently an Adjunct Research Professor at Boston University. Pepperberg also serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). She is well known for her comparative studies into the cognitive fundamentals of language and communication, and she was one of the first to work on language learning in animals other than primate species (exemplified by the Washoe project), by extension to a bird species. Pepperberg is also active in wildlife conservation, especially in relation to parrots.

==Early life, family and education==
Born in 1949 as Irene Platzblatt in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, she was an only child. Her father, Robert Platzblatt, was a biochemist and middle school teacher. Her parents were both first-generation American Jews. Her mother&#x27;s parents were from Romania, and her father&#x27;s from Lithuania. In the 1950s, the family resided in Brooklyn in an apartment above a store, and beginning at a very young age, Irene would own and train a series of budgies.

She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, and brought one of her budgies there with her. She subsequently earned a master&#x27;s degree in Chemistry in 1971 at Harvard University, followed by a doctorate in Chemical Physics in 1976 at Harvard. During her doctoral program, she saw an episode of the PBS TV series &quot;Nova&quot; about animals and language, which influenced her to focus on that instead of chemistry.

==Work history==
Pepperberg has been a researcher, lecturer and adjunct or visiting professor at multiple universities. She was a research associate and lecturer at Purdue University (1979–1984) and Harvard University (in the 1970s and since 2005). At the MIT Media Lab, she has been a visiting associate professor (1999–2000) and researcher (2001–02). While at Purdue, she was involved in the biological sciences and psychological sciences departments. At University of Arizona, she was an associate professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with joint appointment in the psychology department and in the neuroscience program (1991–2000). She has been a Bunting Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study (2004–2005) and an adjunct associate professor at Brandeis University (2002–2013), where its bird laboratory was named for her.

== Research work ==

Although parrots have long been known for their capacities in vocal mimicry, Pepperberg set out to show that their vocal behavior could have the characteristics of human language. She worked intensively with a single grey parrot, Alex, and reported that he acquired a large vocabulary and used it in a sophisticated way, which is often described as similar to that of a four-year-old child. Alex could understand labels to describe objects, colors, shapes, and materials. Pepperberg and her colleagues sought to show that Alex could differentiate meaning and syntax, so that his use of vocal communication was unlike the relatively inflexible forms of &quot;instinctive&quot; communication that are widespread in the animal kingdom. Although such results are always likely to be controversial, and working intensively with a single animal always incurs the risk of Clever Hans effects, Pepperberg&#x27;s work has strengthened the argument that humans do not hold the monopoly on the complex or semi-complex use of abstract communication. With interspecies communication, Pepperberg speculated that grey parrots are comparable to primates, having similar social systems.

Some researchers believe that the training method that Pepperberg used with Alex, (called the model/rival technique) holds promise for teaching autistic and other learning-disabled children who have difficulty learning language and communication skills, numerical concepts and empathy. When some autistic children were taught using the same methods Pepperberg devised to teach parrots, their response exceeded expectations.

From work with the single subject Alex, Pepperberg and her colleagues have gone on to study additional grey parrots, and also parrots of other species. Other notable parrot subjects of her research have been Griffin, Arthur, and Athena. Alex was found dead on the morning of September 6, 2007, and was seemingly healthy the previous day. On September 10, 2007, Alex&#x27;s necropsy revealed no discernible cause of death.

== Model/rival technique ==

The model/rival technique involves two trainers, one to give instructions, and one to model correct and incorrect responses and to act as the student&#x27;s rival for the trainer&#x27;s attention; the model and trainer also exchange roles so that the student sees that the process is fully interactive. The parrot, in the role of student, tries to reproduce the correct behavior.

The use of this model/rival technique resulted in Alex identifying objects by color, shape, number and material at about the level of chimpanzees and dolphins. His language abilities were equivalent to those of a 2-year-old child and he had the problem solving skills of a 5-year-old. Alex was learning the alphabet, had a vocabulary of 150 words, knew the names of 50 objects and could count up to eight when he died. He could also answer questions about objects.

Pepperberg countered critics&#x27; claims that Alex had been taught a script by explaining that the controls and tests she used made it impossible for him simply to recite words when she asked questions. The Clever Hans effect did not apply, she argued, as Alex would talk to anyone, not just to her. Building on Pepperberg&#x27;s research, cognitive scientist Michael Trestman has argued that scaffolding and modeling, both approaches that the model/rival technique utilizes, can account for the cognitive evolution in humans, including &quot;language, advanced social cognition, and elaborate forms of tool craft.&quot;

Pepperberg&#x27;s implementation of the model rival technique has been used to successfully train several other parrots, such as Apollo.

==The Alex Foundation==

Pepperberg is president of The Alex Foundation, a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, which she started. The foundation supports Pepperberg and her team&#x27;s research. In a 2006 interview, Pepperberg said that the foundation was her only funding source, having lost her paid research position due to a funding crunch at MIT&#x27;s Media Lab, although the reporter of that interview does not mention her research associate position at Harvard University since 2005. The Alex Foundation raises money through donations, from direct sale of parrot-related gifts, and indirectly from sales through sponsoring businesses.

==AI research==
Some researchers have suggested that studying avian cognition might allow a useful artificial intelligence to be built without requiring as much resources, as for some applications a parrot or corvid level complexity brain would be adequate such as for image sorting. In recent years it was found that pigeons could sort CT scan data as well as microscope slides with equal or better accuracy than a human expert with only weeks of behavioral training needed.

== Personal life ==
Pepperberg was married for more than 20 years to David Pepperberg, a neuroscientist. They divorced in 1997.

<doc id="288500" wikidata="Q2740168" url="?curid=288500" title="Version 7 Unix">
<text>Version 7 Unix, also called Seventh Edition Unix, Version 7 or just V7, was an important early release of the Unix operating system. V7, released in 1979, was the last Bell Laboratories release to see widespread distribution before the commercialization of Unix by AT&amp;T Corporation in the early 1980s. V7 was originally developed for Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-11 minicomputers and was later ported to other platforms.

==Overview==
Unix versions from Bell Labs were designated by the edition of the user&#x27;s manual with which they were accompanied. Released in 1979, the Seventh Edition was preceded by Sixth Edition, which was the first version licensed to commercial users. Development of the Research Unix line continued with the Eighth Edition, which incorporated development from 4.1BSD, through the Tenth Edition, after which the Bell Labs researchers concentrated on developing Plan 9.

V7 was the first readily portable version of Unix. As this was the era of minicomputers, with their many architectural variations, and also the beginning of the market for 16-bit microprocessors, many ports were completed within the first few years of its release. The first Sun workstations (then based on the Motorola 68000) ran a V7 port by UniSoft; the first version of Xenix for the Intel 8086 was derived from V7 and Onyx Systems soon produced a Zilog Z8000 computer running V7. The VAX port of V7, called UNIX/32V, was the direct ancestor of the popular 4BSD family of Unix systems.

The group at the University of Wollongong that had ported V6 to the Interdata 7/32 ported V7 to that machine as well. Interdata sold the port as Edition VII, making it the first commercial UNIX offering.

DEC distributed their own PDP-11 version of V7, called V7M (for modified). V7M, developed by DEC&#x27;s original Unix Engineering Group (UEG), contained many enhancements to the kernel for the PDP-11 line of computers including significantly improved hardware error recovery and many additional device drivers. UEG evolved into the group that later developed Ultrix.

==Reception==
Due to its power yet elegant simplicity, many old-time Unix users remember V7 as the pinnacle of Unix development and have dubbed it &quot;the last true Unix&quot;, an improvement over all preceding and following Unices. At the time of its release, though, its greatly extended feature set came at the expense of a decrease in performance compared to V6, which was to be corrected largely by the user community.

The number of system calls in Version 7 was only around 50, while later Unix and Unix-like systems continued to add many more:

==Released as free software==

In 2002, Caldera International released V7 as FOSS under a permissive BSD-like software license.

Bootable images for V7 can still be downloaded today, and can be run on modern hosts using PDP-11 emulators such as SIMH.

An x86 port has been developed by Nordier &amp; Associates.

Paul Allen maintained several publicly accessible historic computer systems, including a PDP-11/70 running Unix Version 7.

==New features in Version 7==
Many new features were introduced in Version 7.
*Programming tools: lex, lint, and make.

The Portable C Compiler (pcc) was provided along with the earlier, PDP-11-specific, C compiler by Ritchie.

These first appeared in the Research Unix lineage in Version 7, although early versions of some of them had already been picked up by PWB/UNIX.

*New commands: the Bourne shell, at, awk, calendar, f77, fortune, tar (replacing the tp command), touch
*Networking support, in the form of uucp and Datakit
*New system calls: access, acct, alarm, chroot (originally used to test the V7 distribution during preparation), exece, ioctl, lseek (previously only 24-bit offsets were available), umask, utime
*New library calls: The new stdio routines, malloc, getenv, popen/system
*Environment variables
*A maximum file size of just over one gigabyte, through a system of indirect addressing

===Multiplexed files===
A feature that did not survive long was a second way (besides pipes) to do inter-process communication: multiplexed files. A process could create a special type of file with the codice_1 system call; other processes could then open this file to get a &quot;channel&quot;, denoted by a file descriptor, which could be used to communicate with the process that created the multiplexed file. Mpx files were considered experimental, not enabled in the default kernel, and disappeared from later versions, which offered sockets (BSD) or CB UNIX&#x27;s IPC facilities (System V) instead (although mpx files were still present in 4.1BSD).

<text>Computers and Typesetting is a 5-volume set of books by Donald Knuth published in 1986 describing the TeX and Metafont systems for digital typography. Knuth&#x27;s computers and typesetting project was the result of his frustration with the lack of decent software for the typesetting of mathematical and technical documents. The results of this project include TeX for typesetting, Metafont for font construction and the Computer Modern typefaces that are the default fonts used by TeX. In the series of five books Knuth not only describes the TeX and Metafont languages (volumes A and C), he also describes and documents the source code (in the WEB programming language) of the TeX and Metafont interpreters (volumes B and D), and the source code for the Computer Modern fonts used by TeX (volume E). The book set stands as a tour de force demonstration of literate programming.

The books themselves were typeset in the Computer Modern Roman typeface using TeX; thus, in Knuth&#x27;s words, they &quot;belong to the class of sets of books that describe precisely their own appearance&quot;.

==Volumes==
The five volumes are published by Addison-Wesley.
# Volume A: The TeXbook. &quot;Describes the TeX typesetting language.&quot; It is by far the most common and available of the set, as the TeX interpreter is widely used for typesetting. It is available in softcover (blue spiral-bound with a built-in flap for a bookmark) and hardcover .
# Volume B: TeX: The program. &quot;A documented listing of the source code of the TeX interpreter.&quot; The 1986 edition in hardcover is .
# Volume C: The METAFONTbook. &quot;Describes the METAFONT font description language.&quot; Hardcover , softcover .
# Volume D: Metafont: The program. &quot;A documented listing of the source code of the Metafont interpreter.&quot; Hardcover , paperback .
# Volume E: Computer Modern Typefaces. &quot;A character-by-character listing (in the Metafont language) of the source code for the Computer Modern typefaces (cmr, cmbx, cmti, etc.) used by TeX.&quot; Hardcover , softcover .
The set is also available as a hardcover boxed set with the latest editions as of the year 2000, .

A jubilee edition of the Volumes A to D was published by Addison-Wesley in February 2021, incorporating all the changes made during the TeX tune-up of 2021. (Volume E remained unchanged from the 2017 edition.)

<text>iDVD is a discontinued Mac application made by Apple, which can be used to create DVDs.

iDVD lets users design DVD menus (like a main menu and chapter selection menu) and burn movies, slideshows, and music onto a DVD that can be played on a commercial DVD player. It was created as part of Apple&#x27;s &quot;digital hub&quot; strategy, as a companion tool to iMovie. Early versions were received positively, but later versions languished as internet video overtook DVDs, and iDVD was abandoned in 2011.

== Features ==
iDVD includes over 150 Apple-designed themes. Themes set the layout, background art, typography, and soundtrack for DVD menus and submenus, and each theme includes a main DVD menu, a chapter navigation menu, and an Extras screen. Users can customize the fonts, add freeform text boxes, and change the position and style of buttons. (In iDVD, the term &quot;button&quot; refers to thumbnails like &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Scene Selection&quot; in DVD menus, that can take viewers to different parts of the movie; these buttons can be selected with the TV remote when playing a burned disc.)

Most themes include &quot;drop zones,&quot; decorative placeholders for movies, slideshows, or individual photos. On the burned disc, these &quot;drop zone&quot; movies and slideshows play on a loop while viewers are in a menu. Depending on the selected theme, each menu screen can have between 6 and 12 buttons. If users add more movies than can fit on one screen, iDVD adds submenus to fit those new movies. Users can also manually create submenus. Each menu can have its own theme.

iDVD integrated tightly with the rest of the iLife suite. iMovie projects and iPhoto slideshows can be exported from those applications to iDVD. In the case of iMovie projects, scene selection menus are automatically created in accordance with chapter markers that were set within iMovie. iDVD&#x27;s Media panel can be used to import media from the user&#x27;s iTunes library, iPhoto library, and Movies folder. iDVD also has a Map view, which shows a flow chart of the project&#x27;s menu hierarchy. The Map view includes an Autoplay tile, and any video dragged onto that tile will automatically play when the DVD is inserted into a player, before the menu appears; the DVD may consist of nothing but Autoplay material, and hence contain no menus. A menu bar button lets users enable gridlines showing the TV-safe area (as old televisions often cut off some of a video&#x27;s outer areas). iDVD also incorporates a &quot;OneStep DVD&quot; function, which automatically rewinds the connected miniDV-tape camcorder, imports its footage, and directly burns it to a DVD.

== History ==

=== Background ===
iDVD was part of Apple&#x27;s push into digital video in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Apple had already released iMovie, and Steve Jobs thought users would want to burn their iMovie projects onto a DVD to show their movies to friends and family. Apple executives decided to add DVD-R drives to Macintoshes and make a simple tool to burn these movies. In April 2000, Apple bought Astarte&#x27;s DVD department and used their software as the basis for DVD Studio Pro, while also creating a simpler version for consumers, iDVD. One of the acquired Astarte employees was Mike Evangelist, responsible for iDVD&#x27;s product marketing and design. Jobs rejected Evangelist&#x27;s early design proposal in favor of a simpler single-window interface.

=== Announcement ===

Steve Jobs introduced iDVD at Macworld Expo SF in January 2001, as a companion tool to iMovie. The intended workflow was for users to be able to record footage with a digital camcorder, import it and edit it in iMovie, and then use iDVD to add DVD menus and burn their movie to a writable DVD. iDVD was bundled with Power Mac G4 models with a SuperDrive, and Apple also began selling writable DVDs for $10 each. Simultaneously with iDVD, Apple announced DVD Studio Pro, a DVD authoring tool for professional users sold separately from Final Cut Pro.

iDVD 1 had a brushed-metal, single-window interface, and includes pre-made themes, as well as the ability to create custom themes. It encoded movies to the MPEG2 format required by DVD players, using the PowerPC G4&#x27;s AltiVec SIMD execution unit (called the &quot;Velocity Engine&quot; by Apple). According to Apple, encoding an hour-long DVD with the Velocity Engine would take 2 hours, as opposed to 25 hours with software encoders. During the keynote where he introduced iDVD, Jobs criticized competitors&#x27; predictions that the personal computer was &quot;yesterday&#x27;s platform&quot; and would be supplanted by internet-connected mobile devices. Instead, Jobs said the PC would become the &quot;digital hub&quot; linking these peripherals, including camcorders and DVD players. iDVD 1 could not burn movies longer than an hour.

=== Updates ===
iDVD 2 increased the maximum movie length to 90 minutes. iDVD 3 gained support for movie chapters, and &quot;drop zones&quot; where users can replace a theme&#x27;s default photos and video clips by dragging and dropping their own. iDVD 4 extended the maximum movie length from 90 minutes to 2 hours, by adopting the same MPEG encoding techniques as Apple&#x27;s DVD Studio Pro and Final Cut Pro. It also added the Autoplay tile and the Map view showing a hierarchy of all menus. iDVD 5 added support for DVD±RW, and gained the &quot;OneStep DVD&quot; feature, which could automatically rewind the tape of a connected camcorder, import its footage, and burn it to a DVD. iDVD 5.0.1 added support for burning double-layer (DVD+R DL) discs with compatible SuperDrives; French Mac news site &quot;MacBidouille&quot; found a way to enable double-layer mode with third-party drives, and described the restriction as arbitrary. iDVD 6 added widescreen support, and a &quot;Magic iDVD&quot; feature that automatically chose a theme and arranged clips and photos. iDVD &#x27;08 gained new themes and a &quot;Professional Quality&quot; setting, which does a 2-pass variable bitrate encoding. The Professional Quality setting improves colors and sharpness, and can fit a two-hour long movie onto a single-layer DVD.

iDVD received no new features or themes after version &#x27;08.

== Reception ==
After the announcement, Andrew Gore described iDVD as &quot;the most easily misunderstood new product&quot; Apple announced in January but predicted that iDVD &quot;will be to DVD-R what iTunes is to CD-RW&quot;. In the following years, several news outlets described the reaction to iDVD as positive. &quot;Macworld&quot; and &quot;EMedia&quot; magazine said that iDVD would help popularize DVD authoring among the masses.

In a three-part review of the first version, Jason Snell said it was easy to use but buggy. CNET rated iDVD 2 a 7/10, criticizing the need to switch to iMovie to edit footage and the inability to burn DVDs with third-party DVD drives. CNET reported several bugs with iDVD 4, and iDVD 5. Reviewing iDVD 5, PCMag gave it 4.5 stars, and said its burning speed was superior to most competing apps. In a 2006 review of iDVD 6, reporter Jeff Carlson described iDVD&#x27;s preview as choppy, even on a fast Mac, but said that this didn&#x27;t affect playback of the burned disc on a DVD player. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; criticized iDVD 6&#x27;s performance and menu customization features.

In 2007, &quot;Macworld&quot; Jeff Carlson called iDVD an &quot;afterthought&quot; and framed its future as an open question, after Steve Jobs unenthusiastically referred to &quot;people who still want to make DVDs&quot; in a media event. Apple executives and Gartner researcher Mike McGuire said that the neglect of iDVD and DVD Studio Pro was caused by reduced customer interest following the rise of internet video. In 2009, &quot;Ars Technica&quot; described iDVD as a &quot;quaint anachronism as more and more video is shared and streamed online&quot;. Several outlets noted that iDVD was not mentioned during the iLife &#x27;09 keynote presentation, and was not mentioned on the iLife &#x27;09 retail box despite being included in the bundle.

== Limitations ==
Until version 3.0.1, iDVD could only run on Macs with a built-in SuperDrive. In July 2002, Apple-certified vendor Other World Computing, which sold third-party external DVD drives, released a &quot;DVD Enabler&quot; patch that allowed iDVD to work with their Mercury Pro drive and presented iDVD compatibility as a selling point. In response, Apple threatened a DMCA lawsuit, and OWC backed down, withdrawing DVD Enabler. Journalists criticized the SuperDrive restriction, with &quot;Ars Technica&quot; editor-in-chief calling it a &quot;scheme to promote hardware sales&quot;.

iDVD 3.0.1 gained the ability to run on Macs without a SuperDrive, though on these machines, it could only create and save projects, not burn them to a disc. iDVD 5 remained unable to burn DVDs with third-party drives, though it gained the ability to save finished projects as a disk image, which could be burned with third-party drives using other applications like Roxio Toast. iDVD 6 added the ability to burn DVDs with third-party drives.

== Availability ==
iDVD 1 only worked on Mac OS 9, while later versions only ran on Mac OS X.

Until 2011, iDVD was bundled with all new Macs that had a SuperDrive. iDVD was no longer preinstalled on Macs shipping with OS X 10.7 Lion, and was not available on the Mac App Store unlike other iLife apps. It was, however, still available in the boxed copy of iLife &#x27;11. Since iDVD is a 32-bit application, it is not compatible with macOS 10.15 Catalina. Alternatives include Toast Titanium, and a free and open-source application called Burn.

<text>Software art is a work of art where the creation of software, or concepts from software, play an important role; for example software applications which were created by artists and which were intended as artworks. As an artistic discipline software art has attained growing attention since the late 1990s. It is closely related to Internet art since it often relies on the Internet, most notably the World Wide Web, for dissemination and critical discussion of the works. Art festivals such as FILE Electronic Language International Festival (São Paulo), Transmediale (Berlin), Prix Ars Electronica (Linz) and readme (Moscow, Helsinki, Aarhus, and Dortmund) have devoted considerable attention to the medium and through this have helped to bring software art to a wider audience of theorists and academics.

<text>An unobservable (also called impalpable) is an whose existence, nature, properties, qualities or relations are not directly observable by humans. In philosophy of science, typical examples of &quot;unobservables&quot; are the force of gravity, causation and beliefs or desires. The distinction between &quot;observable&quot; and &quot;unobservable&quot; plays a central role in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s distinction between noumena and phenomena as well as in John Locke&#x27;s distinction between primary and secondary qualities. There is considerable disagreement about which objects should be classified as unobservable, for example, whether bacteria studied using microscopes or positrons studied using cloud chambers count as unobservable. Different notions of unobservability have been formulated corresponding to different types of obstacles to their observation.

== Kant on noumena ==
The distinction between &quot;observable&quot; and &quot;unobservable&quot; is similar to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s distinction between noumena and phenomena. Noumena are the things-in-themselves, i.e., raw things in their necessarily unknowable state, before they pass through the formalizing apparatus of the senses and the mind in order to become perceived objects, which he refers to as &quot;phenomena&quot;. According to Kant, humans can never know noumena; all that humans know is the phenomena.

== Locke on primary and secondary qualities ==
Kant&#x27;s distinction is similar to John Locke&#x27;s distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Secondary qualities are what humans perceive such as redness, chirping, heat, mustiness or sweetness. Primary qualities would be the actual qualities of the things themselves which give rise to the secondary qualities which humans perceive.

== Philosophy of science ==
The ontological nature and epistemological issues concerning unobservables are central topics in philosophy of science. The theory that unobservables posited by scientific theories exist is referred to as scientific realism. It contrasts with instrumentalism, which asserts that we should withhold ontological commitments to unobservables even though it is useful for scientific theories to refer to them.

The notion of observability plays a central role in constructive empiricism. According to van Fraassen, the goal of scientific theories is not truth about all entities but only truth about all observable entities. If a theory is true in this restricted sense, it is called an &quot;empirically adequate&quot; theory. Van Fraassen characterizes observability counterfactually: &quot;X is observable if there are circumstances which are such that, if X is present to us under those circumstances, then we observe it&quot;.

A problem with this and similar characterizations is to determine the exact extension of what is unobservable. There is little controversy that regular everyday-objects that we can perceive without any aids are observable. Such objects include e.g. trees, chairs or dogs. But controversy starts with cases where unaided perception fails. This includes cases like using telescopes to study distant galaxies, using microscopes to study bacteria or using cloud chambers to study positrons.

Some philosophers have been motivated by these and similar examples to question the value of the distinction between observable and unobservable in general.

== Kinds of unobservables ==
W. V. Metcalf distinguishes three kinds of unobservables. One is the logically unobservable, which involves a contradiction. An example would be a length which is both longer and shorter than a given length. The second is the practically unobservable, that which we can conceive of as observable by the known sense-faculties of man but we are prevented from observing by practical difficulties. The third kind is the physically unobservable, that which can never be observed by any existing sense-faculties of man.

<text>Iajuddin Ahmed (1 February 193110 December 2012) was the President of Bangladesh, serving from 6 September 2002 until 12 February 2009. 

With a doctorate in soil science, Ahmed became a full professor at the University of Dhaka and chairman of the department. Beginning in 1991, he started accepting appointments to public positions, as chairman of the Public Service Commission (1991 to 1993) and of the University Grants Commission (1995 to 1999). In 2002, he won election as president. In 2004, he helped establish the private university, Atish Dipankar University of Science and Technology (ADUST).

==Early life and education==
Ahmed obtained his BSc and MS at the University of Dhaka in 1952 and 1954, respectively. He later received his MS and PhD degrees in 1958 and 1962, respectively, from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the United States.

==Teaching==
Returning to the University of Dhaka, Ahmed joined the faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Soil Science. He moved up in the ranks until he became a full professor in the department. He held the posts at the university of chairman of the Soil Science Department of Dhaka University and dean of the Faculty of Biological Science, Dhaka University. He was also provost of Salimullah Muslim Hall.

Ahmed is credited with developing a process that preserved nutrients in soil and later released them according to the needs of the vegetation. In 1984, Professor Ahmed was a visiting professor at Cornell University in the United States and the German Technical University and University of Göttingen in Germany.

==Political career==
Ahmed was an adviser in the caretaker government of 1991. He was also chairman of the Public Service Commission from 1991 to 1993. He served as chairman of the University Grants Commission from 1995 to 1999.

During the 1990s, Professor Ahmed was the president of the Federation of University Teachers Association in Bangladesh (FUTA). He led the anti-autocratic movement.

===Presidency===
Ahmed became President of Bangladesh in 2002 after becoming the only candidate to register for presidential elections. By that time, the position of prime minister was considered the top political role in the Bangladesh government.

During his presidency, Ahmed directed the writing and publication of two books about the nation, &quot;Hundred Years of Bangabhaban&quot; and &quot;Bangabhabaner Shatabarsha.&quot; These were published in 2006 by Bangabhaban&#x27;s press wing, under the initiative of his advisor, Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury.

===Chief Advisor, 2006–2007 Caretaker Government===

According to the constitution, the immediate past Chief Justice is appointed as Chief Advisor during a caretaker government. After Justice KM Hasan declined the position, reportedly because of ill health, five other men were considered for the position.
The last option was for the President to take over, as provided for in the constitution. Ahmed was sworn in as the Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government at 8:00 pm (Bangladesh standard time) on 29 October 2006 after the main political parties failed to agree on another candidate. The opposition parties resisted his appointment, because he had been elected by the majority-BNP parliament. Iajuddin Ahmed as Chief Advisor was to oversee the forthcoming elections, planned for 22 January 2007, while continuing his responsibilities as president.

Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and her allies demanded Ahmed&#x27;s resignation, but he declined. At first, the Awami League and its allies announced they would boycott the planned election because of BNP influence.

The President&#x27;s advisor, Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, met with Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in an attempt to convince both parties to take part in the election. Finally on 23 December, they both agreed to participate in the 22 January 2007 polls. At the last minute, on 3 January, Awami League and its allies withdrew from the election, jeopardising the country&#x27;s stability. The European Union and UN withdrew its election overseers, saying AL&#x27;s actions made a fair election impossible.

Concerned that a one-party election would jeopardise the nation&#x27;s lucrative participation in United Nations&#x27; peacekeeping mission and that the caretaker government would have difficulty resisting takeover by the BNP, the military intervened on 11 January 2007. A group including General Moeen U Ahmed, Army Chief, persuaded Iajuddin Ahmed to declare a state of emergency and resign, appointing an Interim Chief Advisor. Opponents of the military intervention were concerned about the threat to democracy, but many others were relieved to have professional technocrats leading efforts to stabilise the country and reduce corruption in the government. On 12 January, Fakruddin, formerly with the World Bank, was appointed as Chief Advisor.

===Resignation as Chief Adviser===
On 11 January 2007, Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed resigned from his position as Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government, having already received the resignations of his advisors. He retained his position as president and responsibilities for the Defense Ministry in the caretaker government. He issued a statement acknowledging that the Election Commission and his government had been unable to achieve an election. He appointed the former Justice Fazlul Haque as Interim Chief Advisor and imposed a state of emergency. The next day, in consultation with the military, Ahmed appointed Fakhruddin Ahmed as the new Chief Advisor. He is a prominent banker who had been with the World Bank and Bangladesh National Bank.

Iajuddin Ahmed&#x27;s term as president was due to end on 5 September 2007. The government announced at that time that he would remain in office until after the national election (planned by then to be held by late 2008). This was to elect new members of parliament, who would elect a president.

The Awami League and its Grand Alliance won two-thirds of the seats in parliament. It formed a government in 2009, headed by Sheikh Hasina as prime minister. Ahmed left office on 12 February 2009, after Zillur Rahman, an Awami League leader, was sworn in to succeed him as President of Bangladesh.

==Bypass operation==
On the afternoon of 23 May 2006, President Ahmed was admitted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Dhaka. Sources said he was seriously ill and being treated by a team of elite doctors. On their advice, President Ahmed was taken to Singapore on Wednesday, 24 May 2006. The 75-year-old president underwent a successful by-pass heart operation at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. During President Ahmed&#x27;s illness and recovery, in May–July 2006, rumours were reported in the media that he had died, or was going to be removed.

==Personal life==
Ahmed and his second wife, Anwara Begum, adopted a son, Imtiaz Ahmed Babu. Ahmed also has children from his first marriage: Susan and Adam. He has a total of four grandchildren: Aurora, Beryl, Adam and Arin.

Imtiaz Babu was arrested on 9 January 2012 on assault charges, for having attacked the registrar at the Atish Dipankar University of Science and Technology, a private university founded by his father. Babu is on the trustee board of ADUST.

==Illness and death==
Ahmed had additional heart surgery on 28 October 2012. After developing kidney-related complications, he spent more than a month on life support before dying on 10 December 2012 at Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.

Statements of mourning were issued by President Zillur Rahman, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Leader of the Opposition Khaleda Zia and former Advisor to the President Mukhles Chowdhury. Iajudiin Ahmed&#x27;s body was transported to Dhaka from Bangkok on 12 December 2012.

Four &quot;namaz-e-janazas&quot; were held for him. His first was held in Bangkok on 11 December 2012, the second namaz-e-janaza at his ancestral home in Munshiganj on 13 December, the third janaza in Dhaka University Central Masjid, and the fourth and last one was at Baitul Mukarram national masjid. Ahmed was buried in Banani graveyard.

<doc id="288514" wikidata="Q1144339" url="?curid=288514" title="Pixie">
<text>A pixie (also called pisky, pixy, pixi, pizkie, piskie, or pigsie in parts of Cornwall and Devon) is a mythical creature of British folklore. Pixies are speculated to be particularly concentrated in the high moorland areas around Devon and Cornwall, suggesting some Celtic origin for the belief and name. However, the word &#x27;pixie&#x27; (under various forms) also appears in Dorset, Somerset and to a lesser extent in Sussex, Wiltshire and Hampshire.

Similar to the Irish and Scottish &quot;Aos Sí&quot; (also spelled &quot;Aos Sidhe&quot;), pixies are believed to inhabit ancient underground sites such as stone circles, barrows, dolmens, ringforts, or menhirs. In traditional regional lore, pixies are generally benign, mischievous, short of stature, and childlike; they are fond of dancing and wrestling outdoors, of which they perform through the night.

In the modern era, they are usually depicted with pointed ears, often wearing a green outfit and pointed hat. Traditional stories describe them as wearing dirty, ragged bundles of rags, which they discard for gifts containing new clothes. In other depictions, their eyes are described as being pointed upwards at the outer end. These, however, are Victorian era conventions and not part of the older mythology.

== Etymology and origin ==

The origin of the word &quot;pixie&quot; is uncertain. It could have come from the Swedish dialectal &quot;pyske&quot;, meaning &#x27;small fairy&#x27;. Others have disputed this, given there is no plausible case for Nordic dialectal records in southwest Britain, claiming instead—in view of the Cornish origin of the &quot;piskie&quot;—that the term is more Celtic in origin, though no clear ancestor of the word is known. The term &quot;Pobel Vean&quot; (Little People) is often used to refer to them collectively. Because of its location of origin, it is possible it comes from the Proto-Brythonic *bɨx, which has become bych, little, in Middle Welsh and bihan, in Breton. The change from b to p can be easily explained by a sandhi that occurs after the use of the old article or a pronoun.

Very similar analogues exist in closely related Irish (Aos Sí), Manx (Mooinjer veggey), Welsh Tylwyth Teg (&#x27;Fair Family&#x27;), and Breton (korrigan) culture. Although their common names are unrelated, there is a high degree of local variation of names. In west Penwith, the area of late survival of the Cornish language, &quot;spriggans&quot; are distinguished from pixies by their malevolent nature, while knockers are distinct for their association with tin mining in Cornwall.

Pixie mythology is believed to pre-date Christian presence in Britain. Romano-British Hooded Spirits &quot;genii cucullati&quot; are a possible ancient Celtic forebear—such dwarfish sprites wore traditional hooded cloaks associated with the British and concealed phallic daggers. In the Christian era, they were sometimes said to be the souls of children who had died unbaptised (similar to the belief in Limbo). These children would change their appearance to pixies once their clothing was placed in clay funeral pots used in their earthly lives as toys. A common idea in the Victorian era was that pixies were a folk memory of the Pictish people, but that has largely been disproven and is viewed in academia as Norse propaganda against the Picts This suggestion is still referenced in contemporary writing, but there is no proven connection, and the etymological basis is considered ambiguous. Some 19th-century researchers made more general claims about pixie origins, or have connected them with the Puck (Cornish Bucca), a mythological creature sometimes described as a fairy; the name Puck (Irish: Púca, Welsh: Pwca) is also of uncertain origin.

The earliest published version of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; story is from Dartmoor in 1853 and has three little pixies in place of the pigs. In older Westcountry dialect, modern Received Pronunciation letter pairs are sometimes transposed from the older Saxon spelling (&quot;waps&quot; for wasp, &quot;aks&quot; for ask, etc.) resulting in &quot;piskies&quot; in place of &quot;piksies&quot; (pixies) as commonly found in Devon and Cornwall in modern times.

Until the advent of contemporary fiction, pixie mythology was mostly localised to Britain. Some have noted similarities to &quot;northern fairies&quot;, Germanic and Scandinavian elves, or Nordic Tomte, but pixies are distinguished from them by the myths and stories of Devon and Cornwall.

=== Cornwall, Devon and Somerset ===
Before the mid-19th century, the towns Cornwall and Devon had numerous cultural depictions of pixies and fairies. Books devoted to the homely beliefs of the peasantry were filled with incidents of pixie manifestations. Some locales were named for the pixies associated with them. In Devon, near Challacombe, a group of rocks were named after the pixies said to dwell there. At Trevose Head in Cornwall, 600 pixies were said to have gathered dancing and laughing in a circle that had appeared upon the turf until one of them, named Omfra, lost his laugh. After searching amongst the barrows of the ancient kings of Cornwall on St Breock Downs, he wades through the bottomless Dozmary Pool on Bodmin Moor until his laugh is restored by King Arthur in the form of a Chough.

In the legends associated with Dartmoor, pixies (or &quot;piskeys&quot;) are said to disguise themselves as a bundle of rags to lure children. The pixies of Dartmoor are fond of music, dancing, and riding on Dartmoor colts. These pixies are generally said to be helpful for humans, sometimes helping needy widows and others with housework. They are not completely benign, however, as they have a reputation for misleading travellers known as being &quot;pixy-led&quot;, and it can be cured by turning a coat inside-out.

In some of the legends and historical accounts, they are presented as having an anthropomorphic stature. For instance, a member of the Elford family in Tavistock, Devon, successfully hid from Cromwell&#x27;s troops in a pixie house. Though the entrance has narrowed with time, the pixie house, a natural cavern on Sheep Tor, is still accessible.

At Buckland St. Mary, Somerset, pixies and fairies are said to have been in a war. The pixies were victorious and visit occasionally, whilst the fairies are said to have left after their loss.

By the early 19th century, their contact with humans had diminished. In Samuel Drew&#x27;s 1824 book &quot;Cornwall&quot;, Drew states: &quot;The age of pixies, like that of chivalry, is gone. There is, perhaps, at present hardly a house they are reputed to visit. Even the fields and lanes which they formerly frequented seem to be nearly forsaken. Their music is rarely heard.&quot;

==== Pixie Day ====
Pixie Day is an old tradition which takes place annually in June at the East Devon town of Ottery St. Mary. The day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the &quot;Pixie&#x27;s Parlour&quot;.

The Pixie Day legend originates from the early days of Christianity, when a local bishop decided to build a church in Otteri (Ottery St. Mary), and commissioned a set of bells, or bell ringers, to come from Wales, of whom were escorted by monks on their journey.

The pixies were worried, as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land. They cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to Otteri to the road leading them to the cliff&#x27;s edge at Sidmouth. Just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff, one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said &quot;God bless my soul&quot;, breaking the spell.

The bells were then brought to Otteri and installed. However, the pixies&#x27; spell was not completely broken; each year on a day in June, the &quot;pixies&quot; come out and capture the town&#x27;s bell ringers, later imprisoning them in Pixies&#x27; Parlour to be rescued by the Vicar of Ottery St. Mary. This legend is re-enacted each year by the Cub and Brownie groups of Ottery St. Mary, with a specially constructed Pixies&#x27; Parlour in the Town Square—the original Pixie&#x27;s Parlour can be found along the banks of the River Otter.

== Characteristics ==
Pixies are described in folklore and fiction in various ways, most commonly as ill-clothed or naked. In 1890, William Crossing noted a pixie&#x27;s preference for bits of finery: &quot;Indeed, a sort of weakness for finery exists among them, and a piece of ribbon appears to be... highly prized by them.&quot;

Some pixies are said to steal children or lead travellers astray. This seems to be a blend from fairy mythology not originally attached to pixies; in 1850, Thomas Keightley noted that much of Devon pixie mythology may have originated from fairy myth. Pixies are said to reward consideration and punish neglect on the part of larger humans, for which Keightley gives examples. By their presence, they bring blessings to those who are fond of them.

Pixies are said to have a spiritual connection to horses, riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses.

In mythology, pixies are sometimes said to be of human origin or to &quot;partake of human nature&quot;, in distinction to fairies whose mythology is traced to immaterial and malignant spirit forces. In some discussions, pixies are presented as wingless, pygmy-like creatures. However, this is probably a later accretion to the mythology.

One British scholar stated his belief that &quot;Pixies were evidently a smaller race, and, from the greater obscurity of the ... tales about them, I believe them to have been an earlier race.&quot;

=== Literary interpretations ===
Many Victorian-era poets saw pixies as magical beings. An example is Samuel Minturn Peck. In his poem, &quot;The Pixies&quot;, he writes:

:&#x27;Tis said their forms are tiny, yet
::All human ills they can subdue,
:Or with a wand or amulet
::Can win a maiden’s heart for you;
:And many a blessing know to stew
::To make to wedlock bright;
:Give honour to the dainty crew,
::The Pixies are abroad tonight.

The late 19th-century English poet Nora Chesson summarised pixie mythology in a poem entitled &quot;The Pixies&quot;. She gathered all the speculations and myths into verse:

Pixies are &quot;in-between&quot;, not cursed by God or especially blessed. They do the unexpected, they bless the land, and are forest creatures whom other wild creatures find alluring and non-threatening. They love humans, taking some for mates, and are nearly ageless. They are winged, flitting from place to place.

The Pixie Day tradition in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s hometown of Ottery St Mary in East Devon was the inspiration for his poem &quot;Songs of the Pixies&quot;.

The Victorian-era writer Mary Elizabeth Whitcombe divided pixies into tribes according to personality and deeds. The novelist Anna Eliza Bray suggested that pixies and fairies were distinct species.

<doc id="288515" wikidata="Q1133061" url="?curid=288515" title="Clone Wars">
<text>The Clone Wars, also known as the Separatist Crisis, is a fictional conflict in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise by George Lucas. Though mentioned briefly in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film (&quot;A New Hope&quot;, 1977), the war itself was not depicted until &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). The Clone Wars are also the setting for three eponymous projects: a 2D animated series (2003–2005), a 3D film (2008), and a 3D animated series (2008–2014, 2020). They have featured in numerous &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, comics and games.

Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; narrative, the Clone Wars involve a three-year war fought to prevent thousands of planetary systems from seceding from the Galactic Republic and joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS), colloqially referred to as the Separatists or Separatist Alliance. The Republic uses an army of clone troopers led by the Jedi Order against the Separatist battle droid army. The conflict was a scheme by the Republic&#x27;s Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious, seeking to implement the Sith&#x27;s long-term plans to wipe out all Jedi and take over the galaxy. Palpatine intended this by giving the clone troopers a secret executive command, &quot;Order 66&quot; (in the form of a control chip) embedded in their brains, instantly making clones perceive their Jedi officers as traitors and kill them. He succeeded in issuing the command in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; promptly leading to the deaths of numerous Jedi around the galaxy, allowing Palpatine to gain total power and ultimately convert the democratic Galactic Republic into the fascist autocratic Galactic Empire, a reign controlled through a military–industrial complex and featured in the original trilogy.

Lucas used the Clone Wars narrative to answer questions about the original trilogy, such as how the Empire originated and how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. The political and military events of the Clone Wars draw inspiration from such real-world conflicts and historical events, as transition of the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire, the American Civil War, the First and Second World Wars, as well as contemporary events such as the War on Terror and the Bush administration during the early 21st century.

== Concept and development ==
The first reference to the Clone Wars is in &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas&#x27; third draft of the first film, which mentions the grizzled cyborg General Kenobi&#x27;s &quot;diary of the Clone Wars&quot;. The wars were mentioned twice briefly in the final version of the film, referring to Obi-Wan Kenobi as a general who served Leia Organa&#x27;s (then-unnamed) father Bail Organa during the conflict. In drafting &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Lucas considered introducing a clone character who had been involved with the Clone Wars. Leigh Brackett&#x27;s first draft of the film initially developed Lando Calrissian as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in &quot;A New Hope&quot; and were nearly made extinct by the war. Boba Fett was also initially considered as being from a group of shocktroopers nearly wiped out by Jedi during the Clone Wars. However, these concepts were not included in the final version of the film. Lucas was more guarded about the details of the Clone Wars than any other element of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, even making them off-limits to licensed products and books.

Lucas has noted that Palpatine&#x27;s rise to power is similar to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany; as Chancellor of Germany, the latter was granted &quot;emergency powers&quot;, as is Palpatine. Lucas has also said that one of the primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars, and all of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; was the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action. In 2002, Lucas said:

The clone forces shown at the conclusion of &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; comprised the largest digital army created for a film at that point. Lucas proposed to concept artists that &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Lucas then radically re-organized the plot; instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin Skywalker. The absence of the &quot;seven battles on seven planets&quot; in part led to Lucas&#x27;s decision to launch the CGI-animated &quot;Clone Wars&quot; television series; Lucas said the cartoon could &quot;do better&quot; at depicting the conflict.

== Depiction ==

The Clone Wars was first depicted in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, the release of which brought an end to Lucas&#x27;s embargo on licensed material set during the era. Numerous novels, comic books, and video games exploring the conflict have been sanctioned by Lucas Licensing.

=== Film ===
The Clone Wars are first mentioned in &quot;A New Hope&quot; when Obi-Wan explains to Luke that his father fought in them, to which Luke expresses doubt. It is later mentioned by Leia in her message that Obi-Wan served her father, who will later be identified as Bail Organa, in the Clone Wars.

&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, set at the beginning of the Clone Wars, opens with the Galactic Republic&#x27;s rising concern about the secession of thousands of star systems to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which is publicly led by Count Dooku. Chancellor Palpatine manipulates Jar Jar Binks and the rest of the Galactic Senate into granting him emergency powers. Investigating two attempted assassinations of Senator Padmé Amidala, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers Dooku used the identity of a dead Jedi Master to secretly arrange the creation of a massive clone army on the Republic&#x27;s behalf. Yoda leads the clone army to rescue Obi-Wan, Padmé, and Anakin Skywalker from the Separatists on Geonosis, and the first battle of the war ensues. At the battle&#x27;s conclusion, Yoda declares: &quot;Begun, the Clone War has.&quot; In the final scene of the movie, Anakin and Padmé get married in secret, in violation of Anakin&#x27;s Jedi vows.

&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; shows the waning days of the three-year Clone Wars, in which clone troopers and their Jedi generals fought against the Separatist droid army. After killing Dooku and rescuing Palpatine from the Separatists during their assault on Coruscant, Anakin learns Padmé is pregnant. He becomes troubled by visions of her death in childbirth, and Palpatine lures Anakin to the dark side of the Force by promising to teach him how to prevent her premature demise. Meanwhile, Yoda is dispatched to Kashyyyk to stave off a Separatist invasion, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is dispatched to Utapau where he kills General Grievous. Anakin discovers Palpatine is the elusive Sith Lord Darth Sidious, but he defends him against Mace Windu because he needs Sidious&#x27; knowledge to save Padmé. After Sidious murders Windu, he dubs Anakin his new apprentice Darth Vader. Sidious orders the clone troopers to execute Order 66, and clones kill their Jedi generals across the galaxy. Sidious then dispatches Vader to the Jedi Temple along with several clone troopers to kill the remaining Jedi and Padawans in the temple, before sending Vader to kill the Separatist leaders on Mustafar and to issue a &quot;shutdown command&quot; to their droid army. With their demise, Sidious declares an end to the Clone Wars and the Republic&#x27;s reformation into the Galactic Empire.

=== Animation ===
==== &quot;Clone Wars&quot; ====

The 2D-animated &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series (2003–2005) depicts several Clone Wars battles and was meant to generate interest in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. It also depicts the prelude to the opening battle of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and Palpatine&#x27;s capture by General Grievous. It was released on home video in two volumes.

The original &quot;Clone Wars&quot; TV series is no longer considered canonical, since on 25 April 2014, The Walt Disney Company declared that all the existing &quot;Star Wars&quot; works and products except for the original and prequel films and the later &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; were now part of the separate &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity.

==== &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; ====

Several years later, Lucas chose to reboot the series as a 3D CGI series developed by Dave Filoni. After several years of production on the new television series, Lucas decided to spin off the first four episodes as a standalone film. The film, released in 2008, introduces Ahsoka Tano as Anakin&#x27;s apprentice and depicts the Republic and the Separatists battling and attempting to gain permission to travel through Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s territory.

The television series that followed (2008–2014, 2020) is likewise set against the backdrop of the Clone Wars, with the series finale taking place at the same time as the climax of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The show offers additional details about the clone army&#x27;s creation, establishes each of the clones as distinct characters, depicts numerous confrontations and developments from the conflict, and portrays the interaction between the clone troopers and their Jedi commanders. For example, the series reveals that each clone has an &quot;inhibitor chip&quot; in his body that makes most of them obey Order 66.

==== &quot;The Bad Batch&quot; ====

&quot;The Bad Batch&quot; begins shortly after the immediate end of the Clone Wars with the issuing of Order 66, which marks the Jedi as traitors and leads to their widespread extermination by their own clone troopers, who have been programmed to obey this order. The Bad Batch, being genetically distinct and having developed resistance to the programming, find themselves grappling with their identities and loyalties in the wake of the Republic&#x27;s demise. 

The series explores the fallout of Order 66, the rise of the Galactic Empire, and how the galaxy changes under Emperor Palpatine&#x27;s rule. The series also explores the transition from clone troopers to stormtroopers in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, as the Empire shifts from clone production to conscription

=== Live Action ===

==== &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; ====
The series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; features both flashback scenes to the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars, as well as Grogu&#x27;s memories of Order 66 on Coruscant. 

==== &quot;Ahsoka&quot; ====
The Clone Wars are featured in &quot;Ahsoka&quot; Episode 5, where a flashback suggests the scene occurs on Ryloth, referencing Ahsoka&#x27;s experiences in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, in live-action form. Additionally, scenes from the iconic Siege of Mandalore are featured.

=== Novels ===
The 2008 novelization of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; by Karen Traviss begins a series of five novels by Traviss and Karen Miller published by Del Rey Books between 2008 and 2010. &quot;The Clone Wars: Wild Space&quot; (2008) was written by Miller and focuses on Obi-Wan and Bail Organa. Traviss returned to write &quot;The Clone Wars: No Prisoners&quot; (2009), in which Ahsoka is temporarily assigned to Captain Rex. Finally, Miller wrote the two-part &quot;Clone Wars Gambit&quot; (2010), subtitled &quot;Stealth&quot; and &quot;Siege&quot;, which deals with a bioweapon threat by Neimoidian general Lok Durd.

&quot;Dark Disciple&quot; (2015) novelizes a story arc about Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos from eight unfinished episodes of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. &quot;&quot; (2016) is set during the Clone Wars and the subsequent couple of years. &quot;&quot; (2018) features flashbacks to the last year of the war featuring Anakin, Padmé, and Thrawn. &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (2022) is set during the Clone Wars, focusing on Obi-Wan and Anakin.

=== Comics ===

Dark Horse Comics published various comics set during the era, many of which were collected in a series of trade paperbacks over nine volumes. Dark Horse also published a ten-volume graphic novella series titled &quot;Clone Wars – Adventures&quot; (2004–07), utilizing the style of the 2D animated series and depicting original stories set during the era. A series of comics tying into the 3D animated series was released from 2008 to 2010, collected in three volumes, and was supplemented by an series of graphic novellas released between 2008 and 2013.

Marvel&#x27;s comic series &quot;Kanan&quot; (sometimes subtitled &quot;The Last Padawan&quot;) depicts the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; character Kanan Jarrus as Jedi Padawan Caleb Dume during the conflict.

=== Video games ===
LucasArts also produced video games like &quot;Republic Commando&quot; and &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; that depict the conflict.

==Analysis==
Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to World War II. Radio host Clyde Lewis&#x27; article on historical similarities in &quot;Star Wars&quot; claims that Palpatine&#x27;s tactics parallel those of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany; both leaders used wars and scapegoats to manipulate society&#x27;s emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power. Another writer compares the Clone Wars with World War II in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was a baby boomer, and the dark times featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain Cold War. Referring to Lucas&#x27;s statements that the conflict in &quot;Star Wars&quot; was inspired by the cultural backdrop of the Vietnam War, journalist Chris Taylor said the Clone Wars are a parallel to World War II. Anne Lancashire from the University of Toronto also points out some similar nomenclature between the Clone Wars and the American Civil War.

Several publications compared the political context of the Clone Wars to the Iraq War. In claiming that the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the United States, an editorial on Antiwar.com states that &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it&#x27;s right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting – that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own&quot;. Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that &quot;like Palpatine, the Bush administration has been able to feed on people&#x27;s fears to gain more power&quot;. Lucas stated that the Iraq war &quot;didn&#x27;t exist&quot; when he developed the Clone Wars, but he did see parallels between the Vietnam War that inspired &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the war in Iraq. &quot;Star Wars&quot; producer Rick McCallum corroborated that the Clone Wars was developed before the Iraq War, adding that Lucas &quot;is a product of Vietnam&quot;.

==Impact and critical response==

The author of &quot;How Star Wars Conquered the Universe&quot;, Chris Taylor, calls the Clone Wars &quot;a major part of Star Wars lore&quot;. In its attempt to keep its &quot;Star Wars&quot; line of toys active after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), Kenner devised a storyline that would involve the return of an exiled &quot;genetic terrorist&quot; and his Clone Warriors.

Timothy Zahn said the clones&#x27; unexpected appearance fighting for &quot;the good guys&quot; in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;—despite many years of fan speculation that the clones were an invading force—was &quot;wonderfully blindsid[ing]&quot;. After seeing the CGI &quot;Clone Wars&quot; television show, Zahn was grateful that Lucasfilm rejected his initial &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; draft, which involved an insane clone of Obi-Wan created during the conflict.

<text>Mail, also known as Apple Mail, is an email client included by Apple Inc. with its operating systems macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Mail grew out of NeXTMail, which was originally developed by NeXT as part of its NeXTSTEP operating system, after Apple&#x27;s acquisition of NeXT in 1997.

The current version of Mail utilizes SMTP for message sending, POP3, Exchange and IMAP for message retrieval and S/MIME for end-to-end message encryption. It is also preconfigured to work with popular email providers, such as Yahoo! Mail, AOL Mail, Gmail, Outlook and iCloud (formerly MobileMe) and it supports Exchange. iOS features a mobile version of Mail with added Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) support, though it notoriously missed the functionality of attaching files to reply emails until the release of iOS 9. EAS is not supported in the macOS version of Apple&#x27;s Mail app, the main issue being that sent messages will incorrectly be duplicated in the sent messages folder, which then propagates via sync to all other devices including iOS.

Features of Mail include the ability to configure the software to receive all of a user&#x27;s email accounts in the one list, ability to file emails into folders, ability to search for emails, and ability to automatically append signatures to outgoing emails. It also integrates with the Contacts list, Calendar, Maps and other apps.

==History==
===NeXTMail===
Mail was originally developed by NeXT as NeXTMail, the email application for its NeXTSTEP operating system. It supported rich text formatting with images and voice messaging, and MIME emails. It also supported a text-based user interface (TUI) to allow for backwards compatibility.

When Apple began to adapt NeXTSTEP to become Mac OS X, both the operating system and the application went through various stages as it was developed. In a beta version (codenamed &quot;Rhapsody&quot;) and various other early pre-releases of Mac OS X, Mail was known as MailViewer. However, with the third developer release of Mac OS X, the application had returned to being known simply as Mail.

===First release===
Mail was included in all versions of macOS up to and including Mac OS X Panther, which was released on October 24, 2003. It was integrated with other Apple applications such as Address Book, iChat, and iCal. Some of its features that remain in the most recent version of Mail include rules for mailboxes, junk mail filtering and multiple account management.

===Mac OS X Tiger (10.4)===
In Mac OS X Tiger (version 10.4), Mail version 2 included a proprietary single-message-per-file format (with the filename extension .emlx) to permit indexing by Spotlight. Additional features were:
* &quot;Smart mailboxes&quot; that used Spotlight technology to sort mail into folders.
* the ability to flag messages with a low, normal or high priority and to use these priorities in mailbox rules and smart mailboxes.
* tools for resizing photos before they are sent to avoid oversized email attachments.
* the ability to view emailed pictures as a full-screen slideshow.
* parental controls to specify who is allowed to send email to children.
* HTML message composition.

The new version also changed the UI for the buttons in the toolbar. Whereas previous buttons had free-standing defined shapes, the new buttons featured shapes within a lozenge-shaped capsule. According to many users, and even Apple&#x27;s own human interface guidelines at the time, this was worse for usability. An open-source third-party application that reverted the icons to their former shapes was available. Nevertheless, Apple updated their guidelines to include capsule-shaped buttons, and the new UI persisted.

===Mac OS X Leopard (10.5)===
In Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5), Mail version 3 included personalized stationery, handled in standard HTML format. In addition, it offered notes and to-dos (which could be synced with iCal) as well as a built-in RSS reader. It also introduced IMAP IDLE support for account inboxes.

===Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6)===
Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) brought Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 support.

===Mac OS X Lion (10.7)===
In Mac OS X Lion (version 10.7), Mail featured a redesigned iPad-like user interface with full-screen capabilities, an updated message search interface, support for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and Yahoo! Mail (via IMAP). Also added was the capability to group messages by subject in a similar fashion to Mail on iOS 4. The bounce function, where unwanted emails could be bounced back to the sender, was dropped, as was support for Exchange push email.

===OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)===
In OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8), Mail received VIP tagging, Safari-style inline search for words within an email message, the ability to sync with iCloud and new sharing features. Notes was split off into a stand-alone application. The RSS reader and to-dos were discontinued.

===OS X Mavericks (10.9)===
In OS X Mavericks (version 10.9), Mail ceased support for plain-text MIME multipart/alternative messages and solely retained the HTML or rich-text version.

===OS X Yosemite (10.10)===
In OS X Yosemite (version 10.10), Mail introduced Markup (inline annotation of PDF or image files) and Mail Drop (automatically uploads attachments to iCloud, and sends a link in the message instead of the whole file).

===OS X El Capitan (10.11)===
In OS X El Capitan (version 10.11), a filter was added to the message list to filter by various options such as Unread, Flagged, or messages with attachments. The conversation display was also redesigned and various disk space saving optimizations were implemented. Streaming notification support for Exchange accounts was also added.

=== macOS High Sierra (10.13) ===
In macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) Mail reached version 11.5, a version that was not further upgraded (in High Sierra, at least until 2021).

===macOS Mojave (10.14)===
Support for macOS&#x27;s new &quot;dark mode&quot; was added to Mail.

===macOS Catalina (10.15)===
Added support for Block Sender, Unsubscribe, Mute Thread and layout options.

===macOS Big Sur (11.0)===
In macOS Big Sur, Mail was updated alongside the other first-party apps to feature the new design language of Big Sur, with a full-height sidebar and updated icons that match the blue color of the app&#x27;s icon. The Mail app icon was changed to be more consistent with the iOS version, depicting a white envelope on a blue background, albeit with a more &quot;3D&quot; look that has the text &quot;Apple Park California 95014&quot; subtly etched on the envelope. Mail now also supports interactive notifications and integrates with the Reminders app to let Siri suggest possible reminders based on who you are emailing.

===macOS Monterey (12.0)===
Mail now has an option to block trackers in emails from viewing a user&#x27;s IP address and being notified of whether they have read an email. Extensions from the Mac App Store can now integrate with the Mail app, and iCloud+ subscribers can easily create a new email address that forwards to their primary address.

===macOS Ventura (13.0)===
Mail has been updated to include features from popular competitors, such as allowing a user to undo sending an email for up to 10, 20, or 30 seconds, scheduling an email to be sent at a user-set time, reminding the user to follow up to an email, and notifying the user to add an attachment or recipient if they seemed to forget to do themselves. Search has been improved by using synonyms for search terms and automatically correcting typos. It also shows shared content and previous search terms when invoked. Messages you sent which haven&#x27;t received a reply will also move to the top of the inbox to send a follow-up. Emails from companies now show their logo using BIMI support.

<text>iLife is a discontinued software suite for macOS and iOS developed by Apple Inc. It consists of various programs for media creation, organization, editing and publishing. At various times, it included: iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD, iWeb, and GarageBand. Only iMovie and GarageBand remain and are now freely available on Apple&#x27;s Mac App Store. iDVD and iWeb have been discontinued while iTunes and iPhoto have been succeeded by Music and Photos respectively.

iLife was preinstalled on new Mac computers and was previously also sold as a bundle on DVD. With the introduction of the Mac App Store, Apple discontinued the DVD bundle and turned to selling the apps separately. Photos, the app that superseded iPhoto, is now an essential part of macOS, while iMovie and GarageBand, although they ship pre-installed on any new Mac computer or iOS device, can be uninstalled if not needed. Updates for iLife apps purchased on the Mac App Store are available for free, while the pre-App Store model required buying the entire suite when a new version had been released.

==Origins==
iMovie has the longest legacy of the applications included with iLife. It was marketed by Apple as an easy-to-use video editing application that allowed novice users to quickly create professional-quality movies. The first version of the software was released in October 1999 and bundled with the iMac DV. On April 28, 2000, Apple began allowing users to download iMovie free of charge from its website. iMovie remained free until 2003, when it became part of the first iLife release, which was sold for $49. Apple continued to update and develop the existing iMovie software until the release of iLife &#x27;08 in 2007, when a new version, iMovie &#x27;08, was released. iMovie &#x27;08 was completely rewritten as a new application and introduced significant changes to the user interface.

iPhoto was the second application in iLife that began as a free application available for download from Apple&#x27;s website. The first version of iPhoto was announced at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo January 3, 2002, and released January 7, 2002. It was billed as being the &quot;missing link&quot; in photography. In addition to allowing users to import, organize, and perform basic edits on their photos, iPhoto also let users print photos in a variety of ways, including as a bound book. Subsequent versions of iPhoto have added a number of features, including automatic organization by events, faces (using facial recognition technology), and places. iPhoto also includes a full-screen editing mode and a feature called &quot;Photocasting&quot; (a way to share photos with others directly from within iPhoto).

iDVD was first announced on January 9, 2001. It was bundled with the Power Mac G4, the first Mac model with a SuperDrive that could read and write both CDs and DVDs. The first version of iDVD introduced a simple way to design customized DVDs with menus, backdrops, slideshows and home movies that could be played back on most DVD players. iDVD was never released as a download. Instead, it was bundled with the first version of iLife, released in 2003.

The remaining two applications in the iLife suite were first introduced as part of iLife &#x27;04 and iLife &#x27;06, respectively. Released in 2004, the first version of GarageBand was designed as an easy way for both beginner and advanced musicians to create and edit music on their computers. iWeb was introduced at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo on January 10, 2006 and was promoted as a way for Mac users to create their own professionally designed websites without having to know or write HTML or any other code. The last version of iWeb was released with iLife &#x27;11.

On January 6, 2011, iLife &#x27;11 was made available to purchase on the Mac App Store. From October 22, 2013, iLife &#x27;13 was made available for free download on the Mac App Store.

After iPhoto was discontinued in 2015, newest versions of GarageBand and iMovie, the only remaining components of iLife suite, became distributed separately on the Mac App Store, making iLife suite itself discontinued.

==Releases and history==

&quot;Notes about specific releases:&quot;

*iLife &#x27;06: This was the last release to include iTunes. It now comes with every Mac computer and account, as well as every Apple device (i.e. iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Apple TV).
*iLife &#x27;08: This release included a completely reprogrammed iMovie with a new user interface which omitted some of the features of the previous version. In response to criticism, Apple released iMovie HD 6 as a free download to anyone who purchased this version of iLife.
*iLife &#x27;09: With this release of iLife the free download of iMovie HD 6 was discontinued.
*iLife &#x27;11: PowerPC Macs are not compatible with iLife &#x27;11. Although iLife &#x27;11 originally supported Snow Leopard, the latest updates to iPhoto 9 and iMovie 9 require Yosemite, and GarageBand requires Mavericks.

==Current components==

===iMovie===
iMovie is a digital video editor. The process of film capture by a digital camera via FireWire is automated, with iMovie allowing users to split up their videos, add titles and special effects, and reorganize them into movies. It is also compatible with MPEG 4 cameras, AVCHD camcorders, HDV cameras, and Apple&#x27;s iSight webcams. Photographs may also be used, and a soundtrack may be added using tracks from the user&#x27;s iTunes music library. These can then be exported into a variety of viewable formats, including the .mov format used by Apple&#x27;s QuickTime Player.

===GarageBand===
GarageBand is a music and podcast creation application that includes over 1,000 pre-recorded audio loops for use in projects. The program also supports software instruments and importation from real instruments, such as guitars and keyboards.

==Discontinued components==

===iPhoto===
iPhoto was an application that allowed users to store, view, edit, and share their digital photos. Users could organize their photos in a number of ways. Events automatically grouped photos taken around the same time. Faces uses facial recognition to identify photos containing faces, which can then be tagged by users and sorted according to who is in the photo. Places takes advantage of geotagging technology. Many cameras today embed metadata into their digital photos containing information about the location where the photo was taken. Places allowed users to browse and see their photos on a map. iPhoto included tools to crop photos, reduce red-eye, add effects such as sepia and black and white, and to adjust the exposure, saturation, contrast and black and white balance of photos. In addition, users could have their photos printed, create books (hard bound copies of which can be ordered), calendars and greetings cards. As of April 8, 2015, Apple discontinued and removed iPhoto from the Mac App Store with the release of the new Photos app bundled with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. As of 2017, iPhoto was unable to sync with iCloud but Photos can.

===iDVD===
iDVD, integrated with iMovie, allows the burning of movies onto a DVD and the user to customize their DVD with custom menus based on themes (many of which make use of the content of the movies) and custom chapter points. It contains the MPEG-2 encoder functionality needed to produce DVD-compatible content. Each new version added more menu themes. In iLife &#x27;09 and iLife &#x27;11, iDVD was not updated (with the exception of a few bug fixes). There is no support for Blu-ray disc burning in the current version of iDVD. As of July 20, 2011, Apple discontinued iDVD and it is neither included with new Apple computers nor for sale.

===iWeb===
iWeb, released at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo on January 10, 2006, provided the ability to easily turn content from the other iLife applications into websites using Apple-designed templates with one-click uploading to Apple&#x27;s MobileMe sharing service. iWeb also allowed users to create links to their own podcasts and photocasts from the webpage. iWeb was the latest addition to the iLife suite when it was discontinued in June 2011. As of July 20, 2011, Apple discontinued iWeb and it is no longer included with new Apple computers nor for sale.

===MobileMe Web Gallery===
MobileMe Web Gallery was a feature designed for easy photo sharing from directly within the iLife suite. It allowed users to create events or photo albums using the Web Gallery feature of their MobileMe account, and permitted visitors to a user&#x27;s Gallery to view the photos. As of July 1, 2012 MobileMe and its Gallery was discontinued.

<doc id="288528" wikidata="Q3290343" url="?curid=288528" title="Dione Lucas">
<text>Dione Lucas (pronounced &quot;dee-OH-nee&quot;; born Dione Wilson; 10 October 1909 – 18 December 1971) was an English chef, and the first female graduate of Le Cordon Bleu. Her father was the architect, jeweller and designer Henry Wilson, and her sister was the violinist Orrea Pernel (1906–1993). She married another architect, Colin Lucas (1906–1984).

==Life==
Dione Lucas was fundamental in establishing an extension of the famous Paris culinary school in London in the 1930s. She married the architect Colin Lucas. on 9 April 1930. In 1931 she and Rosemary Hume (with whom she has trained in Paris), set up a cookery school in Sloane Street, London, the interior of which was designed by Colin Lucas. They had a flat in Chelsea and they would reputedly serve their students&#x27; creations to passing trade at chairs and tables on the pavement. Lucas is thought to have helped Hume create her first cookery book, as Hume&#x27;s spelling was known to be poor.

Lucas worked as a hotel chef in Hamburg before World War II, and later claimed that Adolf Hitler often dined there and had a taste for stuffed squab. She later opened a Cordon Bleu restaurant and a cooking school in New York, on the ground floor of 117 E. 60th St. She also ran the Egg Basket restaurant by Bloomingdale&#x27;s in New York. One of the earliest television cook-show hosts, Lucas&#x27;s &quot;To The Queen&#x27;s Taste&quot; was broadcast on CBS in 1948-1949 from the restaurant. She had another show in the 1950s.

Dione Lucas was the first woman featured in a cooking show on television on WPIX-11 in New York. In one of her New York restaurants, &quot;The Gingerman&quot;, Lucas helped to introduce the omelette to the American palate.
She can be seen as a predecessor and influence to Julia Child. 
Dione Lucas authored several cookbooks on French cuisine.

==Quotes==
*&quot;The preparation of good food is merely another expression of art, one of the joys of civilized living.&quot;
*&quot;I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a great favorite with Mr. Hitler, who dined at the hotel often. Let us not hold that against a fine recipe though.&quot;

<doc id="288541" wikidata="Q306184" url="?curid=288541" title="Calendar (Apple)">
<text>Calendar is a personal calendar app made by Apple Inc. for its macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS operating systems. It offers online cloud backup of calendars using Apple&#x27;s iCloud service, or can synchronize with other calendar services, including Google Calendar and Microsoft Exchange Server.

The macOS version was known as iCal before the release of OS X Mountain Lion in July 2012. Originally released as a free download for Mac OS X Jaguar on September 10, 2002, it was bundled with the operating system as iCal 1.5 with the release of Mac OS X Panther. iCal was the first calendar application for Mac OS X to offer support for multiple calendars and the ability to intermittently publish/subscribe to calendars on WebDAV servers. Version 2 of iCal was released as part of Mac OS X Tiger, Version 3 as part of Mac OS X Leopard, Version 4 as part of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, Version 5 as part of Mac OS X Lion, Version 6 as part of OS X Mountain Lion, Version 7 as part of OS X Mavericks, Version 8 as part of OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan, and version 9 as part of macOS Sierra.

Apple licensed the iCal name from Brown Bear Software, who have used it for their iCal application since 1997.

iCal&#x27;s initial development was quite different from other Apple software: it was designed independently by a small French team working &quot;secretly&quot; in Paris, led by Jean-Marie Hullot, a friend of Steve Jobs. iCal&#x27;s development has since been transferred to Apple US headquarters in Cupertino.

==Features==
Calendar tracks events and , allows multiple calendar views (such as calendars for &quot;home&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, and other calendars that a user can create) to quickly identify conflicts and free time. Users can subscribe to other calendars so they can keep up with friends and colleagues, and other things such as athletic schedules and television programs, as well as set notifications for upcoming events either in the Notification Center, by email, SMS, or pager. Attachments and notes can be added to iCloud Calendar items.

It is integrated with iCloud, so calendars can be shared and synced with other devices, such as other Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPod touch, and PCs over the internet. One can also share calendars via the WebDAV protocol. Google now supports WebDAV for Google Calendar making Calendar easily configurable.

Calendar includes the ability to see travel time and weather at the event&#x27;s location, with the ability to set an alarm based on the travel time. Different time zones can be selected when entering and editing start and end times. This allows long-distance airplane flight times, for example, to be entered accurately and for that &quot;end&quot; of a visualized time &quot;box&quot; to render accurately on either iOS or macOS when time zone support is turned on in Calendar and the time zone set in Date/Time to the location in question. 

Calendar support was added to CarPlay with iOS 13, allowing Siri to display and read out a user&#x27;s upcoming events while driving.

The app icon shows the device&#x27;s current date when viewed from the home screen, making it one of the only iOS apps with a dynamic icon (the other being Clock).

<text>Swastika is a small community founded around a mine site in Northern Ontario, Canada in 1908. Today it is within the municipal boundaries of Kirkland Lake, Ontario. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

Swastika is a junction on the Ontario Northland Railway, where a branch to Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec leaves the ONR&#x27;s main line from North Bay, Ontario to Moosonee. Until 2012, the &quot;Northlander&quot; passenger railway service between Toronto and Cochrane served the Swastika railway station with connecting bus service running along Highway 66 into downtown Kirkland Lake.

==History==

=== 20th century ===
The town was named after the Swastika Gold Mine staked in the autumn of 1907 and incorporated on January 6, 1908.

James and William Dusty staked the claims alongside Otto Lake for the Tavistock Mining Partnership. The gold mine and town were named after the Sanskrit good-luck symbol swastika. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway had an engineers&#x27; camp nearby as they had to construct two railway bridges as they advanced northwards. The first usage of the name Swastika occurred in their 1907 Annual Report to indicate a water tank located at the site to meet the needs of the steam trains that opened up northern Ontario.

Prospectors and miners flocked to the area and after viewing the find at the Swastika Gold Mine they advanced even further throughout the surrounding region. In 1909 the Lucky Cross Mine adjacent to the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway tracks began producing gold. A Mr. Morrisson started a farm and lodging alongside the tracks as early as 1907 and from there the community developed.

Swastika had a population of 450 by 1911, with the Lucky Cross and Swastika Mines in operation. By 1911, a hotel and businesses were flourishing, the area to the east was heavily staked and in 1912 the major gold mines of Kirkland Lake were found and developed by Harry Oakes. Swastika was the main transportation link with the railway and communications centre. Churches, schools, community groups and organisations continued to provide the needs of the residents of the area.

From 1945 to 1949, Swastika Mine was called the Crescent Kirkland Mine.

During World War II, the provincial government removed the Swastika sign and replaced it with a sign renaming the town &quot;Winston.&quot; The residents removed the Winston sign and replaced it with a Swastika sign with the message, &quot;To hell with Hitler, we had the swastika first.&quot;

The 1930s&#x27; British socialite Unity Mitford, one of the famous Mitford sisters who were daughters to aristocrat David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, was notorious for her extreme devotion to Adolf Hitler and support of Nazism and fascism. She was conceived in Swastika when her parents were there to investigate a gold claim investment in 1913.

=== 21st century ===

In 2008, the small community of Swastika celebrated the town&#x27;s centennial.

In 2021, the Ontario Northland Railway&#x27;s station was demolished. On May 26, 2021, the Province of Ontario announced plans to reinstate the Northlander passenger train between Toronto and Timmins and/or Cochrane.

As of 2023, the population of Swastika was approximately 500 people.

<text>João Álvares Fagundes (born c. 1460, Kingdom of Portugal – died 1522, Kingdom of Portugal) was an explorer and ship owner from Viana do Castelo in Northern Portugal. He organized several expeditions to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia around 1520–1521.

Fagundes, together with his second captain Pero de Barcelos, and accompanied by colonists (mostly from the Azores and some from mainland Portugal), explored the islands of St Paul near Cape Breton, Sable Island, Penguin Island (now known as Funk Island), Burgeo, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon. He named the latter islands as the Eleven Thousand Virgins, in honor of Saint Ursula.

King Manuel I of Portugal gave Fagundes exclusive rights and ownership of his discoveries on 13 March 1521.

In 1607, Samuel de Champlain identified the remains of a large cross (&quot;an old cross, all covered with moss, and almost wholly rotted away&quot;) at what is now Advocate Harbour, Nova Scotia on the Minas Basin. Some historians have attributed the cross to Fagundes, who is presumed to have visited the spot some eight decades earlier.

==Fishing colony of Cape Breton==

Captain Francisco de Souza (&quot;Feitor&quot; or governor of the king) of the captaincy of the island of Madeira, and a native of the same island, reported in 1570 that about 45 or 50 years before, &quot;some noblemen [from Viana] joined with the information that they had of the New Land of the Codfish, they were determined to go settle some part of it&quot;. They obtained a license From King Manuel for an expedition under the command of João Alvares Fagundes, who led several families and couples, mostly from the Azores, especially from the island of Terceira, who were gathered en route. They reached North America with a &quot;nau&quot; and a caravel, and &quot;because they considered the coast of Newfoundland very cold, they sailed from east to west&quot; until they reached a new &quot;coast, arranged from northeast to southwest, and there they dwelt, where they lost or ran out of ships&quot;. De Souza said that nothing more was known of &quot;the colonists who settled there since they were out of communications with the metropole.&quot;

Only later did news of the fate of the colonists come through the reports of Basque fishermen who visited the region. The Basques brought information of the colony and its inhabitants and descendants &quot;and said that they were asked to let the authorities in Portugal know about their situation in the land and to send them priests, because the Gentiles [possibly the Mi&#x27;kmaq people] &quot;are peaceful and docile, and from notorious men that are sailing there.&quot; According to Souza, it was in Cape Britão (Cape Breton in old Portuguese - already having that name in 1570 due to the expeditions of Jacques Cartier and others), &quot;at the entrance of the north coast, in a beautiful bay&quot;, according to the chronicler, &quot;which had a settlement, with very valuable things, and a lot of walnut, chestnut, grapes, and other fruits, where it seems to be good land and so among this company were some couples from the Azores; that they have settled here as is well-known&quot;.

The governor of Madeira ended the reference to this colony with a prayer and a plea: &quot;May Our Lord in His mercy pave the way to get them help, and my intention is to go to the said path of coastline when I reach the Island of São Francisco, which we can do on a single trip&quot;. This possible colony may have lasted at least until the 1570s, or until the end of the century.

<text>Moosonee () is a town in northern Ontario, Canada, on the Moose River approximately south of James Bay. It is considered to be &quot;the Gateway to the Arctic&quot; and has Ontario&#x27;s only saltwater port. Nearby, on Moose Factory Island, is the community of Moose Factory to which it is connected by water taxi in the summer and ice road in the winter.

There is no road connection to the community but flights are provided by Air Creebec and by Thunder Airlines, via Moosonee Airport. Moosonee is also the railhead of the Ontario Northland Railway where goods are transferred to barges and aircraft for transport to more northerly communities. Moosonee is not particularly far north, being located at 51°N, roughly the same latitude as Saskatoon and Calgary, but is colder because of its proximity to Hudson Bay and isolated by its lack of road access to the rest of Ontario. The community was the site of a fur trading post set up in 1903 by Revillon Frères, competitors to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which later bought out Révillon.

Moosonee formerly held the status of a development area, the only community in the province with that designation, and was governed by a locally-elected board subject to formal appointment by the Ontario provincial government. It became incorporated as a town effective January 1, 2001, with an elected mayor and four-person council.

==History==

In 1900, Annie Hardisty and her two daughters were the first settlers on the site. Significant development began on June 6, 1903, four canoes and a crew of 21 persons of the Revillon Frères company arrived on the banks of the Moose River near the much older Moose Factory to establish the Moose River Post. This Parisian furrier had ambitious plans to set up a chain of fur trading posts in direct competition with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, including five on James Bay. But it suffered a setback when their supply ship that carried all the provisions shipwrecked near Fort George (Chisasibi). The Revillon Frères Museum is located on First Street.

Moose River Post became the most important location for Revillon Frères and was quickly expanded with a staff house, carpenter&#x27;s shop, warehouse, and sawmill. The buildings were spaced far apart as a preventive measure to minimize the spread of fire. By 1912, it was reported that &quot;the whole line of good substantial buildings, built principally for their French Canadian employees, stretches along the river front for nearly a mile northward from the residence of the inspector.&quot;

Moose River Post (and Moose Factory) were prosperous but isolated. It was supplied only once per year by ship coming from Montreal around the Labrador Peninsula. Mail arrived only four times per year, twice by canoe and twice by toboggan. During World War I, Revillon Frères&#x27; chartered supply ship was requisitioned for war service. So from then on until 1932, the post was supplied by scows from Pagwa on the National Transcontinental Railway coming down the Pagwachuan, Kenogami, and Albany Rivers.

In 1932, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was extended from Cochrane to Moose River Post, that was renamed at that time to Moosonee, derived from the Cree word meaning &quot;at the Moose [River]&quot;. In 1936, Revillon Frères sold its Canadian operations to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the Moosonee post closed. The HBC also exited the fur trade and opened a retail store in Moosonee (now Northern Store, part of The North West Company). With the end of the fur trade business, Moosonee&#x27;s economy became centred on transportation.

In 1962, Moosonee became the site of RCAF Station Moosonee that was part of NORAD&#x27;s Pinetree Line chain of radar stations. It closed in 1975 and some of its buildings were used by the Town after the closure, including the base swimming pool and recreation centre.

In 1968, the town was classified as a development area board. In November 2000, it was incorporated as the Town of Moosonee.

The town is governed by a mayor and four councillors. As of 2023, the mayor is Wayne Taipale and the councillors are Theresa Chavez, Sheldon Ross, Diane Ryder, and Carman Tozer

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Moosonee had a population of 1,512 living in 487 of its 629 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2021, 86.0 per cent of residents spoke English as their mother tongue, 8.5 per cent Indigenous (mainly Cree), 1.0 per cent French, and 4.4 per cent other languages. The population are mainly First Nations (66.8 per cent), 32.5 per cent non-indigenous and 1 per cent Métis.

==Services==
Moosonee has two elementary schools, Moosonee Public School and Bishop Belleau Separate School (Roman Catholic) that offer kindergarten through grade eight. Bishop Belleau School also provides a French Language Instructional Unit for children who are entitled to be educated in French. There is a public high school, Northern Lights Secondary School, that provides grades nine through twelve. Northern College&#x27;s Moosonee campus provides some post-secondary programs.

Health services are provided through the Moosonee Health Clinic of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority (merger of the former James Bay General Hospital and the Weeneebayko Health Ahtuskaywin, which operated Weeneebayko General Hospital in Moose Factory).

Payukotayno (pronounced pay-k-ta-no) Family Services provide child care and social assistance to Moosonee, Moose Factory, Attawapiskat First Nation, Fort Albany First Nation, Kashechewan First Nation and Peawanuck. Payukotayno is a recognized Ontario Children&#x27;s Aid society and means &#x27;one family&#x27; in Cree.

As of 2020 a &quot;satellite Trades Centre&quot; was being operated in the community by Northern College &quot;linked to the ... Timmins Campus&quot;; courses included technology, trades and apprenticeship programs.

==Climate==
Moosonee has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with subarctic influences, which gives the town warm summers and cold winters that are sometimes severe. James Bay acts as a thermal reservoir to moderate spring and fall temperatures. Freeze-up on the Moose River normally occurs between late November and mid-December, with mean daily minimum January temperatures approximately . Spring break-up, or spring thaw, usually occurs in April. Mean annual precipitation is , and mean annual snowfall is . Precipitation is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year. Severe thunderstorms can occur from time to time. Moosonee used to have a subarctic climate with a yearly mean temperature of , but due to global warming that temperature has risen to .

The highest temperature ever recorded in Moosonee was on 31 July 1975. The coldest temperature ever recorded, at (Moose Factory), was on 24 January 1935.

==Transportation==
The town is billed as &quot;a major transportation hub for Ontario’s Far North&quot;.

As of 2020, the MV &quot;Niska 1&quot; ferry was operating between Moosonee and Moose Factory island, carrying passengers and vehicles.

===Moosonee station and yard===
The main method of access is by Ontario Northland Railway, which reached the town in 1932 and provides passenger and freight train service to Cochrane. Ontario Northland&#x27;s &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot; train runs from Moosonee station to Cochrane station six days per week during the summer months and five days per week during the rest of the year. Moosonee station is located at the end of First Street and has a small station building, freight shed, diesel shed and an outdoor yard to store trains. Tickets are sold by phone or at the offices Cochrane, Moosonee, Moose Factory and Timmins. The train will stop on demand in some locations as part of the flag stop service.

There are also two freight trains per week. During the summer and early fall shipping season, goods can be transported from Moosonee by barge. In January 2007, responsibility for the Port of Moosonee was transferred from the federal government to the Town of Moosonee. The Polar Bear Express Passenger Train transports cars, canoes, ATVs, and snowmobiles as long as they are booked in advance notice. It is one of only two motorail services in North America.

===Airport===
The town is also accessible via the Moosonee Airport, served with scheduled flights by Air Creebec, and Thunder Airlines, and cargo service through North Star Air. In the summer months floatplanes can land at Moosonee Water Aerodrome

===Roads===
Moosonee is inaccessible by road. The nearest road outside of Moosonee ends at Otter Rapids, south of Moosonee. During the early months of 2008, a winter road was open between Moosonee and the provincial road system at Otter Rapids. This road was built to support the twinning of the electric transmission lines that run from Otter Rapids to Moosonee. Local residents report it taking five or six hours to get to Timmins from Moosonee via Otter Rapids and Smooth Rock Falls. This road was not in service in 2009. In late 2009, members of the Moose Cree First Nation voted for the construction of a seasonal winter road south to Otter Rapids.

During the winter, ice roads are plowed and maintained on the ice across the Moose River to Moose Factory and winter roads are maintained to the coastal First Nations communities of Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Attawapiskat. In recent years, much of the traffic heading up north has been destined for the Victor Diamond Mine operated by De Beers Canada to the west of Attawapiskat.

In January 2021, the James Bay Winter Ice Road was under construction, to connect Attawapiskat, Kashechewan, Fort Albany and Moosonee. It opened some time in winter 2021 and was said to accept loads up to 50,000 kilograms in weight. The road was operated by Kimesskanemenow LP, &quot;a limited partnership between the four communities it connects&quot;.

Feasibility studies have been undertaken on the construction of a permanent all-season road to the communities of Moosonee, Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Attawapiskat River. The project, if undertaken, will entail a &quot;coastal road&quot; connecting the four communities with each other, as well as a road to link the coastal road to the provincial highway system at Fraserdale, Kapuskasing or Hearst.

==Communications==
Moosonee has a local radio station, CHMO 1450 AM, that is generally operated by volunteers, plus a rebroadcasting facility for CBC Radio One Northern Ontario from CBCS-FM Sudbury on 1340 AM. Most homes subscribe to either Creecable cable TV or a satellite TV service to receive their programming, following the 2012 closure of the local CBC Television and TVOntario repeaters.

Ontera, formerly Ontario Northland Telecommunications, but now owned by Bell, provides telecommunications service in Moosonee (NPA-NXX 705-336).

==Attractions and tourism==
Tourism agencies recommend the Polar Bear Express as a &quot;great rail excursion&quot; in summer, between Cochrane and Moosonee, to view the &quot;hydroelectric dams, isolated homes and perhaps even some wildlife.&quot; 

A private company offers freighter-canoe ferry across the Moose River to Moose Factory where Centennial Park exhibits 19th-century buildings from the fur-trading era.

Notable attractions in Moosonee include:
* Railway Car Museum – displaying the cultural history of the area in an old Baggage Car of the Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario Railway.
* MNR Interpretive Centre – displays and videos at the office of the Ministry of Natural Resources highlighting the wildlife, geological, and geographical features of the region.
* Excursions to the bird sanctuaries of Shipsands Island and the Southern James Bay.

The Tidewater Provincial Park is on nearby Charles Island, adjacent to Moose Factory Island.

<text>The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), Javan rhino, Sunda rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros is a critically endangered member of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, of the rhinoceros family, Rhinocerotidae, and one of the five remaining extant rhinoceros species across South Asia and Africa. The Javan rhinoceros is one of the smallest rhinoceros species, along with the Sumatran, or &quot;hairy&quot;, rhinoceros. They are superficially similar to Indian rhinos, as they have plate-like, &quot;armored&quot; protective skin folds, but are slightly smaller, at just long and tall, on average. The heaviest specimens weigh around 2,300 kg/2.3 tonnes (2.54 short tons), similar to a black rhinoceros. However, unlike the long and potentially lethal horns of the black or white rhinoceroses of Africa, the Javan species&#x27; single, somewhat blunted horn (only present on males) is usually shorter than .

Up until the mid-19th to about the early 20th century, the Javan rhinoceros had ranged beyond the islands of Java and Sumatra and onto the mainland of Southeast Asia and Indochina, northwest into East India, Bhutan, and the south of China. Today, it is the rarest of all rhinoceros, and among the rarest of all living animal species, with only one currently known wild population, and no individuals successfully kept in captivity. It is among the rarest large mammals on the planet Earth, with a population of approximately 74 rhinos within Ujung Kulon National Park, at the far western tip of Java, Indonesia. In 2023, the Indonesian authorities captured two gangs of poachers who confessed to killing 26 rhinos from 2019–2023. No census has been released since 2019. The Javan rhinoceros population in Vietnam&#x27;s Cat Tien National Park was declared locally extinct in 2011.

The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is primarily attributed to poaching, for the males&#x27; horns, which—despite merely being composed of keratin—are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As the presence of colonial Dutch and other Europeans in its range increased, peaking in the 1700–1800s, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat and massive human population growth (especially post-wartimes, such as the Vietnam War) have also contributed to its decline and hindered the species&#x27; recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally-protected area, and Ujung Kulon is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nonetheless, rural, potentially rugged park boundaries mean that law enforcement cannot be equally present in all places at all times; in some areas, this lack of security still places the species at risk from poachers, disease exposure and, ultimately, loss of genetic diversity—leading to genetic &quot;bottlenecking&quot; (i.e., inbreeding depression).

The Javan rhinoceros can live around 30–45 years in the wild. It historically inhabited dense lowland rainforest, wet grasslands, and vast floodplains at forest-edges. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and rearing offspring, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, whom they usually avoid, adult rhinos have no natural predators in their range. Very small juveniles may be preyed upon, if left unsupervised, typically by leopards, Sumatran tigers or, rarely, crocodiles. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly due to their extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers instead rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, Javan rhinos are the least-studied of all rhinoceros species. Two adult female Javan rhinoceroses, each with a calf, were filmed using a motion-triggered trail camera, the video being released on 28 February 2011 by WWF and Indonesia&#x27;s National Park Authority, proving they are still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released further trailcam videos showing 35 individuals, including mother-offspring pairs and courting adults.

== Etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is a combination of the ancient Greek words ῥίς (ris) meaning &#x27;nose&#x27; and κέρας (keras) meaning &#x27;horn of an animal&#x27;. &quot;sondaicus&quot; is derived from &quot;sunda&quot;, the biogeographical region that comprises the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and surrounding smaller islands. The Javan rhino is also known as the lesser one-horned rhinoceros (in contrast with the greater one-horned rhinoceros, another name for the Indian rhino).

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Rhinoceros sondaicus&quot; was the scientific name used by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1822 for a rhinoceros from Java sent by Pierre-Médard Diard and Alfred Duvaucel to the National Museum of Natural History, France. In the 19th century, several zoological specimens of hornless rhinoceros were described:
*&quot;Rhinoceros inermis&quot; proposed by René Lesson in 1838 was a female rhinoceros without horns shot in the Sundarbans.
*&quot;Rhinoceros nasalis&quot; and &quot;Rhinoceros floweri&quot; proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 were two rhinoceros skulls from Borneo and one from Sumatra, respectively.
*&quot;Rhinoceros annamiticus&quot; proposed by Pierre Marie Heude in 1892 was a specimen from Vietnam.

As of 2005, three Javan rhinoceros subspecies are considered valid taxa:
* &quot;R. s. sondaicus&quot;, the nominate subspecies, known as the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros
* &quot;R. s. inermis&quot;, known as the Indian Javan rhinoceros or lesser Indian rhinoceros
* &quot;R. s. annamiticus&quot;, known as the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros or Vietnamese rhinoceros

=== Evolution ===
Ancestral rhinoceroses are held to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.

The last common ancestor of living rhinoceroses belonging to the subfamily Rhinocerotinae is suggested to have lived around 16 million years ago, with the ancestors of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; diverging from the ancestors of other living rhinoceroses around 15 million years ago. The genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; has been found to be overall slightly more closely related to the Sumatran rhinoceros (as well as to the extinct woolly rhinoceros and the extinct Eurasian genus &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;) than to living African rhinoceroses, thought there appears to have been gene flow between the ancestors of living African rhinoceroses and the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, as well as between the ancestors of the genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; and the ancestors of the woolly rhinoceros and &quot;Stephanorhinus&quot;.

A cladogram showing the relationships of recent and Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species (minus &quot;Stephanorhinus hemitoechus)&quot; based on whole nuclear genomes, after Liu et al., 2021.
The oldest known definitive fossils of the Javan rhinoceros are from the Late Pliocene deposits of Myanmar and Java. Molecular estimates suggest the Indian and Javan rhinoceros diverged from each other earlier, around 4.3 million years ago. An astragalus fossil similar to that of the Javan rhinoceros from the Late Miocene deposits of Myanmar have been identified as &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; cf. &quot;R. sondaicus&quot;.

== Description ==
Javan rhinos are smaller than the Indian rhinoceros, and are close in size to the black rhinoceros. They are the largest animal in Java and the second-largest animal in Indonesia after the Asian elephant. The length of Javan rhinos including their head is , and they can reach a height of . Adults are variously reported to weigh between , although a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status. No substantial size difference is seen between genders, but cows may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in Vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints.

Like the Indian rhino, the Javan rhinos have a single horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than with the longest recorded only . Only bulls have horns. Cows are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of an inch or two in height. Javan rhinos do not appear to often use their horn for fighting but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (black and Sumatran), Javan rhinos have a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Their lower incisors are long and sharp; when Javan rhinos fight, they use these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, Javan rhinos smell and hear well, but have very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.

Their hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin falls in folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck folds of Javan rhinos are smaller than those of the Indian rhinoceros, but still, form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, Javan rhinos are primarily studied through fecal sampling and Camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Even the most optimistic estimate suggests fewer than 100 Javan rhinos remain in the wild. They are considered one of the most endangered species in the world. The Javan rhinoceros is known to survive in only one place, the Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of Java.

The animal was once widespread from Assam and Bengal (where their range would have overlapped with both the Sumatran and Indian rhinos) eastward to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southwards to the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. Javan rhinoceros remains were also found at the Neolithic site of Hemudu in Zhejiang, China, and the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; appears to describe one living in the Yangtze River basin.

The Javan rhino primarily inhabits dense, lowland rain forests, grasslands, and reed beds with abundant rivers, large floodplains, or wet areas with many mud wallows. Although it historically preferred low-lying areas, the subspecies in Vietnam was pushed onto much higher ground (up to 2,000 m or 6,561 ft), probably because of human encroachment and poaching.

The range of the Javan rhinoceros has been shrinking for at least 3,000 years. Starting around 1000 BC, the northern range of the rhinoceros extended into China, but began moving southward at roughly per year, as human settlements increased in the region. It likely became locally extinct in India in the first decade of the 20th century. The Javan rhino was hunted to extinction on the Malay Peninsula by 1932. The last ones on Sumatra died out during World War II. They were extinct from Chittagong and the Sunderbans by the middle of the 20th century. By the end of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese rhinoceros was believed extinct across all of mainland Asia. Local hunters and woodcutters in Cambodia claim to have seen Javan rhinos in the Cardamom Mountains, but surveys of the area have failed to find any evidence of them. In the late 1980s, a small population was found in the Cat Tien area of Vietnam. However, the last known individual of that population was shot in 2010. A population may have existed on the island of Borneo, as well, though these specimens could have been the Sumatran rhinoceros, a small population of which still lives there.

== Behavior ==
The Javan rhinoceros is a solitary animal with the exception of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals&#x27; wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Bull home ranges are larger at compared to the cow, which are around . Bull territories overlap each other less than those of the cow. It is not known if there are territorial fights.

Bulls mark their territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes made by the feet in the ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.
The Javan rhino is much less vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, particularly in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.

=== Diet ===
The Javan rhinoceros is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Most of the plants favored by the species grow in sunny areas in forest clearings, shrubland and other vegetation types with no large trees. The rhino knocks down saplings to reach its food and grabs it with its prehensile upper lip. It is the most adaptable feeder of all the rhino species. Currently, it is a pure browser, but probably once both browsed and grazed in its historical range. The rhino eats an estimated of food daily. Like the Sumatran rhino, it needs salt in its diet. The salt licks common in its historical range do not exist in Ujung Kulon but the rhinos there have been observed drinking seawater, likely for the same nutritional need.

== Conservation ==

The main factor in the continued decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros&#x27; hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros&#x27; range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was listed under Appendix I meaning commercial international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is prohibited. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.

Loss of habitat because of agriculture has also contributed to its decline, though this is no longer as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. Even with all the conservation efforts, the prospects for their survival are grim. Because the population is restricted to one small area, they are very susceptible to disease and inbreeding depression. Conservation geneticists estimate a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve the genetic diversity of this conservation-reliant species.

=== Ujung Kulon ===
The Ujung Kulon peninsula of Java was devastated by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The Javan rhinoceros recolonized the peninsula after the event, but humans never returned in large numbers, thus creating a haven for wildlife. In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros was on the brink of extinction in Sumatra, the government of the Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, which it has remained ever since. A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula&#x27;s carrying capacity. Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species.

In March 2011, a hidden-camera video was published showing adults and juveniles, indicating recent matings and breeding. During the period from January to October 2011, the cameras had captured images of 35 rhinos. As of December 2011, a rhino breeding sanctuary in an area of 38,000 hectares is being finalized to help reach the target of 70 to 80 Javan rhinos by 2015.

In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 video cameras to the existing 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge the size of the animals&#x27; population. A recent survey has found far fewer cows than bulls. Only four cows among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.

In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos&#x27; food sources. Following the trails of Javan rhinoceros allowed in-depth observation of their feeding habits in their natural habitat. Comparing the acid insoluble ash (MA) content of faeces and in the dry weight of food provided reliable estimates of digestibility, and this method has potential for wider application in situations where total collection of faecal matter is not feasible. There was a strong positive correlation between the size of home range and diversity of food intake, and between the size of home range with the numbers of wallow holes used. The quantity and quality of food intake were variable among rhinoceroses and over time. Overall energy consumption was related to the size of the animal, while the digestibility of plants consumed appeared to be influenced by individual age and habitat conditions.

In May 2017, Director of the Biodiversity Conservation at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Bambang Dahono Adji announced plans to transfer the rhinos to the Cikepuh Wildlife Sanctuary located in West Java. The animals will first undergo DNA tests to determine lineage and risk to disease so as to avoid issues such as &quot;inbreeding&quot; or marriage kinship. As of December 2018, these plans had yet to concretely materialise.

In December 2018, the remaining Javan rhino population was severely endangered by the tsunami triggered by nearby volcano Anak Krakatau.

In 2024, officials announced that recently arrested poachers confessed to killing a total of 26 Javan rhinos, potentially cutting the total population by one-third. At least four Javan rhinoceros calves have been recorded between August 2023 and 2024; one seen in May 2024 was estimated to have been three to five months old.

=== Cat Tien ===
Once widespread in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, at the end of the Vietnam War. The combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region through the use of napalm, extensive defoliation from Agent Orange, aerial bombing, use of landmines, and overhunting by local poachers.

In 1988, the assumption of the subspecies&#x27; extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult cow, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam&#x27;s southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited became part of the Cat Tien National Park in 1992.

By the early 2000s, their population was feared to have declined past the point of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no bulls, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.

Genetic analysis of dung samples collected in Cat Tien National Park in a survey from October 2009 to March 2010 showed only a single individual Javan rhinoceros remained in the park. In early May 2010, the body of a Javan rhino was found in the park. The animal had been shot and its horn removed by poachers. In October 2011, the International Rhino Foundation confirmed the Javan rhinoceros was extinct in Vietnam, leaving only the rhinos in Ujung Kulon.

=== In captivity ===
A Javan rhinoceros has not been exhibited in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta, and London. At least 22 Javan rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity; the true number is possibly greater, as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian rhinoceros.

The Javan rhinoceros never fared well in captivity. The oldest lived to be 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in 1907, where the species was so little known that it had been exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros.

==In culture==

The Javan rhinoceros occurred in Cambodia in the past and there are at least three depictions of rhinos in the bas reliefs of the temple at Angkor Wat. The west wing of the North Gallery has a relief that shows a rhino mounted by a god thought to be the fire god Agni. The rhinos are thought to be Javan rhinoceros rather than the somewhat similar looking one-horned Indian rhino on the basis of the skinfold on the shoulder which continues along the back in the Javan to give a saddle-like appearance. A depiction of the rhino in the east wing of the South Gallery shows a rhino attacking the damned in the panel depicting heaven and hell. An architect of the temple is thought to have been an Indian Brahmin priest named Divakarapandita (1040–1120 AD) who served king Jayavarman VI, Dharanindravarman I as well as Suryavarman II who constructed the temple. It is thought that the Indian priest who died before the construction of the temple might have influenced the use of tubercles on the skin which are based on the Indian rhino while the local Khmer artisans carved the other details of the rhinos based on the more familiar local Javan rhino. The association of the rhinoceros as the vahana of the god Agni is unique to Khmer culture. Another rhinoceros carving in the centre of a circular arrangement in a column with other circles containing elephants and water buffalo is known from the temple of Ta Prohm. It has been at the centre of anachronistic speculation that it might represent a Stegosaur due to the leaves behind it that give the impression of plates.

One of the mascots of the 2018 Asian Games is a Javan rhinoceros named Kaka.

The mascot of the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup is a Javan rhinoceros named Bacuya.

<text>The Young Turks (, also &quot;Genç Türkler&quot;) formed as a constitutionalist broad opposition-movement in the late Ottoman Empire against the absolutist régime of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (). The most powerful organization of the movement, and the most conflated, was the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP, founded in 1889), though its goals, strategies, and membership continuously morphed throughout Abdul Hamid&#x27;s reign. By the 1890s, the Young Turks were mainly a loose and contentious network of exiled intelligentsia who made a living by selling their newspapers to secret subscribers.

Included in the opposition movement was a mosaic of ideologies, represented by democrats, liberals, decentralists, secularists, social Darwinists, technocrats, constitutional monarchists, and nationalists, to name a few. Despite being called &quot;the Young Turks&quot;, the group was of an ethnically diverse background; in addition to Turks, Albanian, Aromenian, Arab, Armenian, Azeri, Circassian, Greek, Kurdish, and Jewish members were plentiful. Besides membership in outlawed political committees, other avenues of opposition existed in the ulama, Sufi lodges, and masonic lodges. By and large, Young Turks favored taking power away from Yıldız Palace in favour of constitutional governance. Many coup d&#x27;état attempts associated with Young Turk networks occurred during the Hamidian era, repeatedly ending in failure.

In 1906, the Paris-based CUP fused with the Macedonia-based Ottoman Freedom Society under its own banner. The Macedonian Unionists prevailed against Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. With this revolution, the Young Turks helped to inaugurate the Second Constitutional Era in the same year, ushering in an era of multi-party democracy for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. In power, the CUP implemented many secularizing and centralizing reforms, but was criticized for pursuing a pro–Turkish ideology. In the wake of events which proved disastrous for the Ottoman Empire as a body-politic (such as the 31 March Incident of April 1909, the 1912 coup, and the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913), the country fell under the domination of a radicalized CUP following the 1913 Raid on the Sublime Porte. With the strength of the constitution and of parliament broken, the CUP ruled the Empire in a dictatorship, which brought the Empire into World War I in October 1914. The genocides of 1915 to 1917 against Ottoman Christians were masterminded within the CUP, principally by Enver Pasha, Talat Pasha, Bahaeddin Şakir, and others.

The term &quot;Young Turk&quot; is now used to characterize an insurgent trying to take control of a situation or of an organization by force or political maneuver, and various groups in different countries have been designated &quot;Young Turks&quot; because of their rebellious or revolutionary nature.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Young Turks&quot; comes from the French &quot;Jeunes Turcs&quot;, which international observers tagged various Ottoman reformers of the 19th century. Historian Roderic Davison states that there was not a consistent ideological application of the term; statesmen which wished to resurrect the Janissary corp and derebeys, conservative reformers of Mahmud II, and pro-Western reformers of Abdul Mejid, are all referred to as the party of &quot;Jeunes Turcs&quot; by different observers. Davison concludes that a Young Turk party was identified in situations where an amorphous &quot;Old Turk&quot; faction was being confronted.

The Young Ottomans, the liberal and Islamist opposition movement to Fuad and Aali Pasha&#x27;s regime, were also known as &quot;Jeunes Turcs&quot;, though they called themselves &quot;Yeni Osmanlılar&quot;, or New Ottomans. Historiographically, the group which became definitively known as the Young Turks was the opposition to Sultan Abdul Hamid II which surfaced after 1889, the Committee of Union and Progress being its standard bearer.

==History==

===Origins===

Inspired by the Young Italy political movement, the Young Turks had their origins in secret societies of &quot;progressive medical university students and military cadets,&quot; namely the Young Ottomans, driven underground along with all political dissent after the Constitution of 1876 was abolished and the First Constitutional Era brought to a close by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1878 after only two years. The Young Turks favored a reinstatement of the Ottoman Parliament and the 1876 constitution, written by the reformist Midhat Pasha.

Despite working with the Young Ottomans to promulgate a constitution, Abdul Hamid II dissolved the parliament by 1878 and returned to an absolutist regime, marked by extensive use of secret police to silence dissent, and massacres against minorities. Constitutionalist opponents of his regime, came to be known as Young Turks. The Young Turks were a heterodox group of secular liberal intellectuals and revolutionaries, united by their opposition to the absolutist regime of Abdul Hamid and desire to reinstate the constitution. Despite the name &quot;Young Turks&quot;, members were diverse in their religious and ethnic origins, with many Albanians, Arabs, Armenians, Circassians, Greeks, Kurds, and Jews being members.

=== Opposition ===
To organize the opposition, forward-thinking medical students Ibrahim Temo, Abdullah Cevdet and others formed a secret organization named the Committee of Ottoman Union, which grew in size and included exiles, civil servants, and army officers.

In 1894, Ahmed Rıza joined Ottoman Union, and requested it change its name to Order and Progress to reflect his Positivism. They compromised with Union and Progress. Rıza being based in Paris, the organization was organized around &quot;Meşveret&quot; and its French supplemental.&quot;&quot; The CUP became the preeminent faction of the Young Turks once as absorbed other opposition groups and established contact with exiled intelligentsia, Freemasons, and cabinet ministers, to the point where European observers started calling them the &quot;Young Turk Party&quot;. The society attempted several coup attempts against the government, much to the anti-revolutionary in Rıza&#x27;s chagrin.

Due to the danger in speaking out against absolutism, Young Turk activity shifted abroad. Turkish colonies were established in Paris, London, Geneva, Bucharest, and Cairo. The several ideological currents in the moment meant unity was hard to come by. Ahmet Rıza advocated for a Turkish nationalist and secularist agenda. Even though he denounced revolution, he had a more conservative and Islamist rival in Mehmet Murat Bey of &quot;Mizan&quot; fame. Rıza also had to deal with the &quot;Activist&quot; faction of the CUP that did push for a revolution. Other CUP branches often acted autonomously with their own ideological currents, to the point where the committee resembled more of an umbrella organization. &quot;Meşveret&quot; (Rıza) called for the reinstatement of the constitution but without revolution, as well as a more centralized Turkish-dominated Ottoman Empire sovereign of European influence.

The CUP supported Kâmil Pasha&#x27;s call for responsible government to return to the Sublime Porte during the diplomatic crisis caused by the Hamidian massacres. In August 1896, cabinet ministers aligned with the CUP conspired a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow the sultan, but the plot was leaked to the palace before its execution. Prominent statesmen were exiled to Ottoman Tripolitania and Acre. The year after, Unionist cadets of the Military Academy schemed to assassinate the Minister of Military Schools, and this plot was also leaked to authorities. In became known as the &quot;Sacrifices of the &quot;Şeref&quot;&quot; (Şeref &quot;Kurbanları&quot;) the largest single crackdown of the Hamidian era resulted in more than 630 high-profile arrests and exiles.

Under pressure from Yıldız Palace, French authorities banned &quot;Meşveret&quot;, though not the French supplemental, and deported Rıza and his Unionists in 1896. After settling in Brussels, the Belgian government was also pressured to deport the group a couple years later. The Belgian parliament denounced the decision and held a demonstration supporting the Young Turks against Hamidian tyranny. A congress in December 1896 saw Murat elected as chairman over Rıza and the headquarters moved to Geneva, sparking a schism between Rıza&#x27;s supporters in Paris and Murat&#x27;s supporters in Geneva. After the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s triumph over Greece in 1897 Sultan Abdul Hamid used the prestige he gained from the victory to coax the exiled Young Turks network back into his fold. After expelling Rıza from the CUP, Murat defected to the government, including Cevdet and Sükuti. A wave of extraditions, more amnesties, and buy-outs, weakened an opposition organization already operating in exile. With trials organized in 1897 and 1899 against enemies of Abdul Hamid II, the Ottoman Empire was under his secure control. Though moral was low, Ahmet Rıza, who returned to Paris, was the sole leader of the exiled Young Turks network.

In 1899, members of the Ottoman dynasty Damat Mahmud Pasha and his sons Sabahaddin and Lütfullah fled to Europe to join the Young Turks. However, Prince Sabahaddin believed that embracing the Anglo-Saxon values of capitalism and liberalism would alleviate the Empire&#x27;s problems such as separatism from non-Muslim minorities such as the Armenians, alienating himself from the CUP.

===Schism over foreign intervention===

The was held on 4 February 1902, at the house of Germain Antoin Lefevre-Pontalis a member of the Institut de France. The opposition was performed in compliance with the French government. Closed to the public, there were 47 delegates present. It included Rıza&#x27;s Unionists, Sabahaddin&#x27;s supporters, Armenian Dashnaks and Vergazmiya Hunchaks, and other Greek and Bulgarian groups. It was defined by the question of whether to invite foreign intervention for regime change in Constantinople to better minority rights; a majority which included Sabahaddin and his followers as well as the Armenians argued for foreign intervention, a minority which included Rıza&#x27;s Unionists and the Activist Unionists were against violent change and especially foreign intervention.

The Ottoman Freedom Lover&#x27;s Committee, named after the eponymous 1902 congress, was founded by Prince Sabahaddin and Ismail Kemal in the name of the majority mandate. However the organization was contentious and a coup plot in 1903 went nowhere. They later founded the , which called for a more decentralized and federalized Ottoman state in opposition to Rıza&#x27;s centralist vision. After the congress, Rıza formed a coalition with the Activists and founded the Committee of Progress and Union (CPU). This unsuccessful attempt to bridge the divide amongst the Young Turks instead deepened the rivalry between Sabahaddin&#x27;s group and Rıza&#x27;s CPU. The 20th century began with Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s rule secure and his opposition scattered and divided.

Beyond this ideological rift, the Young Turk movement had three main ideological currents on what the state ideology of the Ottoman Empire should be: old-school multicultural Ottomanism, incumbent pan-Islamism, and vogue pan-Turkism. After the revolution, non-Turkish and non-Muslim Young Turks ascribed themselves to their respective nationalist movements. For the Unionists that stayed with the CUP, the question of embracing (Anatolian) Turkism and then Westernization were on the docket.

===Unionist homecoming in Macedonia===
The Young Turks became a truly organized movement with the CUP as an organizational umbrella. They recruited individuals hoping for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire. In 1906, the Ottoman Freedom Society was established in Thessalonica by Mehmed Talaat. The OFS actively recruited members from the Third Army base, among them Major Ismail Enver. 

The took place in Paris, France, on 22 December 1907. Opposition leaders including Ahmed Rıza, Sabahaddin Bey, and Khachatur Malumian of the Dashnak Committee were in attendance. The goal was to unite all the Young Turks and minority nationalist movements, in order to bring about a revolution to reinstate the constitution. They decided to put their differences aside and signed an alliance, declaring that Abdul Hamid had to be deposed and the regime replaced with a representative and constitutional government by any means necessary, without foreign interference.

In September 1907, OFS announced they would be working with other organizations under the umbrella of the CUP. In reality, the leadership of the OFS would exert significant control over the CUP. Finally, in 1908 in the Young Turk Revolution, pro-CUP officers marched on Istanbul, forcing Abdulhamid to restore the constitution. An attempted countercoup resulted in his deposition.

=== Young Turk Revolution ===
In 1908, the Macedonian Question was facing the Ottoman Empire. Tsar Nicholas II and Franz Joseph, who were both interested in the Balkans, started implementing policies, beginning in 1897, which brought on the last stages of the Balkanization process. By 1903, there were discussions on establishing administrative control by Russian and Austrian advisory boards in the Macedonian provinces. Abdul Hamid was forced to accept this reform package, although for quite a while he was able to subvert its implementation.

However, eventually, signs were showing that this policy game was coming to an end. On 13 May 1908, the leadership of the CUP, with the newly gained power of its organization, was able to communicate to Sultan Abdul Hamid II the unveiled threat that &quot;the [Ottoman] dynasty would be in danger&quot; if he were not to bring back the Ottoman constitution that he had previously suspended since 1878. By June, Unionist officers of the Third Army mutinied and threatened to march on Constantinople. Although initially resistant to the idea of giving up absolute power, Abdul Hamid was forced on 24 July 1908, to restore the constitution, beginning the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire.

===Aftermath===

After the revolution, the Young Turks formalized their differences in ideology by forming political clubs. Two main parties formed: more liberal and pro-decentralization Young Turks formed the Liberty Party and later the Freedom and Accord Party. The Turkish nationalist and pro-centralization wing among the Young Turks remained in the CUP. The groups&#x27; power struggle continued until 1913, after the CUP took over following Mahmud Shevket Pasha&#x27;s assassination. They brought the Ottoman Empire into World War I on the side of the Central Powers during the war.

During the parliamentary recess of this era, the Young Turks held their first open congress at Salonica, on September–October 1911. There, they proclaimed a series of policies involving the disarming of Christians and preventing them from buying property, Muslim settlements in Christian territories, and the complete Ottomanization of all Turkish subjects, either by persuasion or by the force of arms. By 1913, the CUP banned all other political parties, creating a one party state. The Ottoman Parliament became a rubber stamp and real policy debate was held within the CUP&#x27;s Central Committee.

==== World War I ====

On 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. The Middle Eastern theatre of World War I became the scene of action. The combatants were the Ottoman Empire, with some assistance from the other Central Powers, against primarily the British and the Russians among the Allies. Rebuffed elsewhere by the major European powers, the CUP, through highly secret diplomatic negotiations, led the Ottoman Empire to ally itself with Germany.

===== Armenian genocide =====


The conflicts at the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign, and the Gallipoli Campaign affected places where Armenians lived in significant numbers. Before the declaration of war at the Armenian congress at Erzurum, Unionist emissaries asked Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion among the Russian Armenians against the tsarist army in the event of a Caucasian Front.

The Armenians were perceived to be subversive elements (a fifth column) that would take the Russian side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, the Ottoman government embarked on a large-scale deportation of Armenians from Eastern Anatolia. Around 300,000 Armenians were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to Aintab and Marash. In the summer of 1917, Armenians were moved to the Konya region in central Anatolia. Through these measures, the CUP leaders aimed to eliminate the ostensible Armenian threat by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 1,200,000 Armenians were forcibly deported from their home vilayets. As a result, about half of the displaced died of exposure, hunger, and disease, or were victims of banditry and forced labor.

Early on, the Dashnaks had perceived the CUP as allies; the 1909 Adana massacre had been rooted in reactionary backlash against the revolution. But during World War I, the CUP&#x27;s increasing nationalism began to lead them to participate in genocide. In 2005, the International Association of Genocide Scholars affirmed that scholarly evidence revealed the CUP &quot;government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens and unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches.&quot;

===== Assyrian genocide =====
The genocide of Assyrian civilians began during the Ottoman occupation of Azerbaijan from January to May 1915, during which massacres were committed by Ottoman forces and pro-Ottoman Kurds. Previously, many Assyrians were killed in the 1895 massacres of Diyarbekir. However the violence worsened after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, despite Assyrian hopes that the new government would stop promoting anti-Christian Islamism.

The Sayfo occurred concurrently with and was closely related to the Armenian genocide. Motives for killing included a perceived lack of loyalty among some Assyrian communities to the Ottoman Empire and the desire to appropriate their land. At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the Assyro-Chaldean delegation said that its losses were 250,000 (about half the prewar population); they later revised their estimate to 275,000 dead at the Lausanne Conference of 1922–1923.

==== Turkish War of Independence ====
At the end of the War, with the collapse of Bulgaria and Germany&#x27;s capitulation, Talaat Pasha and the CUP ministry resigned on 13 October 1918, and the Armistice of Mudros was signed aboard a British battleship in the Aegean Sea. On 2 November, Enver, Talaat and Cemal fled from Istanbul into exile. Following the war, the Freedom and Accord Party regained control over the Ottoman government and conducting a purge of Unionists. Freedom and Accord rule was short-lived, and with Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atatürk) stirring up nationalist sentiment in Anatolia, the Empire soon collapsed.

== Ideology ==
===Materialism and positivism===
A guiding principle for the Young Turks was the transformation of their society into one in which religion played no consequential role, a stark contrast from the theocracy that had ruled the Ottoman Empire since its inception. However, the Young Turks soon recognized the difficulty of spreading this idea among the deeply religious Ottoman peasantry and even much of the elite. The Young Turks thus began suggesting that Islam itself was materialistic. As compared with later efforts by Muslim intellectuals, such as the attempt to reconcile Islam and socialism, this was an extremely difficult endeavor. Although some former members of the CUP continued to make efforts in this field after the revolution of 1908, they were severely denounced by the ulema, who accused them of &quot;trying to change Islam into another form and create a new religion while calling it Islam&quot;.

Positivism, with its claim of being a religion of science, deeply impressed the Young Turks, who believed it could be more easily reconciled with Islam than could popular materialistic theories. The name of the society, Committee of Union and Progress, was inspired by leading positivist Auguste Comte&#x27;s motto &quot;Order and Progress&quot;. Positivism also served as a base for the desired strong government.

===Centralized government===
After the CUP took power in the 1913 coup and Mahmud Şevket Pasha&#x27;s assassination, it embarked on a series of reforms in order to increase centralization in the Empire, an effort that had been ongoing since the last century&#x27;s Tanzimat reforms under sultan Mahmud II. Many of the original Young Turks rejected this idea, especially those that had formed the Freedom and Accord Party against the CUP. Other opposition parties against the CUP like Prince Sabahaddin&#x27;s and the Arab Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization, both of which made opposition to the CUP&#x27;s centralization their main agenda.

The Young Turks wished to modernize the Empire&#x27;s communications and transportation networks without putting themselves in the hands of European bankers. Europeans already owned much of the country&#x27;s railroad system, and since 1881, the administration of the defaulted Ottoman foreign debt had been in European hands. During the World War I, the empire under the CUP was &quot;virtually an economic colony on the verge of total collapse.&quot;

===Nationalism===

Regarding nationalism, the Young Turks underwent a gradual transformation. Beginning with the Tanzimat with ethnically non-Turkish members participating at the outset, the Young Turks embraced the official state ideology: Ottomanism. However, Ottoman patriotism failed to strike root during the First Constitutional Era and the following years. Many ethnically non-Turkish Ottoman intellectuals rejected the idea because of its exclusive use of Turkish symbols. Turkish nationalists gradually gained the upper hand in politics, and following the 1902 Congress, a stronger focus on nationalism developed. It was at this time that Ahmed Rıza chose to replace the term &quot;Ottoman&quot; with &quot;Turk,&quot; shifting the focus from Ottoman nationalism to Turkish nationalism.

==Aftermath and legacy==
In the aftermath of an assassination attempt by remaining Unionists, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, is quoted on the front page of the 1 August 1926 &quot;The Los Angeles Examiner&quot; as denouncing the Young Turks and especially the CUP (the &quot;Young Turk Party&quot;):

Historian Uğur Ümit Üngör, in his book &quot;The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia&quot;, has claimed that the &quot;Republican People&#x27;s Party, which was founded by Mustafa Kemal, was the successor of CUP and continued ethnic cleansing policies of its predecessor in Eastern Anatolia until the year 1950. Thus, Turkey was transformed into an ethnically homogenous state.&quot;

As to the fate of the Three Pashas, two of them, Talaat Pasha and Cemal Pasha, were assassinated by Armenian nationals shortly after the end of World War I while in exile in Europe during Operation Nemesis, a revenge operation against perpetrators of the Armenian genocide. Soghomon Tehlirian, whose family was killed in the Armenian genocide, assassinated the exiled Talaat Pasha in Berlin and was subsequently acquitted on all charges by a German jury. Cemal Pasha was similarly killed by Stepan Dzaghikian, Bedros Der Boghosian, and Ardashes Kevorkian for &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in Tbilisi, Georgia. Enver Pasha, was killed in fighting against the Red Army unit under the command of Hakob Melkumian near Baldzhuan in Tajikistan (then Turkistan).

<doc id="288560" wikidata="Q1492937" url="?curid=288560" title="Style Wars">
<text>Style Wars is an American 1983 documentary film on hip hop culture, directed by Tony Silver and produced in collaboration with Henry Chalfant. The film has an emphasis on graffiti, although bboying and rapping are covered to a lesser extent. The film was originally aired on the television network PBS and was subsequently shown in several film festivals to much acclaim, including the Vancouver Film Festival. It also won the Grand Jury Prize: Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival.

The documentary captures and includes many historical moments of hip hop culture during its earliest days in the 1970s onward towards the early 1980s. Many film elements from &quot;Style Wars&quot;, including outtakes, are now housed at the Academy Film Archive as part of the Tony Silver Collection.

==Background==
The documentary explores divergent perspectives on graffiti, articulated by graffiti artists, city officials including former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, and other stakeholders such as police officers, subway maintenance personnel, and citizens. Prominent figures in the graffiti community, including artists Kase 2, Dondi, Shy 147, Seen, and Skeme along with his mother, feature prominently. The film also highlights contributions from graffiti documentarian and co-producer Henry Chalfant and breakdancer Crazy Legs of Rock Steady Crew.

While the documentary posits graffiti as a legitimate artistic expression, it concurrently portrays the vigorous efforts by municipal authorities and law enforcement to curtail this form of urban art. The administration under Mayor Koch undertook substantial measures, including the allocation of considerable funds towards anti-graffiti campaigns in subway systems, the construction of barriers at subway entry points to deter graffiti artists, and the deployment of police dogs to these locations.

The narrative extends beyond mere criminalization, presenting viewpoints from established artists who argue that the lack of accessible venues drives young artists to express themselves on public and private edifices. This demographic, often marginalized, seeks to engage with the community and articulate their identities through visible, albeit illegal, marks on urban landscapes. The documentary navigates these complex social dynamics, positioning some participants as intermediaries who recognize the artistic value while critiquing the methods of execution, thus embodying a dual role in the discourse on graffiti as both art and act of defiance.

==Reception and legacy==
In 2009, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; examined the film:

&quot;&quot;Style Wars&quot; is a work of art in its own right too, because it doesn&#x27;t just record what these artists are doing, it somehow absorbs their spirit and manages to communicate it across the decades so that we can find ourselves, so many years later, in the city, understanding what made it beautiful.&quot;

A 2018 review from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also recommends the film, citing its soundtrack and its ability to capture the historical moment it centers on.

Pitchfork referred to the film as the &quot;defining documentary of early hip-hop culture&quot;.

<text>Miquelon-Langlade () is the larger but less populated of the two communes (municipalities) making up the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, located to the south of Newfoundland in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It consists of three islands: Miquelon (also called ), Langlade (&quot;Petite Miquelon&quot;) and Le Cap, connected by narrow tombolos (sandy isthmus).

<doc id="288574" wikidata="Q3352823" url="?curid=288574" title="Ontario Northland Railway">
<text>The Ontario Northland Railway is a Canadian railway operated by the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission, a provincial Crown agency of the government of Ontario.

Originally built to develop the Lake Timiskaming and Lake Nipissing areas, the railway soon became a major factor in the economic growth of the province. After decades of difficult construction through the Canadian Shield, workers reached James Bay in 1932. While blasting the route through the shield, geologists discovered deposits of valuable minerals such as gold, silver, copper and nickel. The railway also made it possible to exploit the timber resources of Northern Ontario.

Its north–south mainline is located entirely in Ontario, starting at its southern terminus at North Bay, running northward through Cobalt, New Liskeard, Cochrane, and on to its northern terminus at Moosonee on the Moose River, about south of the shore of James Bay. There is one major branchline running eastward from Swastika through Kirkland Lake and over the Quebec border to end at Rouyn-Noranda. The railway&#x27;s branch from Swastika to Rouyn-Noranda, including 40 kilometres of track in Quebec, is operated by a subsidiary, the Nipissing Central Railway.

Shorter spur lines also exist running west from Rock Junction to Sherman Mine, south-west from Porquis Junction to Kidd Creek Mine, about 22 km east of Timmins, north-east from Porquis to Iroquois Falls and south from Opaz Junction to Agrium mine site. Several other mining spurs opened and closed with the mines they served. Since 1993, the ONR operates a section of the National Transcontinental Railway running west from Cochrane to Calstock.

==History==
===James Bay Railway===

The line was originally chartered as the Lake Nipissing And James Bay Railway in 1884. The original route ran roughly northward from Callander to Moose River on James Bay. However, in 1902, before construction started, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) took over the charter and used it as the basis for a new line running northwest from Parry Sound to Sudbury, with an additional line running from Parry Sound south to Toronto. The section running south to Toronto opened on November 6, 1906. The northern section was completed in 1908, although by this time it had been rechartered as part of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway (CNOR).

===Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (1902–46)===
With the original plans having been dropped, and a railway on this route still desired, the new Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was incorporated on 17 March 1902, by the &quot;Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act&quot; of the Ontario parliament. The railway was to be a provincial Crown corporation overseen by the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission. Construction on the railway started in 1903, and the settlement of Redwater in the municipality of Temagami began as a small request stop when the railway reached the area of the Lower and Upper Redwater Lakes.

As it passed by Long Lake, near the 103 mile marker, the largest silver rush in Canada was sparked by workers looking for trees for railway ties. The town of Cobalt grew out of the fortunes of silver taken from the grounds. By 1905, it reached New Liskeard in the Lake Timiskaming area. The railway reached Englehart in 1906 and Cochrane in 1909. In the next few years, several branch lines were built.

In 1921, construction on a line north to James Bay was started. In 1923, the new Conservative premier of Ontario, Howard Ferguson, halted further construction, saying that it would be unprofitable. For four years the terminus of the line remained at Fraserdale, near Abitibi Canyon, where the Abitibi Canyon Generating Station was being built on the Abitibi River. Between 1928 and 1930 the railway was extended north at a slow pace. The pace of construction was quickened in 1930 as a make-work project due to the depression. The extension to James Bay was opened on July 15, 1932. The terminus of the railway was at the mouth of the Moose River near the old trading post of Revillon Frères. It was named Moosonee, from the Cree meaning &quot;at the moose&quot;.

A name change for the railway was first proposed in 1942 by Arthur Cavanagh, who was chairman of the commission between 1940 and 1944. He noted that it would have the advantage of associating the railway with the province, not just the District of Timiskaming. A name change would also avoid confusion with the Texas and New Orleans Railway, which had the same initials. The Ontario railway often had boxcars misdirected in the United States, while receiving invoices that should have gone to Texas. The railway&#x27;s name was changed to the Ontario Northland Railway on April 5, 1946, when a bill amending the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act received assent.

===1946–2010===

Three new mines were opened in Northern Ontario in the 1960s. Sherman Mine in Temagami was opened in 1968, Adams Mine in Kirkland Lake in 1963, and Kidd Creek Mine in Timmins in 1967. The Ontario Northland Railway built spurs to serve these mines.

In 1993, CN applied to abandon sections of its underused former National Transcontinental Railway mainline across northern Ontario (it had previously abandoned the portion of the line between Calstock and Nakina in 1988). The portion between Calstock and Cochrane was sold to ONR.

In December 2000, the Ontario government announced that it would be privatizing the railway. CN submitted a bid in March 2002, and in October the government gave it exclusive rights to negotiate a purchase of the railway. However, the deal fell through on July 2, 2003, over the government&#x27;s insistence on job guarantees, and the railway remained in public hands. On February 25, 2005, CN and ONR signed a routing agreement in which ONR would transport CN&#x27;s freight traffic between Noranda and either Hearst or North Bay.

On April 14, 2010, there was news of a proposed Ontario Northland takeover of the controversial Ottawa Valley rail tracks. However, this development never came to fruition.

===Proposed divestment, end of the &quot;Northlander&quot;, restructuring (2012–2014)===
On March 23, 2012, the Ontario government announced that it would begin to wind down the ONTC, citing increased costs to the government and stagnant ridership. ONR passenger train service between Toronto and Cochrane (the &quot;Northlander&quot;) was withdrawn and replaced with an augmented bus service, and all of the corporation&#x27;s assets were to be sold off. On August 16, the Ontario Government announced that &quot;Northlander&quot; train service would end on September 28, 2012, and Ontera will be sold off.

Northern Ontario municipal leaders had continued to express their fears regarding the divestment. They indicated that the ONR provides a fundamental link to many remote and rural communities and provides freight transport to many companies, including mining and forestry, allowing them to thrive. They indicate that the government maintained its funding to the GO Transit network in Southern Ontario and it is important to not forget about the important service the ONR provides to Northern Ontario residents. In February 2014, the new premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, met with northern community leaders and the head of the company and union to discuss the future of the company. They decided the union and management would present a reconstruction plan to the government for consideration.

In late February 2014 a report to restructure the ONTC was delivered to the Minister of Northern Development and Mines. The proposal detailed how the organization could be modernized both culturally and in job reductions through attrition. The report was well received by the minister who appreciated how management and labour come together to explore options for the corporation.

In April 2014 the provincial government concluded the company would remain in public hands. However, Ontera (its telecommunication division) would be sold off to Bell Aliant. The government would reinvest in the company to purchase new coaches and refurbish rolling stock for the &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot;. This decision was supported by other members of Provincial Parliament after the auditor general&#x27;s review cited that it would have cost the taxpayer $820 million instead of saving $265.9 million over three years had the divestment proceeded.

===Plans to resume passenger service===
In December 2020, the province released the draft transportation plan for Northern Ontario which recommended continuing to move forward on a plan for passenger rail services. In May 2021, the provincial government announced plans for Ontario Northland and Metrolinx to write a business plan to resume passenger operations between Toronto and northeastern Ontario with a 13-stop route to begin service by the mid-2020s. In November 2021, the decision was made to make the new terminus Timmins (previously Cochrane) due to its size and the fact that it serves as a regional transportation hub. A test run was conducted in March 2021, and again in November of 2021 where several northern Ontario mayors, MPPs, and local residents were taken from North Bay to Toronto&#x27;s Union station.

In December 2022, the provincial government announced that it would purchase 3 new train sets from Siemens Mobility Limited at a cost of $140million. Each train set would consist of a Charger locomotive and three Venture passenger cars. The train sets are for the restoration of Northlander train service between Toronto and Cochrane, which would operate four to seven times per week depending on season. There would be 16 stops: Toronto (Union Station), Langstaff, Gormley, Washago, Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, Huntsville, South River, North Bay, Temagami, Temiskaming Shores, Englehart, Kirkland Lake/Swastika, Matheson, Timmins and Cochrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar-2022/12/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passenger trains==

ONR operates or operated the following passenger services:
* the &quot;Northlander&quot; ran from Cochrane to Toronto, 6 days per week, year-round until September 28, 2012 when the Ontario Liberal Government discontinued it and replaced it with bus service. However, in May 2021 it announced plans for a resumption of passenger operations to begin sometime in the mid-2020s
* the &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot; from Cochrane to Moosonee, 5 days per week, year-round, and 6 days per week in the summer. This is a flag stop train. The Ontario government has stated its intention to preserve this service even as the ONTC winds down, saying that it will &quot;develop ... a new model to provide ongoing support for essential transportation services, such as the Polar Bear Express.&quot;
* the &quot;Dream Catcher Express&quot; from North Bay to Temagami, an early fall excursion service. This service ended in 2012.

In June 2007 the Polar Bear Express was expanded from a seasonal excursion service to a year-round passenger train, replacing the &quot;Little Bear&quot; mixed freight/passenger train, which had operated 3 days per week. The new train carries some equipment not commonly found on passenger trains, including chain cars (flat cars) for passenger vehicles and boxcars.

In April 2022 the Ontario Government announced that it would invest $75-million (CAD), into infrastructure and towards resuming service between Toronto and Timmins.

==Freight services==
Connections with other railway systems are made as follows:
* North Bay (CN and Ottawa Valley Railway, which connects to CP)
* Hearst (Algoma Central Railway)
* Rouyn-Noranda (CN)

There are a series of regular runs including:
*North Bay to Cochrane – Weekdays
*North Bay to Timmins (Hallnor) – Weekdays
*North Bay to Rouyn, QC – Daily (except Saturday)
*Cochrane to Hearst – Weekdays
*Cochrane to Moosonee – Tuesday and Friday
*Hearst to Agrium Mine Site – Daily

==Locomotives and rolling stock==

The railway currently owns about 25 diesel locomotives and roughly 700 items of rolling stock. One of its more unusual pieces of rolling stock is a canoe car, which is in service in the summer as part of the Polar Bear Express passenger train. The car can hold up to 18 canoes. Canoeists can put canoes on this car as part of their baggage, although canoes are often stowed in boxcars. It is the only known train car specifically designed for transporting canoes and kayaks.

In 1977, the railway purchased four RAm/DE train sets retired from the Trans Europ Express by the Dutch and Swiss railways, for use on its Northlander train. However, the experiment was not entirely successful. The locomotives were scrapped in 1984, although the passenger cars survived until the early 1990s. These surviving passenger cars were pulled by rebuilt Canadian locomotives (EMD FP7). The rear end of the locomotives was altered to fit to original cars. With the Canadian locomotives, the control car / DVT lost their function.

Many passenger cars used on ONR trains today are former single-level GO Transit cars that were extensively refurbished after being used for commuter service around Toronto.

In 2004, Ontario Northland purchased ten passenger cars, including dome cars, from BC Rail and has used some of them on the Polar Bear Express service between Cochrane and Moosonee.

<text>Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars. Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) of lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. The event is celebrated by numerous cultures in various ways at diverse dates. The determination of the first day of a new lunar or lunisolar year varies by culture.

In 2023, the United Nations General Assembly designated the &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; as a &quot;UN holiday&quot;, recognizing the spring festival that coincides with the Chinese New Year and is also celebrated in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Korea among others. Some states in the US, including California and New York, officially celebrate the Lunar New Year as a public holiday in recognition of the Chinese New Year.

The better-known celebrations include new years based on the (lunar) Islamic calendar and the (lunisolar) Jewish calendar that originated in the Middle East; the (lunisolar) Chinese calendar and Tibetan calendar of East Asia; and the (lunisolar) Buddhist and Hindu calendars of Southeast and South Asia. 
==Definition==
&#x27;Lunar New Years&#x27; and &#x27;Lunisolar New Years&#x27; are events celebrated by billions of people across the world on the first new moon of their calendar. Typically, the new year of a purely lunar calendar is determined by the first new moon after the end of a cycle of twelve lunar months (and ignores the solar cycle). The new year of a lunisolar calendar is typically determined by the first, second or even third new new moon after the winter solstice, or after an equinox. 

The Islamic New Year (also called the Hijri New Year or 1Muharram) is determined by the Islamic calendar, a purely lunar calendar. Lunisolar New Year celebrations in East and Central Asia, such as Chinese New Year, are based on a lunisolar calendar. Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes). Some Lunisolar New Year celebrations, such as in Korea and Vietnam, generally fall on the same day as the Chinese celebration in late January or February, due to being based on the Chinese calendar or a variation of it. However, celebration customs and holiday durations may differ. Lunisolar New Year celebrations of other cultures such as Burmese, Cambodian, Lao, Sri Lankan, and Thai people are based on the Buddhist calendar and occur in mid-April. &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot;, the new year in the (lunisolar) Hebrew calendar, is based on the September equinox.

Although &quot;Lunisolar New Year&quot; would be a more accurate term, the name &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; has been promoted by people from some Asian countries, especially in Vietnam and South Korea, leading to a rise in its use. In the United States of America, &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; is strongly associated with Chinese Americans and &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; is commonly used as a translation by people of non-Chinese backgrounds. Chinese New Year is the official name of the celebration and holiday in some countries such as Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia. However, the celebration has officially been known as &quot;Spring Festival&quot; (春节/春節 chūnjié) in China since the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 when the previous name, &quot;Yuandan&quot; (The First Day), was assigned to the first day of the Gregorian calendar. Chinese people outside China refer to it as both &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; as well as &quot;Chinese New Year&quot;. Since at least the mid-2010s, there has been criticism in the United States regarding the use of the term &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; in an official capacity, particularly by Korean and Vietnamese people. Some American politicians have avoided using the term &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; in preference for &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;.

==Celebrations by region==

=== Middle East and West Asia ===
Lunar New Year and Lunisolar New Year celebrations that originated in the Middle East fall on different days:

* The Lunar Hijri calendar used by most of Islam, is a purely lunar calendar comprising 12 lunar months: its year is shorter by about ten or eleven days than the Gregorian calendar year. Consequently Islamic New Year&#x27;s Day may fall in any season: occasionally there can be two Islamic new years in one Gregorian year (as last happened in 2008). In 2023, the Islamic New Year fell on 7 or 8 July 2024 and is estimated to fall on 25 – 26 June 2025. (The Solar Hijri calendar, used in Iran, is a purely solar calendar. Its New Year&#x27;s Day is always the day of the northward equinox.)
* In Judaism, there are as many as four lunar new year observances. Since the Hebrew calendar is lunisolar, the days always fall in the same season.
** Nisan is the month of the &quot;barley ripening&quot;, or &quot;spring&quot; Aviv/Abib, and the book of Exodus 12:1–2, has God instructing Moses to command the Israelites to fix the new moon, the 1st day, of Nisan at the first, or head moon of the year. The talmud in Rosh Hashanah (tractate) 2a calls this the &quot;Rosh HaShana&quot;, the new year, for kings and pilgrimages. The climax of this lunar new year is the festival of Passover, which begins on 15 Nisan/Abib (Aviv). It is also the first day of secular new years in Karaite Judaism and Samaritanism.
** 1 Elul corresponds to the New Year for Animal Tithes in the Rabbinic tradition. Elul is the sixth month, a very late summer/early autumn holiday. It is the date on which the Samaritan calendar advances a year, on the theory that 1 Elul commemorates the creation of the Earth.
** 1 Tishrei, is called Yom teruah, &quot;Day of (trumpet) Blasts&quot; in the written Torah, and it falls on the first of the &quot;seventh month&quot;. It is translated &quot;Feast of Trumpets&quot; in most English bible translations. This &quot;Day of trumpet Blasts&quot; was also called &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot;, literally &quot;new year&quot;, in Rabbinic Judaism, on the theory that it is &quot;Yom haDin&quot;, a universal judgment day for all the children of Adam including Jews. Thus the universal, secular new year. It is the date on which the Rabbinic calendar advances a year, on the theory that 1 Tishrei is the day on which the world was born. Rosh Hashanah also inaugurates the ten days known as the High Holy Days/High Holidays or &quot;Days of Awe&quot;, culminating with Yom Kippur; which is the holiest day of the year in Rabbinic Judaism. For Samaritans and Karaites, Passover remains the holiest day of the year.
** Tu BiShvat is the New Year for Trees in Rabbinic Judaism. On this day, every tree ages one year. The age of a tree determines whether it is subject to certain tithes. In the modern era, it has become festive holiday with some ecological overtones.

=== East Asia ===
Most of East Asia celebrates the Lunisolar New Year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. While commonly referred to as &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; in the Western world, it is actually a Lunisolar New Year. Japan observes the Solar New Year, except for the Ryukyu islands which continues to observe the Lunisolar New Year.

*Chinese New Year (; Wugniu: &quot;2non-liq8 1sin-gnie2&quot; or ; Wugniu: &quot;1tshen-tsiq7&quot;, in Hokkien: ; , also found in many varieties)
*Tujia New Year ( or )
*Tsagaan Sar (Mongolian New Year) Mongol Bichig: 
*Hmong New Year (Hmongic: Nongx Yangx; Chinese: )
*Japanese New Year (Japanese: ) (before 1873)
*Ryukyu New Year
*Korean New Year ()
*Vietnamese New Year (; chữ Hán: )

Tibetans and Mongols celebrate the Lunisolar New Year in February or early March, based on the closely related Tibetan calendar. Chinese Mongols celebrate Tsagaan Sar according to Chinese calendar. Because the Uyghurs based their dates on the Chinese calendar, and the Mongols and Tibetans adopted the Uyghur calendar, Tibetan and Mongolian New Year can either coincide with the Chinese New Year, or take place around one month later.
*Tsagaan Sar (Mongolian New Year) (; &quot;Cagán sar&quot;; Mongol Bichig: ᠴᠠᠭᠠᠨ ᠰᠠᠷᠠ)
*Losar (Tibetan New Year) ()

==== China ====
The history of the Chinese New Year festival can be traced back to more than 4000 years ago. Before the new year celebration was formed, ancient Chinese gathered around and celebrated at the end of harvest in autumn. However, the celebration is not Mid-Autumn Festival, during which Chinese gathered with family and worship the moon. In the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, a poem written during Western Zhou (1045 BC – 771 BC), by an anonymous farmer, described how people cleaned up millet stack-sites, toasted to guests with mijiu, killed lambs and cooked the meat, went to their master&#x27;s home, toasted to the master, and cheered for long lives together, in the 10th month of an ancient solar calendar, which was in autumn. The celebration is believed to be one of the prototypes of the Chinese New Year.

The first dated Chinese new year celebration can be traced back to the Warring States period (475 BC – 221 BC). In &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, an exorcistic ritual called &quot;Big Nuo ()&quot; was recorded being carried out in the ending day of a year to expel illness in Qin. Later, after Qin unified China and the Qin dynasty was founded, the ritual was continued. It evolved to cleaning up houses thoroughly in the preceding days of Chinese New Year.

The first mentioning of the celebration of the start of a new year was recorded in Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). In the book (), written by Eastern Han&#x27;s agronomist and writer Cui Shi (), the celebration was recorded by stating &quot;The starting day of the first month, is called &#x27;Zheng Ri&#x27;. I bring my wife and children, to worship ancestors and commemorate my father.&quot; Later he wrote: &quot;Children, wife, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren all serve pepper wine to their parents, make their toast, and wish their parents good health. It&#x27;s a thriving view.&quot; People also went to acquaintances&#x27; homes and wished each other a happy new year. In &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; Volume 27, , a county officer was recorded going to his prefect&#x27;s house with a government secretary, toasting to the prefect and praising the prefect&#x27;s merit.

Chinese New Year is the grandest ancient traditional festival in China, commonly known as &quot;Guo Nian&quot;. This festival means the beginning of spring and the arrival of the new year. The customs of Chinese New Year include sticking Spring Festival couplets, buying New Year&#x27;s goods, and having family dinner together.

==== Korea ====
The earliest references to Korean New Year are found in 7th-century Chinese historical works, the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; and the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;, containing excerpts of celebrations during the New Year in the Silla Kingdom for Korean calendar, which was influenced by the Tang dynasty&#x27;s calendar system. Korea&#x27;s own record of new year celebration is found in (&quot;Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms&quot;), compiled in the 13th century. Under the rule of 21st King of Silla, new year was celebrated in 488 AD. Then celebration of Korean New Year have continued to Goryeo and Joseon. By the 13th century, Korean New Year was one of the nine major Korean festivals that included ancestral rites, according to the Korean historical work, the .

As opposed to red envelopes, Korean New Year tends to involve white envelopes.

==== Taiwan ====
While there is little recorded history of when Lunar New Year was first observed in Taiwan, it is known that the indigenous population had other ceremonies and did not originally celebrate the festival. It was likely first celebrated by the Hakka or Hoklo populations that migrated from now part of mainland China to the island during the 17th century. Due to Taiwan&#x27;s population being mostly Han Chinese, its Lunar New Year celebration is very similar to that of mainland China, especially in regards to traditions. In addition, some Lunar New Year&#x27;s customs during the Ming and Qing Dynasties were preserved in Taiwan. However, in modern day, there can be more of a focus on visiting Buddhist or Taoist temples with extended family members. There are also notable variations to the food that is eaten during this time, such as the consumption of pineapple cakes and other products derived from pineapples or daikon since the latter is a homophone for &quot;good fortune&quot; in Hokkien.

==== Japan ====
Since 1873, the official Japanese New Year has been celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar, on January 1 of each year, . Prior to 1872, traditional events of the Japanese New Year were celebrated on the first day of the year on the modern Tenpō calendar, the last official lunisolar calendar and, prior to Jōkyō calendar, the Chinese version.

In the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, including Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, people traditionally celebrate Lunar New Year on the first day of the lunar calendar. While the Lunar New Year is not commonly celebrated in Japan, it is celebrated in various Japanese Chinatowns, such as Yokohama Chinatown, Nankin-machi, and Shinichi Chukagai in Nagasaki.

===South Asia===
These South Asian traditional lunisolar celebrations are observed according to the local lunisolar calendars. They are influenced by Indian tradition, which marks the system of lunar months in a solar sidereal year. A separate solar new year also exists for those Indian regions which use solar months in a solar sidereal year.
* Gudi Padwa: Maharashtra and Goa.
* Ugadi: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka
* Puthandu: Tamil Nadu
* Chaitra Navaratri: North and Central India
* Balipratipada: Gujarat, Rajasthan
* Cheti Chand: Sindhi Hindus
* Navreh: Kashmiri Hindus
* Sajibu Cheiraoba: Manipur
* Mha Puja: Nepal (Newaris)
The following are influenced by the Tibetan calendar:
* Galdan Namchot: Ladakh
* Losoong: Sikkim
* Losar: Arunachal Pradesh (Monpas)
* Gyalpo Lhosar: Sherpas
* Tamu Lhosar: Gurungs
* Sonam Lhosar: Tamangs

==== India ====
Various lunar calendars continue to be used throughout India in traditional and religious life. However, they are different from the Chinese lunisolar calendar used in East Asia. The two most common lunar new year celebrations in India are Diwali, and Gudi Padwa/Ugadi/Puthandu. Diwali typically falls in October or November, and Gudi Padwa/Ugadi/Puthandu typically falls in April.

In ancient times, the sun&#x27;s entry into Aries coincided with the equinox. However, due to the earth&#x27;s axial precession, the sidereal year is slightly longer than the tropical year, causing the dates to gradually drift apart. Today, the sun&#x27;s entry into Aries occurs around 18 April, according to astronomical definitions. Some traditional calendars are still marked by the sun&#x27;s actual movements while others have since been fixed to the Gregorian calendar.

The sun&#x27;s entry into Aries is known as &quot;&quot; in Sanskrit, and is observed as Mesha Sankranti and Songkran in South and South-east Asian cultures.

===Southeast Asia===
The following Southeast Asian Lunar New Year celebration is observed according to the local lunisolar calendar and is influenced by Indian Hindu traditions.

* Nyepi &quot;(Balinese New Year)&quot;: Bali, Indonesia
* Rija Nukan &quot;(Cham New Year)&quot;: Chams
The following Southeast Asian Lunar New Year celebration is observed according to the local lunisolar calendar and is influenced by Islamic traditions.
* Satu Suro &quot;(Javanese New Year)&quot;: The Javanese calendar follows a purely lunar calendar of 12 months that retrogresses through the Gregorian and Julian calendar years. As in the Islamic calendar, the day of Javanese New Year may thus fall in any season on the calendar.

==== Malaysia ====
Malaysia is a multi-cultural country. The three dominant ethnic groups in Malaysia are the Malays, the Chinese, and the Indians. Each group has its unique culture and traditional festivals. Public holidays are declared on the three important festivals celebrated by the Malays, Chinese, and Indians, namely Hari Raya Puasa, Chinese New Year and Deepavali respectively.

As timing of these three important festivals fluctuates due to their reliance on the lunar calendars, they occasionally occur close to one another—every 33 years to be exact. Malaysians has named this phenomenon Kongsi Raya (Gongxi Raya), a Malaysian portmanteau, denoting the Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Aidilfitri festivals.

==== Singapore ====
Lunar New Year is officially known as &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; in Singapore. It is celebrated in Singapore primarily by members of the Chinese diaspora, the Peranakans as well as their descendants, who make up three-quarters of the population. They include those who are Hokkien, Cantonese and Teochew from southeastern China; Hainanese from the island province of Hainan; and Hakka, a migrant group spread out all over China. The Peranakans have been in the region for over 400 years and also have mixed Malay and European ancestry. Each ethnic group has its own set of traditions, as well as creating new ones incorporating elements from other cultures like Malays and Indians.

==== Vietnam ====
Chinese migrants brought with them their own policies, cultures, and traditions. The Lunar New Year was passed to the Vietnamese people and has stayed relatively intact through the centuries, despite uneasy and often hostile relations between the two countries. The main difference between the Chinese and Vietnamese calendars is that the Vietnamese zodiac replaces the Ox and Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac with the Buffalo and Cat, respectively. However, it is noteworthy that the Tết Nguyên Đán (Spring Festival) which is celebrated in late January or in the first half of February coincides with the onset of Spring in the regions of northern Vietnam and parts of southern China where the ancient Laos–Thailand kingdom of Âu Lạc and some regions of the Baiyue people are located. The celebration marks the beginning of a new planting season, particularly rice. There is also the historical legend of the origin of bánh chưng, which started on the occasion of Tết. All early written records of the country have been destroyed through the millennia by numerous invasions from various groups.

Vietnamese New Year can also be traced back to the Lý dynasty (1009 AD – 1226 AD). Vietnamese people often celebrated their Tết holiday by painting tattoos on themselves, drinking rice liquor, eating betel nuts, and making &quot;bánh chưng&quot;, as well as pickled onions. During the period of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông (1442 AD – 1497 AD), Tết was considered a significant festival in Vietnam. Today, the rule for determining Vietnamese New Year day is the same with that of China, so the day of Lunar New Year in China and Vietnam mostly coincide. Lucky money is also given on Lunar New Year.

===North America===

==== Canada ====
Hobiyee, also spelled Hoobiyee, Hobiiyee and Hoobiiyee, is the new year of the Nisg̱a&#x27;a people, celebrated in February or March. It signifies the emergence of the first crescent moon and begins the month Buxw-laḵs. Celebrations of Hobiyee are done by Nisg̱a&#x27;a wherever they are located, but the largest celebrations are in Nisg̱a&#x27;a itself and in areas with a large Nisg̱a&#x27;a presence like Vancouver.

==Recognition by the United Nations==
After a decade of advocating for its inclusion by China and also other countries in Asia, the United Nations unanimously passed a resolution at its headquarters in December 2023, to recognize the &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; (based on the lunisolar Chinese calendar), as a floating holiday, at the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly. This means that starting in 2024, UN bodies are encouraged to avoid holding meetings during that day, marking Lunar New Year as the eighth floating holiday that is observed by UN staff internationally.

The United Nations&#x27;s &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; holiday, recognizes the spring festival that coincides with the &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; and is also celebrated in Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Canada, and Suriname. Some states in the US, including California and New York, officially celebrate the Lunar New Year as a public holiday coinciding with the Chinese New Year.

The company was founded on 21 March 1969 and was officially incorporated under the name on 19 March 1973. The company&#x27;s founder and chairman, Kagemasa Kōzuki (also known as Kaz Kozuki), ran a jukebox rental and repair business in Toyonaka, Osaka, before transforming the business into a manufacturer of amusement machines for video arcades. The name &quot;Konami&quot; is a portmanteau of the names of three founding members: Kagemasa Kōzuki, Yoshinobu Nakama, and Tatsuo Miyasako. Their first coin-operated video game was released in 1978, and they began exporting products to the United States the following year.

Konami began to achieve success with arcade games in the early 1980s, starting with &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981), followed by hits such as &quot;Frogger&quot; (1981), &quot;Super Cobra&quot; (1981), &quot;Time Pilot&quot; (1982), &quot;Roc&#x27;n Rope&quot; (1983), &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983), and &quot;Yie Ar Kung-Fu&quot; (1985). Many of their early games were licensed to other companies for US release, including Centuri, Stern Electronics, Sega, and Gremlin Industries. They established their U.S. subsidiary, Konami Inc. (later Konami of America Inc., and Konami Digital Entertainment Inc.), in November 1982; initially based in Torrance, California, they would later move to Buffalo Grove, Illinois, in 1984 following their acquisition of arcade distributor Interlogic, Inc., with Interlogic founder and president Ben Harel serving as president of Konami Inc. It was during this period that Konami began expanding their video game business into the home consumer market following a brief stint releasing video games for the Atari 2600 in 1982 for the U.S. market. The company released numerous games for the MSX home computer standard in 1983, followed by the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Numerous Konami franchises were established during this period on both platforms, as well as the arcades, such as &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;TwinBee&quot;, &quot;Ganbare Goemon&quot;, &quot;Contra&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, in addition to success with hit licensed games such as &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (&quot;TMNT&quot;). Due to the success of their arcade and NES games, Konami&#x27;s earnings grew from $10 million in 1987 to $300 million in 1991. The first &quot;TMNT&quot; arcade game (1989) was Konami&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game.

In June 1991, Konami&#x27;s legal name was changed to and their headquarters were relocated to Minato, Tokyo, in April 1993. The company started supporting the 16-bit video game consoles during this period, starting with the Super NES in 1990, followed by the PC Engine in 1991, and the Sega Genesis in 1992.

1991 was also the year when Konami introduced a new approach to combat piracy in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1991. If the game detected that it was an unauthorized copy, it subtly altered gameplay mechanics. The player’s attack damage was reduced, while enemy attacks became significantly stronger. Additionally, the game&#x27;s final boss, Shredder, was made invincible, rendering the game impossible to complete. This anti-piracy measure served as a deterrent to unauthorized copies by making the game frustratingly difficult for those using pirated versions.

After the launch of the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1994, Konami became a business divisional organization with the formation of various Konami Computer Entertainment (KCE) subsidiaries, starting with KCE Tokyo and KCE Osaka (later known as KCE Studios) in April 1995, followed by KCE Japan (later known as Kojima Productions) in April 1996. Each KCE subsidiary created different intellectual properties such as KCE Tokyo&#x27;s &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series and KCE Japan&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series (a revival of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series on MSX). In 1997, Konami started producing rhythm games for arcades under the Bemani brand and branched off into the collectible card game business with the launch of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. Konami was not only known for its card games, it also imported into the Pachinko business. Pachinko played a huge role in Konami&#x27;s success as it started to popularize new never before seen characters.

In July 2000, the company&#x27;s legal English name was changed to Konami Corporation, but the Japanese legal name remained the same. As the company transitioned into developing video games for the sixth-generation consoles, they branched out into the health and fitness business acquiring People Co., Ltd and Daiei Olympic Sports Club, Inc. which became Konami subsidiaries. In August 2001, the company invested in another video game publisher, Hudson Soft, which became a consolidated subsidiary after Konami accepted new third-party shares issued by them. In January 2003, Avranches Automatique began handling sales of Konami&#x27;s arcade games in Europe outside the U.K. and Ireland. On February 7, 2003, Betson Enterprises took over distribution and service for Konami&#x27;s arcade games in the U.S. Some time later, PMT Sales started handling Konami arcade game sales in the U.K. and Ireland. In March 2006, Konami merged all their video game development divisions into a new subsidiary known as Konami Digital Entertainment Co. (KDE), as the parent company became a pure holding company. Their headquarters were relocated to Minato, Tokyo, in 2007. On January 20, 2009, Electrocoin became the exclusive distributor and after-sale agent of Konami&#x27;s arcade games in Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa.

The absorption of Hudson Soft in 2012 resulted in the addition of several other franchises including: &quot;Adventure Island&quot;, &quot;Bonk&quot;, &quot;Bloody Roar&quot;, &quot;Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Far East of Eden&quot;, and &quot;Star Soldier&quot;.

In April 2015, Konami delisted itself from the New York Stock Exchange following the dissolution of their Kojima Productions subsidiary. In a translated interview with Nikkei Trendy Net published in the following month, the newly appointed president of Konami&#x27;s gaming division, Konami Digital Entertainment, Hideki Hayakawa, announced that Konami would shift their focus towards mobile gaming for a while, claiming that &quot;mobile is where the future of gaming lies.&quot; The trade name of the company was changed from Konami Corporation to Konami Holdings Corporation during the same month. Konami consolidated its productions teams established in 2004 into their headquarters, including Pawapuro Production, BEMANI Production, Virtual Kiss Production, Loveplus Production, Kojima Productions and others, that year.

In 2017, Konami announced that they would be reviving some of the company&#x27;s other well-known video game titles following the success of their Nintendo Switch launch title &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot;.

In early 2020, Konami moved their headquarters to the Ginza district of Tokyo, which includes a facility for holding esports events as well as a school for esports players.

Konami announced a major restructuring of Konami Digital Entertainment on 25 January 2021, which including the dissolution of its Product Divisions 1, 2, and 3 to be reconsolidated into a new structure to be announced at a later time. Konami affirmed this would not affect their commitment to video games and was only an internal restructuring. On 1 July 2022 Konami changed their corporate name again from Konami Holdings Corporation to Konami Group Corporation.

In April 2023, Konami announced that it has opened a new studio in Osaka, Japan. The new offices, located in the Umeda Sky Building south building, will support the developer in its efforts both grow and endure over the coming decades. Konami suggested that the new building would be a core entity in the studio&#x27;s current and future projects, noting that it hopes Konami Osaka will encourage &quot;sustainable growth&quot; over the next 50 years.

In February 2024, Konami Digital Entertainment announced the establishment of its own anime studio called Konami Animation. The studio will invest the CG technology and know-how it fostered from game development into animation, and it plans not only to work on Konami&#x27;s own intellectual properties but in other properties as well. Its first work was a PV for Yu-Gi-Oh! 25th anniversary.

Konami produced its shoot &#x27;em up arcade games such as &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Life Force&quot;, &quot;Time Pilot&quot;, &quot;Gyruss&quot;, &quot;Parodius&quot;, &quot;Axelay&quot;, and &quot;TwinBee&quot;.

In Japan, it is known for the popular &quot;Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū series&quot; baseball series and the &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; games. The company had obtained the rights to &quot;Saw&quot; from Brash Entertainment when the game&#x27;s production had been suspended due to financial issues.

Konami is known for its password, the Konami Code, which traditionally gives many power-ups in its games.

Players can now participate in qualifying matches for two tournaments scheduled for 2024: one for mobile and one for consoles. This partnership aims to enhance eFootball&#x27;s visibility and attract new players, particularly those who were deterred by previous issues with the game.

==Film production==
In 2006, Konami started producing films based on their franchises. Konami produced the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; film (released in 2006) and announced that they will produce a &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; film. On 4 December 2020 Deadline reported that Oscar Isaac will star as Solid Snake in the adaptation, which is currently in development at Sony Pictures with Jordan Vogt-Roberts on board to direct.

==Personal computing==
In 2020, Konami launched a PC gaming brand in Japan known as Arespear, which includes desktop computers, keyboards, and headsets (the last of which designed in collaboration with Konami&#x27;s &quot;Bemani&quot; musicians).

==Controversies==
===&quot;Silent Hills&quot; and reduced video game development===
&quot;Silent Hills&quot;, set to be the ninth installment of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; video game series, was abruptly cancelled in April 2015 without explanation despite the critical acclaim and success of &quot;P.T.&quot;, a playable teaser. Hours after the announcement, Konami delisted itself from the New York Stock Exchange.

Game co-director and writer Guillermo del Toro publicly criticized the cancellation as not making any sense and questioned what he described as a &quot;scorched earth&quot; approach to removing the trailer. Due to the experience, del Toro stated that he would never work on another video game.

In 2015 Konami Digital Entertainment CEO Hideki Hayakawa announced that, with few exceptions, Konami would stop making console games and instead focus on the mobile gaming platform. The decision was heavily criticized by the video gaming community. Konami UK community manager Graham Day soon after pushed back against the reporting that Konami would cease AAA game production, stating that he believed the root of the problem to be either a mistranslation or a misinterpretation of Hayakawa&#x27;s remarks.

===Kojima Productions===
On 3 March 2015, Konami announced they would be shifting focus away from individual studios, notably Kojima Productions. Internal sources claimed the restructure was due to a clash between Hideo Kojima and Konami. References to Kojima were soon stripped from marketing material, and Kojima&#x27;s position as an executive vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment was removed from the company&#x27;s official listing of executives.

Later that year, Konami&#x27;s legal department barred Kojima from accepting the award for Best Action-Adventure for his work on &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; at The Game Awards 2015. When announced during the event, the audience booed in disapproval of Konami&#x27;s actions. Host Geoff Keighley expressed his disappointment in Konami&#x27;s actions. After actor Kiefer Sutherland accepted the award in Kojima&#x27;s stead, a choir sang &quot;Quiet&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; as a tribute to the absent Kojima. Kojima left Konami several days afterwards, re-opening Kojima Productions as an independent company.

===Treatment of employees and ex-employees===
In August 2015, &quot;The Nikkei&quot; criticized Konami for its unethical treatment of employees. In June 2017, &quot;The Nikkei&quot; further reported on Konami&#x27;s continued clashes with Kojima Productions, preventing the studio&#x27;s application for health insurance, as well as Konami&#x27;s actions in making it difficult for former employees to get future jobs; they are notably forbidden from mentioning their work with Konami on their résumés. Konami also started filing complaints against other game companies that hired ex-Konami employees, leading to an unspecified major game company warning its staff against doing so. A former employee of Konami stated: &quot;If an ex-[Konami employee] is interviewed by the media, the company will send that person a letter through a legal representative, in some cases indicating that Konami is willing to take them to court&quot;; they also pressured an ex-employee into closing their new business.

<text>A pardon is a government decision to allow a person to be relieved of some or all of the legal consequences resulting from a criminal conviction. A pardon may be granted before or after conviction for the crime, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction.

Pardons can be viewed as a tool to overcome miscarriage of justice, allowing a grant of freedom to someone who is believed to be wrongly convicted or subjected to an excessive penalty. The second-best theory of pardons views pardons as second-best to fair justice. Pardons can be granted in many countries when individuals are deemed to have demonstrated that they have &quot;paid their debt to society&quot;, or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them. In some jurisdictions of some nations, accepting a pardon may &quot;implicitly&quot; constitute an admission of guilt; the offer is refused in some cases. Cases of wrongful conviction are in recent times more often dealt with by appeal rather than by pardon; however, a pardon is sometimes offered when innocence is undisputed in order to avoid the costs that are associated with a retrial. Clemency plays a critical role when capital punishment exists in a jurisdiction.

Pardons can also be a source of controversy, such as when granted in what appears to be a political favor. The arbitrariness and limited political accountability of pardons have been criticized.

==By country==

===Australia===
In Australia, the pardon power is referred to as the royal prerogative of mercy, an executive power that is vested in the King and may be exercised by the governor-general. The prerogative of mercy is a broad discretionary power that may be exercised by a state governor who is acting on the advice of the state executive council and the state attorney general. Courts in Australia may also exercise their traditional power to exercise mercy when the circumstances of the defendant or offense warrant relief.

In addition to the prerogative of mercy, Australia has passed legislation that creates additional avenues to seek a pardon, exoneration, reduced sentence, or conditional release.

===Canada===
====Pardons====
The Parole Board of Canada (PBC) is the federal agency responsible for making pardon decisions under the &quot;Criminal Records Act&quot; (CRA). Under the CRA, the PBC can issue, grant, deny, and revoke pardons.

In 2012, the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Safe Streets and Communities Act&quot;, which changed many elements of the criminal justice system. The Act replaced the term &quot;pardon&quot; with &quot;record suspension&quot;, and the pardon system was similarly changed.

A pardon keeps the police record of a conviction separate and apart from other criminal records, and gives law-abiding citizens an opportunity to reintegrate into Canadian society.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police removes all information about the conviction for which an individual received the pardon from the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). Federal agencies cannot give out information about the conviction without approval from the minister of public safety.

A pardon does not, however, erase the fact that an individual was convicted of a crime. The criminal record is not erased, but it is kept separate and apart from other (non-pardoned) criminal records.

A pardon removes disqualifications caused by a criminal conviction, such as the ability to contract with the federal government, or eligibility for Canadian citizenship.

If an individual in receipt of a pardon is convicted of a new offence, the information may lead to a reactivation of the criminal record for which the pardon was received in CPIC.

A pardon does not guarantee entry or visa privileges to another country. Before travelling to another country, individuals must still contact the authorities of the country in question to find out what the requirements are to enter that country.

Processing of pardons by the Parole Board of Canada generally takes six months for a summary offence and twelve months for an indictable offence. If the Parole Board proposes to deny the application, it can take 24 months to process.

Individuals can apply for a pardon if they were convicted as an adult of a criminal offense in Canada, or of an offense under a federal act or regulation of Canada, or if they were convicted of a crime in another country and were transferred to Canada under the &quot;Transfer of Offenders Act&quot; or &quot;International Transfer of Offenders Act&quot;. Non-Canadian citizens are not eligible for a Canadian pardon unless they were convicted of a crime in Canada.

To be eligible for a pardon or record suspension, individuals must have completed all of their sentences and a waiting period.

Individuals are considered to have completed all of their sentences if they have:
* Paid all fines, surcharges, costs, restitution and compensation orders
* Served all sentences of imprisonment, conditional sentences, including parole or statutory release
* Completed their probation order

Prior to 2012, following completion of all of their sentences, individuals must have completed a waiting period, as follows:
* Three years for summary convictions under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; or other federal act or regulation, except sexual crimes against children
* Three years under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, if fined $2,000 or less, detained or imprisoned six months or less, or subjected to various lesser punishments for a service offence
* Five years for indictable convictions under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; or other federal act or regulation and summary convictions of sexual crimes against children
* Five years for all convictions by a Canadian offender transferred to Canada under the &quot;Transfer of Offenders Act&quot; or &quot;International Transfer of Offenders Act&quot;
* Five years under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, if you were fined more than $2,000, detained or imprisoned more than six months, or dismissed from service
* Ten years for indictable convictions for sexual crimes against children and criminals receiving more than two years of imprisonment time for &quot;serious personal injury offence&quot; such as manslaughter or other designated offence under section 752 of the Criminal Code.

Effective 13 March 2012, the eligibility criteria and waiting periods changed:
* Five years for summary convictions under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; or other federal act or regulation, except sexual crimes against children
* Five years under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, if fined $2,000 or less, detained or imprisoned six months or less, or subjected to various lesser punishments for a service offence
* Ten years for indictable convictions under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; or other federal act or regulation and summary convictions of sexual crimes against children
* Ten years for all convictions by a Canadian offender transferred to Canada under the &quot;Transfer of Offenders Act&quot; or &quot;International Transfer of Offenders Act&quot;
* Ten years under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, if fined more than $2,000, detained or imprisoned more than six months, or dismissed from service
* &quot;Not Eligible&quot; for indictable convictions for sexual crimes against children (Schedule 1 Offence under CRA)
* &quot;Not Eligible&quot; for criminals with more than three offences prosecuted by indictment, each with a prison sentence of two or more years.

Applicants for a record suspension must be able to show that they have completed their sentences in full and provide proof of payment.

Individuals can apply for a pardon by filling out the application forms available from the Parole Board and by paying a $50 pardon/record suspension application fee.

====Clemency====
In Canada, clemency is granted by the governor general of Canada or the Governor in Council (the federal cabinet) under the royal prerogative of mercy. Applications are also made to the National Parole Board, as in pardons, but clemency may involve the commutation of a sentence, or the remission of all or part of the sentence, a respite from the sentence (for a medical condition or a relief from a prohibition, e.g., to allow someone to drive who has been prohibited from driving).

===Chile===
In Chile, the institution of pardon () is regulated in the Criminal Code (article 93, Nº 4º), which deals with the extinction of criminal liability. A pardon &quot;only grants the remission or the commutation of the sentence; it does not remove the condition of having been condemned&quot;. The pardon may be either general, when it is granted to all those covered by a specific law passed by qualified quorum in National Congress, or particular, when it is granted by Supreme Decree of the president of the republic. In Chile&#x27;s presidential regime, the president is the head of state; in this capacity, the president has the discretionary power to grant particular pardons and is not obliged to seek opinion or approval from other authorities, although, the granting of pardons is limited by the norms of Law No. 18.050 (1981), and its Regulations (Decree No. 1542 of 1981 on particular pardons), which forbid particular pardons for those convicted of a crime of terrorism.

===China===
The 1954 Constitution of China made provision for amnesties and pardons, both of which were to be powers of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress. The amnesty or pardon would then be issued by the president. Chairman Mao Zedong and President Liu Shaoqi released the first-time pardon in 1959.

The later three constitutions promulgated in 1975, 1978, and 1982 all removed provision amnesty and only kept pardons. In China, pardons are decided by the National Standing Committee of the People&#x27;s Congress and issued by the president.

===Egypt===
On 23 September 2015, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued a pardon freeing 100 activists, including Al Jazeera journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.

===France===
Pardons and acts of clemency () are granted by the president of France, who, ultimately, is the sole judge of the propriety of the measure. It is a prerogative of the president which is directly inherited from that of the kings of France. The convicted person sends a request for pardon to the president of the republic. The prosecutor of the court that pronounced the verdict reports on the case, and the case goes to the Ministry of Justice&#x27;s directorate of criminal affairs and pardons for further consideration.

If granted, the decree of pardon is signed by the president, the prime minister, the minister of justice, and possibly other ministers involved in the consideration of the case. It is not published in the &quot;Journal Officiel&quot;.

The decree may spare the applicant from serving the balance of his or her sentence, or commute the sentence to a lesser one. It does not suppress the right for the victim of the crime to obtain compensation for the damages it suffered, and does not erase the condemnation from the criminal record.

When the death penalty was in force in France, all capital sentences resulted in a presidential review for a possible clemency. Executions were carried out if and only if the president rejected clemency, by signing a document on which it was written: &quot;decides to let justice take its course&quot;.

The Parliament of France, on occasions, grants amnesty. This is a different concept and procedure from that described above, although the phrase &quot;presidential amnesty&quot; () is sometimes pejoratively applied to some acts of parliament traditionally voted upon after a presidential election, granting amnesty for minor crimes.

===Germany===
The right to grant pardon in Germany is divided between the federal and the state level. Federal jurisdiction in matters of criminal law is mostly restricted to appeals against decisions of state courts. Only &quot;political&quot; crimes like treason or terrorism are tried on behalf of the federal government by the highest state courts. Accordingly, the category of persons eligible for a federal pardon is rather narrow. The right to grant a federal pardon lies in the office of the president of Germany, but the president can transfer this power to other persons, such as the chancellor or the minister of justice.

In early 2007, there was a widespread public discussion about the granting of pardons in Germany after convicted Red Army Faction terrorist Christian Klar, who was serving six consecutive sentences of life imprisonment, filed a petition for pardon. President Horst Köhler ultimately denied his request. Following a court decision, Klar was released on parole in December 2008.

For all other (and therefore the vast majority of) convicts, pardons are in the jurisdiction of the states. In some states it is granted by the respective cabinet, but in most states the state constitution vests the authority in the state prime minister. As on the federal level, the authority may be transferred. Amnesty can be granted only by federal law.

===Greece===
The Constitution of Greece grants the power of pardon to the president of the republic (Art. 47, § 1). The president can pardon, commute or remit punishment imposed by any court, on the proposal of the minister of justice and after receiving the opinion (not the consent necessarily) of the Pardon Committee.

===Hong Kong===
Prior to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, the power of pardon was the royal prerogative of mercy of the monarch of the United Kingdom. This was used and cited the most often in cases of convicts who had been given the death penalty: from 1965 to 1993 (when the death penalty was formally abolished) death sentences were automatically commuted to life imprisonment under the royal prerogative.

Since the transfer, the chief executive of Hong Kong now exercises the power to grant pardons and commute penalties under section 12 of article 48 Basic Law of Hong Kong. &quot;The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall exercise the following powers and functions ... to pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties&quot;.

===India===
Under the Constitution of India (Article 72), the president of India can grant a pardon or reduce the sentence of a convicted person, particularly in cases involving capital punishment. A similar and parallel power vests in the governors of each state under Article 161.

The Constitution of India vests sovereign power in the president and governors. The governance in the centre and states is carried out in the name of the president and governor respectively. The president is empowered with the power to pardon under Article 72 of the Indian Constitution, which says that the president shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. The meaning of these terms is as follows:

The pardoning powers of the Indian president are elucidated in Art 72 of the Indian Constitution. There are five different types of pardoning which are mandated by law.
# Pardon: completely absolving the person of the crime and letting him go free. The pardoned criminal will be treated like a normal citizen.
# Commutation: changing the type of punishment given to the guilty into a less harsh one, for example, a death penalty commuted to a life sentence.
# Reprieve: a delay allowed in the execution of a sentence, usually a death sentence, for a guilty person to allow him some time to apply for a presidential pardon or any other legal remedy to prove his innocence or allow for successful rehabilitation.
# Respite: reducing the quantum or degree of the punishment to a criminal in view of some special circumstances, like pregnancy, mental condition to name a few.
# Remission: changing the quantum of the punishment without changing its nature, for example reducing twenty years worth of rigorous imprisonment to ten years.

Article 72 reads:

Similarly, as per article 161, the governor of a state has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends. The president can grant a pardon to a person awarded death sentence; however, the governor of a state does not enjoy this power.

The question is whether this power to grant a pardon is absolute or this power of pardon shall be exercised by the president on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The pardoning power of the president is not absolute. It is governed by the advice of the Council of Ministers. This has not been discussed by the constitution but is the practical truth. Further, the constitution does not provide for any mechanism to question the legality of decisions of the president or governors exercising mercy jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the SC in the Epuru Sudhakar case has given a small window for judicial review of the pardon powers of the president and governors for the purpose of ruling out any arbitrariness. The court has earlier held that court has retained the power of judicial review even on a matter which has been vested by the Constitution solely in the executive.

However, it is important to note that India has a unitary legal system and there is no separate body of state law. All crimes are crimes against the Union of India. Therefore, a convention has developed that the governor&#x27;s powers are exercised for only minor offenses, while requests for pardons and reprieves for major offenses and offenses committed in the union territories are deferred to the president.

Both the president and governor are bound by the advice of their respective Councils of Ministers and hence the exercise of this power is of an executive character. It is therefore subject to judicial review as held by the Supreme Court of India in the case of . It was subsequently confirmed by . In the case of , it was held that &quot;clemency is subject to judicial review and that it cannot be dispensed as a privilege or act of grace&quot;. The court made these observation while quashing the decision of then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Sushil Kumar Shinde in commuting the sentence of a convicted Congress activist.

===Iran===
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader has the power to pardon and offer clemency under Article 110, § 1, §§ 11.

===Ireland===

==== Constitutional basis ====
The Irish constitution states (in Article 13.6) that
The power of clemency is nominally exercised by the president. However, the president of Ireland must act &quot;on the advice&quot; of the Government (cabinet), so in practice the clemency decisions are made by the government of the day and the president has no discretion in the matter. The responsibility can also be delegated to people or bodies other than the president.

Amnesty and immunity, on the other hand, are usually dealt with by an Act of the Oireachtas rather than by a general form of pardon or a slate of individual pardons.

There are two methods by which a pardon may proceed:

====Method I====
In the first procedure, aimed at miscarriages of justice, the minister for justice may recommend to the Government that they formally advise the president to grant a pardon, and any conditions along with it. The 1993 Criminal Procedure Act provides the method by which a person convicted of an offence may apply for a pardon. Under this procedure, the person must:
* Have already been convicted.
* Have used up their appeals.
* Allege a new fact (previously known and believed to be significant, but which he has a reasonable excuse for not having mentioned) or newly discovered fact (including a fact previously known which was not believed to be significant) showing a miscarriage of justice has taken place.

Then they can apply in writing to the minister for justice for a pardon. The minister may then &quot;make or cause to be made such inquiries as they consider necessary&quot; and may refuse to grant the pardon on his/her own initiative, or if they think the person should be pardoned, bring such argument to cabinet.

====Method II====
Section six of the act allows a minister for justice to seek or receive a pardon request from someone whose case is not a &#x27;miscarriage of justice&#x27;, but has some other fault, such as an archaic law, a law being misapplied by a rogue judge, a reduction in the harshness of a sentence or a substitution of a sentence, without having to go through the procedure above, gone through appeals, or presented new facts. It also allows the minister to waive the procedure in a case of miscarriage of justice if the specific case warrants it. It may also allow prospective pardons as it allows the minister to pardon someone who has not been convicted yet, which the other procedure requires.

====Committee of Inquiry====
The government itself may assemble a committee to study the case in more detail on their behalf. This may consist of anyone, and any number, but the chair must be:
* A judge or former judge or
* A barrister of at least 10 years standing or
* A solicitor of at least 10 years standing.
This special committee may look to any material it sees fit to make its decision, even if it was not, or would not be, available to a jury or trial judge in a normal court. The government do not have to be bound by the committee recommendations.

====Pardons under military law====
Under Section 7(5) of the act, the same powers of the minister for justice apply to the minister for defence in the case of military officers and enlisted convicted by courts martial.

====Compensation====
The minister for justice or defence may also, in their absolute discretion, pay compensation, determined by them alone, to any person given a pardon, if this compensation is applied for. If they think the compensation is too low they may challenge for a higher figure in the High Court.

====List of people who have received a presidential pardon since 1938====
The power is used very infrequently compared to, for example, pardons in the United States.
* 1940 – Thomas Quinn, granted by Douglas Hyde
* 1943 – Walter Brady, granted by Douglas Hyde
* 1992 – Nicky Kelly, granted by Mary Robinson
* 1999 – William Geary, granted by Mary McAleese
* 2018 – Maolra Seoighe, granted by Michael D. Higgins
* 2021 – John Twiss, granted by Michael D. Higgins

===Israel===
In Israel the president has the power to pardon criminals or commute their sentences. The president&#x27;s pardon powers are set out in the Basic Laws of Israel. The pardon is given following a recommendation by the minister of justice.

After the Kav 300 affair, President Chaim Herzog issued a pardon to four members of the Shin Bet prior to them being indicted. This unusual act was the first of its kind in Israel.

===Italy===
In Italy, the president of the republic may &quot;grant pardons, or commute punishments&quot; according to article 87 of the Italian Constitution. Like other acts of the president, the pardon requires the countersignature of the competent government minister. The Constitutional Court of Italy has ruled that the minister of justice is obliged to sign acts of pardon.

The pardon may remove the punishment altogether or change its form. Unless the decree of pardon states otherwise, the pardon does not remove any incidental effects of a criminal conviction, such as a mention in a certificate of conduct (174 c.p.) or the loss of civil rights.

According to article 79 of the Italian Constitution the Parliament may grant amnesty (article 151 c.p.) and pardon (article 174 c.p.) by law deliberated a majority of two-thirds of the components. The last general pardon, discounting three years from sentences, was approved in 2006.

===Morocco===
In Morocco, the king has the right to grant pardons pursuant to Article 58 of the Constitution of Morocco and Dahir (royal decree) No. 1-57-387 of 6 February 1958. Requests for pardon are required to go through an examination process by a commission comprising the minister of justice and representatives of the supreme court prior to approval by the king.

The right to pardon was traditionally recognized as a common practice among the sultans of the Alawi dynasty, and were only codified into the constitution by Hassan II (). This prerogative is currently used several times per year by the monarch during public holidays.

On one occasion, a pardon which was granted by Mohammed VI to Daniel Galván, a Spanish convicted child rapist, was revoked following public outrage.

===Poland===
In Poland, the president is granted the right of pardon by Article 139 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. Whether the president may grant relief prior to (final) conviction remains controversial, as the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal have opposing views.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, the heads of state – kings or presidents – have always enjoyed the prerogative of grace, being able to grant pardons, commuting or extinguishing sentences in the context of requests for clemency.

According to the Portuguese Constitution, the president of the Portuguese Republic has the power to pardon and commute sentences, on the proposal of the Government of the Portuguese Republic. This is the exclusive and discretionary competence of the president and is not subject to any conditions beyond the prior hearing of the Government, generally represented by the minister of justice. Requests or proposals for pardons are instructed by the Criminal Execution Court by referral from the Ministry of Justice and subsequently submitted to the president for consideration. The pardon is granted by presidential decree; if the pardon is denied, the president decides by order. Traditionally pardons are granted during the Christmas period. The pardon can be revoked by the president of the republic.

In 2019, president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa granted two pardons.

The pardon, as an individual, shall not be confused with amnesty or generic forgiveness, both of a general and abstract nature. Amnesty has retroactive effects, affecting not only the penalty applied but the past criminal act itself, which is forgotten, considered as not practiced (retroactive abolition of crime). Generic forgiveness focuses only on the penalties determined by the sentencing decision and for the future. It is the reserved competence of the Portuguese Parliament to approve generic amnesties and pardons.

===Russia===
The president of the Russian Federation is granted the right of pardon by Article 89 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The chain of pardon committees manage lists of people eligible for pardon and directs them to the president for signing. While President Boris Yeltsin frequently used his power of pardon (1998 – 7,000 to 8,000 cases), his successor Vladimir Putin is much more hesitant; he granted five pardons in 2014 and two in 2015. In 2021, Vladimir Putin officially pardoned six convicted offenders.

A pardon can be requested at any time, although a one-year waiting period is required between requests. This right is granted to citizens of the Russian Federation by Article 50 of the constitution.

The Regulation on the Procedure for Considering Requests for Pardon in the Russian Federation, which was approved by Executive Order No.787, states that a pardon may be granted to the following individuals:

# Individuals convicted by Russian courts and serving their sentences on Russian territory.
# Individuals convicted by foreign courts and serving their sentences in Russian territory (in accordance with international treaties).
# Individuals released on parole.
# Probationers and individuals serving suspended sentences by Russian courts.
# Individuals who have served their sentences but maintain official convictions on record.

As of 2023, Russia had pardoned over 5,000 convicts after they completed contracts with Wagner Group, a mercenary group, to fight in Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the group&#x27;s founder, offered thousands of inmates clemency in exchange for fighting in the most dangerous theaters of the war. The program is no longer in effect as of 2024.

===Rwanda===
The prerogative of mercy is a form of pardon that can be exercised by the president of Rwanda. The prerogative is one of the powers of the president defined by the Constitution of Rwanda, which came into effect in 2003 following a national referendum. According to the Constitution of Rwanda, &quot;The President of the Republic has authority to exercise the prerogative of mercy in accordance with the procedure determined by law and after consulting the Supreme Court on the matter.&quot;

===South Africa===
Under section 84(2)(j) of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996), the president of South Africa is responsible for pardoning or reprieving offenders. This power of the president is only exercised in highly exceptional cases.

To pardon a person is to forgive a person for his/her deeds. The pardon process is therefore not available to persons who maintain their innocence and is not an advanced form of appeal procedure.

Pardon is only granted for minor offences after a period of ten years has elapsed since the relevant conviction.

For many serious offences (for example if the relevant court viewed the offence in such a serious light that direct imprisonment was imposed) pardon will not be granted even if more than ten years have elapsed since the conviction.

===Spain===
The (&quot;right of grace&quot;) or (&quot;pardon&quot;) is acknowledged by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 as a privilege of the king of Spain (article 62.i: &quot;Functions of the King&quot;). Spanish law defines it as a renunciation on the state&#x27;s part of its own punitive power on behalf of an individual, founded on reasons of equity or public interest. The Constitution subjects royal pardons to the law and forbids general pardons, so they have to be granted individually. Theoretically, a royal pardon can be granted for a general offense or accessory offenses alone; if it is granted for a general offense, the accessory ones it implies are also pardoned, with the exception of punishments involving political rights (i.e., removal of the right to run for a public office as a result of a sentence), which have to be explicitly mentioned in the pardon decree if they are going to be pardoned.

The procedure and requirements for the grant of the pardon are given by the Law of 18 June 1870, modified by Law 1/1988 of 14 January. The application for royal pardon has to be carried out by the convicted person himself, his relatives or any other person in his name. The convicting court will then issue a report of the case, which shall be considered along with the public comments of the prosecutor and the victims of the crime if there were any. All of this is gathered by the minister of justice, who will present the pardon issue to the Cabinet of Ministers. If the Cabinet decides a pardon should be granted, then the minister of justice will recommend as such to the king. Pardons are issued by royal decree and have to be published in the Boletín Oficial del Estado (&quot;Public Journal&quot;).

Pardons are not commonly conceded in Spain but for offenders convicted for minor crimes who are about to complete their sentence and have shown good behaviour and repentance. Dating back to medieval times, several organisations and religious brotherhoods still hold the right of granting pardons as part of some privilege or other granted to them by the king of Spain. The scope of this privilege depends on the royal charter received by the organisation when their right to concede pardons was granted, though it usually holds only for minor offenses in very especial conditions; this right is implicitly acknowledged by the public offices nowadays, though it is not exercised but following the usual procedure for royal pardons. Traditionally, they will propose some petty criminal about to end his sentence for pardon being granted to him, and he/she will be released following the tradition to which the pardon holds, usually during the Holy Week. This type of pardons are distinguished from the usual ones in that they only release the prisoner from jail, halting the sentence, but do not pardon the offense itself.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, under the Sri Lankan Constitution the president can grant a pardon, respite or substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment imposed to any offender convicted of any offence in any court within the Republic of Sri Lanka. It is generally referred to as a &quot;presidential pardon&quot;.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, pardons may be granted by the Swiss Federal Assembly for crimes prosecuted by the federal authorities. For crimes under cantonal jurisdiction, cantonal law designates the authority competent to grant pardons (if any). In most cantons, the cantonal parliament may pardon felonies, and the cantonal government may pardon misdemeanors and minor infractions.

===Turkey===
The president of Turkey is granted the right of pardon under certain circumstances defined in the constitution, article 104. According to the article, the president can &quot;remit, on grounds of chronic illness, disability, or old age, all or part of the sentences imposed on certain individuals&quot;. After the convict&#x27;s or his or her proxy&#x27;s application, if the Council of Forensic Medicine determines that the convict suffers from chronic illness, disability, or old age, the Ministry of Justice presents the situation to the president, and the president can choose to grant a pardon.

Additionally, the parliament of Turkey has the power to announce general amnesty.

===United Kingdom===

The power to grant pardons and reprieves in the United Kingdom is known as the royal prerogative of mercy. It was traditionally in the absolute power of the monarch to pardon an individual for a crime, whether or not he or she had been convicted, and thereby commute any penalty; the power was then delegated both to the judiciary and the sovereign&#x27;s ministers. Since the creation of legal rights of appeal, the royal prerogative of mercy is no longer exercised by the person of the sovereign, or by the judiciary, but only by the government.

In constitutional terms, under the doctrine of the rule of law, the power of ministers to overrule the judiciary by commuting criminal sanctions imposed resolves different and sometimes conflicting public interests. In civil matters, only the legislative branch, and not ministers, have the power to override the judiciary.

The Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660 was a general pardon for everyone who had committed crimes during the English Civil War and Interregnum with some exceptions for regicides and serious crimes.

Until the nineteenth century, for many crimes the sentence was mandatory and was formally pronounced in court immediately upon conviction, but judges and ministers were given powers to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy out of court, in order to mitigate the rigour of the law. Before there was any general form of criminal appeal, a judge might grant a pardon either by way of clemency, because he felt in his opinion that the law was unduly harsh (for example, in the case of convictions of minors), that the verdict was dubious, to seek public approval, or it was otherwise in the public interest. Capital sentences imposed by the assizes were generally executed when the assize was concluded and as the circuit judge left the town, so there was a limited window of time to apply to a judge or directly to the Crown for a pardon. Especially for assizes that were far away from the then capital and major cities of London, York, Durham, Edinburgh, or Dublin, a pardon might well arrive too late. Perhaps as a form of temporary punishment, to give solace, to avoid public disorder, to consult or obtain further evidence, or to maximise the public approval of the King&#x27;s mercy, judges often did not grant their pardons until their departures; the convict often hoped until his last moments that the sentence of death would not actually be executed, and it was generally popular for a reprieve to arrive at the scaffold at the very moment of the execution.

Conditional pardons were granted to many in the 18th century, in return for transportation to British colonies overseas for life in lieu, especially to the Australian colonies.

The first known &quot;general pardon&quot; in post-Conquest England was issued during the celebrations at the coronation of King Edward III in 1327. In 2006, all British Armed Forces soldiers who were executed for cowardice during the First World War were given a statutory pardon by an Act of Parliament (the Armed Forces Act 2006), following a long-running controversy about the justice of their executions.

Today the sovereign only grants pardons upon the advice of their ministers: currently they are the Lord Chancellor, for England and Wales; the First Minister of Scotland; or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State for Defence is responsible for military cases. It is the standard policy of the government to only grant pardons to those who are considered &quot;morally&quot; innocent of the offence, as opposed to those who may have been wrongly convicted by a misapplication of the law. Pardons are generally no longer issued prior to a conviction, but only after the conviction. The royal prerogative of mercy is now rarely used, given that the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission are now avenues to statutory remedies against miscarriages of justice.

Therefore, the grant of pardons is now very rare occurrence indeed, and the vast majority of acknowledged miscarriages of justice were decided upon by the courts. During the Birmingham Six case, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd stressed that he could only make the decision for a pardon if he was &quot;convinced of [their] innocence&quot;, which at the time he was not.

One recent case was that of two drug smugglers, John Haase and Paul Bennett. They were pardoned in July 1996 from their sentences of imprisonment both of 18 years, having served some ten months, on the advice of Home Secretary Michael Howard. This was intended as a reward for their information given to the authorities, but there were speculations as to the motives of the Home Secretary. In 2008 they were sentenced to imprisonment for 20 and 22 years, respectively, after subsequent discovery that the information they gave was unreliable.

In 1980, after the courts had dismissed their appeals, the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, used the royal prerogative of mercy to free David Cooper and Michael McMahon from their imprisonment, both having been convicted of murder on poor evidence.

Under the Act of Settlement 1701, a pardon cannot prevent a person from being impeached by Parliament, but a pardon may commute any penalties imposed for the conviction. In England and Wales no person may be pardoned for an offence under Section 11 of the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 (unlawfully transporting prisoners out of England and Wales).

===United States===

==== Federal government ====

In the United States, the pardon power for offenses against the United States is granted to the president of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the president &quot;shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant many different forms of clemency (generally less sweeping than a full pardon), including not only pardons, but also conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines, forfeitures and other criminal financial penalties, respites and reprieves, and amnesties.

The pardon power of the president applies only to convictions under federal law. Additionally, the power extends to military court-martial cases as well as convictions in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

Almost all pardon petitions are addressed to the president, who grants or denies the request. In some cases, the president will, of their own accord, issue a pardon. Typically, applications for pardons are referred for review and non-binding recommendation by the Office of the Pardon Attorney, an official of the United States Department of Justice. 

In the current administration, a preference has been established for pardoning or offering clemency for white-collar crime. Sam Mangel, a prison consultant who worked with Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, has said he was informed he should not inquire about a pardon for any individuals found guilty of sex crimes, crimes of violence, or immigration cases.

====State law====
The governors of most U.S. states have the power to grant pardons, reprieves and other forms of clemency for offenses under state criminal law. In other states, that power is committed to an appointed agency or board, or to a board and the governor in some hybrid arrangement (in some states the agency is merged with that of the parole board, as in the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board).

Nine states in the United States have boards of pardons and paroles that exclusively grant all state pardons. These states are: Alabama (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Connecticut (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Georgia (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Idaho (Commission of Pardons and Paroles), Minnesota (Board of Pardons), Nebraska (Board of Pardons), Nevada (Board of Pardon Commissioners), South Carolina (Board of Probation, Parole and Pardon), and Utah (Utah Board of Pardons and Parole).

On at least four occasions, state governorsToney Anaya of New Mexico in 1986, George Ryan of Illinois in 2003, Martin O&#x27;Malley of Maryland in 2014, and Kate Brown of Oregon in 2022have commuted all death sentences in their respective states prior to leaving office.

==Related concepts==

These terms differ subtly from country to country, but generally:
* Clemency is a general concept of amelioration of penalties, especially by action of executive officials; the forms it may take include the following:
** Amnesty: A pardon applied to a group of people rather than an individual. President Jimmy Carter offered amnesty to anyone who had evaded the draft. Weapon amnesties are often granted so that people can hand in weapons to the police without any legal questions being asked as to where they obtained them, why they had them, etc. After a civil war a mass amnesty may be granted to absolve all participants of guilt and &quot;move on&quot;. Amnesties are typically applied in advance of any prosecution for the crime.
** Commutation: Substituting the imposed penalty for a crime with a lesser penalty, whilst still remaining guilty of the original crime (e.g., someone who is guilty of murder may have their sentence commuted to life imprisonment rather than death, or the term of imprisonment may be reduced).
** Remission: Complete or partial cancellation of the penalty, whilst still being considered guilty of said crime (i.e., reduced penalty). (This should not be confused with what is known in the United States as remission of remand, in which a case is sent back to a lower court from which it was appealed, with instructions as to what further proceedings should be held.)
** Reprieve: Temporary postponement of a punishment, usually so that the accused can mount an appeal (especially if he or she has been sentenced to death).
** Respite: The delay of an ordered sentence, or the act of temporarily imposing a lesser sentence upon the convicted, whilst further investigation, action, or appeals can be conducted.
* Parole is the provisional early release of a prisoner who agrees to abide by imposed behavioral conditions, generally including periodic check-ins with parole officers. Failure to comply with the terms of early release may result in reincarcertion.
* Expungement: The process by which the record of a criminal conviction is destroyed or sealed from the official repository, thus removing any traces of guilt or conviction.
* Immunity from prosecution: A prosecutor may grant immunity, usually to a witness, in exchange for testimony or production of other evidence. The prosecutor (conditionally) agrees not to prosecute a crime that the witness might have committed in exchange for said evidence. For example, a car thief who witnesses a murder might be granted immunity for his crime as an inducement to identify, and perhaps to truthfully testify against the murderer. Some criminals who testify for the prosecution may be offered immunity from prosecution for their own crimes.

<text>The 4000 series is a CMOS logic family of integrated circuits (ICs) first introduced in 1968 by RCA. It was slowly migrated into the 4000B buffered series after about 1975. It had a much wider supply voltage range than any contemporary logic family (3V to 18V recommended range for &quot;B&quot; series). Almost all IC manufacturers active during this initial era fabricated models for this series. Its naming convention is still in use today.

==History==
The 4000 series was introduced as the &quot;CD4000 COS/MOS&quot; series in 1968 by RCA as a lower power and more versatile alternative to the 7400 series of transistor-transistor logic (TTL) chips. The logic functions were implemented with the newly introduced Complementary Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. While initially marketed with &quot;COS/MOS&quot; labeling by RCA (which stood for Complementary Symmetry Metal-Oxide Semiconductor), the shorter &quot;CMOS&quot; terminology emerged as the industry preference to refer to the technology. The first chips in the series were designed by a group led by Albert Medwin.

Wide adoption was initially hindered by the comparatively lower speeds of the designs compared to TTL based designs. Speed limitations were eventually overcome with newer fabrication methods (such as self aligned gates of polysilicon instead of metal). These CMOS variants performed on par with contemporary TTL. The series was extended in the late 1970s and 1980s with new models that were given 45xx and 45xxx designations, but are usually still regarded by engineers as part of the 4000 series. In the 1990s, some manufacturers (e.g. Texas Instruments) ported the 4000 series to newer HCMOS based designs to provide greater speeds.

==Design considerations==
The 4000 series facilitates simpler circuit design through relatively low power consumption, a wide range of supply voltages, and vastly increased load-driving capability (fanout) compared to TTL. This makes the series ideal for use in prototyping LSI designs. While TTL ICs are similarly modular, these usually lack the symmetrical drive strength of CMOS and may therefore require more consideration of the loads applied on its outputs.
Just like with TTL, buffered models can drive higher electrical current (mainly available for I/O-devices like octal latches and three-state drivers) but have a slightly higher risk of introducing ringing (transient oscillations) unless correctly damped or terminated. Many models contain a high level of integration, including fully integrated 7-segment display counters, walking ring counters, and full adders.

<text>Sandra Rose Te Hakamatua Lee-Vercoe (born 8 August 1952) is a former New Zealand politician and diplomat. She served as deputy leader (and briefly leader) of the Alliance party and was later High Commissioner to Niue.

== Early life ==
Lee was born in Wellington to an English Romani father and a Māori mother, and grew up in a two bedroom Māori Affairs house with her parents, grandfather and great grandfather. She was educated at Onslow College. Lee later moved to Auckland, settling on Waiheke Island. Her involvement in politics began with the foundation of Mana Motuhake, a Māori issues party, in 1979. Her political career, however, did not begin until 1983, with her election to the Waiheke County Council. She became chairperson of the Council in 1989. When Waiheke was amalgamated into Auckland proper, Lee became a member of the Auckland City Council.

Lee connects to Poutini Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Toa.

== Member of Parliament ==

In 1991, Lee became president of Mana Motuhake. Shortly after this, Mana Motuhake agreed to become a founding member of the Alliance, a coalition of minor parties. At the 1992 Alliance party conference Lee was elected the co-leader of the party alongside Jeanette Fitzsimons.

In the 1993 election, Lee became the first Māori woman to win a general seat (James Carroll being the first man in 1893) when she successfully contested the electorate as an Alliance candidate, defeating the incumbent Richard Prebble. Upon the retirement of Mana Motuhake founder Matiu Rata in 1994, Lee became Mana Motuhake&#x27;s political leader. In November 1994, when Jim Anderton stepped down as leader of the Alliance for personal reasons, Lee took his place but Lee persuaded Anderton to return to the leadership in May 1995. Lee lost her Auckland Central seat to Labour&#x27;s Judith Tizard at the 1996 election. 

=== Cabinet member ===
When a Labour-Alliance coalition government was formed after the 1999 election, Lee became Minister of Local Government, Minister of Conservation, and Associate Minister of Māori Affairs. She was ranked seventh in Cabinet. During her time as Minister of Conservation Lee was known as an outspoken opponent of commercial whaling. 

As Minister of Local Government, Lee oversaw significant reform including the development and passage of the Local Electoral Act 2001, and the development and introduction of the Local Government Act 2002 and Local Government (Rating) Act 2002.

She lost the position as Mana Motuhake leader in 2001, after a leadership challenge by Willie Jackson. Lee believed that personal matters pertaining to her, such as her relationship with Te Puni Kōkiri staffer Anaru Vercoe, were used to discredit her as leader of Mana Motuhake. Commentators also noted there was an element of revenge by Jackson, as he had been demoted in the 1996 party list in order to make room for Alamein Kopu, who had been elevated in the party list upon Lee&#x27;s persuasion.

=== Retirement ===
By the end of her term in parliament, the Alliance began to divide between Jim Anderton&#x27;s moderate faction (including Lee) that held most of the parliamentary power, and the strongly left-wing faction, represented by most rank-and-file members and party president Matt McCarten and four of the Alliance MPs (including Laila Harré). The latter accused Anderton (and by extension, Lee) of moving the Alliance too close to Labour and not being distinct enough. The Alliance had fallen below the 5% threshold in polls. By March 2002, tensions had gotten so bad that McCarten and Lee had a &#x27;swearing match&#x27; at a meeting in the Alliance&#x27;s Wellington premises.

On 3 April 2002, both Anderton and Lee announced their refusal to stand under the Alliance banner at the 2002 election. Anderton went on to form the Progressive Coalition while Harré led the Alliance into the election (which saw them knocked out of parliament), but Lee did not stand and retired from politics that year.

Lee-Vercoe has continued to be politically active by being a guest commentator on issues affecting Māori and New Zealand on &quot;Te Karere&quot;, &quot;Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Native Affairs&quot; and &quot;Radio Waatea&quot;. Her career as a parliamentarian was honoured and highlighted in the &quot;Matangireia&quot; documentary series, released in 2019, that documented former Māori politicians and their legacy.

== Diplomat ==
Lee was High Commissioner to Niue, representing the New Zealand government, from 12 February 2003 to 3 October 2005.

== Board member ==
In September 2006 Lee was appointed to the board of Housing New Zealand. In July 2007 she was appointed to the board of Te Papa Tongarewa.

== Political offices ==

* 1983–1989: Member, Waiheke County Council
* 1989: Chair, Waiheke County Council
* 1989–1994 (January): Councillor, Auckland City Council
* 1993–1996: Member of Parliament (Alliance), Auckland Central
* 1996–2002: Member of Parliament (List) (Alliance)
* 1999 (December) – 2002: Minister of the Crown (Local Government, Conservation, Associate Māori Affairs), Labour-Alliance government

== Personal life ==
At age 16, Lee married Mike Lee, giving birth to their elder daughter at age 17. They separated in 1992. She has been married to Anaru Vercoe since 2002.

New Zealand journalist and television producer, Annabelle Lee-Mather, is Lee&#x27;s daughter.

<doc id="288607" wikidata="Q358167" url="?curid=288607" title="Louison Bobet">
<text>Louis &quot;Louison&quot; Bobet (; 12 March 1925 – 13 March 1983) was a French professional road racing cyclist. He was the first great French rider of the post-war period and the first rider to win the Tour de France in three successive years, from 1953 to 1955.

==Origins==
Louis Bobet was born one of three children above his father&#x27;s baker&#x27;s shop in the rue de Montfort, Saint-Méen-le-Grand, near Rennes. His father gave him a bicycle when he was two and after six months he could ride it 6 km. Bobet&#x27;s father was also called Louis and the son was called Louison – little Louis – to avoid confusion The ending &quot;-on&quot; is a diminutive in French but outside Brittany Louison refers more usually to a girl. He was known as Louis in his early years as a rider, even as a professional, until the diminutive Louison gained in popularity.

His sister played table tennis, his brother Jean football, although he also became a professional cyclist. Louison played both table tennis and football and became Brittany champion at table tennis. It was his uncle, Raymond, who was president of a cycling club in Paris who persuaded him to concentrate on cycling.

Bobet&#x27;s first race was a 30 km event when he was 13. He came second in a sprint finish. He raced in his local area and won four events for unlicensed riders in 1941. He qualified for the final of the unofficial youth championship, the Premier Pas Dunlop in 1943 at Montluçon and came sixth. The winner was Raphaël Géminiani, who would become a professional team-mate and rival.

Bobet is said to have carried messages for the Resistance during the Second World War. After D-Day he joined the army and served in eastern France. He was demobilised in December 1945.

==Racing career==
Bobet applied for racing licence on leaving the army and by error was sent one for an independent, or semi-professional. He benefited from the right to compete against professionals as well as amateurs. He came second in the Brittany championship and rode the national championship in Paris. There he came up against a veteran professional, Marcel Bidot, who on retirement became Bobet&#x27;s manager in the national team. Bobet left the field to catch two riders who had broken clear. He dropped one and outsprinted the other to become national champion. He turned fully professional for Stella, a bicycle factory in Nantes.

===Tour de France 1947===
Stella was a small team that rode mainly in Brittany. In May 1947, however, two from the team rode the Boucles de la Seine race in Paris. He won alone by six minutes. It brought him an invitation to ride the Tour de France, at that time disputed by national and regional teams. The unexpected toughness of the race forced him to go home on the ninth day, in the Alps and to cry when the going got hard. It brought him the nickname &quot;cry-baby&quot; in the bunch and René Vietto referred to him as &quot;La Bobette&quot;, a mock feminisation of his name, for his tears and complaining. The historian Dick Yates wrote:

:He brought down the scorn of the press and everyone quickly wrote off this &#x27;cry-baby&#x27;. René Vietto was in the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification and he looked like he was going to win – he was a real man. As France forgot about him, Bobet went home to lick his wounds and listen to words of advice from his father.

===Tour de France 1948===
The former rider, Maurice Archambaud, took over management of the team from Léo Véron and took a chance on Bobet. Much had changed since the previous summer and he took the lead after the third stage, which finished near Stella&#x27;s factory in Nantes. Bobet lost the yellow jersey the following day but regained it by winning the sixth stage, to Biarritz. He had 20 minutes&#x27; lead over the veteran Italian, Gino Bartali as the race entered the Alps. And then happened one of the most outstanding periods in the history of the Tour.

(&quot;See Gino Bartali for full story.&quot;)

A political crisis in Italy threatened to overthrow the government and bring the country to anarchy. The prime minister asked Bartali to distract Italians by dominating the Tour. Bartali won three stages in a row and the Tour by 14 minutes. Bobet&#x27;s 20 minutes on Bartali was cut to a 32-minute deficit by the time the race finished in Paris. Bobet had twice worn the yellow jersey and won two stages, however, and with the money he won he moved to Paris and bought a drapery shop for his wife.

===Tour de France 1950===
Bobet did not finish in 1949, struggling from the start. He dropped out on the first day in the mountains, along with four other members of the national team. In 1950 he won the national championship at Montlhéry south of Paris the week before the Tour and rode in the national team with Géminiani, the rider who had beaten him as a boy in the Premier Pas Dunlop. He and Bobet developed a rocky friendship, Géminiani&#x27;s rough, instinctive character a contrast to the more thoughtful, quieter Bobet. The two argued frequently but remained friends. Géminiani, following the French habit of creating nicknames by doubling a syllable of a name referred to Bobet as &quot;Zonzon&quot;, a name that Bobet hated but tolerated. Géminiani had the confidence that Bobet lacked.

Bobet and Géminiani were second and third early in the race. Both hoped to profit from the absence of Fausto Coppi, who was injured, but found themselves instead up against an unbeatable Ferdinand Kübler. Bobet finished third, winning the mountain competition.

===Tour de France 1953===
Bobet rode the 1951 Tour in the blue-white-red of national champion again but cracked in the mountains. Jean Bidot, the manager, sent riders to help him but in the end abandoned him to concentrate on Géminiani, the best placed. Bobet came 20th, although with a stage win. He lost 40 minutes on the last day in the mountains even though the race was taking it easy, Hugo Koblet already being unbeatable. Dick Yates said:

It was a terrible performance for a man of his class, but although he had suffered and suffered he had not given up the struggle. While this showed character, nobody was prepared to make allowances for it. &#x27;He is just not a stage rider,&#x27; they said. &#x27;He&#x27;ll never win the Tour. No matter how brilliant you may be, if you&#x27;re not consistent you haven&#x27;t got a chance.&#x27; The sensitive Bobet was stung by this criticism. He had given his all for the Tour but everyone had turned against him. Even Jean Robic, who was not really in Bobet&#x27;s class, was now more popular and it really hurt.

And then in 1953, after a year without the Tour, Bobet left the field behind on a stage that crossed the Vars. He climbed the Col d&#x27;Izoard alone on roads still rutted and strewn with stones and when the gearing on his bicycle forced him to fight to keep it moving. The historian Bill McGann wrote:
Stage 18 is etched in the history of the Tour. It was 165km from Gap to Briançon... Bobet knew this was the time to strike. One of Bobet&#x27;s team-mates, Adolphe Deledda, went clear on the Vars with two other riders. Bobet stayed with the other leading climbers as they ascended the Vars. Spanish rider Jesús Loroño attacked. The alert and very capable Bobet jumped on his wheel and the pair disappeared up the mountain. Bobet was a good descender and dropped Lorono on the way down the Vars. Meanwhile, Deledda, upon being told that Bobet was on his way, eased up and waited for his captain. The two hooked up and took off across the 20km valley floor leading to the Izoard. In doing so they caught and then dispatched Deledda&#x27;s two original breakaway companions. Bobet and Deledda, knowing the importance of the moment, were men on a mission. Deledda, fulfilling the team contract in both letter and especially in spirit, buried himself towing Bobet to the great mountain. Bobet flew up the Izoard as if he had wings. Bobet had finally arrived as the premier stage racer in the world. As he crested the Izoard there was a very well known cycling fan by the side of the road. Fausto Coppi with his mistress, Giulia Locatelli (the &quot;woman in white&quot;), was watching the race. As he rode past the great man, Bobet shouted thanks to Coppi for coming.

He won that day by more than five minutes in Briançon, took the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification, then won the time trial and finished the Tour with 14 minutes&#x27; lead. He was greeted in Paris by Maurice Garin, winner of the first Tour in 1903, celebrating the Tour&#x27;s 50th anniversary. He had, however, won a Tour without stars. Kübler was not riding and nor was Coppi, who was standing on the Izoard to watch Bobet pass. Koblet was riding badly and dropped out after a crash. Bartali was too old. Yates&#x27; assessment is that &quot;Bobet had won the Tour and won it well but the opposition was hardly top drawer.

===Tour de France 1954===

The 1954 race was different, without Italians but with a strong team from Belgium. The race started fast and didn&#x27;t ease up. Bobet took the lead after four days, then lost it on day eight. The jersey changed hands until Bobet again dominated on the Izoard. Winning the time-trial cemented his lead and he got to Paris 15 minutes before Kübler A few weeks later he became world champion in Germany. He left Stella after eight years to ride for Mercier, the team riding bicycles carrying Bobet&#x27;s name and sold by him but made in the Mercier factory in St-Étienne.

===Tour de France 1955===
Bobet completed his hat-trick of successive wins in 1955, having that year won the Tour of Flanders and Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. The strongest French rider at first was Antonin Rolland and the manager, Marcel Bidot, asked the team to ride for him. Rolland, however, grew weaker as the race approached the Pyrenees. Bobet won the Tour but with a saddle boil that needed surgery. &quot;His flesh was full of holes&quot;, said a report. &quot;Dead tissue had to be removed to within several millimetres of vital organs. Nobody dared speak the word &#x27;cancer&#x27;&quot; Bobet believed that enduring the sores during the Tour made him a lesser rider for the rest of his life.

He learned to fly a plane while forced not to ride.

===Tour de France 1958===
The 1958 was the last that Bobet finished. One account said:

He has 400,000 kilometres in his legs. He has conquered glory and fortune but he is badly ill. Despite the formal advice of his doctor, he has decided to ride the 1958 Tour de France. He will suffer. He knows that. In the heart of the gigantic rocks of the Cassé Déserte, Bob is arced on his bicycle, his kidneys crushed by the effort and his head, like a heavy, painful balance, oscillates above his handlebars. The sun beats down on him. Around him, the whole mountain smokes like a giant witch&#x27;s cauldron. As he breathes, what burns his throat and his lungs is the dust that rises around him... Abandoned, alone, without help, streaming with sweat, he has no other weapon against his adversaries but the mountain, the bad weather and his crazy willpower.

He came seventh.

==Personality==
The most striking feature of Bobet the man rather than rider was his ambition to behave like a Hollywood matinée idol, a sort of David Niven character in a dinner suit tuxedo. It brought him much ribbing from other French riders. Géminiani says Bobet&#x27;s diffident and elegant manner made him less popular even in his own Brittany than the more rustic, forthright manners of other Breton people such as Jean Robic. The British professional Brian Robinson called Bobet &quot;a private man and a little moody&quot; and said he would sulk if things went wrong. The French journalist René de Latour said of Bobet in Sporting Cyclist that &quot;he didn&#x27;t look good on a bike&quot; and that he had &quot;the legs of a football [soccer] player&quot;.

Bobet spoke out against French involvement in a war against communists in Indo-China. He said he wasn&#x27;t a Marxist but a pacifist. Géminiani said Bobet lacked humility. &quot;He really thought that, after him, there&#x27;d be no more cycling in France&quot;, he said. Bobet occasionally talked of himself in the third person.

Bobet was driven by personal hygiene and refused to accept his first yellow jersey because it had not been made with the pure wool he believed the only healthy material for a sweating and dusty rider. Synthetic thread or blends were added in 1947 following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn. The race organiser, Jacques Goddet wrote:
It produced a real drama. Our contract with Sofil was crumbling away. If the news had got out, the commercial effect would have been disastrous for the manufacturer. I remember debating it with him a good part of the night. Louison was always exquisitely courteous but his principles were as hard as the granite blocks of his native Brittany coast.

Goddet had to get Sofil to produce another jersey overnight, its logo still visible but artificial fabric absent. 
Bobet&#x27;s concern with hygiene and clothing was accentuated by frequent problems with saddle sores.

==Raymond Le Bert==
Bobet was one of the first riders to employ a personal soigneur, taking his lead from Coppi. He took on Raymond Le Bert, a physiotherapist from St-Brieuc, as well as a secretary and a driver. Le Bert booked him hotel rooms between half-stages of the Tour, against the Tour&#x27;s rules. Riders were supposed to use a dormitory provided for them. When the Tour insisted riders carry spare tyres, usually round their shoulders, Le Bert gave Bobet tubulars with the inner tubes taken out, useless to ride on but lighter to carry if that&#x27;s what the rules insisted.

Le Bert said he had met Coppi, whom Bobet admired for his &quot;modern&quot; techniques but refused to have anything to do with the Italian&#x27;s suitcase of drugs. Bobet insisted he never took drugs. But the journalist and race organiser, Jean Leulliot, remembered a dinner organised by Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan, the organisers of the Tour de France, for the race&#x27;s former winners. Leulliot wrote:

One table attracted particular attention. Around it were Anquetil, Merckx and Bobet, 13 victories in the Tour between them. The conversation at the table was particularly lively and Louison Bobet was being challenged for saying that he had never taken the slightest drug or stimulant. He was obliged to admit that he had drunk the small bottles prepared for him by his soigneur at the time without knowing exactly what they contained. Which produced laughter from Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx.

==Bobet and Britain==
Bobet presented prizes at the annual presentation of the British Best All-Rounder time-trial competition at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 1954. He gave a yellow jersey to a veteran competitor, Vic Gibbons. Bobet flew from Paris to London in a de Havilland Dove chartered by a London timber-merchant and cycling enthusiast, Vic Jenner. Jock Wadley, the editor of &quot;Sporting Cyclist&quot; was with Jenner. He remember that the two Britons arrived at Le Bourget airport without having brought passports – but that immigration staff gave them no attention because they were too busy trying to get an autograph from Bobet.

==Retirement and death==

Bobet&#x27;s career effectively ended when the car carrying him and his brother Jean crashed outside Paris in the autumn of 1960.

Louison Bobet had a succession of businesses after he stopped racing, including a clothes shop, but he became best known for investing in and developing the seawater health treatment of thalassotherapy. He had used it when recovering from his car crash. He opened the Louison Bobet centre beside the sea at Quiberon. The Quiberon centre was purchased by Accor in 1984 and became the flagship of its Thalassa Sea &amp; Spa brand. He fell ill, however, and died of cancer the day after his 58th birthday. Cancer had been speculated during the operation for his saddle boils. Bobet is interred in the cemetery of Saint-Méen-le-Grand, and there is a museum to his memory in the town, the idea of village postmaster Raymond Quérat.

<text>The Roman legionary (in Latin &quot;legionarius&quot;; : &quot;legionarii&quot;) was a citizen soldier of the Roman army. These soldiers would conquer and defend the territories of ancient Rome during the Republic and Principate eras, alongside auxiliary and cavalry detachments. At its height, Roman Legionnaires were viewed as the foremost fighting force in the Roman world, with commentators such as Vegetius praising their fighting effectiveness centuries after the classical Roman legionary disappeared.

Roman legionnaires were recruited from Roman citizens under age 45. They were first predominantly made up of recruits from Roman Italy, but more were recruited from the provinces as time went on. As legionnaires moved into newly conquered provinces, they helped Romanize the native population and helped integrate the disparate regions of the Roman Empire into one polity. They enlisted in a legion for 25 years of service, a change from the early practice of enlisting only for a campaign. Legionnaires were expected to fight, but they also built much of the infrastructure of the Roman Empire and served as a policing force in the provinces. They built large public works projects, such as walls, bridges, and roads. The legionary&#x27;s last five years of service were on lighter duties. Once retired, a Roman legionary received a parcel of land or its equivalent in money and often became a politically prominent member of society.

== History ==
=== Inception: Marius&#x27;s reforms ===
=== During the Principate ===
As Augustus consolidated power in 27 BC and founded the Principate, he further professionalized the Roman legionary and sought to break the legionary&#x27;s dependence on his general. Under him, a legionary&#x27;s term of service was raised to 25 years (before that, a legionary&#x27;s average term of service was only 10 years) and pay was standardized throughout the legions. The Roman legionaries were also guaranteed a land grant or a cash payment at the end of his service, making the Roman legionary less dependent on generals for rewards after campaigns. Augustus also changed the &quot;sacramentum&quot; so that soldiers swore allegiance only to the emperor, and not to the general. Thus, Augustus managed to end the civil wars which defined the late Roman Republic and created an army that was broadly loyal to only the emperor.

Legionnaires would expand Rome&#x27;s borders to include lower Britannia, Dacia, North Africa, and more through military campaigns under Augustus and future emperors.

=== Decline ===
From the reign of Septimus Severus onward, the Roman legionary gradually lost his preeminence. Though there were multiple causes for this decline, all pointed to the gradual degradation of loyalty and/or discipline. Septimus Severus, perhaps unwittingly, began this decline when he lavished his legionaries with donatives and pay increases, recognising that they were his key to becoming and staying emperor. However, this proved detrimental to the discipline of the legionaries, as they began to expect more and more rewards from their emperors. Under Caracalla, Septimus Severus&#x27;s successor, all freedmen in the Roman Empire became Roman citizens, effectively erasing the distinction between auxiliaries and legionnaires. This, coinciding with the continued expansion of the Roman army, meant recruits of more dubious standards joined the legions, decreasing the quality of the Roman legionary further.

During the 3rd Century Crisis, a more mobile army became necessary, as threats arose across the long borders of the Roman Empire. As such, mounted cavalry became essential to respond to the varied challenges to the empire. Because of this, Roman heavy infantry faded further from dominance. By the 4th century, Roman infantry lacked much of the body armor of the classical legionary and used darts rather than the &quot;pila&quot; of their predecessors.

== Functions ==
Though the legionary was first and foremost a soldier, he provided a variety of other critical functions. Lacking a professional police force, governors would use legionaries to keep the peace and protect critical facilities. As the Roman empire lacked a large civil administration, the army would often be given many administrative positions. High ranking soldiers often acted as judges in disputes among local populations and the army was an important component of tax collection. Legionaries also served to spread Roman culture throughout the provinces where they were stationed. As legionaries settled in the provinces, towns sprang up around them, often becoming large cities. In this way, as legionaries co-mingled and intermarried with the local populace, they helped Romanize the provinces they protect.

Roman legionaries served as a source of labor and expertise as well. As such, much of the infrastructure which connected the empire was built by legionaries. Roads, canals, and bridges were built by legionaries as well as more defensive structures such as fortresses and walls. Hadrian&#x27;s wall, a monumental example of Roman engineering, was built by the three legions stationed in the area. Legionaries were not just limited to building large-scale engineering projects. Surveyors, doctors, artisans, and engineers within the army would be used for a variety of different civil services along with their normal military role.

== &quot;Immunes&quot; ==
Regular trained legionaries were known as &quot;milites&quot; and were the equivalent in rank of the modern private. Included in the ranks, aside from the &quot;milites&quot;, were the &quot;immunes&quot;, specialist soldiers with secondary roles such as engineer, artilleryman, drill and weapons instructor, carpenter and medic. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and would fight in the ranks if called upon. They were excused from some of the more arduous tasks such as drill and fatigues and received better pay than their comrades in arms.

== Recruitment ==
Though Roman legionaries were predominantly made up of volunteer citizens, conscription of recruits continued through Republic era and into the Principate, especially in times of crisis. This meant that levees remained a significant part of the Roman legions. With the state providing the equipment to the recruits and no property requirements, even the poorest Roman citizens were able to join the legions. However, the army was viewed as an honorable and valued profession. With a steady pay, good retirement benefits, and even certain legal advantages, a legionary had many perks that common citizens found desirable. As such, though poor citizens could join the military, members from across the &quot;plebeian&quot; class were found in the Roman legions. Indeed, the army served as one of the few avenues of upward mobility in the Roman world.

The army actively sought out recruits with useful skills such as smiths, carpenters, and butchers. Though not required, literacy was useful since promotion to higher ranks such as &quot;centurion&quot; required a knowledge of writing. During the Later Republic, Roman legionaries predominantly came from the areas surrounding Rome. However, as Rome expanded, recruits began to come from other areas in Italy. Slowly, recruits came from the regions where the legions were stationed rather than from Italy itself. By the reign of Trajan, there were 4–5 legionaries originating from the provinces for every legionary originating from Italy.

== Equipment ==
When on the march in hostile territory, the legionary would carry or wear full armour, supplies and equipment. This commonly consisted of chain (&quot;lorica hamata)&quot;, scaled (&quot;lorica squamata)&quot;, or in the 1st–3rd century sectioned (&quot;lorica segmentata)&quot; armour, shield (&quot;scutum&quot;), helmet (&quot;galea&quot;), two javelins (one heavy &quot;pilum&quot; and one light &quot;verutum&quot;), a short sword (&quot;gladius&quot;), a dagger (&quot;pugio&quot;), a belt (&quot;balteus&quot;), a pair of heavy sandals (&quot;caligae&quot;), a pair of greaves, a pair of manicas, a marching pack (&quot;sarcina&quot;), about fourteen days&#x27; worth of food, a waterskin (bladder for &quot;posca&quot;), cooking equipment, two stakes (&quot;sudes murale&quot;) for the construction of palisades, a shovel, and a wicker basket.

After the military reforms of Emperor Claudius (circa 41 AD), each legion would also be requisitioned a certain number of artillery pieces. Each cohort (roughly 480 men) would receive one ballista and each &quot;centuria&quot; (roughly 100 men) would receive one carroballista. In a standard legionary formation of ten cohorts and sixty centuriae, a legion would be equipped with ten ballistae and sixty carroballistae.

== Battle and combat ==

=== Maintaining morale ===
The Roman legionary fought first and foremost with his &quot;contubernium&quot;, the basic eight man unit of the Roman army. The men of the same &quot;contubernium&quot; fought, slept, ate, and trained together. This strong sense of camaraderie gave Roman legionaries a sense of pride and kept them fighting on the battlefield. The standard bearers, &quot;signiferi&quot;, were of great importance in keeping Roman soldiers in the battle. The loss of a standard was a disgrace to the &quot;centuria&quot; the standard belonged to. As such, standard bearers served as someone to rally around and as someone to exhort legionaries to battle.

&quot;Optiones&quot;, Roman officers at the rear of a formation, had many essential roles outside of battle. However, during battle, their task was to prevent legionaries from routing. Carrying a staff with a ball-end, an &quot;optio&quot; would force legionaries fleeing from battle back into formation. Leading at the front, &quot;centurions&quot; would fight alongside legionaries under their command, serving as a role model for his legionaries to remain in combat.

Finally, there were the rewards and punishments, which served as both incentives and deterrents for legionaries in battle. For example, the highly coveted &quot;corona civica&quot; was given to legionaries who saved a comrade in battle. However, death was the punishment for a variety of different offenses. Those who committed cowardice and dereliction of duty were stoned to death by their comrades. On very rare occasions when a whole unit displayed cowardice, the unit might be decimated, in which one out of every ten soldiers were executed. Less extreme punishments included demotions, changing the wheat rations to barley, and the removal of some identifying military gear.

=== Prelude to battle ===
Large armies would generally not begin battle immediately upon meeting. Rather, days or even weeks of redeployment and negotiation would take place before battle. Several days of maneuvering occurred before the Battle of Pharsalus began. Before battle, measures were taken to ensure legionaries were as effective as possible. These included giving legionaries their meals and resting them before the battle. Their commanders and general would also give speeches during this time. These speeches would heavily emphasize the amount of plunder and riches that winning the battle would give the legionaries, as this was a primary incentive for the legionaries to do battle. Light skirmishing would then take place, with cavalry and auxiliaries probing enemy lines before a pitched battle commenced.

=== Fighting style ===

The Roman legionary&#x27;s three principal weapons were the &quot;pilum&quot; (javelin), &quot;scutum&quot; (shield), and &quot;gladius&quot; (short sword). Ideally, the legionaries would throw their &quot;pila&quot; first as they approached the enemy army. These pila could often penetrate enemy shields and hit the soldiers behind them. Even if the pila failed to pierce the shields, the neck of the javelin would bend, making the shield useless. This then made the enemy vulnerable to missile fire and legionary attack. The disruption and damage wrought by pila would then be followed by the charge of Roman legionaries.

Though Roman &quot;scutum&quot; had various different designs, they all shared a large metal boss in the center of the shield. This allowed the legionary to not only use the &quot;scutum&quot; as defensive equipment but also as an offensive weapon. Legionaries would have used this iron boss to punch and shove the enemy combatants. Accompanying this was the &quot;gladius&quot;, a primarily stabbing weapon though it could also be used to cut. These fairly simple tools combined with impressive discipline made the Roman legionary an extremely effective soldier in the ancient world.

Though there were many different formations that legionaries fought in, they tended toward close, ordered formations with gaps between formations. These gaps would allow for reserve units to enter battle or serve as avenues for skirmishing forces to retreat back behind the legionaries. During lulls in the battle, wounded soldiers could further be taken back behind battle lines through these gaps.

== Pay and conditions ==

During the Pax Romana, a rank-and-file Roman legionary would be paid 225 denarii per year. This was increased to 300 denarii during the reign of Domitian. However, during the third century crisis, inflation and chaos disrupted a legionary&#x27;s pay, with emperors often letting legionaries seize goods from civilians. Their income was supplemented by donatives from emperors either to secure a legion&#x27;s loyalty or to award them after a successful campaign. Plunder and loot also supplement a legionary&#x27;s income and is used as a large incentive for soldiers to follow their emperor in campaigns. At the end of their years of service, Roman legionaries received a small allotment of land or a monetary equivalent.

As the Roman empire solidified, permanent legionary fortresses were constructed and many grew into towns. These fortresses contained bathhouses, taverns, and even amphitheaters where festivals and animal displays were held. However, legionaries were not allowed to legally marry until the reign of Septimius Severus (though their spouses were often recognized), most likely because of the implicit necessity to care for the widow in the event of a legionary&#x27;s death.

=== Training and discipline ===
When first enlisted, a fresh Roman recruit (&quot;tiro&quot;) was not given real weapons to train with. Instead, he was given wooden swords and shields designed to be twice the weight of their counterparts in battle. This allowed the recruit to develop strength as he trained with these wooden weapons. Alongside battle training, the recruit was also taught other necessary skills such as swimming and setting up camp. Most of all, however, the recruit was taught discipline, and was drilled twice a day during his training period. After this period, which could last up to six months, the recruit would become a &quot;milite&quot; and sent to his respective legion.

The Roman soldier underwent especially rigorous training throughout his military career; discipline was the base of the army&#x27;s success, and the soldiers were relentlessly and constantly trained with weapons and especially with drill—forced marches with full load and in tight formation were frequent. As discipline was important, infractions were heavily punished by the centurions. Punishments could range from being obliged to spend the night outside the protective security of a fortified camp, through being beaten with clubs (&quot;fustuarium&quot;—a common punishment for &#x27;slowpokes&#x27; during long marches), to the stoning of individuals or unit executions involving decimation. However, honors, rewards, and promotions were frequently awarded to legionaries who distinguished themselves in battle or through exemplary service.

One of the goals for strong disciplinary training was to expel fear from a Roman soldier. Fear, and the panic that often follows, is a devastating force to an army on the battlefield. The Romans aimed to remove fear through strict physical and mental training. However, a different fear was used to motivate a soldier in spite of the fear of battle; that was the fear of harsh punishment by their commanding officers. In the words of Josephus &quot;they are moreover hardened for war by fear; for their laws inflict capital punishments, not only for soldiers running away from the ranks, but for slothfulness and inactivity&quot;.

=== Diet ===
A Roman legionary had two or three meals per day: The &quot;prandium&quot; (breakfast) and the &quot;cena&quot; (dinner). For these meals, the soldiers were issued regular rations consisting mainly of wheat, which composed roughly 60–70% of a soldier&#x27;s total rations. This would be consumed in the form of either bread or porridge. However, while on campaign, the soldiers would cook their wheat rations into hardtack, a long-lasting biscuit.

Supplementing the soldier&#x27;s wheat rations was the &quot;cibaria&quot;, rations other than grain. This included a variety of foodstuffs but mainly wine, vinegar, vegetables (largely beans or lentils), salt, salt-pork, cheese, and olive oil. However, this did not include fruit. Through foraging, trade with merchants, requisitioning, or raiding during campaigns, the Roman legionary could obtain other foodstuffs not included in his rations. In combination, the average soldier&#x27;s diet was generally nutritious and filling.

=== Healthcare ===
Permanent Roman forts would contain hospitals, where doctors (&quot;medici&quot;) operated on wounded, injured, or sick legionaries. These medical personnel also isolated sick soldiers, thereby reducing the chance of a possibly infectious disease spreading through the army. Roman forts and camps were also planned in such a way as to minimize the spread of water-borne illnesses, which ravaged many ancient armies. Engineers took special care in piping fresh water to the camps and carrying sewage downstream of any watering places. Those legionaries who were seriously and permanently wounded or injured would be granted &quot;missio causaria&quot;, or a medical discharge. This discharge would come with many benefits including exemption from some taxes and some civic duties.

== Other legionaries ==
&quot;Legionary&quot; is also a term used for members of various military forces which have been accorded the title of &quot;legion&quot;, although bearing no resemblance to the heavy infantry of ancient Rome. In the 18th and early 19th century this designation was sometimes accorded to units which comprised both mounted and foot components. More recently the title has been used by the French Foreign Legion, the Spanish Foreign Legion and the Polish Legions. Members of these modern legions are often called &quot;légionnaires&quot;, the French term for legionary.

The term was also used by the Romanian far right paramilitary group known in English as the Iron Guard.

<doc id="288614" wikidata="Q1432789" url="?curid=288614" title="Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport">
<text>Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport is a commercial and military-use airport in Savannah, Georgia, United States. Savannah/Hilton Head International provides travelers with access to Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, as well as neighboring areas including Bluffton and Beaufort, South Carolina and the Golden Isles region of Coastal Georgia.

Owned by the City of Savannah and managed by the Savannah Airport Commission, Savannah/Hilton Head International is located seven nautical miles northwest of the Savannah Historic District. The airport&#x27;s passenger terminal is directly accessible to Interstate 95 between Savannah and the suburban city of Pooler. Its previous names include Savannah International Airport, Travis Field and Chatham Field.

This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. U.S. Customs facilities are on the field and the airport is part of a Foreign Trade Zone.

==History==
The first Savannah Municipal Airport was opened on September 20, 1929, with the inauguration of air service between New York City and Miami by Eastern Air Express. In 1932, a city resolution named the airport Hunter Field. A trolley car was used as the first terminal at Hunter Field in the mid-1930s. In 1940, the U.S. Army Air Corps proposed to take over Hunter Field if a war started. While commercial airlines continued to use Hunter Field, the city decided to build a second municipal airport in response to the increased military presence.

The City of Savannah acquired a 600-acre tract near Cherokee Hill, one of the highest elevations in the county, and construction of a new airfield began under a Works Progress Administration project. Three 3,600-foot runways were constructed running north–south, east–west, and northeast–southwest. In 1942, before the completion of this new airfield, the U.S. Army Air Corps decided to take over the new facility and start additional construction to carry out its mission. It named the airfield Chatham Field and used it until the end of World War II as a bomber base and crew training base for B-24 bombers as well as fighter aircraft.

In 1948, Chatham Army Airfield was turned over to the Georgia Air National Guard and the airport was renamed Travis Field, in honor of Savannah native Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, killed in the crash of a B-29 bomber near Fairfield-Suisun AFB, California, and his brother, Colonel William Travis. To accommodate the airlines, Travis Field received a new control tower and an airline terminal in the former base theater.

In 1958, work began on a new airline terminal. In 1962, an additional extension brought the east–west runway&#x27;s length to . The jet age arrived in 1965 when Delta Air Lines introduced Douglas DC-9-10 flights. Grumman Aircraft opened a $7.5 million Gulfstream manufacturing plant at Travis in 1967. A new $21-million terminal building was built on the northwest corner of the airport in 1994.

A six-gate terminal built-in 1960 was replaced in 1994 by the current facility. Although the airport had no direct international flights at the time, it was renamed Savannah International Airport in 1983, then Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport in 2003.

In 1992, the airport had international service with non-stop flights to destinations in the Caribbean and Mexico when Key Airlines was operating a passenger hub in Savannah. Key Airlines also operated non-stop mainline jet service to a number of U.S. cities at this time and from Savannah. According to the Key Airlines system timetable dated October 1, 1992, non-stop services primarily operated with Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 jetliners were being flown from the airport to Antigua (ANU), Aruba (AUA), Atlanta (ATL), Baltimore (BWI), Boston (BOS), Cancun (CUN), Chicago Midway Airport (MDW), Cozumel (CZM), Curaçao (CUR), Freeport (FPO), Montego Bay (MBJ), Nassau (NAS), New York Newark Airport (EWR), Orlando (MCO), St. Maarten (SXM) and St. Thomas (STT). In addition to these non-stop flights, a one-stop direct service was also flown by the airline from Savannah to St. Croix (STX). Key Airlines subsequently experienced financial difficulties and then ceased all flights in 1993.

Some from the west end of Runway 10 (the main east–west runway) are two concrete grave markers. A runway extension project placed the runway through a small family plot and the graves of the airport property&#x27;s two original owners. Because the family did not want to remove and relocate the graves, the markers were placed on the asphalt runway. Runway 10 is thought to be the only airport runway in the United States with marked gravestones in it. Federal law generally prohibits the moving of a grave without the permission of the next of kin. In this case, two graves of the Dotson Family, the earliest grave dating backed to 1857, were encountered during the construction of the runway. Since the next of kin could not be located, the graves were left undisturbed. Two additional graves are located off the runway surface.

The new 275,000-sq.-ft. terminal opened in May 1994 with eight gates (expandable to 19 gates). The project included new roads, a new aircraft taxiway and parking apron, stormwater ponds, landscaping, and a new interchange at I-95 for entry into the Airport (Exit 104) at mile marker 104. The total cost for the project was $68.5 million. It was completed one month ahead of schedule and under budget. It was designed by KBJ Architects.

A terminal expansion project was completed in July 2007, adding five departure gates (for a total of 15). A $35 million parking garage was completed in October of the same year, adding 1,700 parking spaces and uses an electronic program to alert drivers to the number of available spaces on each garage level.

International service was finally resumed in 2017 when Air Canada began seasonal service between Toronto and Savannah, which has since ceased to operate the route.

For the second consecutive year, the airport was named the #1 Best Domestic Airport in &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot; World&#x27;s Best Awards 2022 as a result of a survey by its readers. Airport accessibility, shopping, check-in, security, restaurants, cleanliness and other factors contributed to the airport&#x27;s top US rating. &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; magazine ranked Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport the US #1 airport for the third consecutive year by its readers as well.

==Facilities==
Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport covers an area of 3,650 acres (1,477 ha) at an elevation of 50 ft. (15 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with concrete surfaces:
* 10/28: 9,351 ft. x 150 ft. (2,850 m x 46 m)
* 01/19: 7,002 ft. x 150 ft. (2,134 m x 46 m)

For the 12-month period ending July 31, 2023, the airport had 112,822 aircraft operations, an average of 309 per day: 49% general aviation, 14% air taxi, 33% scheduled commercial, and 4% military. At that time there were 150 aircraft based at this airport: 82 single-engine, 27 multi-engine, 29 jet, 4 helicopter, and 8 military.

=== Future expansion ===
To accommodate the rapid growth in passengers traveling through the airport, construction is currently underway to expand the TSA security lanes. Upon completion in fall 2024, there will be six TSA security lanes. Construction on an additional four gates is expected to start in September 2024 and be completed by November 2025. Construction is also expected to start in 2024 on two new surface lots for airport parking.

===Military===

Also located on the airport is Savannah Air National Guard Base, home to the 165th Airlift Wing (165 AW) of the Georgia Air National Guard. The 165 AW flies the C-130H Hercules tactical airlift aircraft and, as an Air National Guard (ANG) unit, is under the operational claimancy of the Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 165 AW, including the collocated Georgia ANG Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC) and Air Dominance Center, consists of over 310 full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, and over 700 additional part-time traditional air national guardsmen (TG), also known as Drill Status Guardsmen (DSG).

Savannah ANGB has over 145 buildings and 239 acres of leased land in the southeast and northeast quadrants of the airport.

It is also home of the Air Dominance Center.

<text>Legio XIV Gemina (&quot;The Twinned Fourteenth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army, levied by Julius Caesar in 57 BC. The cognomen &quot;Gemina&quot; (Twinned) was added when the legion was combined with another understrengthed legion after the Battle of Actium. The cognomen &quot;Martia Victrix&quot; (martial and victorious) was added following their service in the Pannonian War and the defeat of Boudicca in AD 61. The emblem of the legion was the Capricorn, as with many of the legions levied by Caesar.

==History==
===Under Caesar===
Legio XIV was first raised by Caesar in Cisalpine Gaul during his raids into, and conquest of, Gaul. Their enlistment term was for 16 years, as per the other Republican legions (though Augustus raised that to 20). In the first years, the legion frequently was left behind to guard the camp during battles and raids. Following its early destruction at Atuatuca (near today&#x27;s Tongeren, Belgium) during Ambiorix&#x27;s revolt it was immediately reconstituted. For years after the Massacre at Atuatuca carried out by the Eburones under Ambiorix together with Cativolcus they were viewed as an unlucky legion, but its honor had been preserved due to the efforts of their Aquilifer, Lucius Petrosidius.

===Under Germanicus===
This legion fought under General Germanicus Julius Caesar against the Germanic leader Arminius. A decade before this campaign, Arminius succeeded in wiping out three entire legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, one of the greatest disasters in Roman military history. The legion secured a victory for Germanicus, and earned him a triumph from his adopted father and biological uncle, Emperor Tiberius.

===Invasion of Britain===
Stationed in Moguntiacum, Germania Superior from AD 9, Legio XIV &quot;Gemina Martia Victrix&quot; was one of four legions used by Aulus Plautius and Claudius in the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. It built its legionary fortress at Mancetter on Watling Street and by AD 58 it had moved its base to Wroxeter.

It took part in the defeat of Boudicca in 60 or 61. At the Battle of Watling Street the 14th defeated Boudicca&#x27;s force of 230,000, according to Tacitus and Dio, with their meager force of 10,000 Legionaries and Auxiliaries. This act secured them as Nero&#x27;s &quot;most effective&quot; legion, and he kept them garrisoned in Britain during the next few years to keep the uneasy tribes in check.

In 67 AD the legion was sent to the Balkans in preparation for a campaign against the Parthians that Nero planned but which never materialised.

===Rebellion on the Rhine===
In AD 89 the governor of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, rebelled against Domitian, with the support of the XIVth and of the XXI &quot;Rapax&quot;, but the revolt was suppressed.

When the XXIst legion was lost in AD 92, XIV &quot;Gemina&quot; was sent to Pannonia to replace it, setting up camp in Vindobona (Vienna). After a war with the Sarmatians and Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars (101–106 AD), the legion was moved to Carnuntum, where it stayed for three centuries. Some vexillations or subunits of the Fourteenth fought in the wars against the Mauri, under Antoninus Pius, and the legion participated in the Parthian campaign of Emperor Lucius Verus. During his war against the Marcomanni, Emperor Marcus Aurelius based his headquarters in Carnuntum.

===In support of Septimius Severus===
In AD 193, after the death of Pertinax, the commander of the Fourteenth, Septimius Severus, was acclaimed emperor by the Pannonian legions, and above all by his own. XIV &quot;Gemina&quot; fought for its emperor in his march to Rome to attack usurper Didius Julianus (193), contributed to the defeat of the usurper Pescennius Niger (194), and probably fought in the Parthian campaign that ended with the sack of the capital of the empire, Ctesiphon (198).

===In support of imperial candidates===

In the turmoil following the defeat of Valerian, the XIV &quot;Gemina&quot; supported usurper Regalianus against Emperor Gallienus (260), then Gallienus against Postumus of the Gallic Empire (earning the title &quot;VI Pia VI Fidelis&quot;—&quot;six times faithful, six times loyal&quot;), and, after Gallienus&#x27; death, Gallic Emperor Victorinus (269–271).

===5th century===
At the beginning of the 5th century, XIV &quot;Gemina&quot; was still assigned at Carnuntum. It probably dissolved with the collapse of the Danube frontier in the 430s. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists a &quot;Quartodecimani&quot; comitatensis unit under the &quot;Magister Militum per Thracias&quot;; it is possible that this unit is XIV &quot;Gemina&quot;.

<text>Peter Gansevoort (July 17, 1749 – July 2, 1812) was a Colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He is best known for leading the resistance to Barry St. Leger&#x27;s Siege of Fort Stanwix in 1777. Gansevoort was also the maternal grandfather of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; author Herman Melville.

==Early life==
Peter Gansevoort was born into the Dutch aristocracy of Albany in the Province of New York. His parents were Harman Gansevoort (1712–1801), the third generation of his family to live in America, and Magdalena Douw (1718–1796). His younger brother was Leonard Gansevoort, who was more active politically, serving in the state assembly and senate, as well as the Continental Congress.

Gansevoort&#x27;s paternal ancestors had been in Albany since 1660, when it was the Dutch colony of Fort Orange, and Harmen Harmense Gansevoort owned a brewery and farms. Through his mother, he was related to New York&#x27;s Van Rensselaer family as her mother, and Gansevoort&#x27;s maternal grandmother, was Anna Van Rensselaer (1696–1756), a daughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer, the director of the Eastern patent of the Rensselaerswyck manor. In addition, his first cousin, Leonard Gansevoort (1754–1834), an Albany lawyer and alderman, was married to Maria Van Rensselaer (1760–1841), the daughter of Col. Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1717–1781), the granddaughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer and the sister of Henry Van Rensselaer (1744–1816), Philip Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1747–1798), and Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763–1845).

==Career==
===American Revolution===
As the American Revolution grew closer, Peter Gansevoort joined the Albany County militia. While he lacked the experience of many older officers, he was a tactful and persuasive leader. Even at his young age, he was over six feet tall, and had a commanding presence. This, along with his family connections, caused Gen. Philip Schuyler to give him a commission.

===Invasion of Quebec===

At the start of the American Revolution, Gansevoort joined the Continental Army. He was commissioned as a Major on June 30, 1775, and served as a field commander in the 2nd New York Regiment. Goose Van Schaick was the regiment&#x27;s Colonel; he had raised it, and served as its nominal commander. Lieutenant Colonel Peter W. Yates had been the regiment&#x27;s primary field commander, but remained as commander of Fort George when Major Gansevoort led much of the regiment north with Richard Montgomery&#x27;s forces for the invasion of Quebec (1775).

Gansevoort led the regiment during the siege of Fort St. Jean, today known by its French name of Fort Saint-Jean. In late October, to improve the effect of the siege, Montgomery sent Gansevoort and his men down the river to seize Fort Chambly. At Chambly, they captured over 120 barrels of needed gunpowder and a huge mortar which they nicknamed &quot;the Old Sow&quot;. They also took about 100 prisoners of the Welch Fusilier garrison and their young Captain, John André.

Montgomery used the Old Sow to open fire on St. Johns, which was compelled to surrender on November 2, 1775. Gansevoort took part in the capture of Montreal, although he became ill during that attack. He started on the advance to Quebec City, but by the time the force reached Trois-Rivières, he was being carried on a stretcher.

He returned to Montreal and spent the winter as one of the sick with the occupation force. By the spring of 1776, the invasion had fallen apart at Quebec. Montgomery had been killed, and Benedict Arnold had been wounded. Gansevoort had recovered to the point where he led the remaining New York forces south in a fighting withdrawal that stopped the British advance at Lake Champlain. As recognition for his accomplishment, in June 1776, he was assigned to command Fort George.

===Siege of Fort Stanwix===
In November, Gansevoort was promoted to Colonel and given command of the 3rd New York Regiment. which he recruited and trained in early 1777. Lt. Colonel Marinus Willett became his second in command. His area of responsibility was extended from the Hudson River valley and Fort Edward and Fort George, along the Mohawk River Valley to Fort Oswego in the northwest. This was to be the axis of Colonel Barry St. Leger&#x27;s attack during the Saratoga campaign.

The 3rd New York did not have the men and equipment to extend that far, even with the support of local militia units. He conceded Fort Oswego to the British, and elected to defend Fort Stanwix (near modern Rome, New York). The fort had been abandoned after the French and Indian War and was in ruins. He and Willett restored the fort and strengthened its defenses. They hurriedly set up a garrison, getting the last boatload of supplies into the fort under fire from St. Leger&#x27;s advance force on August 2.

He and his more than 700-strong garrison withstood the three-week-long siege, making a sortie on August 6, while much of St. Leger&#x27;s force was occupied in the Battle of Oriskany. The siege was lifted on August 22, after word arrived that Benedict Arnold was leading a large relief force up the Mohawk Valley.

He received the grateful thanks of the Congress, as John Adams noted that &quot;Gansevoort has proven that it is possible to hold a fort.&quot;

===1778–1781===
Gansevoort eventually turned Fort Stanwix over to a garrison of the 1st New York Regiment. He moved his headquarters to his new command at Fort Saratoga (near modern Schuylerville, New York). He led his regiment in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. He had another bout of illness that winter (1779–1780) and returned home for a while, but, by July 1780, he was back with the 3rd at West Point. He was assigned to command the New York Brigade, and reestablished his headquarters at Fort Saratoga.

In the reorganization and downsizing of the New York Line in 1781, Gansevoort was left with no assignment in the Continental Army. He returned home and became Brigadier General of the Albany County Militia.

In 1783 he became an Original Member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.
===Post-Revolution===
After the war, Gansevoort continued to make his home in Albany where he operated the family brewery. He expanded his farms, adding grist mills and a lumber mill, in the area that eventually became Gansevoort, New York. In 1790, he served for a while as sheriff of Albany County, as a commissioner of Indian affairs, and continued his support of the military in the militia and as a quartermaster. In 1800, he ran for US Senator from New York but was defeated by Gouverneur Morris of the Federalist Party.

In 1809, he was made a Brigadier General in the United States Army and commanded the Army&#x27;s Northern Department. In 1811, he was called on to preside over the court-martial of General James Wilkinson. Wilkinson was found not guilty, and the court adjourned on Christmas Day. Hurrying back to his family, he suffered a recurrence of his old illness, and he never recovered, dying the next Summer.

==Personal life==

On January 12, 1778, he had married Catherine &quot;Katy&quot; Van Schaick (1752–1830) in her family&#x27;s home on Van Schaick Island, Cohoes, New York. She was the daughter of Wessel and Maria Van Schaik, and her cousin Goose Van Schaick had been Peter&#x27;s commander and Colonel in 1775. Over the years, they had five children, five of whom lived past infancy, including:

* Herman Gansevoort (1779–1862), who married Catherine S. Quackenbush (1774–1855) in 1813.
* Wessel Gansevoort (1781–1862), who never married.
* Leonard Herman Gansevoort (1783–1821), who married Mary Ann Chandonette (1789–1851)
* Peter Gansevoort (1788–1876), who married Mary Sanford (1814–1841), a daughter of Chancellor Nathan Sandford. After her death, he married Susan Lansing (1804–1874), great-niece of John Lansing Jr., in 1843.
* Maria Gansevoort (1791–1872), who married Allan Melvill (1782–1832), son of Thomas Melvill, in 1814.

He died at home in Albany on July 2, 1812. he is buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.

===Descendants===
His grandson through his son Leonard was Guert Gansevoort, who had a distinguished naval career that spanned 45 years. Through his daughter Maria, he was the maternal grandfather of author Herman Melville (1819–1891).

His eldest son, Herman, built the Gansevoort Mansion in 1813 on his father&#x27;s tract at Gansevoort in Saratoga County, New York. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

<doc id="288622" wikidata="Q2637365" url="?curid=288622" title="Benediction">
<text>A benediction (, &#x27;well&#x27; + , &#x27;to speak&#x27;) is a short invocation for divine help, blessing and guidance, usually at the end of worship service. It can also refer to a specific Christian religious service including the exposition of the eucharistic host in the monstrance and the blessing of the people with it.

==Christianity==
From the earliest church, Christians adopted ceremonial benedictions into their liturgical worship, particularly at the end of a service. Such benedictions have been regularly practiced both in the Christian East and West. Among the benedictions of the Roman Catholic Church, include the Apostolic Benediction made by the Pope and his delegates, and the &quot;last blessing&quot; of the dying. The Anglican Church retained the principle of benediction after the Protestant Reformation, and as a result, the benediction or blessing ends most Anglican, as well as Methodist, services of worship.

A common form of benediction in Baptist and liturgical Protestant churches is for the worship leader to raise his hands and recite the words of the biblical Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26 KJV). This addition to the Mass was made by Martin Luther in his Deutsche Messe and remains traditional in Lutheran Churches. Many Protestant denominations, such as the Methodist Church, incorporate the use of benedictions in the closing of their church services. Such benedictions may be taken from Scripture, written by a church member, or a combination of the two.

An often complex and lengthy blessing before communion took place in the mass of the Gallican Rite and in some French sees survived until the Gallican rites controversy when they were suppressed. Pope John Paul II, however, gave permission for these sees to restore this traditional element of their local rite. 

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, benedictions will occur at both the beginning and the end of each service, and there may be other benedictions during the course of the service. The final benediction (the dismissal) is the most important, and will often entail mention of the feast or saint being commemorated that day. The priest will bless with his right hand, and the bishop will bless with both hands. In both cases, the hand is held so that the fingers form the initials IC XC (the abbreviation for &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; in Greek), and he traces the Sign of the Cross in the air with his hand. If a bishop or abbot is holding his crozier while making the benediction, he will raise his right hand and trace the Sign of the Cross with both his crozier and right hand, crossing the one in front of the other. More solemn benedictions, such as that which comes at the end of the Divine Liturgy, will be made with a blessing cross rather than the hand.

===Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament===

One of the most generally popular services in the Roman Catholic Church is Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, commonly referred to as Benediction and known in France as Salut and in Germany as Segen. It is also the custom of some high-church Anglican churches to hold this service. It is ordinarily an afternoon or evening devotion and consists in the singing of certain hymns, or litanies, or canticles, before the Blessed Sacrament, which is exposed upon the altar in a monstrance and is surrounded with candles. At the end, the priest or deacon, his shoulders enveloped in a humeral veil, takes the monstrance into his hands and with it makes the sign of the cross in silence over the kneeling congregation. Benediction is often employed as a conclusion to other services, e.g. Vespers, Compline, Evensong, the Stations of the Cross, but it is also still more generally treated as a rite complete in itself. 

There is a good deal of diversity of usage in different countries with regard to details, but some of the elements are constant. The use of incense and wax candles, the singing of the &quot;Tantum ergo&quot; with its versicle and prayer, and the blessing given with the Blessed Sacrament are obligatory everywhere. In Rome, the only portion of the service which is to be regarded as strictly liturgical is the singing of the &quot;Tantum ergo&quot; and the giving of the Benediction which immediately follows. This idea is emphasized by the fact that in many Roman churches the celebrant, vested in cope and preceded by thurifer, acolytes, etc., only makes his entry into the sanctuary just before the &quot;Tantum ergo&quot; is begun. Preceding this, the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, informally, by a priest in cotta and stole; and then choir and congregation are left to sing litanies and canticles, or to say prayers and devotions as the occasion may demand.

In English-speaking countries the service generally begins with the entry of the priest and his assistants in procession and with the singing of the &quot;O Salutaris Hostia&quot; as soon as the Blessed Sacrament is taken out of the tabernacle. In England the singing of the &quot;O Salutaris&quot; is enjoined in the &quot;Ritus servandus&quot;, the code of procedure approved by a former synod of the Province of Westminster. The Litany of Our Lady, though usually printed after the &quot;O Salutaris&quot; and very generally sung at Benediction, is not obligatory. Further solemnity is often given to the service by the presence of deacon and subdeacon in dalmatics. When the bishop of the diocese officiates he uses mitre and crosier in the procession to the altar, and makes the sign of the cross over the people three times in giving the benediction. 
Otherwise, when the means for carrying out a more elaborate rite are not available, an informal service is permitted. The priest, wearing cotta and stole, simply opens the tabernacle door. Prayers and devotions are said or sung, and then the priest blesses those present with the veiled ciborium before the tabernacle door is again closed. The permission, general or special, of the bishop of the diocese is necessary for services where Benediction is given with the monstrance.

==Judaism==
Judaism developed ritualised benedictions (&quot;Berachot&quot;) for use at the Temple of Jerusalem, and the home. The Hebrew verb (&quot;brkh&quot;) means &#x27;to fall on one&#x27;s knees&#x27;. These &quot;Berachot&quot; often took the form of a blessing upon the fulfillment of a &quot;mitzvah&quot; (divine commandment). The most important benediction was the Priestly Blessing pronounced by the &quot;kohanim&quot; (priests descended from Aaron), as found in .

== Hinduism ==
Popularised by ISKCON, benediction in Hinduism usually refers to prayers said or sung sometimes during, before or after lunch, afternoon or any other preferred or chosen time.

<text>The Bible In Basic English (also known as the BBE) is a translation of the Bible into Basic English. The BBE was translated by Professor S. H. Hooke using the standard 850 Basic English words. 100 words that were helpful to understand poetry were added along with 50 &quot;Bible&quot; words for a total of 1,000 words. This version is effective in communicating the Bible to those with limited education or where English is a second language. The New Testament was released in 1941 and the Old Testament was released in 1949.

The 1965 printing of the Bible was published by Cambridge Press in England without any copyright notice and distributed in the US, falling into the Public Domain according to the UCC convention of that time.

<doc id="288636" wikidata="Q130878" url="?curid=288636" title="Chewing gum">
<text>Chewing gum is a soft, cohesive substance designed to be chewed without being swallowed. Modern chewing gum is composed of gum base, sweeteners, softeners/plasticizers, flavors, colors, and, typically, a hard or powdered polyol coating. Its texture is reminiscent of rubber because of the physical-chemical properties of its polymer, plasticizer, and resin components, which contribute to its elastic-plastic, sticky, chewy characteristics.

== History ==
The cultural tradition of chewing gum seems to have developed through a convergent evolution process, as traces of this habit have arisen separately in many early civilizations. Each early precursor to chewing gum was derived from natural growths local to the region and was chewed purely out of the instinctual desire to masticate. Early chewers did not necessarily desire to derive nutritional benefits from their chewable substances but at times sought taste stimuli and teeth cleaning or breath-freshening capabilities.

Chewing gum in many forms has existed since the Neolithic period. 5,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, has been found in Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is believed to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Mayans and Aztecs were the first to exploit the positive properties of gum; they used chicle, a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gum were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree. Mastic gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and is believed to have been used to maintain oral health. Both chicle and mastic are tree resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.
Although chewing gum can be traced back to civilizations worldwide, the modernization and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. In this way, the industrializing West, having forgotten about tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums, the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly dip the gum in to maintain sweetness. William F. Semple, a dentist from Mount Vernon, Ohio, filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304, on 28 December 1869. Semple&#x27;s gum was intended to clean the teeth and strengthen the chewer&#x27;s jaw. It was not a sweet treat; ingredients included chalk and powdered licorice root. Charcoal was also suggested as a &quot;suitable&quot; ingredient in the patent.

The first flavored chewing gum was created in the 1860s by John Colgan, a Louisville, Kentucky, pharmacist. Colgan mixed with powdered sugar the aromatic flavoring tolu, a powder obtained from an extract of the balsam tree (&quot;Myroxylon&quot;), creating small sticks of flavored chewing gum he named &quot;Taffy Tolu&quot;. Colgan also led the way in the manufacturing and packaging of chicle-based chewing gum, derived from &quot;Manilkara chicle&quot;, a tropical evergreen tree. He licensed a patent for automatically cutting chips of chewing gum from larger sticks: US 966,160 &quot;Chewing Gum Chip Forming Machine&quot; 2 August 1910 and a patent for automatically cutting wrappers for sticks of chewing gum: US 913,352 &quot;Web-cutting attachment for wrapping-machines&quot; 23 February 1909 from Louisville, Kentucky, inventor James Henry Brady, an employee of the Colgan Gum Company.

Modern chewing gum was first developed in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former president, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where he gave it to Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture. In the United States, chewing gum experienced a decline in popularity in the early 21st century, as it lost its association with counterculture and teenage rebelliousness. Others blamed smartphones reducing impulse purchases at the checkout.

Demand for chewing gum also declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people were less concerned about bad breath and impulse purchases also declined. U.S. sales of gum fell about 30 percent, and while demand was back up to the pre-pandemic level in 2023 in dollar terms, this was the result of inflation as the average price of a pack increased $1.01 from 2018 to $2.71 in 2023. Globally, sales were down 10 percent from 2018.

== Ingredient composition ==
Gum base composition is considered proprietary information known by select individuals within each gum-manufacturing company. Information about the other components of chewing gum are more accessible to the public and they are listed in Table 2.

Table 2: Common ingredients in the formulation of modern chewing gum
=== Gum base ===
Gum base is made of polymers, plasticizers, and resins. Polymers, including elastomers, are responsible for the stretchy and sticky nature of chewing gum. Plasticizers improve flexibility and reduce brittleness, contributing to the plastic and elastic nature of gum. The interactions of plasticizers within gum base are governed by solubility parameters, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Resins compose the hydrophobic portion of the gum base, responsible for its chewiness. Although the exact ingredients and proportions used in each brand&#x27;s gum base are trade secrets within the gum industry, Table 3 lists all of the natural and synthetic gum base components approved for use in the United States, demonstrating some examples of key gum base components.

Table 3: Gum base ingredients approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016)
== Manufacturing process ==
First, gum base is previously prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors are added to the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.

=== Product varieties ===

Chewing gum can come in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4 to 6.9 grams per piece, and products can be differentiated by the consumers&#x27; intent to form bubbles or the sugar/sugarless dichotomy.

Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about five to 17 sticks or more, and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or &quot;dragée&quot; gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut and wrap gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.

=== Quality and safety ===
Chewing gum is rather shelf stable because of its non-reactive nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40 to 0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from three to six percent. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not required by law to be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead to the end of the product&#x27;s shelf life, as it causes the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.

== Physical and chemical characteristics ==
The physical and chemical properties of chewing gum impact all aspects of this product, from manufacturing to sensory perception during mastication.

=== Chewiness ===
The polymers that make up the main component of chewing gum base are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer&#x27;s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in chewing gum, but not the gum base itself. This allows for gum to be chewed for a long time without breaking down in the mouth like conventional foods. Chewing gum can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.

=== Stickiness ===
While hydrophobic polymers beneficially repel water and contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one&#x27;s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum toward the end of the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.

=== Bubble-blowing capability ===

Bubblegum bubbles are formed when the tension and elasticity of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally on all of the interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.

Gum bases with higher molecular weights are typically used in gums intended to meet bubble-forming expectations. Higher molecular weight gum bases include longer polymers that are able to stretch further, and thus are able to form larger bubbles that retain their shape for a longer time.

=== Flavor release ===
Flavor delivery is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components due to the physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum&#x27;s ingredients. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers&#x27; saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six-minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10–15 minutes into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum and the end of the chew.

Studies have shown that gum flavor is perceived better in the presence of sweetener. Companies have started to create chemical systems in gum so that the sweetener and flavor release together in a controlled manner during chewing.

=== Cooling sensation ===
A cooling sensation is achieved through the chemical phenomenon of the negative enthalpy of dissolution that occurs with bulk sweeteners, such as the sugar alcohols. The enthalpy of dissolution refers to the overall amount of heat that is absorbed or released in the dissolving process. Because the bulk sweeteners absorb heat as they dissolve and have a negative enthalpy, they yield a cooling sensation as they are dissolved in a consumer&#x27;s saliva.

==Health effects==

===Brain function===
A review about the cognitive advantages of chewing gum by Onyper et al. (2011) found strong evidence of improvement for the following cognitive domains: working memory, episodic memory and speed of perception. However the improvements were only evident when chewing took place prior to cognitive testing. The precise mechanism by which gum chewing improves cognitive functioning is however not well understood.
The researchers did also note that chewing-induced arousal could be masked by the distracting nature of chewing itself, which they named &quot;dual-process theory&quot;, which in turn could explain some of the contradictory findings by previous studies. They also noticed the similarity between mild physical exercise such as pedaling a stationary bike and chewing gum. It has been demonstrated that mild physical exercise leads to little cognitive impairment during the physical task accompanied by enhanced cognitive functioning afterwards. Furthermore, the researchers noted that no improvement could be found for verbal fluency, which is in accordance with previous studies. This finding suggests that the effect of chewing gum is domain specific. The cognitive improvements after a period of chewing gum have been demonstrated to last for 15–20 minutes and decline afterwards.

===Dental health===

Sugar-free gum sweetened with xylitol has been shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot; in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44 grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32 grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.

Food and sucrose have a demineralizing effect upon enamel that has been reduced by adding calcium lactate to food. Calcium lactate added to toothpaste has reduced calculus formation. One study has shown that calcium lactate enhances enamel remineralization when added to xylitol-containing gum, but another study showed no additional remineralization benefit from calcium lactate or other calcium compounds in chewing-gum.

Other studies indicated that the caries preventive effect of chewing sugar-free gum is related to the chewing process itself rather than being an effect of gum sweeteners or additives, such as polyols and carbamide. A study investigating the in situ effect of casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) found that its incorporation into a sugar-free gum increases the remineralization / protection of eroded enamel surface significantly.

Gum chewing is regarded as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva can also promote enamel remineralization as long as it does not become too acidic.

Masumoto et al. looked at the effects of chewing gum after meals following an orthodontic procedure, to see if chewing exercises caused subjects pain or discomfort, or helped maintain a large occlusal contact area. 35 adult volunteers chewed gum for 10 to 15 minutes before or after three meals each day for 4 weeks. 90% of those questioned said that the gum felt &quot;quite hard&quot;, and half reported no discomfort.

===Use in surgery===
Several randomized controlled studies have investigated the use of chewing gum in reducing the duration of post-operative ileus following abdominal and specifically gastrointestinal surgery. A systematic review of these suggests gum chewing, as a form of &quot;sham feeding&quot;, is a useful treatment therapy in open abdominal or pelvic surgery, although the benefit is less clear when laparoscopic surgical techniques are used.

Chewing gum after a colon surgery helps the patient recover sooner. If the patient chews gum for fifteen minutes for at least four times per day, it will reduce their recovery time by a day and a half. The average patient took 0.66 fewer days to pass gas and 1.10 fewer days to have a bowel movement. Saliva flow and production is stimulated when gum is chewed. Gum also gets digestive juices flowing and is considered &quot;sham feeding&quot;. Sham feeding is the role of the central nervous system in the regulation of gastric secretion.

===Use in cardiovascular disease===
Chewing gum has been shown to be effective in relieving the symptom of thirst in patients living with heart failure.

===Stomach===
Chewing gum is used as a novel approach for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, chewing gum is sometimes considered to contribute to the development of stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren&#x27;t required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing sorbitol, gas and/or diarrhea may occur.

== Controversies ==

=== Classification as food ===
Controversy arises as to health concerns surrounding the questionable classification of gum as food, particularly in regard to some alternative uses for gum base ingredients. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), chewing gum is considered a food, as the term &quot;food&quot; means &quot;a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient used or intended for use or for sale in whole or in part for human consumption, or chewing gum&quot;. Chewing gum is defined as a food of minimal nutritional value. However, many of the ingredients in gum base have uses in inedible products, which raises concern in some consumers. Polyethylene, one of the most popular components of gum base, belongs to a common group of plastics and is used in products from plastic bags to hula hoops. Polyvinyl acetate is a sticky polymer found in white glue. Butyl rubber is typically used in caulking and the lining of car tires, in addition to its role in gum base. Paraffin wax is a byproduct of refined petroleum.

===Possible carcinogens===
Concern has arisen about the possible carcinogenicity of the vinyl acetate (acetic acid ethenyl ester) used by some manufacturers in their gum bases. Currently, the ingredient can be hidden in the catch-all term &quot;gum base&quot;. The Canadian government at one point classified the ingredient as a &quot;potentially high hazard substance.&quot; However, on 31 January 2010, the Government of Canada&#x27;s final assessment concluded that exposure to vinyl acetate is not considered to be harmful to human health. This decision under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) was based on new information received during the public comment period, as well as more recent information from the risk assessment conducted by the European Union.

===Choking and excretion of swallowed gum===
Various myths hold that swallowed gum will remain in a human&#x27;s stomach for up to seven years, as it is not digestible. According to several medical opinions, there seems to be little truth behind the tale. In most cases, swallowed gum will pass through the system as quickly as any other food.

There have been cases where swallowing gum has resulted in complications in young children requiring medical attention. A 1998 paper describes a four-year-old boy being referred with a two-year history of constipation. The boy was found to have &quot;always swallowed his gum after chewing five to seven pieces each day&quot;, being given the gum as a reward for good behavior, and the build-up resulted in a solid mass which could not leave the body. A 1½-year-old girl required medical attention when she swallowed her gum and four coins, which got stuck together in her esophagus. A bezoar is formed in the stomach when food or other foreign objects stick to gum and build up, causing intestinal blockage. As long as the mass of gum is small enough to pass out of the stomach, it will likely pass out of the body easily, but it is recommended that gum not be swallowed or given to young children who do not understand not to swallow it.

Adults have choked to death on chewing gum in rare cases. A 2012 report describes a 42-year-old woman who fell on the stairs while chewing gum. Due to the impact, the gum fell into the pharynx and was inhaled into the larynx, causing complete blockage and resulting in the woman&#x27;s death by asphyxiation.

=== Environmental effects ===
Chewing gum is not water-soluble and unlike other confectionery is not fully consumed. There has been much effort at public education and investment aimed at encouraging responsible disposal. Despite this it is commonly found stuck underneath benches, tables, handrails and escalators. It is extremely difficult and expensive to remove once &quot;walked in&quot; and dried. Gum bonds strongly to asphalt and rubber shoe soles because they are all made from polymeric hydrocarbons. It also bonds strongly with concrete paving. Removal is generally achieved by steam jet and scraper but the process is slow and labour-intensive.

Most external urban areas with high pedestrian traffic show high incidence of casual chewing gum discard. In 2000 a study on Oxford Street, one of London&#x27;s busiest shopping streets, showed that a quarter of a million black or white blobs of chewing gum were stuck to its pavement. Gum removal from city streets, or even famous landmarks, can be a costly effort; in Rome, 15,000 pieces of chewed gum are discarded on a daily basis and the removal of each piece costs the city one euro. However, likely as a consequence of Singapore&#x27;s ban, Singapore&#x27;s pavements are, perhaps uniquely amongst modern cities, free of gum.

Various teams of researchers have developed gum that is less adhesive and degrades within days or weeks. One example, Rev7 Gum, was briefly for sale from 2010 to 2012.

=== Bans ===
Many schools do not allow chewing gum because students often dispose of it inappropriately (leaving it under desks and chairs, behind vending machines, etc.). The chewing may also pose a distraction to class, and the gum might carry diseases or bacteria from other students.

The Singapore government outlawed chewing gum in 1992 citing the danger of discarded gum being wedged in the sliding doors of underground trains and general cleanliness. However, in 2004 the government allowed sugarless gum to be sold in pharmacies if a doctor or dentist prescribed it due to the Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement.

== Recycling ==

In 2018, the BBC published a news article on British designer Anna Bullus, who created a method of collecting and recycling chewing gum into plastic, noting that litter from chewing gum is the second most common form of litter, second only to cigarette litter. She uses a Worcester recycling plant to make old chewing gum into plastic. She then uses that plastic at a plastic moulding specialist, Amber Valley, in Leicester to make plastic objects. Known objects made are collection containers for more chewing gum, shoe soles, rubber boots, and plastic cups. Her company advertises itself as the &quot;first company in the world to recycle and process chewing gum into a range of new compounds that can be used in the rubber and plastics industry&quot;. The company is called Gum-tec, and the collection containers are dubbed &quot;gumdrops&quot;. Advertised products on the website are pencils, coffee mugs, guitar picks, a &quot;bicycle spoke&quot;, rulers, sports cones, frisbees, boomerangs, door stops, &quot;meal mates&quot;, lunch-boxes, and combs.

<text>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (informally the NOAA Corps) is one of eight federal uniformed services of the United States, and operates under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a scientific agency overseen by the Department of Commerce. The NOAA Corps is made up of scientifically and technically trained officers. The NOAA Corps and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are the only U.S. uniformed services that consist only of commissioned officers, with no enlisted or warrant officer ranks. The NOAA Corps&#x27; primary mission is to monitor oceanic conditions, support major waterways, and monitor atmospheric conditions.

The NOAA Corps traces its origins to the establishment of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps on May 22, 1917, which the service recognizes as its official date of establishment. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps in 1965, which in turn became the NOAA Corps in 1970.

==Mission==
The NOAA Corps is the smallest of the eight uniformed services of the United States government. It has over 300 commissioned officers, but no enlisted or warrant officer personnel. The NOAA Corps today employs professionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. NOAA Corps officers operate NOAA ships, fly NOAA aircraft, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout NOAA, as well as in positions in the United States Merchant Marine, the United States Department of Defense, the United States Coast Guard, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the United States Department of State. Like its predecessors, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps and the ESSA Corps, the NOAA Corps provides a source of technically skilled officers which can be incorporated into the United States Armed Forces in times of war, and in peacetime supports defense requirements in addition to its non-military scientific projects. Should it be called into active duty, it would be a department of one of the six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

==History==

===Early history===
The NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps traces its roots to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the oldest scientific agency of the federal government. The Coast and Geodetic Survey was founded as the United States Survey of the Coast under President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 and renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836. Until the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Coast Survey was staffed by civilian personnel working with United States Army and United States Navy officers. During the American Civil War, Army officers were withdrawn from Coast Survey duty, never to return, while all but two Navy officers also were withdrawn from Coast Survey service for the duration of the war. Since most men of the Survey had Union sympathies, most stayed on with the Survey rather than resigning to serve the Confederate States of America; their work shifted in emphasis to support of the United States Navy and Union Army, and these Coast Surveyors are the professional ancestors of today&#x27;s NOAA Corps. Those Coast Surveyors supporting the Union Army were given assimilated military rank while attached to a specific command, but those supporting the U.S. Navy operated as civilians and ran the risk of being executed as spies if captured by the Confederates while working in support of Union forces. After the war, U.S. Navy officers returned to duty with the Coast Survey, which was given authority over geodetic activities in the interior of the United States in 1871 and was subsequently renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878.

With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, the U.S. Navy again withdrew all of its officers from Coast and Geodetic Survey assignments. They returned after the war ended in August 1898, but the system of U.S. Navy officers and men crewing the Survey″s ships that had prevailed for most of the 19th century came to an end when the appropriation law approved on June 6, 1900, provided for &quot;all necessary employees to man and equip the vessels,&quot; instead of U.S. Navy personnel. The law took effect on July 1, 1900; at that point, all U.S. Navy personnel assigned to the Survey″s ships remained aboard until the first call at each ship″s home port, where they transferred off, with the Survey reimbursing the Navy for their pay accrued after July 1, 1900. From July 1900, the Coast and Geodetic Survey continued as an entirely civilian-run organization until after the United States entered World War I in April 1917.

===Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps===

To avoid the dangers that Coast Survey personnel had faced during the Civil War of being executed as spies if captured by the enemy, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps was established on 22 May 1917, giving Coast and Geodetic Survey officers a commissioned status so that under the laws of war, they could not be executed as spies if they were captured while serving as surveyors on a battlefield during World War I. The creation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps also ensured that in wartime a set of officers with technical skills in surveying could be assimilated rapidly into the United States Armed Forces so that their skills could be employed in military and naval work essential to the war effort. Before World War I ended in November 1918, over half of all Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers had served in the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, or United States Marine Corps, performing duty as artillery orienteering officers, as minelaying officers in the North Sea (where they were involved in the laying of the North Sea Mine Barrage), as navigators aboard troop transports, as intelligence officers, and as officers on the staff of American Expeditionary Force commanding officer General John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps returned to peacetime scientific pursuits after the war. Its first flag officer was Rear Admiral Raymond S. Patton, who was promoted from captain to rear admiral in 1936.

When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps again suspended its peacetime activities to support the war effort, often seeing front-line service. Over half of all Coast and Geodetic Survey officers were transferred to the U.S. Army, the United States Army Air Forces, the U.S. Navy, or the U.S. Marine Corps, and deployed in North Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the defense of North America as artillery surveyors, hydrographers, amphibious engineers, beachmasters (i.e., directors of disembarkation), instructors at service schools, and in a wide variety of technical positions. They also served as reconnaissance surveyors for a worldwide aeronautical charting effort, and a Coast and Geodetic Survey officer was the first commanding officer of the Army Air Forces Aeronautical Chart Plant at St. Louis, Missouri. Three officers who remained in Coast and Geodetic Survey service were killed during the war, as were eleven other Survey personnel.

After the war ended in August 1945, the Coast and Geodetic Survey again returned to peacetime scientific duties, although a significant amount of its work in the succeeding years was related to support of military and naval requirements during the Cold War.

===ESSA Corps===

When the Coast and Geodetic Survey was transferred to the newly established Environmental Science Services Administration on July 13, 1965, control of the corps was transferred from the Coast and Geodetic Survey to ESSA itself, and accordingly, the corps was redesignated the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps, known informally as the ESSA Corps. The ESSA Corps retained the responsibility of providing commissioned officers to operate Coast and Geodetic Survey ships and of providing a set of officers with technical skills in surveying for incorporation into the U.S. armed forces during wartime.

Following the establishment of the ESSA, Rear Admiral H. Arnold Karo was promoted to vice admiral to help lead the agency. He served as the first Deputy Administrator of ESSA and was the first vice admiral, and at the time the highest-ranking officer, in the combined history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps and ESSA Corps. Rear Admiral James C. Tison Jr. was the first director of the ESSA Corps.

===NOAA Corps===
The ESSA was replaced by the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on October 3, 1970. As a result, the ESSA Corps was redesignated the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, known informally as the NOAA Corps. Rear Admiral Harley D. Nygren was appointed as the first director of the new NOAA Corps.

In 1972, the NOAA Corps became the first uniformed service of the United States to recruit women on the same basis as men, and in that year it commissioned Ensign Pamela Chelgren, making her the first female commissioned officer. In 1977, Chelgren became operations officer aboard the NOAA research ship , making her third-in-command and giving her the highest shipboard posting ever achieved by a woman in the Uniformed Services of the United States up to that time. On 1 June 2012, the NOAA research vessel RV &quot;Gloria Michelle&quot;, a boat crewed by two NOAA Corps personnel, became the first vessel in the history of NOAA or its ancestor organizations to have an all-female crew.

On 2 January 2014, Michael S. Devany was promoted to vice admiral upon assuming duties as Deputy Under Secretary for Operations at NOAA, becoming only the second vice admiral in the combined history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, ESSA Corps, and NOAA Corps, and the first since the promotion of Vice Admiral Karo in 1965. On 15 July 2024, Nancy A. Hann assumed the position of Deputy Under Secretary for Operations, NOAA, and became the third person and first woman to achieve the rank of vice admiral in the combined history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, ESSA Corps, and NOAA Corps.

==Commissioned officers==
===Ranks and insignia===
The NOAA Corps uses the same naval commissioned officer ranks as the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. While the grade of admiral has been established as a rank in the NOAA Corps, the rank has not been authorized for use by the United States Congress. Current NOAA Corps ranks rise from ensign to vice admiral, pay grades O-1 through O-9, respectively, although the rank of vice admiral has been used only rarely in the history of the NOAA Corps and its predecessors. 

Unless already on active duty as a commissioned officer in any of the other U.S. uniformed services and transferring their commission from that service, new NOAA Corps officers are appointed via direct commission and must complete a 19-week basic officer training class (BOTC) at the United States Coast Guard Officer Candidate School at the United States Coast Guard Academy before entering active duty. 

NOAA Corps officers receive the same pay as other members of the U.S. uniformed services. They cannot hold a dual commission with another U.S. uniformed service, but inter-service transfers sometimes are permitted from other services via .

Unlike their United States Armed Forces counterparts, NOAA Corps officers do not require their rank appointments and promotions to be confirmed by the United States Senate, and only require approval from the president.

===Rank flags===

NOAA Corps flag officers are authorized the use of rank flags.

===Militarization===
NOAA Corps officers can be militarized by the President of the United States under the provisions of , which states:

==Uniforms==
For formal service uniforms, the NOAA Corps wears the same Service Dress Blues and Service Dress Whites as the U.S. Navy, but with NOAA Corps insignia in place of U.S. Navy insignia. For daily work uniforms, the NOAA Corps wears the same Operational Dress Uniform (ODU) as the U.S. Coast Guard, but with NOAA Corps insignia in place of U.S. Coast Guard insignia.
==Awards and decoration==
==Flag==

Although the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and ESSA had their own flags, neither the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps nor the ESSA Corps did. The NOAA Corps adopted its flag on 7 March 2002, the last of the then-seven uniformed services of the United States to have its own distinctive flag.

The flag has a navy blue background. Centered on the background is a white circle inscribed with &quot;NOAA COMMISSIONED CORPS&quot; and &quot;1917&quot;, the latter referring to the year of the founding of the NOAA Corps&#x27;s original predecessor, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps. A red triangle symbolizing the discipline of triangulation used in hydrographic surveying. A similar triangle was used by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, ESSA flags. Triangles are flown in the commission pennants by Coast and Geodetic Survey and NOAA vessels, and for the NOAA Corps, their insignia is also set within the triangle. The flag is displayed in accordance with the customs and traditions of the uniformed services of the United States.

==Official song==
In 1988, the NOAA Corps adopted a march, &quot;Forward with NOAA,&quot; as its first official service song. In 2017 it adopted a sea chanty, &quot;Into the Oceans and the Air,&quot; as its new official service song.

<text>USS &quot;Sand Lance&quot; (SSN-660), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship and the second submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the sand lance, a member of the family Ammodytidae.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 24 October 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 15 January 1965. She was launched on 11 November 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas J. McIntyre, and commissioned on 25 September 1971. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was the last ship to be constructed for the Navy at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

==Service history==
On the day of her commissioning, &quot;Sand Lance&quot;″s home port was changed from Portsmouth to Charleston, South Carolina. She spent the remainder of 1971 on shakedown. She operated in the Charleston area for the whole of 1972, then, in February 1973, stood out of Charleston for special operations. She returned to Charleston on 21 April 1973, remained in port until 11 June 1973, and then departed again on special operations. She completed these operations in August 1973 and put in at Faslane Naval Base, Scotland, on 13 August 1973. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; left Faslane on 20 August 1973 and arrived in Charleston on 5 September 1973. Sand Lance was sent to the Mediterranean to monitor shipping going through the Straits of Gibraltar during the Yom Kippur War. She then operated out of Charleston in the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through at least June 1974. She went through overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in 1975 and 1976 (15 months).

In 1987, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; completed Law Enforcement Operations in the Caribbean Sea and was transferred to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery Maine for a refueling overhaul, replacement of propeller (screw), and upgrades to hull coatings. She underwent sea trials in 1990 and returned to active service out of Charleston, SC.

In 1991, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was deployed for six months as part of the UNITAS task force around South America. She traveled through the Panama Canal and around the southernmost tip of South America.

From October 1993 to March 1994 &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was on a Mediterranean Sea Deployment and called on ports at Naples, Italy; Monte Carlo, Monaco; U.S. Naval Support Activity Base Santo Stefano Island, Italy; Toulon, France, and Gibraltar.

In 1994 &quot;Sand Lance&quot;, while moored at Charleston – almost sank next to the pier ahead of one of her sister ships, the attack submarine , due to flooding in the engine room&#x27;s lower level when a main seawater hull valve was being removed for maintenance. Plates, called blanks, had been placed over her hull penetrations by divers to avoid flooding during removal of the valve but had been placed over the wrong main seawater openings. The flooding was stopped, but not before most of the engine room&#x27;s lower level was flooded.

In 1995, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; left Charleston and relocated to a new homeport in Groton, Connecticut, where she became a member of Submarine Squadron 2.

In 1996, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was sent on a patrol to the Arctic Circle. While there, the submarine surfaced through the polar ice cap at the North Pole on 12 July.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Sand Lance&quot; was decommissioned on 7 August 1998 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 April 1998 and was completed on 30 August 1999.

Sand Lance&#x27;s Maneuvering Room Consoles, which were used to control the engines, electrical systems and nuclear reactor were displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and are now stored there in the event of future exhibits involving nuclear submarines.

<doc id="288648" wikidata="Q1054227" url="?curid=288648" title="Tivaevae">
<text>Tivaevae or tivaivai () in the Cook Islands, tifaifai in French Polynesia, is a form of artistic quilting traditionally done by Polynesian women. The word literally means &quot;patches&quot;, in reference to the pieces of material sewn together. The tivaevae are either made by one woman or can be created in groups of women called &quot;vainetini&quot;. The &quot;vainetini&quot; use this time together to bond, sing and catch up on village news.

==Traditional uses==
Tivaevae are often given on very special occasions either to important visitors, as birthday and wedding gifts or used to cover the body of a loved one who has died. They are often displayed during important events like the traditional boys&#x27; hair-cutting ceremonies, birthdays and weddings.

By custom, a tivaevae is not measured by monetary value nor production cost. Its value is said to be reflected by the love and patience that the creator(s) have put into making a stunning work of art. Cook Islands women often described their tivaevae as being &quot;something from the heart&quot;. Artist Vereara Maeva-Taripo has described tivaevae as central to the identity of Cook Islands women.

Tivaevae are rarely seen for sale on the islands. The Atiu Fibre Arts Studio on Atiu is the only place in the Cook Islands where they are commercially produced and available for purchase.

==History==
The tivaevae&#x27;s origins are uncertain. Rongokea (1992) believes it to be an imported art form, and cites two sets of Christian missionaries in the 19th century as possible origins. While it is known that these female missionaries taught the indigenous women how to sew, it is not certain that they taught them the craft of quilting or making bed coverlets. The appliqué style of tivaevae quilting appears to have been influence by Pennsylvanian German scherenschnitte or Victorian folded paper-cutting traditions. Multiple origins and influences thus seem likely.

As an art form, tivaevae replaced barkcloth production in Tahiti and the Cook Islands by the late 19th century: the function and nature of barkcloth production was transferred to tivaevae. Vereara Maeva-Taripo and Tungane Broadbent are important tivaevae artists of today from the Cook Islands, and both artists have been displayed in Queensland Art Gallery and are in the collection in Cook Islands National Museum and Queensland Art Gallery, as well as Christchurch Art Gallery.

<doc id="288650" wikidata="Q1652243" url="?curid=288650" title="Peak envelope power">
<text>Peak envelope power (PEP) is the average power over a single radio frequency cycle at the crest of the modulation. This is a Federal Communications Commission definition. PEP is normally considered the occasional or continuously repeating crest of the modulation envelope under normal operating conditions. The United States FCC uses PEP to set maximum power standards for radio transmitters.

==AM PEP==
Assuming linear, perfectly symmetrical, 100% modulation of a carrier, PEP output of an AM transmitter is four times its carrier PEP; in other words, a typical modern 100-watt amateur transceiver is usually rated for no more than, and often less than, 25 watts carrier output when operating in AM. 

==PEP vs. average power==
PEP is equal to steady carrier power, or radiotelegraph dot or dash average power, in a properly-formed CW transmission. PEP is also equal to average power in a steady FM, FSK, or RTTY transmission. 

Although average power is the same as PEP for complex modulation forms, such as FSK, the peak envelope power bears no particular ratio or mathematical relationship to longer-term average power in distorted envelopes, such as a CW waveform with power overshoot, or with amplitude modulated waveforms, such as SSB or AM voice transmissions. Typical average power of a SSB voice transmission, for example, is 10-20% of PEP. The percentage of longer term average power to PEP increases with processing, and commonly reaches ~50% with extreme speech processing.

==PEP level control==
Most modern amateur transceivers sample PEP to adjust power, using an ALC (automatic level control) system. Time delay in the ALC system and finite time of RF signals passing through multiple stages, in particular narrow filters, often gives rise to unusual envelope distortion. This distortion commonly appears as envelope power overshoot on leading edges, and sometimes causes negative carrier shift on AM. Some more poorly designed transceivers have a short term envelope power overshoot several times the steady-state PEP setting. This envelope overshoot further complicates definitions of PEP and average power. 

PEP was often used in non-broadcast AM applications because it most accurately described the potential of mobile transmitters to interfere with each other. Its use is now somewhat deprecated, with the &quot;average&quot; transmitter power output (or sometimes &quot;average&quot; effective radiated power) now typically being preferred.

<text>Corona is a neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York City. It borders Flushing and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park to the east, Jackson Heights to the west, Forest Hills and Rego Park to the south, Elmhurst to the southwest, and East Elmhurst to the north. Corona&#x27;s main thoroughfares include Corona Avenue, Roosevelt Avenue, Northern Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, and 108th Street.

Corona has a multicultural population with a Latino majority, and is the site of historic African-American and Italian-American communities. After World War II, the majority of the neighborhood&#x27;s residents were mostly Italian, German, Irish and of other European ancestries. Corona also has a significant Chinese population.

Corona is mostly part of Queens Community District 4. The section north of Roosevelt Avenue, known as North Corona, is the northern section of Corona and is in Community District 3. Corona is patrolled by the 110th and 115th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
The area was originally known as West Flushing, but various theories have arisen for its etymology. One theory is that it was renamed by music producer Benjamin W. Hitchcock, a developer who renamed the area in 1872 and sold off land for residential development. Another theory is that real estate developer Thomas Waite Howard, who became the first postmaster in 1872, petitioned to have the post office name changed to Corona in 1870, suggesting that it was the &quot;crown of Queens County&quot;. A third theory is that the name Corona derives from the crown used as an emblem by the Crown Building Company, which is said to have developed the area. The Italian immigrants who moved into the new housing stock referred to the neighborhood by the Italian or Spanish word for &quot;crown&quot;, or &quot;corona&quot;.

Corona was a late-19th-century residential development in the northeastern corner of the old Town of Newtown. Real estate speculators from New York started the community in 1854, the same year that the New York and Flushing Railroad began service to the area largely to serve a newly opened race course. It was at the Fashion Race Course in 1858 that the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the All Stars of Brooklyn and the All Stars of New York, are commonly believed to be the first all-star baseball games and in essence the birthplace of professional baseball. A trophy baseball from this tournament sold in 2005 for nearly $500,000.

During the second half of the 1940s through the 1960s, many legendary African-American musicians, civil rights leaders and athletes moved to the neighborhood. In the last half of the 20th century, Corona saw dramatic ethnic successions. In the 1950s, what was predominantly an Italian-American and African-American neighborhood began to give way to an influx of Dominicans. In the late 1990s, Corona saw a new wave of immigrants from Latin America. The area north of Roosevelt Avenue contained the heart of the historic African-American community. The intersection of 108th Street and Corona Avenue is the historic center of the Italian-American community, sometimes referred to as Corona Heights. The majority Hispanic community now consists of Dominicans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Bolivians, Peruvians, Mexicans, Venezuelans, and Chileans. There are also Asian Americans (Chinese, Indians, Koreans, Filipinos, and Japanese) as well as Italian Americans and African Americans.

==Structures==
Dorie Miller Residential Cooperative, built in 1952, comprises six buildings, containing 300 apartments, with 1,300 rooms in total. The cooperative is named after Doris &quot;Dorie&quot; Miller, a U.S. Naval hero at Pearl Harbor and the first African-American recipient of the Navy Cross. Among its original residents were jazz greats Nat Adderley &amp; Jimmy Heath; Kenneth and Corien Drew, publishers of Queens&#x27; first African-American newspaper, &quot;The Corona East Elmhurst News&quot;, Thelma E. Harris founder of Aburi Press and prominent Queens Judge Henry A. Slaughter. Corona was also the childhood home of Marie Maynard Daly, the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry.

The Louis Armstrong House attracts visitors to the neighborhood and preserves the legacy of musician Louis Armstrong, one of Corona&#x27;s most prominent historical residents. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.The Lemon Ice King of Corona, an ices shop, is located at 52nd Avenue, Corona Avenue, and 108th Street. Founded in 1944 by Peter Benfaremo, it is a neighborhood point of interest. The shop attracts international tourists due to having been featured in the opening credits of the TV show &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

Corona used to have three kettle ponds. One of them, Linden Pond, was located a block south of 103rd Street–Corona Plaza station and was the centerpiece of Park of the Americas, located near the original center of Corona. The pond had become a public health hazard by the early 20th century, and was renovated in 1912; it was removed altogether when the park was renovated in 1947. The second was Shady Lake, located at what is now the intersection of 53rd Avenue, Corona Avenue, and 108th Street. The pond, originally used to harvest ice, was drained in the 20th century; the Lemon Ice King of Corona and William F. Moore Park are now located near the site. A third, Backus Lake at 98th Street and 31st Avenue, was also considered a nuisance by the 1900s, and was drained in 1917.

===Corona Plaza===
Corona Plaza, located at Roosevelt Avenue and National Street, was previously an underutilized lot and truck route that was transformed over the course of several years into a pedestrian plaza for community programming and inclusive living. In the latter half of the 20th century, the area that is now Corona Plaza was a lot that connected the street to a row of mainly immigrant-owned businesses. The neighborhood of Corona had an overflow of immigrants who struggled to find employment which exacerbated illegal trading, much of which would occur through the use of trucks that could park in this unofficial lot. By the early 21st century, Corona Plaza was gradually given more attention and became a community space for the ethnically diverse population of Corona.

In 2005, the nearby Queens Museum began applying for permits to temporarily close off the streets that allowed vehicle access to the plaza and hosted public events (typically art based) that the residents of the community could attend. Seeing the lot&#x27;s future potential, the Queens Museum partnered with the Queens Economic Development Corporation (QEDC) to develop plans to reuse the space. The partners saw this as an opportunity for grassroots, art-led engagement that would unite residents. The two groups&#x27; individual intentions both contributed to the creation of the permanent plaza: the QEDC supports developing local businesses while the Queens Museum creates a stronger presence in the neighborhood for its arts programs,

The space was first transformed in 2012 as a temporary plaza with chairs and tables that prohibited through traffic. It was later made permanent by the Department of Design and Construction, which filled in the lot with concrete, added built-in seating and a performance space, new pedestrian lighting, and plants to reinforce the liveliness. Later added was a drinking fountain, WalkNYC wayfinding signs, bike racks to serve commuters, an automatic pay toilet, and more furniture. Maintenance and technical assistance (including daily cleaning) services for the plaza are funded by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), which has also partnered with the Queens Museum to bring programming to the newly transformed space. The plaza was fully implemented in early 2018 at a cost of around $5.6 million. Corona Plaza is recognized by urban planning circles as a project that has created a new community space.

<text>Elmhurst (formerly Newtown) is a neighborhood in the borough of Queens in New York City. It is bounded by Roosevelt Avenue on the north; the Long Island Expressway on the south; Junction Boulevard on the east; and the New York Connecting Railroad on the west.

The village, originally named Middleburgh, was established in 1652 by English Puritans, approximately from New Amsterdam. When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed it New Town, which was eventually simplified to Newtown. It remained a rural community until the late 1890s, when it was renamed Elmhurst and became part of the City of Greater New York. Elmhurst became heavily developed with residential and commercial structures in the early 20th century, and many immigrants started moving in during the latter part of the century.

Elmhurst is located in Queens Community District 4 and its ZIP Code is 11373. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 110th Precinct. Politically, Elmhurst is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 25th District and small parts of the 21st, 24th, and 29th Districts.

==History==

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
The village was founded in 1652 in the Dutch colony of New Netherland () by English Puritans from Connecticut and Massachusetts. They named it (&#x27;Middleburgh&#x27;) after the capital of the Dutch province of Zeeland, which had been a refuge of Puritans fleeing religious persecution in England. The village was located approximately from the growing city of New Amsterdam () and just east of the settlement at Maspat (now called Maspeth), which had been abandoned following threats and attacks by local Lenape Native Americans. When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed Middleburgh as (New Town) to maintain a connection to its Dutch heritage. This was eventually simplified to Newtown. In a deed dated July 9, 1666, the settlers took title to the lands of Newtown from the Native American tribes.

A town building, near what is now Broadway and Corona Avenue, was erected to serve as both a community and religious building. Use of this building was shared by the different religious denominations in Middleburgh: the Church of England, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Presbyterians, and the Quakers. In 1669, the town planned a new church for all of these denominations, on a plot of land donated by Ralph Hunt near Grand Avenue and Queens Boulevard. According to the town records, the new building was to cost forty pounds, half in corn and half in cattle. The village of Newtown was established as the town seat for the township in 1683, when Queens County was reorganized as a &quot;one county, five towns&quot; model. The Town of Newtown, which had a town hall, jail, tax office, and town clerk&#x27;s office, was the center of a municipality that comprised the villages that were located north of present-day Forest Park and west of Flushing Meadows.

By 1700, the town had a population of 1,000, including 405 youths under the age of sixteen, 434 adults, and 161 slaves. Among the English settlers in the present Elmhurst section of Newtown was Gershom Moore, who lived at what is now the intersection of Broadway, 45th Avenue, and Elmhurst Avenue. A chance seedling on his farm eventually produced the Newtown Pippin, Colonial America&#x27;s most famous apple. The St. James Church was founded in 1704, followed by the Reformed Church of Newtown in 1731. The Colonel Bernardus Bloom Farmhouse at 90-11 56th Avenue, which existed from the 17th century to 2015, was one of the oldest surviving farmhouses in Newtown through the 21st century.

=== 19th century ===

Newtown was also the center of a population of free blacks and slaves by the early 19th century. With the program of gradual abolition and the manumission of some slaves by masters following the American Revolution, the free population increased. In 1828, a year after slavery in New York state was finally abolished under the terms of a 1799 gradual abolition law, landowner James Hunter and his wife deeded to the community for a church and parsonage. They had already been using land at Corona Avenue and 90th Street as a burial ground since about 1818. This was associated with the United African Society of Newtown, by 1906 known as St. Mark&#x27;s A.M.E. Church. By 1886, more than 300 burials had been made in the cemetery. The church moved further east and gradually the burial ground was forgotten until the remains of a woman were discovered in an iron coffin in 2011 during development. The church is hoping to buy the land for preservation.

More concentrated residential development in the area was spurred by the completion of a horsecar line, the Grand Street Line, which reached New Town in 1854. The Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line was built through Newtown in 1876, attracting more residents to the neighborhood.

=== Renaming and incorporation into city ===
Cord Meyer bought land at Broadway and Whitney Avenue in 1896. He proposed that the town be renamed &quot;Elmhurst&quot;, meaning &quot;a grove of elms&quot;; in 1897, one year before Queens County was incorporated in the Greater City of New York, the town was renamed. The renaming was done partially to disassociate the town from nearby Maspeth and the smelly, polluted Newtown Creek, and partially to celebrate the elm trees (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) that abounded in the area.

Elmhurst developed as a fashionable district due to a housing development built by the Cord Meyer Development Company between 1896 and 1910, north of the Port Washington Branch railroad station. Cord Meyer expanded its holdings between 1905 and 1930, including Elmhurst Square, Elmhurst South, Elmhurst Heights, and New Elmhurst. Elmhurst also was the site of the Grand Street LIRR station just west of the current Grand Avenue – Newtown subway station. The Grand Street LIRR station was served by the Main Line and the former Rockaway Beach Branch. In the 1930s, the Independent Subway System&#x27;s Queens Boulevard line was built through the neighborhood, spurring economic development but also destroying many old buildings.

Prior to World War II, Elmhurst had become an almost exclusively Jewish and Italian neighborhood, made up of early 20th century immigrants and their descendants. Following the war, Elmhurst evolved into what has been considered one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in New York City, as immigrants arrived from new areas. By the 1980s, there were persons from 112 nations in residence in the neighborhood, which has continued to diversify since then. Among the most numerous ethnic groups that have settled in the area are Latinos and Chinese Americans.

For many years, the Elmhurst gas tanks, a pair of large natural gas storage structures built in 1910 and 1921 on 57th Avenue between 74th and 80th Streets, were well-known landmarks, standing high. Because the Long Island Expressway frequently became congested in that area, &quot;backup at the Elmhurst Gas Tanks&quot; became a familiar phrase in radio traffic reporting. The gas storage facilities were removed in 2001. The site was redeveloped and opened as Elmhurst Park in 2011.

== Land use ==
Elmhurst contains a variety of zoning districts, including manufacturing, commercial, residential, and mixed-use. Much of the neighborhood is composed of detached or multi-family houses, though there are also rowhouse districts, apartment buildings of up to six or seven stories, and large developments such as LeFrak City. Commercial overlays are located primarily along Queens Boulevard, Broadway, and Grand and Corona Avenues. Several tracts are also zoned for shopping centers, which are occupied by Elmhurst&#x27;s malls. Light-manufacturing zones are located near the western end of the neighborhood, mainly between the LIRR&#x27;s Port Washington Branch and 51st Avenue.

<doc id="288676" wikidata="Q1145574" url="?curid=288676" title="Jackson Heights">
<text>Jackson Heights is a neighborhood in the northwestern part of the borough of Queens in New York City. Jackson Heights is neighbored by North Corona to the east, Elmhurst to the south, Woodside to the west, and today northern Astoria (Ditmars-Steinway) to the northwest, and East Elmhurst to the north and northeast. Jackson Heights has an ethnically diverse community, with half the population having been foreign-born since the 2000s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called it &quot;the most culturally diverse neighborhood in New York, if not on the planet.&quot; According to the 2010 United States Census, the neighborhood has a population of 108,152.

The site of Jackson Heights was a vast marsh named Trains Meadow until 1909 when Edward A. MacDougall&#x27;s Queensboro Corporation bought of undeveloped land and farms. The Queensboro Corporation named the land Jackson Heights after Jackson Avenue, which was in turn named after John C. Jackson, a descendant of one of the original Queens families. He was a respected Queens entrepreneur. Jackson Avenue was the northern border of the ambitious Garden City development of the Queensboro Corporation. Further development arose through the development of transit and &quot;garden apartments&quot;. &quot;Garden homes&quot; soon became prevalent in Jackson Heights. During the 1960s, Jackson Heights&#x27;s white middle-class families began moving to the suburbs, and nonwhite residents began moving in.

Jackson Heights retains much of its residential character. It also has numerous commercial establishments clustered along 37th Avenue, as well as on several side streets served by subway stations. Most of the surviving garden city neighborhood is part of a national historic district called the Jackson Heights Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. A smaller part of the original garden city neighborhood was placed in a New York City historic district of the same name in 1993.

Jackson Heights is in Queens Community District 3 and its ZIP Code is 11372. The zip code 11370 is co-named with East Elmhurst. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 115th Precinct. Politically, Jackson Heights is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 21st and 25th districts.

==History==

===Early history===
From colonial times to the 1900s, the area now known as Jackson Heights was a vast marsh named Trains Meadow. Urbanization at the turn of the century was creating a New York City housing shortage and urban sprawl. In 1909, Edward A. MacDougall&#x27;s Queensboro Corporation bought of undeveloped land and farms and christened them Jackson Heights after John C. Jackson, a descendant of one of the original Queens families and a respected Queens County entrepreneur.

Northern Boulevard, a main east–west road in the neighborhood, was also originally named Jackson Avenue; that name is retained in a short stretch in Long Island City. Though the land was not known for its elevation, after the land was filled to raise the terrain above the marshes of the Trains Meadow, Jackson Heights attained the highest elevation in the vicinity. The addition of the term &quot;Heights&quot; echoed the prestige of the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights and indicated that Jackson Heights was meant to be an exclusive neighborhood. At that time the area could most easily be reached by ferry from Manhattan or the Brooklyn Bridge. More direct access came with the Queensboro Bridge in 1909, This was followed by the elevated IRT Flushing Line—the present-day , just 20 minutes from Midtown Manhattan—in 1917, and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company double-decker coaches in 1922.

===Development===
Jackson Heights was conceived as a planned development for middle- to upper-middle-income workers looking to escape an overcrowded Manhattan. Inspired by Sir Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s garden city movement, it was laid out by Edward MacDougall&#x27;s Queensboro Corporation in 1916 and began attracting residents after the arrival of the Flushing Line in 1917. The Queensboro Corporation coined the name &quot;garden apartment&quot; to convey the concept of apartments built around private parks. Although land for churches was provided, the apartments were limited to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, excluding Jews, Blacks, and perhaps Greeks and Italians.

Several Jackson Heights buildings were built by the Queensboro Corporation as part of a planned community a few blocks from the Flushing Line between Northern Boulevard (then Jackson Avenue) and 37th Avenue, the main commercial corridor of the new development. Targeted at the middle class, these multi-story apartment buildings designed in the Colonial Revival and neo-Tudor styles were based on similar ones in Berlin. They were to share garden spaces, have ornate exteriors and features such as fireplaces, parquet floors, sun rooms, and built-in bathtubs with showers; and be cooperatively owned. In addition, the corporation divided the land into blocks and building lots, as well as installed streets, sidewalks, and power, water, and sewage lines.

The Laurel apartment building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard was the first of Jackson Heights&#x27;s Queensboro Corporation buildings, completed in 1914 with a small courtyard. The Greystones on either side of 80th Street between 37th and 35th avenues were completed in 1918 with a design by architect George H. Wells. Leftover unused space was converted to parks, gardens, and recreational areas, including a golf course; much of this space, including the golf course, no longer exists. This was followed by the 1919 construction of the Andrew J. Thomas–designed Linden Court, a 10-building complex between 84th Street, 85th Street, 37th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue. The two sets of five buildings, separated by a gated garden with linden trees and two pathways, included parking spaces with single-story garages accessed via narrow driveways, the first Jackson Heights development to do so; gaps at regular intervals in the perimeter wall; a layout that provided light and ventilation to the apartments and fostered a sense of belonging to a community; the area&#x27;s first co-op; and now-prevalent private gardens surrounded by the building blocks.

The Hampton Gardens, the Château, and the Towers followed in the 1920s. The Château and the Towers, both co-ops on 34th Avenue, had large, airy apartments and elevators. Until 1922, elevators were required to have attendants and more modest buildings were constructed as walk-ups not exceeding five floors. The elegant Château cooperative apartment complex, with 12 buildings surrounding a shared garden, was built in the French Renaissance style and has slate mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls. At first purely decorative, the shared gardens in later developments included paved spaces where people could meet or sit. The Queensboro Corporation started the Ivy Court, Cedar Court, and Spanish Gardens projects, all designed by Thomas, in 1924.

The Queensboro Corporation advertised their apartments from 1922 on. On August 28, 1922, the Queensboro Corporation paid $50 to radio station WEAF to broadcast a ten-minute sales pitch for apartments in Jackson Heights, in what may have been the first &quot;infomercial&quot;, opening with a few words about Nathaniel Hawthorne before promoting the corporation&#x27;s Nathaniel Hawthorne apartments. The ad wanted viewers to:

Built in 1928, the English Gables line 82nd Street, the main shopping area of Jackson Heights&#x27;s Hispanic community. There are two developments, English Gables I and II; they are meant to provide a gateway to the neighborhood for commercial traffic and for passengers from the 82nd Street–Jackson Heights station. A year later, the Robert Morris Apartments, on 37th Avenue between 79th and 80th streets, were constructed. Named after Robert Morris, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, the apartments have ample green spaces, original high ceilings, and fireplaces, and are relatively expensive.

During the Depression, two new buildings were built: Ravenna Court on 37th Avenue between 80th and 81st streets, built in 1929; and Georgian Court three blocks east, between 83rd and 84th streets, built in 1930. The Queensboro Corporation began to build on land that until then had been kept open for community use, including the tennis courts, community garden, and the former golf course—between 76th and 78th streets and 34th and 37th avenues—all of which were built upon during the 1940s and 1950s. The corporation also began erecting traditional six-story apartment buildings. Dunolly Gardens, the last garden apartment Thomas designed, was an exception, a modernistic group of six buildings completed in 1939. The corner windows, considered innovative in the 1930s, gave the apartments a more spacious feel, and the landscaped interior courtyard is one of the historic district&#x27;s largest. After the 1940s, Jackson Heights&#x27;s real estate was diversified, with more apartment buildings and cooperatives built with elevators; some new transportation infrastructure was also built.

In 1929, Holmes Airport opened in the northern section of Jackson Heights that is also considered part of East Elmhurst. Bordering St. Michaels Cemetery to the west, the airfield was also called the Grand Central Air Terminal and Grand Central Airport. Holmes Airport shut down in 1940, one year after LaGuardia Airport opened.

=== Social and demographic shifts ===
The neighborhood grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1950s, with construction slowing during the Depression and booming back again after World War II. Holmes Airport operated from 1929 to 1940 on adjacent to the community. Later, its land became veterans&#x27; housing and the Bulova watch factory site.

==== Ethnic tensions ====
By 1930, artists from the Manhattan theater district, many of whom were homosexual, had moved into the area, forming the beginnings of the second largest LGBTQ community in New York outside of Manhattan. Jews were allowed to move in by the 1940s. In the 1950s, middle-class businessmen from Colombia, escaping violence and repression in Latin America, brought their financial capital and their families to the community. Following the development of Long Island in the 1960s, Jackson Heights&#x27; white middle-class families began moving further out into the suburbs. At the same time the neighborhood experienced an influx of ethnically diverse professionals from Latin America and the Indian subcontinent taking advantage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which allowed them to arrange the immigration of their families. White residents&#x27; resistance to integration with African-Americans continued late into the decade, and Junction Boulevard came to be called the &quot;Mason-Dixon Line&quot;, as it divided Jackson Heights from the black communities in East Elmhurst and Corona.

==== Crime increases ====
By the mid-1970s, Roosevelt Avenue had become the neighborhood&#x27;s commercial center and also gained national attention as a place for organized crime. A 1993 &quot;New York Times&quot; article detailed how wire transfer services in Jackson Heights inadvertently enabled Colombian cartels to repatriate, and in the process launder, millions of dollars in drug money to South America alongside customers who used the service to transfer legally earned money. The violence that ensued as a result of the growing Jackson Heights illegal drug trade is described in this excerpt from a 1978 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article titled &quot;Gunfights in the Cocaine Corral&quot;:

By the late 1980s, Jackson Heights had rising real-estate values and a moderate amount of crime compared to other city neighborhoods. Nevertheless, there were still high-profile crimes that reinforced perceptions of the neighborhood as dangerous. In 1990, Julio Rivera, a gay Puerto Rican man, was murdered in a hate crime. His death galvanized the LGBTQ community into protesting his death with a candlelight vigil, the formation of several LGBTQ activist groups, and the foundation of the Queens Pride Parade. Two years later, journalist Manuel de Dios Unanue was murdered after authoring articles in &quot;El Diario La Prensa&quot; about the proliferation of Colombian cartels embedded within the business community along Roosevelt Avenue. Seeking to distance themselves from the portrayal of Jackson Heights as a crime-ridden neighborhood, some residents argued that de Dios had been murdered in Elmhurst, as the restaurant where he was attacked was on the south side of Roosevelt Avenue.

Following the reduction of crime in New York City during the late 1990s, the market for illicit substances that fed the Colombian cocaine industry in Jackson Heights eventually decreased, leading to a reduction in cartels in the neighborhood.

=== Revitalization and 21st century ===
Community leaders responded to negative perceptions of Jackson Heights by seeking to have the neighborhood designated a historic district. In 1988, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group was formed; it organized walking tours as well as beautification activities and commissioned a neighborhood history. Five years later, part of Jackson Heights was made a New York City historic district. The designation, which set architectural guidelines for structures within the designated district, affected both existing buildings and planned new developments within the district.

Starting in the 2000s, Jackson Heights has become once again a desirable destination for professionals and middle-class families. Some of these residents moved to Jackson Heights for the unique architecture of its buildings, while others move for its cultural diversity.

== Land use ==

===Historic district===

Most of the original neighborhood, comprising the garden city apartment buildings, was made a National Register Historic District and a New York State Historic Register District. The Jackson Heights New York State and National Register Districts range from 93rd Street through 69th Street between Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. Some property fronting on Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue, as well as some &quot;cut-outs&quot;, are not inside the Register Districts. The national historic district called the Jackson Heights Historic District, includes 2,203 contributing buildings, 19 contributing sites, and three contributing objects. Among the landmarked buildings, over 200 original Queensboro Corporation apartment buildings still exist in Jackson Heights. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

Almost 600 buildings in the neighborhood—a rectangle stretching roughly from 76th to 88th Streets and from Roosevelt Avenue almost up to Northern Boulevard—were designated as a New York City Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on October 19, 1993. It comprises large apartment buildings with private communal gardens, as well as many groupings of private homes and many stores on the streets surrounding Roosevelt Avenue. Unlike the State and National Districts, the local designation comes with aesthetic protections.

In addition to the Jackson Heights Historic District, the Lent Homestead and Cemetery and Jackson Heights post office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Business district ===
The main retail thoroughfare is 37th Avenue from 72nd Street to Junction Boulevard, with more retail on 73rd, 74th, and 82nd streets between 37th and Roosevelt avenues. Stores and restaurants on and near 74th Street tend to cater to the large population from the Indian subcontinent in the neighborhood, with sari and jewelry stores, Indian and Bengali music and movie retailers and many restaurants. 37th Avenue contains a wide mix of retailers, including many grocery stores, and 82nd Street contains many national chain stores located in Tudor-style buildings in the Jackson Heights Historic District. South American retailers and eateries, predominantly from Colombia and Peru dominate Northern Boulevard from 80th Street east to the border of neighboring Corona at Junction Boulevard. Roosevelt Avenue is also lined with various mainly Hispanic retail stores.

==== Street food ====

Along Roosevelt Avenue from 74th to 108th Streets, street food from all over the world is made and sold at food carts &quot;currently dominated by the Mexican community&quot;. Typical cart food includes Bengali fuchka (phuchka), Middle Eastern lamb over rice, Nepalese momo, Colombian chuzos and arepas, Greek souvlaki, Ecuadorian ceviche, Thai steamed chicken over rice, and Mexican elotes (corn on a cob), tacos, homemade tamales filled with meats, cheese, fruits or even chilies, fruit batidos or aguas frescas (smoothies), and South American sweet churros.

In a 2017 episode of his show &quot;Parts Unknown&quot;, American chef Anthony Bourdain visited several Queens eateries, profiling Evelia Coyotzi, who sells tamales in a street cart on Junction Boulevard, the border between Jackson Heights and Corona. Bourdain learned about Coyotzi, a Mexican immigrant who spoke no English, through the Street Vendor Project, which advocates for New York City street vendors.

==Culture==

Jackson Heights is among the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City and the nation. Half of the population was foreign-born by the 2000s. It is home to large numbers of South Americans (particularly Colombian, Ecuadorian and Argentinian) and South Asians (Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Tibetans, Nepalese, and Indians). Because of its large and vibrant Tibetan community, it has been called &quot;the second (if unofficial) capital of the exile Tibetan world, after Dharamsala, India.&quot; Most businesses are Asian- and Latino-owned, and there are restaurants, bakeries, specialty shops, legal offices, bars, and beauty salons. There is a Little India on 74th Street and a Little Pakistan and Little Bangladesh on 73rd Street. There is also a large concentration of South Americans east of 77th Street, especially a Little Colombia along 37th Avenue.

Jackson Heights was heavily Colombian during the 1980s, but other immigrant groups have settled in the area, notably Mexicans. Many of the displaced Colombians have moved to adjacent areas such as Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Corona, College Point and Flushing. Queens County still has the largest concentration of Colombians in the United States of any county (roughly 135,000).

The 2015 documentary &quot;In Jackson Heights&quot; portrays Jackson Heights as a microcosm of the American melting pot.

The word game Scrabble was co-invented by former architect Alfred Mosher Butts, who lived in Jackson Heights.

There is a year-round greenmarket every Sunday morning at Travers Park, as well as various family-oriented spring and summer concerts.

===LGBTQ community===
====Early history====
In the 1920s, LGBT actors working in the 42nd Street theater scene decided to make their homes in Jackson Heights due to the lack of affordability of Manhattan neighborhoods and the easy accessibility of the 7 train. That was the beginning of what is now the second largest gay community in New York City.

Until the 1990s, LGBT activities in Jackson Heights were usually held surreptitiously and at night due to a constant fear of backlash. As the neighborhood continued to grow, more spaces for the gay community were added. One of those was the Queens Center for Gay Seniors, which was created using grant money and is still the only senior center in Queens serving the LGBT community specifically.

====Murder of Julio Rivera====

The LGBT community became a movement after the 1990 murder of Julio Rivera, a 29-year-old bartender who worked at the Magic Touch gay bar. Rivera was raised in the Bronx, but tried to avoid the violence of the streets there, and moved to Jackson Heights as a young adult. On the night of July 2, three men cornered Rivera in a schoolyard that was known as a gay cruising area and beat him with a hammer and beer bottle, and then stabbed him. At the beginning of the case, the police department categorized the assault as drug-related, because Rivera had been a longtime cocaine user and they found traces of cocaine on his body. However, after Rivera&#x27;s friends and relatives advocated for the case to be examined further, the NYPD concluded that Rivera&#x27;s death had been an anti-gay crime, and the three men involved were charged with murder and manslaughter.

This was the first real standing for justice and honor for the LGBT community in Queens. The resulting activism led to the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a social services agency that helps monitor any type of criminal acts against the community citywide. Rivera&#x27;s sister-in-law was elected as the AVP for the LGBT board. Union helped improve the relationship between the Police Department and Jackson Heights&#x27;s LGBT community and helped with supervision against violence. In 2000, the corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue, where Rivera was killed, was renamed in his memory and a documentary, &quot;Julio of Jackson Heights&quot;, was made about his murder.

==== 1990s to present ====
Since the 1990s, the LGBTQ community in Jackson Heights has not only grown in number, but also expanded its diversity and cultures. The Inaugural Queens Lesbian and Gay Parade and Block Party Festival, organized by Daniel Dromm and Maritza Martinez, took place on June 6, 1993, in Jackson Heights, marking a watershed in LGBTQ history. Some 1,000 marchers participated, and thousands of spectators attended. More than a dozen LGBTQ organizations sponsored the event. In 1994 Dromm and activist Wayne Mahlke organized the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens, &quot;the only LGBT independent Democratic club in the Borough of Queens.&quot; That same year, the Queens Pride Parade commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. In 1995, Ed Sedarbaum established the SAGE/Queens Clubhouse, the first senior citizens program in Queens to provide outreach to LGBTQ elderly. In 1999, an estimated 40,000 people attend the Queens Pride Parade with some 70 community groups registered.

Daniel Dromm and Jimmy Van Bramer were elected to the New York City Council on November 3, 2009, representing, respectively, the 25th and 26th districts in Queens. Both City Council members are openly gay.

===== Incidents =====

In 2006, John L. McGhee was charged with Garzon&#x27;s murder.

On June 3, 2018, 25-year-old school teacher Brandon Soriano was attacked by two men following the 2018 Pride Parade in what has been deemed a hate crime. Five days later, a Latina transgender woman was allegedly stabbed repeatedly a few blocks away.

Prior to expansion, the P.S. 69 school yard offered baseball fields, a stickball field, a handball court and three tennis courts. Con Edison sponsored several summer tennis camps at P.S. 69&#x27;s school yard from 1982 to 1992. In 1998, P.S. 69 built an annex to compensate for the booming population of children in Jackson Heights and the public access to the school yard was removed. On November 30, 2011, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other city officials opened the 200th &quot;Schoolyard to Playground&quot; at P.S. 69 as a part of the PlaNYC initiative to ensure all New Yorkers live within a 10-minute walk of a park or playground; the program is turning schoolyards into playgrounds in neighborhoods across the city.

Originally serving the spiritual needs of European-American Protestant residents, it is now the most diverse church in Queens with Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and English services. Reverend Austin Armistead, who led the church from 1974 to 1995, is credited for the church&#x27;s racial and cultural change. Prior to his arrival in 1974, the suggestion of the Spanish-speaking service had been rejected. Armistead made the decision to remake the church, with a vision of mirroring the neighborhood and so divided the church into four different ministries; the church also came to serve as &quot;common ground&quot; for a range of community groups, from ethnic associations to LGBTQ organizations to nonprofits like the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.

<text>Onam () is an annual harvest and Hindu cultural festival celebrated mostly by the people of Kerala. A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state and includes a spectrum of cultural events.

== Hindu Mythology ==
Onam commemorates the return of the generous daitya king Mahabali after he was banished to the netherworld by Vamana (the fifth avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu). According to the Hindu legends, after Indra (the king of the devas) is defeated by Mahabali (the king of the asuras), the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana. The king Mahabali (himself a devotee of Vishnu) conducts ritual prayers, one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees, despite being told about Vamana&#x27;s divine nature by the sage Shukra. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld (Patala). However, witnessing Mahabali&#x27;s love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king&#x27;s sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year.

The date of Onam celebration is based on the &quot;Panchangam&quot;, and falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month &quot;Chingam&quot; of Malayalam calendar, which in Gregorian calendar falls between August–September.

== History ==

The festival has ancient origins and is intricately linked with Hindu mythology. Literary and epigraphical evidence suggests that Onam has a long religious context and history in Kerala and neighbouring parts of South India:
* The earliest known reference to the word Onam as a celebration is found in &quot;Maturaikkāñci&quot; – a Sangam era Tamil poem from the 3rd century CE. It mentions a festival called Onam being celebrated in dedication to Mayon (Vishnu) in Madurai, when games and duels were held in temple premises, oblations were sent to the temples, people wore new clothes and feasted.
* The 8th-century Alvar mystic saint Nammalvar mentions of &quot;the one who measured the three worlds&quot;, a parallel to the legend of Mahabali and Vamana.
* The 9th-century &quot;Pathikas&quot; and &quot;Pallads&quot; by Periyalvar describes Onam celebrations and offerings to Vishnu, mentions feasts and community events.
* An 11th-century inscription in the Thrikkakara Temple (Kochi) dedicated to Vamana – an avatar of Vishnu – mentions a series of offerings made by a votary over two days prior and on Thiru Onam.
* A 12th-century inscription in the Tiruvalla Temple, one of the largest Hindu temples in Kerala dedicated to Vishnu, mentions Onam and states a donation was made to the temple as the Onam festival offering.
* Uddanda Shastri, a southern Indian Sanskrit poet visiting the court of the Zamorin, has written about a festival called &quot;śrāvaṇa&quot;. It is presumed that this verse is about the festival of Onam as the word Onam (or Thiruvonam) is the Tamil/Malayalam form of the &quot;śrāvaṇa&quot; nakshatra mentioned in Indian astronomy:
चोकुयन्ते पृथुकततयश्चापतादिन्य उच्चैः सर्वानार्यःपतिभिरनिशम् लम्भयन्त्यर्थकामान्।

बभ्रम्यन्ते सकलपुरुषैर्वल्लभाभ्यः प्रदातुम् चित्रम् वस्त्रम् श्रावणकुतुकम् वर्तते केरळेषु॥

&quot;Gangs of lads, playing their bows hoot loudly again and again; All women make their husbands provide wealth and pleasure; All men are wandering hither and thither to present beautiful garments to their women. The festivity of &#x27;Sravana&#x27; takes place in Kerala&quot;.
* A 16th-century European memoir describes Onam. It mentions among other things that Onam is always celebrated in September, the Malayali people adorn their homes with flowers and daub them over with cow&#x27;s dung believing its auspicious association with goddess Lakshmi.

According to Kurup, Onam has been historically a Hindu temple-based community festival celebrated over a period of many days.

== Significance ==
Onam is an ancient Hindu festival of Kerala that celebrates rice harvest. The significance of the festival is in Indian culture, of which two are more common.

=== Mahabali and Vamana ===
According to Hindu mythology, Mahabali was the great-great-grandson of a Brahmin sage named Kashyapa, the great-grandson of a demonic dictator, Hiranyakashipu, and the grandson of Vishnu devotee Prahlada. This links the festival to the Puranic story of Prahlada of Holika fame in Hinduism, who was the son of Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada, despite being born to a demonic Asura father who hated Vishnu, rebelled against his father&#x27;s persecution of people and worshipped Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu tries to kill his son Prahlada, but is slain by Vishnu in his Narasimha avatar, Prahlada is saved.
Prahlada&#x27;s grandson, Mahabali, came to power by defeating the gods (Devas) and taking over the three worlds. According to Vaishnavism, the defeated Devas approached Vishnu for help in their battle with Mahabali. Vishnu refused to join the gods in violence against Mahabali because Mahabali was a good ruler and his own devotee. Mahabali, after his victory over the gods, declared that he would perform a &quot;Yajna&quot; (&quot;homa sacrifices/rituals&quot;) and grant anyone any request during the &quot;Yajna&quot;. Vishnu took the avatar – his fifth – of a dwarf monk called &quot;Vamana&quot; and approached Mahabali. The king offered anything to the boy – gold, cows, elephants, villages, food, whatever he wished. The boy said that one must not seek more than one needs, and all he needed was &quot;three paces of land.&quot; Mahabali agreed.

Vamana grew to an enormous size and covered everything Mahabali ruled over in just two paces. For the third pace, Mahabali offered his head for Vishnu to step on, an act that Vishnu accepted as evidence of Mahabali&#x27;s devotion. Vishnu granted him a boon, by which Mahabali could visit again, once every year, the lands and people he previously ruled. This revisit marks the festival of Onam, as a reminder of the virtuous rule and his humility in keeping his promise before Vishnu. The last day of Mahabali&#x27;s stay is remembered with a nine-course vegetarian Onasadya feast.

The name Thrikkakara is originated from &#x27;Thiru-kaal-kara&#x27; meaning &#x27;place of the holy foot&#x27;. The main deity at Thrikkakara Temple is Vamana, the smaller temple to the side has Shiva as the deity. Vamana temple is known as &#x27;Vadakkum Devar&#x27; and the Shiva temple is known as &#x27;Tekkum Devar&#x27;. A number of subsidiary deities have been installed at Thrikkakara Temple. The 1961 census report on Onam festival states:Though the Vamana temple is accepted as the main temple at the elite level, the local people consider the Shiva temple as the more important one. They believe that Shiva was the &#x27;Kuladeivam&#x27; (family deity) of Mahabali and that there was no Vamana temple at that time. The palace of Mahabali was situated at the place where the Vamana temple is at present. After the fall of Mahabali, his palace was destroyed and later on Vamana was installed on that spot by the saint Kapila.According to Nanditha Krishna, a simpler form of this legend, one without Mahabali, is found in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the Vedic text &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot; where a solar deity is described with powers of Vishnu. This story likely grew over time, and is in part allegorical, where &quot;Bali&quot; is a metaphor for thanksgiving offering after a bounty of rice harvest during monsoon, and &quot;Vishnu&quot; is the metaphor of the Kerala sun and summer that precedes the Onam. According to Roshen Dalal, the story of Mahabali is important to Onam in Kerala, but similar Mahabali legends are significant in the region of Balia and Bawan in Uttar Pradesh, Bharuch in Gujarat, and Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. The story is significant not because Mahabali&#x27;s rule ended, but it emphasises the Hindu belief in cyclical nature of events, that no individual, no ruler and nothing lasts forever, except the virtues and self-understanding that overcomes all sorrow.

=== Parashurama ===

An alternate tale behind Onam relates to Parashurama, an incarnation of Vishnu who is credited in Hinduism to have created the Western Ghats and Kerala. According to this legend, Vishnu observed the kings of the Kshatriya (warrior) waging constant war on one another and growing arrogant. He assumed the avatar of Parashurama, the warrior sage, in the era of the king Kartavirya Arjuna. This king persecuted and oppressed the people, the sages, and the gods. Following the murder of his father Jamadagni, Parashurama swore vengeance against the king and the warrior class, slaying them as he travelled the world. When all the oppressors had been vanquished, he threw his axe into the ocean. The ocean retreated from the region where the axe descended, creating the land of Kerala. The Onam festival, according to this legend, celebrates Parashurama&#x27;s creation of Kerala by marking those days as the new year.

The legend and worship of Parashurama is attested in texts and epigraphs dated to about the 2nd century CE.

=== Cultural festival ===
Onam is a &quot;popular major Hindu festival in Kerala&quot;, states Christine Frost, but one that is also celebrated by other communities with &quot;much zest alongside Hindus&quot;. The festival is celebrated in BECs (Basic Ecclesial communities) in Trivandrum with local rituals, according to Latin Catholic Bishop Selvister Ponnumuthan. These traditions, according to Selvister Ponnumuthan, start with the lighting of &quot;Nilavilakku&quot;, an &quot;arati&quot; that includes waving of flowers (&quot;pushparati&quot;) over the Bible, eating the Onam meal together with the Hindus as a form of &quot;communion of brothers and sisters of different faiths&quot;. The significance of these practices are viewed by BECs in Trivandrum as a form of integration with Hindus, mutual respect and sharing a tradition.

Paulinus of St. Bartholomew (1748–1806), in his &#x27;A voyage to the East Indies&#x27; describes Onam as :The fourth grand festival, celebrated in Malayala, is called Onam, and happens always in the month of September, on the day of new moon (not always). About the 10th of September the rain ceases in Malabar. All nature seems as if regenerated; the flowers again shoot up, and the trees bloom, in a word, this season is the same as that which Europeans call spring. This festival seems, therefore, to have been instituted for the purpose of soliciting from the Gods a happy and fruitful year. It continues eight days and during that time the Indians are accustomed to adorn their houses with flowers and daub them over with cow&#x27;s dung; because the cow, as already observed, is a sacred animal dedicated to the Goddess Lakshmi, the Ceres of the Indians. On this occasion they also put on new clothes throw aside all their old earthenware and supply its place by new. The men, particularly those who are young, form themselves into two parties and shoot at each other with arrows. These arrows are blunted, but exceedingly strong, and are discharged with such force, that a considerable number are generally wounded on both sides. These games have a great likeness to the Cerealia and Juvenalia of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
=== Onam and Islam ===

According to P.S. Salini, a research scholar in Islamic studies, most Muslims join the festivities with their friends and celebrate &quot;Hindu festivals such as Onam&quot;. According to a 2001 chapter by Filippo Osella and Caroline Osella, both Hindus and non-Hindus have celebrated Onam equally &quot;as a time when the unity of the family and kin group is particularly emphasized&quot;. In another 2008 paper, Osella and Osella states that &quot;Onam is not celebrated by Muslims&quot; and the Muslims who do prepare an Onam feast have an air of a &quot;daring secret&quot;.

Some Muslim Indian politicians light a traditional &quot;vilakku&quot; (oil lamp), while others have refused to light such a lamp at Onam events declaring it to be a Hindu tradition and against the teachings of Islam. Muslim daily newspapers and other publications have condemned Muslim ministers who participate in Onam traditions.

Various sections of Islam have raised concerns about the celebration of Onam by Muslims. However some Muslims observe Onam anyway, considering its celebrations and rituals as a cultural practice.

== Celebrations, rituals and practices ==

Onam falls in the month of &quot;Chingam&quot;, which is the first month according to the Malayalam Calendar. The celebrations mark the Malayalam New Year, are spread over ten days, and conclude with Thiruvonam. The ten days are sequentially known as Atham, Chithira, Chodhi, Vishakam, Anizham, Thriketa, Moolam, Pooradam, Uthradam and Thiruvonam. The first and the last day are particularly important in Kerala and to Malayalee communities elsewhere.

The Atham day is marked with the start of festivities at Thrikkakara Vamanamoorthy Temple, Kochi. This Vishnu temple is considered as the focal centre of Onam and the abode of Mahabali, with the raising of the festival flag. Parades are held, which are colourful and depict the elements of Kerala culture with floats and tableaux.

Other days have a diverse range of celebrations and activities ranging from boat races, cultural programs, sports competitions, dance events, martial arts, floral Rangoli – &quot;pookkalam&quot;, prayers, shopping, donating time or food for charity to spending time with family over feasts. Men and women wear traditional dress. The Kerala sari or Kasavu sari is particularly wore on this day.

=== &quot;Athachamayam&quot; ===
The Onam celebrations across the state starts off with a grand procession at Thrippunithura near Kochi called Atthachamayam, also referred to as &quot;Thripunithura Athachamayam&quot;. The parade features decorated elephants marching, drum beats and other music, folk art forms, floats and colourfully dressed people with masks. In Kerala&#x27;s history, the Kochi king used to head a grand military procession in full ceremonial robes from his palace to the Thrikkakara temple, meeting and greeting his people. In contemporary times, this a state-supported event.

The parade floats traditionally feature scenes from epics such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Additionally, some floats include themes from the &quot;Bible&quot; as well as current themes thereby highlighting unity and harmony.

The procession path historically has been from Tripunithura to the Vamanamoorthy Temple in Thrikkakara, Ernakulam district. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar. After arrival at the temple, the marchers offer a prayer.

=== &quot;Pookkalam&quot; (Flower Rangoli) ===

The floral Rangoli, known as &quot;Onapookkalam&quot;, &quot;Athapookkalam&quot; or just &quot;Pookkalam&quot;, is made out of the gathered blossoms with several varieties of flowers of differing tints pinched up into little pieces to design and decorate patterns on the floor, particularly at entrances and temple premises like a flower mat. Lamps are arranged in the middle or edges. It is a work of religious art, typically the team initiative of girls and women, who accomplish it with a delicate touch and a personal artistic sense of tone and blending. When completed, a miniature pandal (umbrella) hung with little festoons is erected over it. The pookkalam is similar to Rangoli which is made of powders of various colours and is popular in North India.

The traditional ritual of laying pookkalam (floral Rangoli) starts on Atham day. The pookkalam on this day is called Athapoo, and it is relatively small in size. The size of the pookkalam grows in size progressively with each day of the Onam festival. Only yellow flowers will be used on Atham with only one circular layer made and the design is kept simple. Statues or figurines of Mahabali and Vamana are also installed at the entrance of each house on this day.

Traditionally, Atthapookalams included flowers endemic to Kerala and the Dashapushpam (10-flowers), but nowadays all varieties of flowers are used. Earthen mounds, which look somewhat like square pyramids, representing Mahabali and Vamana are placed in the dung-plastered courtyards in front of the house along with the Pookalam, and beautifully decorated with flowers. All over Kerala, &quot;Pookalam&quot; competitions are a common sight on Onam day.

=== Music and dance ===
Traditional dance forms including &quot;Thiruvathira&quot;, &quot;Kummattikali&quot;, &quot;Pulikali&quot;, &quot;Thumbi Thullal&quot;, &quot;Onam Kali&quot; and others. Thiruvathira Kali is a women&#x27;s dance performed in a circle around a lamp. Kummattikali is a colourful-mask dance. In Thrissur, festivities include a procession consisting of caparisoned elephants surrounded by Kummatikali dancers. The masked dancers go from house to house performing the colourful Kummattikali. Onam Kali is a form of dance where players arrange themselves in circles around a pole or tree or lamp, then dance and sing songs derived from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and other epics.
Kathakali dance is also commonly performed during this time, with dancers enacting characters from the various Ancient Indian legends. A famous venue for this is at Valluvanad which is associated with the growth of Kathakali, and Cheruthuruthy, where Kerala Kalamandalam is located.

=== &quot;Pulikali&quot;: tiger dance ===

Pulikali, also known as Kaduvakali is a common sight during the Onam season. This dance showcases performers painted like tigers in bright yellow, red and black, who dance to the beats of instruments like Chenda and Thakil. This folk art is mainly performed in the cultural district of Thrissur and thousands pour into the city to be a part of this art.

Performances of the ritual worship dance, Theyyam, are given during the Onam season. In this, Mahabali is played by the Onathar. Its variations include characters such as &quot;Oneswaran&quot; and &quot;Onapottan&quot;.

At the Thrikkakara temple, every day of the festival showcases one or more of these activities including Kathakali, Thiruvathira, Chakyar Koothu, Ottam Thullal, Patakam, Onam songs, and percussion instrument shows. The Onasadya here is grand in scale, and is attended by over ten thousand people from all religions and faiths. Festivities include Puli Kali (masked leopard dance) and traditional dance forms like Kaikotti Kali which are performed in various functions. The official Government celebrations start on this day with heavy illuminations in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode along with fireworks.

Most cities in Kerala, such as the political, commercial and cultural capitals, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Thrissur, are lit up with lights and fabulous displays of fireworks. Sumptuous Onam Sadya feasts are prepared. In Thrikkakara temple, a mega-feast is conducted, which is open to the public and is attended by more than twenty thousand people.

=== &quot;Vallamkali&quot;: boat race ===

The &quot;Vallamkali&quot; (the snake boat race) is another event that is synonymous with Onam. Well-known races include the Aranmula Uthrattadhi Boat Race and the Nehru Trophy Boat Race. Numerous oarsmen row huge snake-shaped boats. Men and women come from far and near to watch and cheer the snake boat race through the water. This event is particularly featured on the Pampa River, considered sacred and Kerala equivalent of Ganges River.

As a tribute to the traditional snake boat race, a similar snake boat race is also held by the Malayali diaspora in Singapore annually during Onam at the Jurong Lake.

=== &quot;Onam Sadya&quot; ===

The &quot;Onam sadya&quot; (feast) is another indispensable part of Onam, and almost every Keralite either makes or attends one. The Onasadya reflects the spirit of the season and is traditionally made with seasonal vegetables such as yam, cucumber, ash gourd and so on. The feast is served on plantain leaves and consists of nine courses, but may include over two dozen dishes, including (but not limited to): Chips (especially Banana chips), Sharkaraveratti (Fried pieces of banana coated with jaggery), Pappadam, various vegetable and soups such as Injipuli (also called PuliInji), Thoran, Mezhukkupuratti, Kaalan, Olan, Avial, Sambhar, Dal served along with a small quantity of ghee, Erisheri, Molosyam, Rasam, Puliseri (also referred to as Velutha curry), Kichadi (not to be confused with Khichdi) and Pachadi (its sweet variant), Moru (buttermilk or curd mixed with water), Pickles both sweet and sour, and coconut chutney. The feast ends with a series of dessert called Payasam (a sweet dish made of milk, sugar, jaggery, and other traditional Indian savouries) eaten either straight or mixed with ripe small plantain. The curries are served with rice, usually the &#x27;Kerala Matta&#x27; parboiled rice preferred in Kerala.

In hotels and temples, the number of curries and dishes may go up to 30. The importance of the feast to Kerala&#x27;s Onam celebration culture is captured in the famous Malayalam proverb &quot;Kaanam Vittum Onam Unnanam&quot; which means &quot;One must have the Onam lunch even by selling one&#x27;s property if need be.&quot; The Travancore-style Onasadya is renowned to be the most disciplined and tradition-bound.

The Kurichians tribe of Parambikkulam celebrate Onam as a festival for eating new grains. Just before Onam, they go for a community hunt and the game bagged during the hunt are distributed among participants and consumed in family feasts. The feasts are held on Uthradam and Thiruvonam. Their feast also include fish and meat.

=== Post Onam celebrations ===
Normally, the largest chunk of Onam celebrations ends by Thiruvonam. However, the two days following Thiruvonam are also celebrated as Third and Fourth Onam. The third Onam, called Avvittom marks the preparations for King Mahabali&#x27;s return ascension to heavens. The main ritual of the day is to take the Onathappan statue which was placed in the middle of every Pookkalam during the past 10 days and immerse it in nearby rivers or sea. The Pookkalam will be cleaned and removed after this ritual.

=== Other customs ===

People buy and wear new clothes for the occasion of Onam, called &quot;Onakkodi&quot;.

During the Onam, Keralite Hindus install an image of Thrikkakara Appan or &quot;Onatthappan&quot; (Vishnu in the form of Vamana) in their home just as Hindus install images or murtis of Lord Ganesha on the Ganesha Chaturthi festival elsewhere.

Many lamps are lit in Hindu temples of Kerala during this celebration. A palmyra tree is erected in front of temples and surrounded by a wooden balustrade and covered with dry palmyra leaves. It is lit with a torch and burned to ashes to signify that King Mahabali went to Patala as a sacrifice.

The swing is another integral part of Onam, especially in rural areas. Young men and women, decked in their best, sing &quot;Onappaatt&quot;, or Onam songs, and rock one another on swings slung from high branches.

Onam season is often associated with creativity as weavers and potters go for excess production to cater to increased demands for their products during the season, especially in the North Kerala regions of Kannur and Kasargod. Handloom fairs are an integral part of the spirit of Onam festivities these days.

In some parts of Kerala, people indulge in various games and dances during and post-Thiruvonam. These are known as Onakkalikal. These include competitions such as Ox races (Maramadimatsaram), Uriyady, food-eating competitions, Pookalam competitions etc.in a special month.

Kuravans of Travancore use Onam as a day for offering thanks to their ancestral spirits. On Uthradam day, they offer liquor, rice cakes, flattened and parched rice, incense, camphor, etc. to the spirits. The ritual ends with a request to the spirits to be satisfied with their offerings and assured that the next attempt would be better. Then an appeal is made to protect the believers and to ward off evil spirits from their area. This ritual is locally known as kalayam vaikkal. A similar offering like this is done during Makaram harvest, known as Uchara.

== Outside India ==

Onam is also celebrated by the worldwide Malayali diaspora. Celebrations are notable in Oman, Malaysia, Switzerland, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and France (notably Paris and Marseille).
