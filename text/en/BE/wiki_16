<text>The provinces of the Colony of New Zealand existed as a form of sub-national government. Initially established in 1846 when New Zealand was a Crown colony without responsible government, two provinces (New Ulster and New Munster) were first created. Each province had its own legislative council and governor. With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 the provinces were recreated around the six planned settlements or &quot;colonies&quot;. By 1873 the number of provinces had increased to nine, but they had become less isolated from each other and demands for centralised government arose. In 1875 the New Zealand Parliament decided to abolish the provincial governments, and they came to an end in November 1876. They were superseded by counties, which were later replaced by territorial authorities.

Following abolition, the provinces became known as provincial districts. Their principal legacy is the use of some provincial boundaries to determine the geographical boundaries for anniversary day public holidays.

== Crown Colony: 1841–1853 ==

Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, New Zealand became a British colony, initially as part of New South Wales.

The Royal Charter of November 1840 stated that the islands of New Zealand were &quot;designated and known respectively&quot; as:
* New Ulster (the North Island)
* New Munster (the South Island)
* New Leinster (Stewart Island / Rakiura)
These names were of geographic significance only. New Zealand became a separate Crown Colony from New South Wales in May 1841.

In 1846 the British Parliament passed the first New Zealand Constitution Act, which allowed for the establishment of provinces. Governor George Grey arrived in New Zealand in November 1845, and upon reading the new Constitution Act in May 1847 argued for its suspension in dispatches to the Colonial Office. Before this occurred, Grey proclaimed the provincial boundaries on 10 March 1848:

* New Ulster (the North Island, north of the Patea River mouth)
* New Munster (the North Island south of the Patea River mouth, the South Island and Stewart Island / Rakiura)

Each province had a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-in-Chief.

The 1846 Constitution Act was suspended in early 1848, with the only operative provisions relating to the reform of the provinces. News of the suspension did not reach New Zealand until 23 March 1848, when the immigrant ship John Wickliffe arrived in Port Chalmers to begin European settlement of Otago.

In addition, the provinces were separated from the central government for the first time.

New Ulster and New Munster had their own seals.

== Responsible Government: 1853–1876 ==

New provinces were formed by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. This Act established a quasi-federal system of government and divided the country into the six provinces of Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago. Each province elected its own legislature known as a provincial council, and elected a superintendent who was not a member of the council. The councils elected their speaker at their first meeting after elections.

The Act also created a national General Assembly consisting of the Legislative Council (appointed by the governor) and the directly elected House of Representatives. These provinces came into effect on 17 January 1853 and the regulations defining the boundaries of the provinces were gazetted on 28 February. Electoral regulations were gazetted on 5 March. As with general elections, elections were open to males 21 years or older who owned freehold property worth £50 a year. The first provincial elections were held at the same time as the 1853 general elections. While Governor George Grey had issued the writs for the provincial and general elections at the same time, the provincial councils met before the general assembly met, in May 1854.

The New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1857 provided for the appointment of a deputy superintendent.

=== New Provinces Act 1858 ===
The Constitution Act provided for the creation of additional provinces, and when the spread of European settlements between the original centres of the provincial governments and the outlying settlers grew, the General Assembly passed the New Provinces Act 1858.
This Act allowed any district of between 500 thousand and 3 million acres of land with a European population of no fewer than 1,000 people to petition for separation provided that at least 60% of electors agreed. As a result, Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province separated from Wellington on 1 November 1858; Marlborough Province from Nelson on 1 November 1859; and Southland Province from Otago on 1 April 1861. New Plymouth also changed its name to Taranaki under the same Act.

Stewart Island / Rakiura, which had since 1853 not been part of any province, was annexed to the province of Southland on 10 November 1863.

Provinces established under this act elected their superintendents in a different way. Members of the provincial council would elect a suitable person listed on the electoral roll as superintendent by a majority. If such a person was an elected member, this would result in a by-election to fill the vacancy.

=== Abolition of Provinces Act 1875 === 

New Zealand&#x27;s provinces were the subject of protracted political debate almost as soon as they were founded. Two factions emerged in the General Assembly: &quot;Centralists&quot;, favouring a strong central government, and &quot;Provincialists&quot;, favouring strong regional governments. The Centralist members of the General Assembly regarded the provinces as inherently self-interested, and prone to pork-barrel politics. In the construction of railways, for example, three of the provinces had constructed railways (as was the case in Australia) to different track gauges, with Canterbury Provincial Railways being built to &quot;broad&quot; gauge, and Southland&#x27;s railways being built to &quot;standard&quot; gauge. As a result, the Public Works Act of 1870 standardised the gauge to be used, and Otago&#x27;s first railway, the Port Chalmers railway, was built to the new &quot;standard&quot; narrow gauge. Colonial Treasurer (and later Premier) Julius Vogel launched his Great Public Works policy of immigration and public works schemes of the 1870s, borrowing the massive sum of 10 million pounds, to develop significant infrastructure of roads, railways, and communications, all administered by the central government. This diminished the power of the provinces greatly. The provinces were finally abolished by the Abolition of Provinces Act 1875, during the Premiership of Harry Atkinson. The Act came into force on 1 November 1876, but the superintendents stayed in office until the replacement county councils took office on 1 January 1877.

== Replacement ==

Upon abolition, the provinces took the legal status of provincial districts that had no administrative functions. Local government was vested in elected borough and county councils. The Counties Bill of 1876 created 63 counties out of the provinces. In 1989 the counties were replaced by enlarged district councils.

The boundaries of the former provinces served as administrative areas for education boards set up under the Education Act of 1877 and for the offices of several Government departments, including the Department of Lands and Survey. Various responsibilities were delegated to boards. For example, the Education Act 1877 created the &quot;Education Boards&quot; for Auckland, Hamilton, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki, Wanganui, Wellington, Nelson, Westland, Southland, Canterbury and Otago districts. The Department of Lands and Survey split the country into the &quot;Land Districts&quot; of Auckland (North), Auckland (South), Hawkes Bay, Gisborne, Taranaki, Wellington, Canterbury, Marlborough, Nelson, Westland, Otago and Southland.

The New Zealand Rugby Union was formed in 1892 with foundation members principally being provinces: Auckland†, Hawke&#x27;s Bay†, Taranaki†, Manawatu, Wanganui, Wairarapa, Wellington†, Nelson†, Marlborough† and South Canterbury. At the time, three major South Island Provincial Unions – Canterbury†, Otago† and Southland† – resisted the central authority of the NZRU.

== Modern uses of the old names ==

Some current &quot;Provincial Anniversary Days&quot; are still public holidays in New Zealand: Auckland†, Taranaki†, Hawkes&#x27; Bay†, Wellington†, Marlborough†, Nelson†, Canterbury†, Canterbury (South), Westland†, Otago†, Southland† and Chatham Islands.

The provincial districts had &quot;different&quot; boundaries from the present day regions, for example, the Manawatū-Whanganui region is largely in the Wellington provincial district. The districts are represented by teams in rugby union&#x27;s ITM Cup and Heartland Championship, both of which replaced the National Provincial Championship in 2006, although the term &quot;provincial&quot; is still used in connection with rugby for the present 29 unions whether founded in the 1880s (e.g. Otago) or 2006 (Tasman).

Some of the names persist in other contexts as well, such as health administration districts: Northland,
Waitemata,
Auckland†,
Counties Manukau,
Waikato,
Bay of Plenty,
Lakes (Rotorua/Taupo),
Hawke&#x27;s Bay†,
MidCentral (Manawatu),
Tairawhiti (Gisborne),
Taranaki,
Whanganui,
Wairarapa,
Hutt Valley,
Capital and Coast (Wellington)†,
Nelson (Marlborough)†,
West Coast†,
Canterbury†,
South Canterbury and
Southern (Otago)†.

Some of the names of former provinces and current regions have a tendency to be preceded by &quot;the&quot;. Thus, for example, we have &quot;Auckland&quot;, &quot;Canterbury&quot;, &quot;Hawke&#x27;s Bay&quot;, &quot;Marlborough&quot; and &quot;Wellington&quot;, but &quot;the Waikato&quot;, &quot;the Manawatu&quot;, &quot;the Bay of Plenty&quot;, and &quot;the West Coast&quot;.

The current regions of New Zealand and most of their councils came about in 1989: 
Northland, 
Auckland†, 
Waikato, 
Bay of Plenty, 
Gisborne, 
Hawke&#x27;s Bay†, 
Taranaki†, 
Manawatu-Whanganui, 
Wellington†, 
Tasman, 
Nelson†, 
Marlborough†, 
West Coast†, 
Canterbury†, 
Otago† and 
Southland†.

Another usage of words associated with the former provinces often refers to anything rural, e.g. one may refer to a town as rather than rural or use the phrase &#x27;out in the provinces,&#x27; in order to refer to the countryside. These terms can often be heard on national television networks, particularly on weather broadcasts.

† indicates a former province.

<doc id="275025" wikidata="Q1517543" url="?curid=275025" title="The Wee Free Men">
<text>The Wee Free Men is a 2003 comic fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, which takes place in his Discworld setting. It is labelled a &quot;Story of Discworld&quot; to indicate its status as children&#x27;s or young adult fiction, unlike most of the books in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. A sequel, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, appeared in 2004 (both books were republished in a combined edition, &quot;The Wee Free Men: The Beginning&quot;, in August 2010); a third book called &quot;Wintersmith&quot; appeared in 2006; and the fourth, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, was released in September 2010. The final book in the series, &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, was released in 2015.

While Terry Pratchett&#x27;s first &quot;Discworld&quot; book for children, &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot; had swearing translated to rat language, in this book it is in the dialect of the Nac Mac Feegle which is taken from Scots and Scottish Gaelic.

An illustrated edition of the novel, with pictures by Stephen Player, appeared in print on 2 October 2008.

==Plot summary==
Tiffany Aching is a 9-year-old girl who literally sees things differently from others. While playing by the river near her home, she sees two tiny blue, kilted men who warn her of a &quot;green heid&quot; in the water. Suddenly a vile green monster, Jenny Greenteeth, appears in the water. Using her brother Wentworth as bait, Tiffany ambushes the beast and cracks it with a frying pan, while Wentworth is completely unfazed, as he is unable to see either the little men or the monster. She goes into town to visit a travelling teacher and comes upon Miss Tick, a witch who has been watching her. Tiffany is told that these little men are the Nac Mac Feegles, who are rough and rowdy fae folk who speak in Scots. Miss Tick informs her that she is likely the witch of the wold she resides in, and gives her the toad familiar she carries as a guide before tricking Tiffany out of the tent and disappearing.

Tiffany returns home to discover that the Nac Mac Feegles are not only incredibly fast and strong, but afraid of her, as she catches them stealing eggs from under a chicken and a sheep right out of the field. When Wentworth is kidnapped by the Queen of the Fairies, Tiffany seeks out the help of the Nac Mac Feegles to rescue him, as they are the most powerful otherworldly things she knows and they&#x27;re more than willing to submit to her will, terrified by one who is not only a witch but one who can read and write. Rob Anybody, and a group of other Feegles including Big Yan and Daft Wullie take her back to their home where she meets the buzzard-aviator Hamish, the bard-Feegle William, and their clan leader the Kelda. Tiffany is told that her brother has been taken by the Queen to her domain in Fairyland, and not only must she take the Feegles to go rescue him, but she must also take up the reins as Kelda, as the current one is about to die. After worming her way out of marrying Rob Anybody, Tiffany goes out of the mound to the field where the Feegles test her First Sight and Second Thoughts by letting her find the entrance to the queen&#x27;s domain.

Once in, Tiffany and the Feegles face several large wolves who the Feegles handily clobber, and several dream-causing blob-people called dromes. Going through drome-caused dreams, she finds Roland, the son of the Baron of her homeland. Tiffany and Roland go through several dreams and the normal dreamscape to eventually find a dream with both Wentworth and the Queen in it. Tiffany narrowly escapes defeat at the hands of the Queen&#x27;s dream-minions by having Roland release the Feegles from their trapping in a large walnut, and they escape from that dream into one of Tiffany&#x27;s imagining. Once in that dream, the Feegles and Wentworth are presumed to have perished at the hands of the Queen&#x27;s trickery, and Tiffany escapes with Roland&#x27;s unconscious body out back into the dreamscape, heading for the exit, full of regret that she could not save her friends. The Queen mocks her inability to save them and her insecurities, but Tiffany reconnects with her homeland&#x27;s heritage to gain the strength to defeat the Queen at her own game of dreams in the darkest hour. The Feegles who she later meets back up with reveal that the trap the Queen had set was not nearly enough to stop the Feegles, and that they and Wentworth are both fine. Tiffany, Roland, Wentworth and the Feegles all return to their homeland, where the Baron mistakenly gives his son all of the credit for saving them, which Tiffany ends up being okay with.

Another large influence on the narrative of the story and development of Tiffany&#x27;s character is her Granny Aching, a hard working, silent, and knowledgeable shepherd. She was the book&#x27;s definition of a witch. Stories and memories of her are mentioned here and there in the book, and her memory helps Tiffany defeat the Queen at the end.

==Film==
In January 2006, reports emerged that director Sam Raimi had signed up to make a movie based on this novel with a script by Pamela Pettler, the writer of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;. Sony Pictures Entertainment had recently acquired the rights to the book. In a June 2008 interview, Pratchett said &quot;I saw a script that I frankly thought was awful. It seemed to be &quot;Wee Free Men&quot; in name only. It had all the hallmarks of something that had been good, and then the studio had got involved. It probably won&#x27;t get made.&quot; In December 2009, Pratchett said that he had &quot;got back &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;&quot;.

In 2013, Terry Pratchett&#x27;s daughter Rhianna Pratchett announced that she would be adapting &quot;Wee Free Men&quot; into a film. In 2016 it was confirmed that the film will be developed in association with The Jim Henson Company.

==Reception ==
&quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; was listed in &quot;TIME&#x27;s&quot; &quot;THE 100 BEST FANTASY BOOKS OF ALL TIME&quot;, the only novel by Pratchett alone to make that list (his other entry being &quot;Good Omens&quot;, a collaboration with Neil Gaiman).

<text>Robert Rosen (June 27, 1934 – December 28, 1998) was an American theoretical biologist and Professor of Biophysics at Dalhousie University.

==Career==
Rosen was born on June 27, 1934, in Brownsville (a section of Brooklyn), in New York City. He studied biology, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and history; particularly, the history of science. In 1959 he obtained a PhD in relational biology, a specialization within the broader field of Mathematical Biology, under the guidance of Professor Nicolas Rashevsky at the University of Chicago. He remained at the University of Chicago until 1964, later moving to the University of Buffalo — now part of the State University of New York (SUNY) — at Buffalo on a full associate professorship, while holding a joint appointment at the Center for Theoretical Biology.

His year-long sabbatical in 1970 as a visiting fellow at Robert Hutchins&#x27; Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, California was seminal, leading to the conception and development of what he later called Anticipatory Systems Theory, itself a corollary of his larger theoretical work on relational complexity. In 1975, he left SUNY at Buffalo and accepted a position at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a Killam Research Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, where he remained until he took early retirement in 1994. He is survived by his wife, a daughter, Judith Rosen, and two sons.

He served as president of the Society for General Systems Research, now known as the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS), in 1980-81.

== Research ==
Rosen&#x27;s research was concerned with the most fundamental aspects of biology, specifically the questions &quot;What is life?&quot; and &quot;Why are living organisms alive?&quot;. A few of the major themes in his work were:
* developing a specific definition of complexity based on category theoretic models of autonomous living organisms
* developing Complex Systems Biology from the point of view of Relational Biology as well as Quantum Genetics
* developing a rigorous theoretical foundation for living organisms as &quot;anticipatory systems&quot;

Rosen believed that the contemporary model of physics - which he showed to be based on a Cartesian and Newtonian formalism suitable for describing a world of mechanisms - was inadequate to explain or describe the behavior of biological systems. Rosen argued that the fundamental question &quot;What is life?&quot; cannot be adequately addressed from within a scientific foundation that is reductionistic. Approaching organisms with reductionistic scientific methods and practices sacrifices the functional organization of living systems in order to study the parts. The whole, according to Rosen, could not be recaptured once the biological organization had been destroyed. By proposing a sound theoretical foundation for studying biological organisation, Rosen held that, rather than biology being a mere subset of the already known physics, it might turn out to provide profound lessons for physics, and also for science in general.

Rosen&#x27;s work combines sophisticated mathematics with potentially radical new views on the nature of living systems and science. He has been called &quot;biology&#x27;s Newton.&quot; Drawing on set theory, his work has also been considered controversial, raising concerns that some of the mathematical methods he used could lack adequate proof. Rosen&#x27;s posthumous work &quot;Essays on Life Itself&quot; (2000) as well as recent monographs by Rosen&#x27;s student Aloisius Louie have clarified and explained the mathematical content of Rosen&#x27;s work.

=== Relational biology ===
Rosen&#x27;s work proposed a methodology which needs to be developed in addition to the current reductionistic approaches to science by molecular biologists. He called this methodology &quot;Relational Biology&quot;. &quot;Relational&quot; is a term he correctly attributes to his mentor Nicolas Rashevsky, who published several papers on the importance of set-theoretical relations in biology prior to Rosen&#x27;s first reports on this subject. Rosen&#x27;s relational approach to Biology is an extension and amplification of Nicolas Rashevsky&#x27;s treatment of &quot;n&quot;-ary relations in, and among, organismic sets that he developed over two decades as a representation of both biological and social &quot;organisms&quot;.

Rosen&#x27;s relational biology maintains that organisms, and indeed all systems, have a distinct quality called &quot;organization&quot; which is not part of the language of reductionism, as for example in molecular biology, although it is increasingly employed in systems biology. It has to do with more than purely structural or material aspects. For example, organization includes all relations between material parts, relations between the effects of interactions of the material parts, and relations with time and environment, to name a few. Many people sum up this aspect of complex systems by saying that &quot;the whole is more than the sum of the parts&quot;. Relations between parts and between the effects of interactions must be considered as additional &#x27;relational&#x27; parts, in some sense.

Rosen said that organization must be independent from the material particles which seemingly constitute a living system. As he put it:
Rosen&#x27;s abstract relational biology approach focuses on a definition of living organisms, and all complex systems, in terms of their internal &quot;organization&quot; as open systems that cannot be reduced to their interacting components because of the multiple relations between metabolic, replication and repair components that govern the organism&#x27;s complex biodynamics.

He deliberately chose the `simplest&#x27; graphs and categories for his representations of Metabolism-Repair Systems in small categories of sets endowed only with the discrete &quot;efficient&quot; topology of sets, envisaging this choice as the most general and less restrictive. It turns out however that the efficient entailments of formula_1systems are &quot;closed to efficient cause&quot;, or in simple terms the catalysts (&quot;efficient causes&quot; of metabolism, usually identified as enzymes) are themselves products of metabolism, and thus may not be considered, in a strict mathematical sense, as subcategories of the category of sequential machines or automata: in direct contradiction of the French philosopher Descartes&#x27; supposition that all animals are only elaborate machines or &quot;mechanisms&quot;. Rosen stated: &quot;&quot;I argue that the only resolution to such problems&quot; [of the subject-object boundary and what constitutes objectivity] &quot;is in the recognition that closed loops of causation are &#x27;objective&#x27;; i.e. legitimate objects of scientific scrutiny. These are explicitly forbidden in any machine or mechanism.&quot;&quot; Rosen&#x27;s demonstration of &quot;efficient closure&quot; was to present this clear paradox in mechanistic science, that on the one hand organisms are defined by such causal closures and on the other hand mechanism forbids them; thus we need to revise our understanding of nature. The mechanistic view prevails even today in most of general biology, and most of science, although some claim no longer in sociology and psychology where reductionist approaches have failed and fallen out of favour since the early 1970s. However those fields have yet to reach consensus on what the new view should be, as is also the case in most other disciplines, which struggle to retain various aspects of &quot;the machine metaphor&quot; for living and complex systems.

=== Complexity and complex scientific models: (&quot;M,R&quot;) systems ===

The clarification of the distinction between simple and complex scientific models became in later years a major goal of Rosen&#x27;s published reports. Rosen maintained that modeling is at the very essence of science and thought. His book &quot;Anticipatory Systems&quot; describes, in detail, what he termed the &quot;modeling relation&quot;. He showed the deep differences between a true modeling relation and a simulation, the latter not based on such a modeling relation.

In mathematical biology he is known as the originator of a class of relational models of living organisms, called formula_1 systems, that he devised to capture the minimal capabilities that a material system would need in order to be one of the simplest &quot;functional organisms&quot; that are commonly said to be &quot;alive&quot;. In this kind of system, formula_3 stands for the metabolic and formula_4 stands for the &#x27;repair&#x27; subsystems of a simple organism, for example active &#x27;repair&#x27; RNA molecules. Thus, his mode for determining or &quot;defining&quot; life in any given system is a functional, not material, mode; although he did consider in his 1970s published reports specific &quot;dynamic realizations&quot; of the simplest formula_1systems in terms of enzymes (formula_3), RNA (formula_4), and functional, duplicating DNA (his formula_8-mapping).

He went, however, even further in this direction by claiming that when studying a complex system, one &quot;can throw away the matter and study the organization&quot; to learn those things that are essential to defining in general an entire class of systems. This has been, however, taken too literally by a few of his former students who have not completely assimilated Robert Rosen&#x27;s injunction of the need for a theory of &quot;dynamic realizations&quot; of such abstract components in specific molecular form in order to close the modeling loop for the simplest functional organisms (such as, for example, single-cell algae or microorganisms). He supported this claim (that he actually attributed to Nicolas Rashevsky) based on the fact that living organisms are a class of systems with an extremely wide range of material &quot;ingredients&quot;, different structures, different habitats, different modes of living and reproduction, and yet we are somehow able to recognize them all as &quot;living&quot;, or functional organisms, without being however &quot;vitalists&quot;.

His approach, just like Rashevsky&#x27;s latest theories of organismic sets, emphasizes biological organization over molecular structure in an attempt to bypass the &quot;structure-functionality relationships&quot; that are important to all experimental biologists, including physiologists. In contrast, a study of the specific material details of any given organism, or even of a type of organisms, will only tell us about how that type of organism &quot;does it&quot;. Such a study doesn&#x27;t approach what is common to all functional organisms, i.e. &quot;life&quot;. Relational approaches to theoretical biology would therefore allow us to study organisms in ways that preserve those essential qualities that we are trying to learn about, and that are common only to &quot;functional&quot; organisms.

Robert Rosen&#x27;s approach belongs conceptually to what is now known as Functional Biology, as well as Complex Systems Biology, &quot;albeit&quot; in a highly abstract, mathematical form.

=== Quantum Biochemistry and Quantum Genetics ===

Rosen also questioned what he believed to be many aspects of mainstream interpretations of biochemistry and genetics. He objects to the idea that functional aspects in biological systems can be investigated via a material focus. One example: Rosen disputes that the functional capability of a biologically active protein can be investigated purely using the genetically encoded sequence of amino acids. This is because, he said, a protein must undergo a process of folding to attain its characteristic three-dimensional shape before it can become functionally active in the system. Yet, only the amino acid sequence is genetically coded. The mechanisms by which proteins fold are not completely known. He concluded, based on examples such as this, that phenotype cannot always be directly attributed to genotype and that the chemically active aspect of a biologically active protein relies on more than the sequence of amino acids, from which it was constructed: there must be some other important factors at work, that he did not however attempt to specify or pin down.

Certain questions about Rosen&#x27;s mathematical arguments were raised in a paper authored by Christopher Landauer and Kirstie L. Bellman which claimed that some of the mathematical formulations used by Rosen are problematic from a logical viewpoint. It is perhaps worth noting, however, that such issues were also raised long time ago by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their famous &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; in relation to antinomies of set theory. As Rosen&#x27;s mathematical formulation in his earlier papers was also based on set theory and the category of sets such issues have naturally re-surfaced. However, these issues have now been addressed by Robert Rosen in his recent book &quot;Essays on Life Itself&quot;, published posthumously in 2000. Furthermore, such basic problems of mathematical formulations of formula_1--systems had already been resolved by other authors as early as 1973 by utilizing the Yoneda lemma in category theory, and the associated functorial construction in categories with (mathematical) structure. Such general category-theoretic extensions of formula_1-systems that avoid set theory paradoxes are based on William Lawvere&#x27;s categorical approach and its extensions to higher-dimensional algebra. The mathematical and logical extension of &quot; metabolic-replication systems&quot; to generalized formula_1-systems, or &quot;G-MR&quot;, also involved a series of acknowledged letters exchanged between Robert Rosen and the latter authors during 1967—1980s, as well as letters exchanged with Nicolas Rashevsky up to 1972.

Rosen&#x27;s ideas are becoming increasingly accepted in theoretical biology, and there are several current discussions. One of his main results, as explained in his book &quot;Life Itself&quot; (1991), was the unexpected conclusion that (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines.

Erwin Schrödinger discussed issues of quantum genetics in his famous book of 1945, &quot;What Is Life?&quot; These were critically discussed by Rosen in &quot;Life Itself&quot; and in his subsequent book &quot;Essays on Life Itself&quot;.

==Comparison with other theories of life==

(&quot;M,R&quot;) systems constitute just one of several current theories of life, including the chemoton of Tibor Gánti, the hypercycle of Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster,
 autopoiesis (or &quot;self-building&quot;) of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, and the autocatalytic sets of Stuart Kauffman, similar to an earlier proposal by Freeman Dyson. 
All of these (including (&quot;M,R&quot;) systems) found their original inspiration in Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s book &quot;What is Life?&quot; but at first they appear to have little in common with one another, largely because the authors did not communicate with one another, and none of them made any reference in their principal publications to any of the other theories. Nonetheless, there are more similarities than may be obvious at first sight, for example between Gánti and Rosen. Until recently there have been almost no attempts to compare the different theories and discuss them together.

==Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)==

Some authors equate models of the origin of life with LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all extant life. This is a serious error resulting from failure to recognize that L refers to the &quot;last&quot; common ancestor, not to the &quot;first&quot; ancestor, which is much older: a large amount of evolution occurred before the appearance of LUCA.

Gill and Forterre expressed the essential point as follows:
 LUCA should not be confused with the first cell, but was the product of a long period of evolution. Being the &quot;last&quot; means that LUCA was preceded by a long succession of older &quot;ancestors.&quot;

<doc id="275031" wikidata="Q2449364" url="?curid=275031" title="Donglin Temple (Jiujiang)">
<text>Donglin Temple () is a Buddhist temple approximately from Jiujiang, in the north of Jiangxi province, China. Built in 386 CE at the foot of Mount Lu by Huiyuan, founder of the Pure Land Buddhism, it is well known for how long it has stood without collapsing.

In the Tang dynasty, Jianzhen made several trips to Japan for the mission of preaching Buddhism. As a result, Huiyuan and the doctrine of Donglin Temple began to spread in Japan. Donglin Temple made contributions to improve cultural exchanges and friendly visits between China and Nepal, India, Japan.

The monastery reached its peak of influence during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), but was severely damaged during the Taiping Rebellion and was almost destroyed during the Republican period (1912–1949) of Chinese history.

==History==
===Eastern Jin dynasty===
Donglin Temple was originally built as &quot;Longquan Jingshe&quot; () in 386 by a prominent Buddhist monk named Huiyuan, founder of the Pure Land Sect of Buddhism, under the Eastern Jin dynasty (266–420). During his time as abbot, he disseminated Pure Land Buddhism for 30 years, and attracted large numbers of practitioners. He organized the White Lotus Society (), a community gathered 123 Chinese and foreign monks and scholars. Indian Buddhist monks Tanmoti () and Sengjia Tipo () also delivered Buddhism at that time. 

===Tang dynasty===
The temple experienced unprecedented growth during the Tang dynasty (618–907), and it had more than one thousand monks and was in size, with 310 halls and rooms. Jianzhen, an exceptional Buddhist monk, lectured the sutras and precepts in the temple before going to Japan. In 753, in the 12th year of Tianbao period, Zhi&#x27;en (), a monk in Donglin Temple, arrived in Japan with Jianzhen.
==Structures==
===Guest houses===
Guest houses are provided free of charge for tourists for living there up to three days. Like monastic living, they are sex segregated and rooms have to be shared.

===Big Buddha of Donglin===
After decades long donation campaign, the temple built a tall statue of the buddha Amitābha surrounded by an -tall flame sculpture.

==Public Access==
Unlike many tourist sites in China, visitors are not required to buy any tickets in this temple. On the contrary, tourists can have free vegetarian meals together with monks (at 6:00–6:30, 11:00–11:30, 17:00–17:30) after joining their religious nianfo exercises.

==Abbot==
The current abbot of the temple, Master Da&#x27;an (), was a professor of Beijing University of International Business and Economics.

==See also==
Various other places are named for the temple, including Donglin Academy and Tōrin-in.

<doc id="275035" wikidata="Q7696975" url="?curid=275035" title="Television South">
<text>Television South (TVS) was the ITV franchise holder in the South and South East of England between 1 January 1982 at 9.25 am and 31 December 1992 at 11.59 pm. The company operated under various names, initially as &#x27;Television South plc&#x27; and then following reorganisation in 1989 as &#x27;TVS Entertainment plc&#x27;, with UK broadcasting activities undertaken by subsidiary &#x27;TVS Television Ltd&#x27;.

During its 11-year history, TVS produced a number of notable programmes for the ITV network especially in the fields of drama, light entertainment and children&#x27;s programming. It was also a significant regional broadcaster producing a wide range of programmes for its area with the flagship being the nightly award-winning news programme &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; produced as two separate editions for the South and South East.

TVS ceased broadcasting on 31 December 1992 after losing its franchise to Meridian Broadcasting during the review of franchise holders in 1991. The company was sold to the US firm International Family Entertainment in 1993.

The trademarks of Television South are now owned by an independent production company, while a majority of the company&#x27;s back catalogue is now owned by The Walt Disney Company. TVS Television Ltd itself was in existence until 2018, and was ultimately a non-trading subsidiary of Virgin Media.

==Formation==
Television South was formed following discussions between television producer James Gatward, television executive Bob Southgate, who had previously worked at ITN, Thames Television, and journalist Martin Jackson to apply for the new &#x27;South and South-East&#x27; of England ITV franchise in 1980. Finance was provided by Barclays Bank and Charterhouse investment bank. This area was the most hotly contested, with seven other applicants besides TVS and the incumbent Southern Television.

The Independent Broadcasting Authority had decided to increase the area covered by the South to now include the South East. This meant switching the main Bluebell Hill transmitter, and associated relays (including the important relay at Tunbridge Wells) to broadcast Television South (TVS) instead of ITV London. To reflect this, the contract area served by Southern Television, which was previously titled the &#x27;South of England&#x27; area, was renamed &#x27;South and South-East of England&#x27;. To serve the new region better, the IBA expected the successful applicant to operate separate facilities for both the south and the south-east, known as a &#x27;dual-region&#x27;, with new additional facilities to be built in the South East.

Following the submission of its application, TVS was anticipating that it would be forced into a shotgun marriage with Southern, but in the end, TVS won outright against the seven other contenders since its plans for a better mix of programmes and greater investment were considered good enough to operate the franchise alone. This was the official line given by the IBA, but it was also considered that Southern&#x27;s non-local ownership (the majority shareholders were Associated Newspapers, based in London, and D.C. Thomson, based in Dundee) and its very conservative nature led to it being dropped in favour of the more interesting proposals made by TVS in its franchise application. 

By the start of 1981 a number of high-profile personalities had joined the station in preparation for the start of the new franchise:

* Michael Blakstad, formerly of &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, as director of programmes;
* Anna Home, formerly of BBC children&#x27;s output, as head of programmes for children and young people;
* Michael Rodd, as head of science and industry programmes;
* Herbert Chappell, in charge features, education and music.

During 1981, TVS&#x27;s ambitions were soon recognised for their desire to have a greater say in how ITV operated and its dismay on how it was being treated by the &quot;Big Five&quot; ITV companies: Thames Television, LWT, Central Independent Television, Yorkshire Television and Granada Television. The rationale was that the larger ITV companies should bear more of the production costs as their size enabled them to. This led to criticism in some quarters that the larger of the remaining &#x27;regional&#x27; ITV companies, such as TVS, Anglia Television, Scottish Television, Tyne Tees Television and HTV, found it difficult to get network access for their major productions, and that they were left with &quot;softer&quot; non-primetime sectors such as children&#x27;s and religious television.

Michael Blakstad, director of programmes, claimed ITV needed a shake up as an advertiser, and viewers did not like contemplating the ITV nightly programme offering and were thus hoping the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; would welcome TVS with open arms as a chance to light up the schedules, as the only &#x27;occasional flash of excitement&#x27; appeared from LWT&#x27;s &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;. Blakstad also claimed none of TVS&#x27;s £2 million worth of new programming had been accepted for networked transmission, and TVS was invited to the monthly contractors&#x27; meetings as observer only from May 1982. He also expressed doubts that Yorkshire Television would give up its monopoly of networked science programmes. Blakstad stated: &#x27;TVS was awarded the franchise to bring a catalyst to ITV, but the authority may have to help them get into the laboratory first.&#x27;

In the days before the start of the new franchise, the Independent Broadcasting Authority made it clear that they were happy about the service changes, and were particularly impressed with TVS in connection with new programming for the ITV network in areas in which the IBA wished for improvements, mainly children&#x27;s output and the sciences. TVS&#x27;s aims were for a different line of programming in the early evening slots, to win back the 50,000 viewers it claimed were switching over to rivals, due to the poor service provided by Southern.

TVS began broadcasting at 9.30 am on Friday 1 January 1982. The new dual-regional station sprang to life with its new specially composed start-up theme – variously named but referred to in-house as &quot;TVS Gallop&quot; – accompanied by a programme menu and clock. Continuity broadcaster Malcolm Brown, formerly of Granada, made the opening announcement:

Following the first airing of the station&#x27;s first ident, the first programme to air was a &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; special entitled &quot;Bring in the New&quot;, presented by Khalid Aziz. A number of presenters made the transition from Southern to TVS; all production staff were transferred as part of the then-union agreements within ITV that no technician should lose employment as a result of franchise changes. 200 staff were also recruited for the facilities at Gillingham and Maidstone, although a small number of these were made redundant after the company went on-air, as the studios struggled to reach production capacity, restricted by TVS&#x27;s limited access to the ITV network.

===Broadcasting years===
Prior to broadcasting, TVS refused to take on most of Southern&#x27;s programme stock, except the arrangement to cover two Glyndebourne operas each year. Following the launch of Channel 4 in November 1982, the operas were shown on that channel. &quot;Houseparty&quot; was replaced by &quot;Not For Women Only&quot; which recognised changes in women&#x27;s social patterns, while a new Saturday morning children&#x27;s series called &quot;No. 73&quot; was also introduced, locally at first, before being networked.

Whitbread acquired a 20% stake in TVS from European Ferries in April 1984, as the latter wished to concentrate its financial and management resources on the shipping and property sectors, but sold on the stake in November 1986. Financial director Lionel Ross said:

In August 1984, Greg Dyke joined TVS as director of programmes, coming from TV-am. He was brought in to rejuvenate the station, and started to move programming away from its original philosophy of niche arts and science programming, and began producing more entertainment programmes. In 1985, an agreement was reached with LWT, which required help to fill its schedules with appropriate, domestically produced programming while not having to increase its budget; thus TVS was able to get more of its programmes onto the ITV network slots, such as &quot;Bobby Davro on the Box&quot;, &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, &quot;C.A.T.S Eyes&quot;, &quot;Five Alive&quot;, &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Summertime Special&quot; and other light entertainment programmes. TVS retained their original philosophy for regional and children&#x27;s programmes. 

By November 1986, the station became one of the most heavily criticised companies by the IBA over its programming; the criticism mainly concerned the Southampton editions of &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; while issues were raised over the quality of TVS&#x27;s drama and light entertainment output. Their education series were &#x27;too didactic&#x27;, while the religious output was branded as having &#x27;barely discernible religious content&#x27;. Dyke accepted the IBA criticism but highlighted that TVS had already begun remedying the issues and faults, with a new editor for their Southampton news operation, and a new head of religious output was brought in, along with a controller of drama - a first for TVS. Once again, TVS expressed concern about their relationship with the Big Five ITV stations, and how they controlled the channel&#x27;s output. In April 1987, Greg Dyke left TVS and returned to LWT.

By TVS&#x27;s fifth anniversary in 1987, their profits had grown 62% since 1981 to £14.4 million, which was helped after TVS increased their share of programming for ITV network and growth in new business; warnings were made that inflation and cost was higher, but the projected growth of television operations would be around 7–8% during the rest of the year. The result was that the accounts revealed TVS had become bigger than Yorkshire Television in terms of advertising revenue, and was quickly catching up with the other Big Five ITV companies. By the following January, profits had increased again to £21.8m. There was speculation at the time that the technicians&#x27; strike at TV-am could have spread to TVS&#x27;s operations over their plans to provide an overnight service, which become fully operational by June 1988.

With TVS continuing to generate large profits, but restricted in ITV network programming, the company started to search for other investments. In 1985, they launched failed bids to acquire Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment and the French television channel TF1. In 1986, TVS were successful in buying Midem, an organisation that promoted trade fairs; and Gilson International, a Los Angeles distribution company selling programmes outside the US. TVS also acquired a 3.5% stake in Australia Network Ten company Northern Star.

At the start of July 1988, speculation started to appear of a take-over bid for the American media company MTM Enterprises. Within a few days, MTM was bought for £190m, which gave owner and founder Mary Tyler Moore 5.1% shares in TVS, and Arthur Price, chief executive of MTM, a total of 6.6%.; both agreed not to sell for a period of five years. TVS paid for the deal partly by selling 10% stakes for £29.2m each to Générale D&#x27;Images (a cable television, film library and film production group) and Canal Plus, asking shareholders for £47.8m through a convertible preference share issue, with the remaining £38m taken out in a bank loan. The deal created a unique company with productions operations in Ireland, UK and USA, along with a UK broadcasting franchise.

Uncertainty over the high price paid by TVS for MTM, coupled with a collapse of a US syndication market which affected many other US stations,
plus a £5.7m write-off from the disposal of Super Channel resulted in financial instability. In January 1990, TVS started searching for a buyer for a 49% stake in MTM, as part of the restructuring of MTM due to losses of £7.3m. A few days later, TVS confirmed profits were down 35% in 1989, which resulted in 140 redundancies across the UK; this was not as bad as expected, since TVS had planned to eliminate up to 200 jobs that summer.

Ahead of the ITV franchise round, James Gatward resigned from TVS, after being informed his services were no longer required, as the board believed he was not showing sufficient resolve in preparing TVS for the franchise bid. Further changes took place, with the TVS Television board being merged into the TVS Entertainment board, along with a further 100 redundancies to help strengthen the finances. In March 1991, four contenders were lined up to buy MTM, which would have seen the company being sold off for around £50m; there were hopes that the deal would be sorted by May before the ITV franchise application was submitted.

==Loss of franchise==

In 1990, the new Broadcasting Act was passed by parliament, which deregulated broadcasting in the UK and removed the monopoly on programme production held by franchise holders. Changes to network broadcasting and the introduction of cable and satellite channels meant that ITV needed to be leaner and fitter to compete with its new rivals.

The original draft of the Broadcasting Act stated that the applicant with the highest cash bid would win; however, following fears that this would financially stretch the network and diminish programme standards, the concept of a &#x27;quality threshold&#x27; was introduced. Incumbents and applicants had to pass this first, before cash bids were even considered; even then, if a cash bid was deemed to impact on plans, the application could be rejected.

The lucrative nature of the TVS contract area made it one of the most desirable franchises in the UK. Despite preparing vast amounts of audience research, programming proposals and an extremely comprehensive application document for the ITC, the TVS board – now minus its founder Gatward – calculated that it needed to outbid all opposition to retain its licence. This resulted in the &#x27;bid high or die&#x27; strategy – in which the management calculated the highest possible bid that TVS could possibly afford. The result of these calculations was a massive £59 million per annum, payable for the following 10 years; it was the highest bid ever made by any UK television broadcaster.

The ITC announced the results of the franchise battle by releasing simultaneous faxes to the contending companies. Three companies had passed the so-called programme &#x27;quality threshold&#x27; – TVS, Carlton and Meridian Broadcasting. Of these three, TVS&#x27;s bid was the highest. However, the ITC now asserted it also needed confidence that the winning company could sustain its annual payments throughout the entire period of the 10-year licence; the commission claimed that TVS would not be able to sustain the proposed annual £59 million licence payments. The ITC then awarded the licence to Meridian Broadcasting, which had bid only £36 million per year.

The ITC refused every attempt to get it to explain its decision. TVS could have sought a judicial review, but the legal advice that it received was that the prospect of success would be slim and the costs would be enormous. Whilst it carried on broadcasting to the end of its franchise period, it began partially liquidating the company. The studio facilities at Southampton were sold to the incoming franchise winner Meridian Broadcasting, even though they intended to operate as a &#x27;publisher broadcaster&#x27; and would not be making anything like the amount of regional programming made by TVS. The Maidstone Studios were retained with the news facility being leased to Meridian as TVS planned to continue trading as an independent producer.

The unions started to negotiate with Meridian to absorb some of the 800 staff at TVS who were facing redundancy. Meridian planned to employ only 370 staff, as it intended to produce a far smaller amount of network programming and would use independent producers for the remainder of its programming. In the event, the projections of advertising revenue on which TVS had based its massive bid turned out to be correct. However, only three years later, all the high-bidding licensees – including HTV, which had nearly bankrupted itself to put forward a £25 million bid to win back the licence for Wales and the West – were allowed to reduce their payments, in some cases by more than half.

===Closing night===
TVS ceased broadcasting to the South and South East of England at just before midnight on 31 December 1992. While most other ITV stations were broadcasting the Thames Television farewell programme &quot;The End of the Year Show&quot;, Scottish and Grampian chose to opt out and instead aired their traditional Hogmanay special, while TVS chose to opt out and air its own final programme entitled &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot;, a 65-minute retrospective of its programming, presented by Fred Dinenage and Fern Britton and recorded in front of a studio audience at the Northam studios in Southampton on 13 December that year. The programme closed with an amended version of the TVS ident, along with the message &#x27;Thanks for watching&#x27; before crossing to Big Ben for the New Year chimes at midnight and the handover to Meridian Broadcasting.

===Post-franchise era===
In the Autumn of 1992, a number of American companies were interested in acquiring TVS, from the likes of TCW Capital, International Family Entertainment Inc. (IFE) and Lorne Michaels. IFE originally made a bid worth £38.2m and received backing from a number of key shareholders for this to be accepted. A small number of shareholders, including Julian Tregar, rejected the offer from IFE. In November, TCW Capital made a counter bid, but pulled out a few weeks later, after reviewing the accounts of TVS. IFE increased their offer to £45.3 million, but continued to be opposed by Tregar who blocked the deal on technical grounds, as it was alleged that the offer was too low.
IFE finally revised and increased their offer to appease the remaining shareholders, and on 23 January 1993, the IFE offer of £56.5 million was finally accepted, with the deal being completed on 1 February that year. The following September, IFE launched a UK version of The Family Channel, based at The Maidstone Studios and using some elements of the TVS programme archive. Flextech was a partner in the venture, taking a 39% stake in the business.

In 1996, IFE sold its remaining 61% share to Flextech, giving it full ownership of the venture, and subsequently, in February 1997, Flextech rebranded the station as Challenge TV, focusing mainly on game shows. IFE was sold to Fox Kids Worldwide (a joint venture of News Corporation and Saban Entertainment), which in turn was acquired by Disney in 2001. The MTM Enterprises library was maintained by 20th Century Fox Television (which was acquired by Disney in 2019).

==Liquidation==

The corporate entity TVS Television Limited remained in existence until 2018, and was latterly a wholly-owned but non-trading subsidiary of Virgin Media.

A final account prior to dissolution had been signed on 4 January 2018. At the time of liquidation the only asset of value was an intercompany receivable balance from Flextech Broadband Limited. TVS Television Limited officially dissolved on 18 April.

==Studio facilities==
===Northam, Southampton===
The Southampton base was the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters and its primary production and transmission centre. These studios were purchased by TVS from its predecessor Southern, but TVS was delayed in the purchase of the site by Southern and therefore had to initially operate prior to launch from temporary buildings in the Southern car park, leading to Southern contemptuously branding TVS as &quot;Portakabin TV&quot;, as referenced in a satirical song performed by Richard Stilgoe on Southern&#x27;s final programme. TVS finally completed the purchase of the Southampton site, equipment, news library and staff pension fund in August 1981. Also included in the sale was land purchased by Southern for planned new studios in Maidstone. Upon purchase TVS made significant investment, including building a new scenery block to the rear of the existing site. After losing its contract, TVS sold the studios to its successor Meridian Broadcasting in mid-1992. The studios were closed by Meridian in 2004, and demolished in 2010.

===Vinters Park, Maidstone===
The studios to serve the eastern section of TVS&#x27;s transmission area were at Vinters Park near Maidstone in Kent. The site was originally acquired by Southern Television, which had commissioned a conceptual design for new studio facilities on the site. Following the award of the franchise to TVS, Southern Television sold the site to the new company at a premium. Construction commenced in early 1982, and the first studios at the centre became operational in mid-1983.

The Maidstone Studios, though significant (and home to many networked shows) were ancillary to those in Southampton which were the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters. Meridian Broadcasting, the new licensee, were not offered the studios as TVS initially intended to become an independent producer. However, Meridian agreed to rent the newsroom and facilities for an initial 10-year period from 1993. Following the sale of TVS in that year, the studios were acquired by TVS&#x27;s new owners IFE and Meridian&#x27;s agreement came to a premature end. Meridian operated from elsewhere in Maidstone, but in 2004, after extensive cutbacks, it moved back into a small newsroom in The Maidstone Studios, which would later become the official trading and marketing name of the Vinters Park complex, when it was later sold-off as a standalone &quot;four walls&quot; studio complex, later used for shows on BBC and ITV, etc.

===Dover===
The studios on Russell Street were originally the eastern base of Southern Television, from which &quot;Scene South East&quot; and &quot;Scene Midweek&quot; were broadcast and were essentially a news-gathering operation with transmission facilities for regional news opt-outs. TVS used Dover as a regional studio for a year until completion of Vinters Park when it disposed of the site; the buildings have since been demolished and the site is now St. James Retail Park, a shopping outlet.

===TVS Television Theatre===
TVS acquired the former Plaza Cinema in Gillingham, Kent, as a stopgap measure between the commencement of broadcasting and the completion of Vinters Park. The theatre was quickly converted for television use, ready for the start of broadcasting. The decision to operate a television theatre was against the trend in television at that time, as both the BBC and Thames Television were to dispose of similar facilities in the following two years.

Production at Gillingham was limited; it was used for several quiz shows, and it was the base of the regional afternoon magazine show &quot;Not for Women Only&quot; while TVS recorded the UK inserts for &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; at that base. TVS sold the theatre in 1988 to an independent production company. For a period afterwards, the site was used for other activities before being demolished to make way for redevelopment. A campaign to have it listed, failed as the large-scale conversion for television production had made it unsuitable for listing.

===Regional offices===
TVS maintained small news studios in Brighton, Reading and Poole. Each studio had a single camera and a cut down version of the interview set to enable down-the-line interviews; these centres were each staffed by a news team, consisting of two reporters, a cameraperson, sound recordist and lighting electrician. Each crew had a vehicle equipped with radio-link equipment to enable live location reports via the TVS helicopter. The studios were based in the Brighton Centre, Reading Civic Centre and Poole Arts Centre.

A studio at Westminster was created for parliamentary coverage; TVS had two cameras in the basement studio of the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in Broad Sanctuary, as well as a news crew. This facility was available for hire to other broadcasting organisations, when not needed by TVS. One feature was a remote-control operated camera mounted on the roof of the centre, giving a clear shot of the Houses of Parliament for use as a live backdrop.

In addition, TVS had sales offices in London, which was converted from a former bakery, and Manchester.

==Sub-regions==
TVS operated a dual region, where the company both offered different services for the South and South East of England. This was primarily a different edition of the flagship &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; news programme, from a different base and with a different presenting team. However, some other local programming was produced solely for the South or South East and as a result, programming would differ either between sub-regions or pan-regional programmes.

At the beginning of TVS&#x27;s time as contractor, the company used separate presentation for each sub-region, with a caption declaring the sub-region below the clock, so viewers could differentiate between programmes for the whole region, or for their sub-region. This practice was dropped after a year or so.

==Identity==
TVS&#x27;s identity featured a six-coloured fleur-de-lis symbol that formed up in three stages from the outside in, before zooming out and sitting alongside the TVS lettering, accompanied by a shortened version of the station theme &quot;New Forest Rondo&quot;. There were different variations for weekdays and the weekend, which only differed in the zoom-out to the lettering. The ident was shot initially on film of a mechanical model but was later shot using video effects and from 1985, a computer-generated version of the ident was used. Accompanying this ident was a clock on a black background, with the six TVS colours on either side, and an ident sequence following the theme &#x27;For the best view of the South&#x27; which was used prior to the news. 

On 7 September 1987, following the departure of Dyke from TVS, the station&#x27;s presentation was completely overhauled, with the new idents designed by John Hayman and a new jingle by composer Ed Welch. The new idents featured metallic TVS lettering which would spin out, turning into a metallic logo before spinning back to the lettering; the rainbow colour effects were still included, when the logo spun. Three versions were produced: a normal ident, a short ident where the TVS logo rotated into the lettering, and a minute-extended ident featuring video from the regions that was used upon start-up and in some of the longer junctions. No clock was included in the new look. The idents were all against a grey gradient background and featured the caption &#x27;Television South&#x27; below the end lettering. This change, in effect, brought a more &#x27;corporate&#x27; feel to TVS Television.

This ident was altered slightly on 1 September 1989 following the TVS management restructuring, so that the ident was against a gradient blue background and cut in to the rotation of the logo into the lettering. The caption was changed to &#x27;Television&#x27; to reflect the station&#x27;s technical name of TVS Television, and the music was altered slightly to be bolder. Against the blue background, the metallic lettering now had the appearance of glass or perspex. This ident was used by TVS until it went off air on 31 December 1992, when a special ident with the caption &#x27;Thanks for watching&#x27; used to close the final TVS programme, &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot;.

==Programming==

TVS produced a vast array of programming covering a wide aspect of areas. As part of the dual region, two entirely separate editions of the TVS regional news programme &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; were developed, to produce daily news coverage across the area. Both won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s awards for the Best News Programme of the Year, in 1983 (for the South East edition), and in 1989 and 1991 (for the South edition).

TVS also innovated with the experimental &quot;Afternoon Club&quot;, a dedicated programme encompassing a number of afternoon soap operas, quiz shows etc. linked by general chat and guests etc. TVS also produced its own afternoon magazine series, &quot;Not for Women Only&quot;. TVS was also instrumental in providing separate non-news programmes for the South, South East and Thames Valley areas, including the chat show &quot;Coast to Coast People&quot; and the listings guide &quot;This Way Out&quot;. The award-winning series &quot;Country Ways&quot;, which examined the people and places of the region, began in 1984 and continued in production for ITV Meridian until 2008.

One of TVS&#x27;s strongest performance was in children&#x27;s programming. Early successes included the Saturday morning show &quot;No. 73&quot; (which launched the career of Sandi Toksvig, and was networked from its second series) &quot;On Safari&quot;, the British version of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and being one of the biggest contributors to &quot;Dramarama&quot;. In 1990, TVS brought back &quot;How&quot; as &quot;How 2&quot; and began production of &quot;Art Attack&quot;.

As TVS established its deal with LWT, the company started to make significant contributions to the network with its own drama and entertainment series including: &quot;Catchphrase&quot;, &quot;C.A.T.S. Eyes&quot;, numerous Bobby Davro series, and the successful television adaptations of the novels of Ruth Rendell, with more than 15 programmes being made over a 10-year period.

TVS also provided a number of networked factual and science-based programmes, including &quot;In The Mouth of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Real World&quot;, the latter of which was twice broadcast in 3D (a ground-breaking television first in the UK) with special glasses given away with the magazine &quot;TV Times&quot;.
TVS continued Southern Television&#x27;s tradition of providing classical music programmes, but these were broadcast on Channel 4 instead of ITV, principally involving The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under conductor Owain Arwel Hughes. Other contributions included opera from Glyndebourne and a performance of Mahler&#x27;s 8th Symphony from Salisbury Cathedral to inaugurate Channel 4&#x27;s stereo service on 28 July 1990. As well as classical music, TVS also produced a number of pop and light music programmes.

Other location programming included the usual round of sports coverage in the region, principally football. Also, extensive coverage of the various party political conferences from Brighton and Bournemouth. In the summer, a major light entertainment programme, &quot;Summertime Special&quot;, was produced for the ITV network on Saturday evenings.

<text>Wales Rally GB was the most recent iteration of the United Kingdom&#x27;s premier international motor rally, which ran under various names since the first event held in 1932. It was consistently a round of the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) calendar from the inaugural 1973 season until the rally&#x27;s final running in 2019, and was also frequently included in the British Rally Championship.

The first rallies in the 1930s were simply known as Royal Automobile Club (RAC) Rallies and did not necessarily require leaving England. In 1951 the club organised the first annual RAC International Rally of Great Britain to tour the island, and until the 53rd event in 1997 this was still commonly known as the RAC Rally. In 1998, amidst a restructuring of the club and its commercial activities, the event lost its RAC identity and became known as the Rally of Great Britain or Rally GB, with title sponsorship from the Government of Wales since 2003.

The last planned Wales Rally GB was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Welsh Government withdrew sponsorship support. Attempts were made to replace it with a Rally UK or Rally Northern Ireland, held entirely in Northern Ireland, however no such event has run .

==History==

===Royal Automobile Club Rallies===

==== 1930s ====
The inaugural event was the 1932 Royal Automobile Club Rally, which was the first major rally of the modern era in Great Britain. Of the 367 crews entered, 341 competitors in unmodified cars started from nine different towns and cities (London, Bath, Norwich, Leamington, Buxton, Harrogate, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh.)

The Official Programme explained:
Completing the routes held no other competitive element other than following them within the time schedules, which were deliberately made easy by the RAC so that everybody made it to Torquay. However, competitors performed tests at the finish in Torquay, involving slow running, acceleration and braking. There was no official winner declared, although Colonel A. H. Loughborough in a Lanchester 15/18 was recorded as having the fewest penalty points in the decisive tests at the finish. He completed the 100-yard slow driving test at an average speed of , which was found to be less punishing under the scoring system than Donald Healey found by being fastest in the acceleration test, completing it in 7.6 seconds.

The following year&#x27;s RAC Rally followed a similar format, but with Hastings as the chosen finish. Over three hundred competitors entered, and this time Miss Kitty Brunell, driving an AC four-seater sports, was the driver with the fewest penalties. Over the next few years the rallies finished at various towns including Brighton and Blackpool. The rally was run annually until 1939, after which the outbreak of the Second World War forced its suspension.

=== RAC International Rallies of Great Britain ===

==== 1950s: Rallies of the Tests ====
The first post-war RAC rally was the RAC International Rally of Great Britain 1951 and included an 1800 mile itinerary with tests of speed, hill-climbing and regularity. Although the rally still started from multiple points, the cars were convened at Silverstone racing circuit for a high speed test, and from there followed a common itinerary around Scotland, Wales and England, finishing in Bournemouth. Cars had to be standard production models and sold in quantities greater than 50. Many motor manufacturers wanted to enter teams and pressed the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders to approve the event to remove taboo surrounding the event being only for privateers.

The 1953 event was included as the third round of the inaugural European Touring Championship and included nine tests and part of the route was a secret. The tests included acceleration and braking held at Silverstone, night driving at Castle Combe, a night climb of Prescott Hill, a speed test at Goodwood and a new &#x27;garaging&#x27; test at Llandrindod Wells which involved driving into a garage and parking, leaving the garage on foot then proceeding to return and reverse out of the garage, all against the clock. An official winner was declared for the first time, Ian Appleyard, driving a Jaguar XK120.

In 1954 and the years that followed, the rally received criticism for being &quot;no more than a navigational treasure hunt&quot; in comparison to the rallies being held in Europe at the time such as the Alpine or Liege-Rome-Liege. These demanded exceptional driving skill, endurance or had itineraries that required a higher speed over their entire route to avoid harsher penalties. No event was held in 1957 due to the Suez Crisis, but by 1958 no foreigner entered the rally at all. This didn&#x27;t stop the award for best foreign driver being awarded, to Paddy Hopkirk of Northern Ireland.

For 1959, the rally was moved to November in the hope of making the rally more of a driving test in wintry weather, attempting to address concerns that the touring, regularity, road-rally wasn&#x27;t necessary or worthy anymore.

==== 1960s: Introduction of special stages ====
In 1960, organising secretary Jack Kemsley negotiated with the Forestry Commission to use a closed two-mile (3 km) gravel road named Monument Hill in Argyll, Scotland as a speed test. Times were still converted to points for the purposes of the rally competition and were based on an average speed of 40 mph. Swede Eric Carlsson won the rally and was the only driver not to accrue any penalty points at all. His co-driver Stuart Turner is quoted on the Monument Hill stage in the 1987 book &quot;RAC Rally&quot; by Maurice Hamilton, saying: &quot;there is no doubt that was the point at which the RAC Rally shifted from a traditional &quot;Find Your Way&quot; on the public roads rally to the type of event we know today&quot;.

In the following year, 1961, rough gravel forestry roads all over the country were opened up to the drivers and the sealed surfaces such as Oulton Park made a tiny fraction of around 200 miles of special stages. With so many, the results of the rally were based more on what happened on these stages. This, with the introduction of special timing clocks and seeding of entries, secured the rally&#x27;s future and appeal to international competitors, and the beginning of its reputation as one of the most gruelling and unpredictable fixtures on the calendar.

By 1965 there was over 400 miles across 57 special stages held on a mix of War Department roads, racing circuits and other private venues but the majority were in the forests. In 1966, the Forestry Commission increased the compensation requested for the use of its roads and the rally gained a sponsor in The Sun newspaper to help cover the costs, which were already being assisted by Lombank. From 1965, penalties accrued on the public road sections were being applied in units of time instead of points, with the total time measured on the special stages classifying the results of the rally.

The 1967 event was cancelled on the eve of the event due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, so competitors staged a mock rally at the Bagshot proving ground as consolation for the press and television (ATV had been persuaded to provide major coverage with in-car cameras for the first time).

==== 1970s: Sponsorship and spectator special stages ====
Until 1970 there had been no title sponsorship, but in that year the rally plates on all cars carried advertising of the event&#x27;s newspaper sponsor after the name &quot;(RAC International Rally of Great Britain sponsored by the Daily Mirror).&quot; In 1971, the event&#x27;s full title itself changed to become known as the &quot;Daily Mirror RAC International Rally of Great Britain&quot;. This deal lasted for two further events before finance company Lombard North Central, then known as Lombank, took over title rights in 1974. The event became known as the Lombard RAC Rally, and Lombard&#x27;s name became synonymous with the event for almost two decades. In 1972 Unipart were sponsoring all the 72 individual stages.

In 1971, ticketed &#x27;spectator stages&#x27; were introduced and by 1975 had become an important part of the event&#x27;s profile and source of revenue. These stages were usually short stints at stately homes or other public venues, such as Chatsworth House and Sutton Park. They were popular with spectators as they were closer to large population centres than the forests in Wales or Scotland, and organisers saw them help control the growing numbers of spectators crowding the forests.

The first day became devoted to these stages, in 1976 over 350 miles of road sections for just 14 miles of simple stages. They were often referred to as &quot;Mickey Mouse stages&quot; because of the lack of challenge they offered. Competing driver and columnist Chris Lord used the term and said he understood their purpose, but they were putting drivers off entering. Speaking of itineraries, Roger Clark said he&#x27;d rather have longer road sections than have &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; stages to break them up. Nonetheless, they contributed to the results.

The seventies also saw change in the administration of organisation and authority of the sport. In 1975, the RAC&#x27;s Competitions Committee was replaced by a Motor Sports Council, which was absorbed by the RAC Motor Sports Association in 1979. The legally independent association was created in December 1977 to organise motorsport events, one of which was the RAC Rally.

==== 1980s ====
The 1985 event was the longest RAC Rally to date, with a total length of , with 79 hours of driving and 33 hours of rest over six days. Following the death of Henri Toivonen in 1986, limits on overall event length and stage length were put in place. Night stages were still permitted, however minimum break times prevented stages taking places through the night.
The 1986 RAC Rally was the last European event for Group B vehicles. These highly tuned turbocharged cars were to be banned as they were deemed too powerful and dangerous, in light of the various accidents in which they were involved. In the end, the Peugeot 205 T16 Evo. 2s of Timo Salonen, Juha Kankkunen and Mikael Sundström took three of the top four places, with only Markku Alén&#x27;s second position in the Lancia Delta S4 preventing a monopoly of the podium.

There were 83 finishers out of 150 starters in 1986, compared to year of worst attrition in 1981 when only 54 of the 151 starters reached the end. This was in stark contrast to the early years: in 1938, there were only 6 retirements from 237 starters.

==== 1990s ====
During the 1990s, the length of the rally was gradually reduced, in line with other international rallies. 1989 was the last event to take place over 5 days, with 1995 the last event to take place over 4 days. The 1990 event was the first to allow crews to use pacenotes, as previous editions did not allow crews to perform reconnaissance runs through the route beforehand.

1996 would be the last time to-date that forest stages would be run outside of Wales, with the opening leg taking place in Kielder Forest and the Scottish Borders.

=== Rallies of Great Britain ===
In 1998, &#x27;RAC&#x27; disappeared from both the name of the rally and its organising body (RAC MSA). Earlier that year the Club had begun a lengthy process of restructuring and altering its constitution in order to sell its commercial motoring services operation to Cendant. This sale was ultimately blocked by the state on monopoly concerns, but a sale was made early in 1999 to Lex Group.

It&#x27;s possible that &#x27;RAC&#x27; was dropped by request of the existing title sponsor of the rally Network Q, who offered similar commercial services to both Cendant and Lex Group. It&#x27;s more likely, though not explicitly proven, that use of &quot;RAC&quot; branding was sold as part of the motoring services deal.

==== 2000s: New formats ====

In 2000, the WRC&#x27;s commercial rights holder International Sportsworld Communicators was sold to a consortium led by David Richards, who revolutionised the series into a TV and spectator friendly series whilst cutting costs. One of the biggest changes implemented was to condense the rallies into a more compact area rather than touring the country, reducing &#x27;dead air&#x27; road sections that provided little value to anybody. This was quickly followed by a reduction of services, ultimately to just one central service park; and the double-running of stages in a &#x27;cloverleaf&#x27; format was supposed to provide more value for the organisers, competitors, media production and spectators. Additionally, all WRC rallies followed a format of starting on a Thursday evening or Friday morning, to finishing on a Sunday afternoon.

The 2000 Rally GB could no longer start on a Sunday with a day of &#x27;spectator stages&#x27; at the traditional stately homes or venues. Instead, tickets were needed for all special stages for the first time, and all stages were run on gravel &#x27;in the forests&#x27;, with the exception of a short head-to-head super-special held at a purpose-built spectator arena in Cardiff Docks. The rally started and ended in Cardiff and at no point left South or Mid-Wales, the first time in the event&#x27;s history it had not covered roads in England or Scotland. 2001 saw just one central service area employed at Felindre, near Swansea, then in 2002 every special stage was run more than once.

After 10 years of sponsorship by Network Q, the Welsh Assembly became the title sponsor in 2003, helping to cement the rally&#x27;s foothold in Wales.
The 2005 rally included the first indoor super special stage at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The rally was overshadowed by a death on the final day. On stage fifteen, Peugeot driver Markko Märtin crashed heavily into a tree, and while he was unharmed his co-driver Michael Park sustained fatal injuries. It was the first death in the WRC in over a decade. The final two stages were cancelled and Sébastien Loeb, who would have won the event and the championship, voluntarily incurred a two-minute time penalty in order not to win under such circumstances, leaving Petter Solberg to be declared the victor. A memorial for Park was unveiled in Märtin&#x27;s homeland of Estonia and the damaged tree on the Margam Park stage of the rally where he died bears a plaque in memorial of him.

==== 2010s ====
After being centred in South Wales since 2000, the 2011 edition of the rally started in Llandudno in North Wales and then heading south towards Cardiff during the rally. From 2013, the rally was centred in North Wales, with a service park located in Deeside, near Chester. In 2016 an agreement was reached between the MSA and Natural Resources Wales to continue to use Welsh forest stages for three years.

==== 2020s ====
Rally GB was one of several World Championship rallies cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, marking the first time in the history of the series that a round in Britain had not been held. A proposed move to Northern Ireland was scrapped for 2021 after the prospective organisers failed to reach an agreement with local government to host the rally. As a result Rally GB was replaced by the Belgian Ypres Rally on the 2021 calendar. Despite further attempts by Motorsport UK to organise a rally, it did not appear on the 2022, 2023, 2024 or 2025 calendars.

Despite the cancellation of Wales Rally GB in 2020, there are proposals to ressurect Rally GB to a new base in the country of Scotland for 2026. 

== Character ==

===Road Profile===
British forest stages are known to feature relatively high average speeds, although for the most part not as fast as those of Scandinavia. The crests are also not as sharp and there are little-to-no natural jumps or yumps.

The stages throughout the country are known to alternate between more natural long, sweeping corners and others with manmade long straights and angular corners.

The roads are commonly smooth and all feature a hard base and minimal loose surface material. That being said Kielder stages are known to be rougher and more abrasive, as well as being heavily built-up in the centre and cambered towards the edges.

Road width varies throughout the country. Stages in North Wales and the Lake District are typically narrow, whilst those of South Wales and Kielder are much wider.

===Weather===
Typically run in November, rainfall is almost guaranteed and wet and muddy road conditions have become the defining characteristic of the rally throughout its history. Temperatures at this time of year rarely exceed double digits. Therefore the ideal road position is viewed to be one of the earlier cars through the stage, as the road becomes more polished or cut-up by every passing car.

Ice and snow are also not an uncommon occurrence for Britain at this time of year, and varying levels have affected the rally over the years. Editions such as 1971, 1988 and 1993 featured heavy snow conditions, particularly in the Northern-most sections of the route. The most recent edition to be affected by freezing conditions was 2008, when several stages on the opening day had to be either shortened or cancelled due to substantial ice. The issue of freezing is further complicated by the outlaw of studded tyres in British forests by the Forestry Commission, in order to prevent damage to the roads.

The unique weather conditions encountered on the rally have been viewed as a major put-off for several top drivers. Double world champion Walter Röhrl perhaps being the most high profile competitor to state his dislike for the event.

===Title showdowns===
For many years the rally has traditionally been the last round of the World Championship, and therefore has staged many famous down-to-the-wire showdowns.

In 1991 the world championship came down-to-the-wire in the British forests, with Lancia driver Juha Kankkunen edging out Toyota&#x27;s Carlos Sainz after the Spaniard suffered engine issues and went off the road in Kielder Forest and damaged his car.

One year later and Sainz and Kankkunen returned to the RAC along with Frenchman Didier Auriol to fight for the 1992 title. Auriol&#x27;s challenge would end with engine failure, and Kankkunen&#x27;s hopes were also dashed when he went off and damaged his steering on the final day of the rally in southern Scotland. Sainz eventually won the rally and with it claimed his second world title.

In 1995, it was estimated that around 2 million fans lined the forests to witness Scotsman Colin McRae win his second consecutive RAC Rally. In the process he beat teammate Carlos Sainz to take his first and only world title in front of thousands of fans at Chester Racecourse.

McRae would have less fortune in future years; despite winning again in 1997, he was pipped to the title by Finn Tommi Mäkinen by just one point. The Scot would come up short again in 2001 when he crashed out of an early lead, gifting the championship to his English rival Richard Burns.

One of the most dramatic showdowns was 1998, when championship leader Tommi Mäkinen crashed out on one of the first day&#x27;s spectator stages after his Mitsubishi hit a patch of oil, slid and tore a wheel off. This seemingly handed the title to Toyota&#x27;s Carlos Sainz. However, in a cruel twist of fate Sainz&#x27;s engine let go just 300 meters from the finish line of the final stage, meaning that Mäkinen claimed the championship title, with Luis Moya famously throwing his helmet through the car&#x27;s rear window in frustration.

In 2003, a four-way title fight was narrowed down to just two when Burns was forced to withdraw from the event for medical reasons, which would tragically claim his life two years later, and Carlos Sainz crashed out. In the end, Norwegian Petter Solberg would win the rally ahead of Sébastien Loeb, and consequently beat the Frenchman to claim his only world rally title by just one point.

=== Nordic successes ===
Nordic drivers have enjoyed rich pickings in the RAC Rally through the years. Home drivers won the first six runnings of the race from 1953, when an outright winner was first declared. However, in 1960 Erik Carlsson of Sweden drove his Saab 96 to a hat-trick of victories in 1960–1962. Of the nine drivers to have won three or more rallies, five have been Swedes, Finns or Norwegians. The record for most victories is currently five, won by Sébastien Ogier (2013–2016, 2018), who surpassed Finnish Hannu Mikkola (1978–79, 1981–82) and Norwegian Petter Solberg (2002–2005). Though, last time a Nordic driver won Rally GB, was in 2012 (Jari-Matti Latvala).

=== Title sponsors ===
Until 1970 there had been no title sponsorship, but in that year the rally plates on all cars carried advertising of the event&#x27;s newspaper sponsor after the name &quot;(RAC International Rally of Great Britain sponsored by the Daily Mirror)&quot;. In 1971, the event&#x27;s full title itself changed to become known as the &quot;Daily Mirror RAC International Rally of Great Britain&quot;. This deal lasted for two further events before finance company Lombard North Central, then known as Lombank, took over title rights in 1974. The event became known as the Lombard RAC Rally, and Lombard&#x27;s name became synonymous with the event.

Following Lombard&#x27;s withdrawal of sponsorship after nineteen years, the rally became known as the Network Q RAC Rally and later, the Network Q Rally of Great Britain. The rally moved its operational base to Cardiff in 2000 and competitive stage mileage was concentrated in Wales. With sponsorship from the Welsh Government, the event was known as the Wales Rally GB.

However, with such an extensive history covering the whole country, there were demands for the &quot;glory days&quot; of the old RAC Rally. In this spirit, two events have recently been established, and cover the same classic stages which are no longer part of the WRC itinerary. The &quot;RAC Revival Rally&quot; uses modern, but less powerful cars, while the &quot;Roger Albert Clark Rally&quot; is a historic event using only pre-1972 machinery, and named after the first home winner of the race as a World Championship event.

<text>Sean Christopher McMullen (born 21 December 1948 in Sale, Victoria) is an Australian science fiction and fantasy author.

==Biography==

McMullen is one of Australia&#x27;s leading science-fiction and fantasy authors and has written over 70 stories and 17 books. In 2011, his novelette &quot;Eight Miles&quot; was the runner-up in the Hugo Awards. He has won the Analog Reader&#x27;s Award twice, for &quot;Ninety Thousand Horses&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Tower of Wings&quot; in 2002.

His first novel was originally published in Australia as two separate books, &quot;Voices in the Light&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mirrorsun Rising&quot; (1995). His first internationally published novel was &quot;The Centurion&#x27;s Empire&quot; (1998), which featured a time machine built during the Roman Empire. After this book&#x27;s success, his first two novels were rewritten and combined for a publication in the US as &quot;Souls in the Great Machine&quot; (1999), which, in turn, became the first volume of the &quot;Greatwinter&quot; trilogy, a unique mix of the generally anti-genres steampunk and cyberpunk. This was followed by the &quot;Moonworlds&quot; series, which saw McMullen blend science and romance in a fantasy setting. His most recent series is the &quot;Century War&quot; series for young adult readers, set in Melbourne in 1901.

McMullen&#x27;s non-fiction work includes &quot;Strange Constellations: A History of Australian Science Fiction&quot;, a history of Australian science fiction jointly written with Van Ikin and Russell Blackford. He also co-wrote the first histories of Australian fantasy and horror with Steven Paulsen.

McMullen has a degree in physics and history from Melbourne University (1974), a postgraduate degree in library and information science, and a PhD in Medieval Literature.

He was a professional musician in the 1970s, concentrating on singing and guitar playing.

McMullen has recently retired from a career in scientific computing to concentrate on his literary work.

He is a fourth dan black belt in karate, teaching at the Melbourne University Karate club.

He is the father of C. S. McMullen, an Australian speculative fiction author.

<text>Languages of India belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians; both families together are sometimes known as Indic languages. Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population belong to the Austroasiatic, Sino–Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, and a few other minor language families and isolates. According to the People&#x27;s Linguistic Survey of India, India has the second highest number of languages (780), after Papua New Guinea (840). &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists a lower number of 456.

Article 343 of the Constitution of India stated that the official language of the Union is Hindi in Devanagari script, with official use of English to continue for 15 years from 1947. In 1963, a constitutional amendment, , allowed for the continuation of English alongside Hindi in the Indian government indefinitely until legislation decides to change it. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union are &quot;the international form of Indian numerals&quot;, which are referred to as Arabic numerals in most English-speaking countries. Despite some misconceptions, Hindi is not the national language of India; the Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language.

The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as &quot;scheduled&quot; languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of &quot;classical language&quot; to Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Pali, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu. This status is given to languages that have a rich heritage and independent nature.

According to the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 &quot;major&quot; languages and 1599 &quot;other&quot; languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in the definition of the terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot;. The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people. Three contact languages have played an important role in the history of India in chronological order: Sanskrit, Persian and English. Persian was the court language during the Indo-Muslim period in India and reigned as an administrative language for several centuries until the era of British colonisation. English continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher education and in some areas of the Indian government.

Hindi, which has the largest number of first-language speakers in India today, serves as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; across much of northern and central India. However, there have been concerns raised with Hindi being imposed in South India, most notably in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Some in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam, Punjab and other non-Hindi regions have also started to voice concerns about imposition of Hindi. Bengali is the second most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant number of speakers in eastern and northeastern regions. Marathi is the third most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant number of speakers in the southwest, followed closely by Telugu, which is most commonly spoken in southeastern areas.

Hindi is the fastest growing language of India, followed by Kashmiri in the second place, with Meitei (officially called Manipuri) as well as Gujarati, in the third place, and Bengali in the fourth place, according to the 2011 census of India.

According to the Ethnologue, India has 148 Sino-Tibetan, 140 Indo-European, 84 Dravidian, 32 Austro-Asiatic, 14 Andamanese, 5 Kra-Dai languages.

==History==

The Southern Indian languages are from the Dravidian family. The Dravidian languages are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. Proto-Dravidian languages were spoken in India in the 4th millennium BCE and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE. The Dravidian languages are classified in four groups: North, Central (Kolami–Parji), South-Central (Telugu–Kui), and South Dravidian (Tamil-Kannada).

The Northern Indian languages from the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family evolved from Old Indo-Aryan by way of the Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrit languages and Apabhraṃśa of the Middle Ages. The Indo-Aryan languages developed and emerged in three stages — Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE to 600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan stage (600 BCE and 1000 CE), and New Indo-Aryan (between 1000 CE and 1300 CE). The modern north Indian Indo-Aryan languages all evolved into distinct, recognisable languages in the New Indo-Aryan Age.

In the Northeast India, among the Sino-Tibetan languages, Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language) was the court language of the Manipur Kingdom (). It was honoured before and during the darbar sessions before Manipur was merged into the Dominion of the Indian Republic. Its history of existence spans from 1500 to 2000 years according to most eminent scholars including Padma Vibhushan awardee Suniti Kumar Chatterji. Even according to the &quot;Manipur State Constitution Act, 1947&quot; of the once independent Manipur, Manipuri and English were made the court languages of the kingdom (before merging into Indian Republic).

Persian, or &quot;Farsi&quot;, was brought into India by the Ghaznavids and other Turko-Afghan dynasties as the court language. Culturally Persianized, they, in combination with the later Mughal dynasty (of Turco-Mongol origin), influenced the art, history, and literature of the region for more than 500 years, resulting in the Persianisation of many Indian tongues, mainly lexically. In 1837, the British replaced Persian with English and Hindustani in Perso-Arabic script for administrative purposes and the Hindi movement of the 19th Century replaced Persianised vocabulary with Sanskrit derivations and replaced or supplemented the use of Perso-Arabic script for administrative purposes with Devanagari.

Each of the northern Indian languages had different influences. For example, Hindustani was strongly influenced by Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian, leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language.
Bangla on the other hand has retained its Sanskritic roots while heavily expanding its vocabulary with words from Persian, English, French and other foreign languages.

==Inventories==

The first official survey of language diversity in the Indian subcontinent was carried out by Sir George Abraham Grierson from 1898 to 1928. Titled the Linguistic Survey of India, it reported a total of 179 languages and 544 dialects. However, the results were skewed due to ambiguities in distinguishing between &quot;dialect&quot; and &quot;language&quot;, use of untrained personnel and under-reporting of data from South India, as the former provinces of Burma and Madras, as well as the princely states of Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore were not included in the survey.

Different sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; are defined and grouped. &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, produced by the Christian evangelist organisation SIL International, lists 435 tongues for India (out of 6,912 worldwide), 424 of which are living, while 11 are extinct. The 424 living languages are further subclassified in &quot;Ethnologue&quot; as follows:
* Institutional– 45
* Stable– 248
* Endangered– 131
* Extinct– 11

The People&#x27;s Linguistic Survey of India, a privately owned research institution in India, has recorded over 66 different scripts and more than 780 languages in India during its nationwide survey, which the organisation claims to be the biggest linguistic survey in India.

The People of India (POI) project of Anthropological Survey of India reported 325 languages which are used for in-group communication by 5,633 Indian communities.

===Census of India figures===
The Census of India records and publishes data with respect to the number of speakers for languages and dialects, but uses its own unique terminology, distinguishing between &quot;language&quot; and &quot;mother tongue&quot;. The mother tongues are grouped within each language. Many of the mother tongues so defined could be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is especially so for many mother tongues with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the language Hindi.

; 1951 Census
Separate figures for Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi were not issued, due to the fact the returns were intentionally recorded incorrectly in states such as East Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, PEPSU, and Bilaspur.

; 1961 Census
The 1961 census recognised 1,652 mother tongues spoken by 438,936,918 people, counting all declarations made by any individual at the time when the census was conducted. However, the declaring individuals often mixed names of languages with those of dialects, subdialects and dialect clusters or even castes, professions, religions, localities, regions, countries and nationalities. The list therefore includes languages with barely a few individual speakers as well as 530 unclassified mother tongues and more than 100 idioms that are non-native to India, including linguistically unspecific demonyms such as &quot;African&quot;, &quot;Canadian&quot; or &quot;Belgian&quot;.

; 1991 Census
The 1991 census recognises 1,576 classified mother tongues. According to the 1991 census, 22 languages had more than a million native speakers, 50 had more than 100,000 and 114 had more than 10,000 native speakers. The remaining accounted for a total of 566,000 native speakers (out of a total of 838 million Indians in 1991).

; 2001 Census
According to the census of 2001, there are 1,635 rationalised mother tongues, 234 identifiable mother tongues and 22 major languages. Of these, 29 languages have more than a million native speakers, 60 have more than 100,000 and 122 have more than 10,000 native speakers. There are a few languages like Kodava that do not have a script but have a group of native speakers in Coorg (Kodagu).

; 2011 Census
According to the most recent census of 2011, after thorough linguistic scrutiny, edit, and rationalization on 19,569 raw linguistic affiliations, the census recognizes 1,369 rationalized mother tongues and 1,474 names which were treated as ‘unclassified’ and relegated to ‘other’ mother tongue category. Among, the 1,369 rationalized mother tongues which are spoken by 10,000 or more speakers, are further grouped into appropriate set that resulted into total 121 languages. In these 121 languages, 22 are already part of the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India and the other 99 are termed as &quot;Total of other languages&quot; which is one short as of the other languages recognized in 2001 census.

==Multilingualism==

===2011 Census India===

==Language families==
Ethnolinguistically, the languages of South Asia, echoing the complex history and geography of the region, form a complex patchwork of language families, language phyla and isolates. Languages spoken in India belong to several language families, the major ones being the Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 78.05% of Indians and the Dravidian languages spoken by 19.64% of Indians. The most important language families in terms of speakers are:

===Indo-Aryan language family===

The largest of the language families represented in India, in terms of speakers, is the Indo-Aryan language family, a branch of the Indo-Iranian family, itself the easternmost, extant subfamily of the Indo-European language family. This language family predominates, accounting for some 1035 million speakers, or over 76.5 of the population, per a 2018 estimate. The most widely spoken languages of this group are Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Odia, Maithili, Punjabi, Marwari, Kashmiri, Assamese (Asamiya), Chhattisgarhi and Sindhi. Aside from the Indo-Aryan languages, other Indo-European languages are also spoken in India, the most prominent of which is English, as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

===Dravidian language family===
The second largest language family is the Dravidian language family, accounting for some 277 million speakers, or approximately 20.5% per 2018 estimate. The Dravidian languages are spoken mainly in southern India and parts of eastern and central India as well as in parts of northeastern Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. Besides the mainstream population, Dravidian languages are also spoken by small scheduled tribe communities, such as the Oraon and Gond tribes. Only two Dravidian languages are exclusively spoken outside India, Brahui in Balochistan, Pakistan and Dhangar, a dialect of Kurukh, in Nepal.

===Austroasiatic language family===
Families with smaller numbers of speakers are Austroasiatic and numerous small Sino-Tibetan languages, with some 10 and 6 million speakers, respectively, together 3% of the population.

The Austroasiatic language family (&quot;austro&quot; meaning South) is the autochthonous language in Southeast Asia, arrived by migration. Austroasiatic languages of mainland India are the Khasi and Munda languages, including Bhumij and Santali. The languages of the Nicobar islands also form part of this language family. With the exceptions of Khasi and Santali, all Austroasiatic languages on Indian territory are endangered.

===Tibeto-Burman language family===
The Tibeto-Burman language family is well represented in India. However, their interrelationships are not discernible, and the family has been described as &quot;a patch of leaves on the forest floor&quot; rather than with the conventional metaphor of a &quot;family tree&quot;.

Padma Vibhushan awardee Indian Bengali scholar Suniti Kumar Chatterjee said, &quot;Among the various Tibeto-Burman languages, the most important and in literature certainly of much greater importance than Newari, is the Meitei or Manipuri language&quot;.

In India, Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken across the Himalayas in the regions of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam (hills and autonomous councils), Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and West Bengal.

Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in India include two constitutionally recognised official languages, Meitei (officially known as Manipuri) and Bodo as well as the non-scheduled languages like Karbi, Lepcha, and many varieties of several related Tibetic, West Himalayish, Tani, Brahmaputran, Angami–Pochuri, Tangkhul, Zeme, Kukish sub linguistic branches, amongst many others.

===Tai-Kadai language family===

The Ahom language, a Southwestern Tai language, had been once the dominant language of the Ahom Kingdom in modern-day Assam, but was later replaced by the Assamese language (known as Kamrupi in ancient era which is the pre-form of the Kamrupi dialect of today). Nowadays, small Tai communities and their languages remain in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh together with Sino-Tibetans, e.g. Tai Phake, Tai Aiton and Tai Khamti, which are similar to the Shan language of Shan State, Myanmar; the Dai language of Yunnan, China; the Lao language of Laos; the Thai language of Thailand; and the Zhuang language in Guangxi, China.

===Andamanese language families===
The languages of the Andaman Islands form another group:
* the Great Andamanese languages, comprising a number of extinct, and one highly endangered language Aka-Jeru.
* the Ongan family of the southern Andaman Islands, comprising two extant languages, Önge and Jarawa, and one extinct language, Jangil.

In addition, Sentinelese is thought likely to be related to the above languages.

===Language isolates===
The only language found in the Indian mainland that is considered a language isolate is Nihali. The status of Nihali is ambiguous, having been considered as a distinct Austroasiatic language, as a dialect of Korku and also as being a &quot;thieves&#x27; argot&quot; rather than a legitimate language.

The other language isolates found in the rest of South Asia include Burushaski, a language spoken in Gilgit–Baltistan (administered by Pakistan), Kusunda (in western Nepal), and Vedda (in Sri Lanka). The validity of the Great Andamanese language group as a language family has been questioned and it has been considered a language isolate by some authorities. The Hruso language, which is long assumed to be a Sino-Tibetan language, it may actually be a language isolate. Roger Blench classifies the Shompen language of the Nicobar Islands as a language isolate. Roger Blench also considers Puroik to be a language isolate.

In addition, a Bantu language, Sidi, was spoken until the mid-20th century in Gujarat by the Siddi.

==Official languages==

===Federal level===

After Mughal rule and prior to Independence, in British India, English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes.

In 1946, the issue of national language was a bitterly contested subject in the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India, specifically what should be the language in which the Constitution of India is written and the language spoken during the proceedings of Parliament and thus deserving of the epithet &quot;national&quot;.
The Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language.

Members belonging to the northern parts of India insisted that the Constitution be drafted in Hindi with the unofficial translation in English. This was not agreed to by the drafting committee on the grounds that English was much better to craft the nuanced prose on constitutional subjects. The efforts to make Hindi the pre-eminent language were bitterly resisted by the members from those parts of India where Hindi was not spoken natively.

Eventually, a compromise was reached not to include any mention of a national language. Instead, Hindi in Devanagari script was declared to be the official language of the union, but for &quot;fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution, the English Language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement.&quot;

Article 343 (1) of the Constitution of India states &quot;The Official Language of the Union government shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.&quot; Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965.

As the date for changeover approached, however, there was much alarm in the non-Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal, Karnataka, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly, Jawaharlal Nehru ensured the enactment of the , which provided that English &quot;may&quot; still be used with Hindi for official purposes, even after 1965. The wording of the text proved unfortunate in that while Nehru understood that &quot;may&quot; meant shall, politicians championing the cause of Hindi thought it implied exactly the opposite.

In the event, as 1965 approached, India&#x27;s new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri prepared to make Hindi paramount with effect from 26 January 1965. This led to widespread agitation, riots, self-immolations, and suicides in Tamil Nadu. The split of Congress politicians from the South from their party stance, the resignation of two Union ministers from the South, and the increasing threat to the country&#x27;s unity forced Shastri to concede.

As a result, the proposal was dropped, and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.

====Hindi====

In the 2001 census, 422 million (422,048,642) people in India reported Hindi to be their native language. This figure not only included Hindi speakers of Hindustani, but also people who identify as native speakers of related languages who consider their speech to be a dialect of Hindi, the Hindi belt. Hindi (or Hindustani) is the native language of most people living in Delhi and Western Uttar Pradesh.

&quot;Modern Standard Hindi&quot;, a standardised language is one of the official languages of the Union of India. In addition, it is one of only two languages used for business in Parliament. However, the Rajya Sabha now allows all 22 official languages on the Eighth Schedule to be spoken.

Hindustani, evolved from &quot;khari boli&quot; (खड़ी बोली), a prominent tongue of Mughal times, which itself evolved from Apabhraṃśa, an intermediary transition stage from Prakrit, from which the major North Indian Indo-Aryan languages have evolved.

By virtue of its being a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, Hindi has also developed regional dialects such as Bambaiya Hindi in Mumbai. In addition, a trade language, Andaman Creole Hindi has also developed in the Andaman Islands. In addition, by use in popular culture such as songs and films, Hindi also serves as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; across North-Central India.

Hindi is widely taught both as a primary language and language of instruction and as a second tongue in many states.

====English====

British colonialism in India resulted in English becoming a language for governance, business, and education. English, along with Hindi, is one of the two languages permitted in the Constitution of India for business in Parliament. Despite the fact that Hindi has official Government patronage and serves as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; over large parts of India, there was considerable opposition to the use of Hindi in the southern states of India, and English has emerged as a de facto &quot;lingua franca&quot; over much of India. Journalist Manu Joseph, in a 2011 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that due to the prominence and usage of the language and the desire for English-language education, &quot;English is the de facto national language of India. It is a bitter truth.&quot; English language proficiency is highest among urban residents, wealthier Indians, Indians with higher levels of educational attainment, Christians, men and younger Indians. In 2017, more than 58 percent of rural teens could read basic English, and 53 percent of fourteen year-olds &amp; sixty percent of 18-year-olds could read English sentences.

===Scheduled languages===

Until the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1967, the country recognised 14 official regional languages. The Eighth Schedule and the Seventy-First Amendment provided for the inclusion of Sindhi, Konkani, Meitei and Nepali, thereby increasing the number of official regional languages of India to 18. The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, as of 1 December 2007, lists 22 languages, which are given in the table below together with the regions where they are used.

The individual states, the borders of most of which are or were drawn on socio-linguistic lines, can legislate their own official languages, depending on their linguistic demographics. The official languages chosen reflect the predominant as well as politically significant languages spoken in that state. Certain states having a linguistically defined territory may have only the predominant language in that state as its official language, examples being Karnataka and Gujarat, which have Kannada and Gujarati as their sole official language respectively. Telangana, with a sizeable Urdu-speaking Muslim population, and Andhra Pradesh has two languages, Telugu and Urdu, as its official languages.

Some states buck the trend by using minority languages as official languages. Jammu and Kashmir used to have Urdu, which is spoken by fewer than 1% of the population, as the sole official language until 2020. Meghalaya uses English spoken by 0.01% of the population. This phenomenon has turned majority languages into &quot;minority languages&quot; in a functional sense.

In addition to states and union territories, India has autonomous administrative regions which may be permitted to select their own official language – a case in point being the Bodoland Territorial Council in Assam which has declared the Bodo language as official for the region, in addition to Assamese and English already in use. and Bengali in the Barak Valley, as its official languages.

==Prominent languages of India==
===Hindi===

In British India, English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes. When India became independent in 1947, the Indian legislators had the challenge of choosing a language for official communication as well as for communication between different linguistic regions across India. The choices available were:
* Making &quot;Hindi&quot;, which a plurality of the people (41%) identified as their native language, the official language.
* Making English, as preferred by non-Hindi speakers, particularly Kannadigas and Tamils, and those from Mizoram and Nagaland, the official language. &quot;See also Anti-Hindi agitations&quot;.
* Declare both Hindi and English as official languages and each state is given freedom to choose the official language of the state.

The Indian constitution, in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965. The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non-Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in South India whose native tongues are not related to Hindi. As a result, Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963, which provided for the continued use of English for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965.

===Bengali===

Native to the Bengal region, comprising the nation of Bangladesh and the states of West Bengal, Tripura and Barak Valley region of Assam. Bengali (also spelt as &quot;Bangla&quot;: বাংলা) is the sixth most spoken language in the world. After the partition of India (1947), refugees from East Pakistan were settled in Tripura, and Jharkhand and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. There is also a large number of Bengali-speaking people in Maharashtra and Gujarat where they work as artisans in jewellery industries. Bengali developed from Abahattha, a derivative of Apabhramsha, itself derived from Magadhi Prakrit. The modern Bengali vocabulary contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, also borrowings from Sanskrit and other major borrowings from Persian, Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages in contact with.

Like most Indian languages, Bengali has a number of dialects. It exhibits diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language. Bengali language has developed a rich cultural base spanning art, music, literature, and religion. Bengali has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, dating from about 10th to 12th century (&#x27;Charyapada&#x27; Buddhist songs). There have been many movements in defence of this language and in 1999 UNESCO declared 21 Feb as the International Mother Language Day in commemoration of the Bengali Language Movement in 1952.

===Assamese===
Asamiya or Assamese language is most spoken in the state of Assam. It is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language with more than 23 million total speakers including more than 15 million native speakers and more than 7 million L2 speakers per the 2011 Census of India. Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Assamese evolved at least before the 7th century CE from the middle Indo-Aryan Magadhi Prakrit. Assamese is unusual among Eastern Indo-Aryan languages for the presence of the (which, phonetically, varies between velar () and a uvular () pronunciations). The first characteristics of this language are seen in the Charyapadas composed in between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The first examples emerged in writings of court poets in the fourteenth century, the finest example of which is Madhav Kandali&#x27;s Saptakanda Ramayana composed during 14th century CE, which was the first translation of the Ramayana into an Indo-Aryan language.

===Marathi===

Marathi is an Indo-Aryan language. It is the official language and co-official language in Maharashtra and Goa states of Western India respectively, and is one of the official languages of India. There were 83 million speakers of the language in 2011. Marathi has the third-largest number of native speakers in India and ranks 10th in the list of most spoken languages in the world. Marathi has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages; Oldest stone inscriptions from 8th century &amp; literature dating from about 1100 AD (Mukundraj&#x27;s &quot;Vivek Sindhu&quot; dates to the 12th century). The major dialects of Marathi are Standard Marathi (Pramaan Bhasha) and the Varhadi dialect. There are other related languages such as Ahirani, Dangi, Vadvali, Samavedi. Malvani Konkani has been heavily influenced by Marathi varieties. Marathi is one of several languages that descend from Maharashtri Prakrit. The further change led to the Apabhraṃśa languages like Old Marathi.

Marathi Language Day (मराठी दिन/मराठी दिवस (transl. Marathi Dina/Marathi Diwasa) is celebrated on 27 February every year across the Indian states of Maharashtra and Goa. This day is regulated by the State Government. It is celebrated on the birthday of eminent Marathi Poet Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar, popularly known as Kusumagraj .

Marathi is the official language of Maharashtra and co-official language in the union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. In Goa, Konkani is the sole official language; however, Marathi may also be used for all official purposes.

Over a period of many centuries the Marathi language and people came into contact with many other languages and dialects. The primary influence of Prakrit, Maharashtri, Apabhraṃśa and Sanskrit is understandable. Marathi has also been influenced by the Austroasiatic, Dravidian and foreign languages such as Persian and Arabic. Marathi contains loanwords from Persian, Arabic, English and a little from French and Portuguese.

===Meitei===

&quot;Meitei language&quot; (officially known as &quot;Manipuri language&quot;) is the most widely spoken Indian Sino-Tibetan language of Tibeto-Burman linguistic sub branch. It is the sole official language in Manipur and is one of the official languages of India. It is one of the two Sino-Tibetan languages with official status in India, beside Bodo. It has been recognized as one of the advanced modern languages of India by the National Sahitya Academy for its rich literature. It uses both Meitei script as well as Bengali script for writing.

==Other regional languages and dialects==
The 2001 census identified the following native languages having more than one million speakers. Most of them are dialects/variants grouped under Hindi.

===Practical problems===
India has several languages in use; choosing any single language as an official language presents problems to all those whose &quot;mother tongue&quot; is different. However, all the boards of education across India recognise the need for training people to one common language. There are complaints that in North India, non-Hindi speakers have language trouble. Similarly, there are complaints that North Indians have to undergo difficulties on account of language when travelling to South India. It is common to hear of incidents that result due to friction between those who strongly believe in the chosen official language, and those who follow the thought that the chosen language(s) do not take into account everyone&#x27;s preferences. Local official language commissions have been established and various steps are being taken in a direction to reduce tensions and friction.

==Languages by earliest known inscriptions==
Earliest known manuscripts are often subjected to debates and disputes, due to the conflicting opinions and assumptions of different scholars, claiming high antiquity of the languages. So, inscriptions are studied more in depth for understanding the chronology of the oldest known languages of the Indian subcontinent.
==Language policy==

The Union Government of India formulated the Three language formula.

==Language conflicts==
There are conflicts over linguistic rights in India. The first major linguistic conflict, known as the Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu, took place in Tamil Nadu against the implementation of Hindi as the official language of India. Political analysts consider this as a major factor in bringing DMK to power and leading to the ousting and nearly total elimination of the Congress party in Tamil Nadu. Strong cultural pride based on language is also found in other Indian states such as Assam, Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and Maharashtra. To express disapproval of the imposition of Hindi on its states&#x27; people as a result of the central government, the government of Maharashtra made the state language Marathi mandatory in educational institutions of CBSE and ICSE through Class/Grade 10.

The Government of India attempts to assuage these conflicts with various campaigns, coordinated by the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, a branch of the Department of Higher Education, Language Bureau, and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

<text>Pakistan is a multilingual country with over 70 languages spoken as first languages. The majority of Pakistan&#x27;s languages belong to the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European language family.

Urdu is the national language and the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Pakistan, and while sharing official status with English, it is the preferred and dominant language used for inter-communication between different ethnic groups. Numerous regional languages are spoken as first languages by Pakistan&#x27;s various ethnolinguistic groups. 

According to the 2023 census, languages with more than a million speakers each include Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Urdu, Balochi, Hindko, Brahui, Mewati and the Kohistani languages. The census excludes data from Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, therefore Shina and Balti population might not be exact. There are approximately 60 local languages with fewer than a million speakers.

== List of languages ==
The 2022 edition of &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists 77 established languages in Pakistan. Of these, 68 are indigenous and 9 are non-indigenous. In terms of their vitality, 4 are classified as &#x27;institutional&#x27;, 24 are &#x27;developing&#x27;, 30 are &#x27;vigorous&#x27;, 15 are &#x27;in trouble&#x27;, and 4 are &#x27;dying&#x27;.

== Statistics ==


== Official languages ==
=== Urdu (official language) ===

 Urdu () is the national language () and &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Pakistan. Although only about 9% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language, it is widely spoken and understood as a second language by the vast majority of Pakistanis.

Urdu was chosen as a symbol of unity for the new state of Pakistan in 1947, because it had already served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; among Muslims in north and northwest British India. It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan, and together with English as the main languages of instruction, although the people from differing provinces may have different native languages.

Urdu is taught as a compulsory subject up to higher secondary school in both English and Urdu medium school systems, which has produced millions of second-language Urdu speakers among people whose native language is one of the other languages of Pakistan – which in turn has led to the absorption of vocabulary from various regional Pakistani languages, while some Urdu vocabularies has also been assimilated by Pakistan&#x27;s regional languages.

=== English (co-official language) ===

English is a co-official language of Pakistan and is widely used in the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as to some extent in the officer ranks of Pakistan&#x27;s armed forces. Pakistan&#x27;s Constitution and laws were written in English and are now being re-written in the local languages. It is also widely used in schools, colleges and universities as a medium of instruction. English is seen as the language of upward mobility, and its use is becoming more prevalent in upper social circles, where it is often spoken alongside native Pakistani languages. In 2015, it was announced that there were plans to promote Urdu in official business, but Pakistan&#x27;s Minister of Planning Ahsan Iqbal stated, &quot;Urdu will be a second medium of language and all official business will be bilingual.&quot; He also went on to say that English would be taught alongside Urdu in schools.

== Major regional languages ==
=== Punjabi ===
Punjabi () is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in the Punjab province of Pakistan, with the prominent dialect being the Majha dialect, written in the Shahmukhi script. Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan. It is spoken as a first language by 36.98% of Pakistanis. The language is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.

=== Pashto ===

Pashto () is an Iranian language spoken as a first language by more than 18.15% of Pakistanis, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in northern Balochistan as well as in ethnic Pashtun communities in the cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and most notably Karachi, which may have the largest Pashtun population of any city in the world. There are three major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are the Pakhto variety of Northern (Peshawar) variety, the southern Pashto spoken in the vicinity of Quetta, and the Wanetsi or Tareeno variety of northern Balochistan.

=== Sindhi ===

Sindhi () is an Indo-Aryan language spoken as a first language by almost 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The name &quot;Sindhi&quot; is derived from &quot;Sindhu&quot;, the original name of the Indus River.

Like other languages of this family, Sindhi has passed through Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) and Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and Apabhramsha) stages of growth. 20th century Western scholars such as George Abraham Grierson believed that Sindhi descended specifically from the Vrācaḍa dialect of Apabhramsha (described by Markandeya as being spoken in &quot;Sindhu-deśa&quot;) but later work has shown this to be unlikely. It entered the New Indo-Aryan stage around the 10th century CE.

The six major known dialects of the Sindhi language are Siroli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kutchi.

=== Saraiki ===

Saraiki () is a collective term for Southern-Punjabi dialects of the Lahnda group, spoken in central and southeastern Pakistan, primarily in the southern part of the province of Punjab. Saraiki is to a high degree mutually intelligible with Standard Punjabi and is coshares with it a large portion of its vocabulary and morphology. At the same time in its phonology it is radically different (particularly in the lack of tones, the preservation of the voiced aspirates and the development of implosive consonants)

Saraiki is spoken by approximately 26 million people in Pakistan, ranging across southern Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and border regions of northern Sindh and eastern Balochistan.

=== Balochi ===

Balochi () is an Iranian language spoken as a first language by about 3% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Balochistan province. Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. Sarhaddi is a sub-dialect of Rakshani. Other sub-dialects are Kalati (Qalati), Chagai-Kharani and Panjguri. Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi is very different from the rest.

=== Hindko ===

Hindko ()is an Indo-Aryan language group of Lahnda dialects spoken in several discontinuous areas in northwestern Pakistan, primarily in the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
Hindko is mutually intelligible with Punjabi and Saraiki, and has more affinities with the latter than with the former. Differences with other Punjabi varieties are more pronounced in the morphology and phonology than in the syntax.
The word &quot;Hindko&quot;, commonly used to refer to a number of Indo-Aryan dialects spoken in the neighbourhood of Pashto, likely originally meant &quot;the Indian language&quot; (in contrast to Pashto). An alternative local name for this language group is &quot;Hindki&quot;.

=== Brahui ===

Brahui () is a Dravidian language spoken in the central part of Balochistan province. Brahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in Kalat, Khuzdar and Mastung districts, but also in smaller numbers in neighboring districts, as well as in Afghanistan which borders Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group no longer speak Brahui.

== Endangered languages ==

Other languages spoken by linguistic minorities include the languages listed below, with speakers ranging from a few dozen to tens of thousands. A few are highly endangered languages that may soon have no speakers at all. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization defines five levels of language endangerment between &quot;safe&quot; (not endangered) and &quot;extinct&quot;:

* Vulnerable - &quot;most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home)&quot;
* Definitely endangered – &quot;children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home&quot;
* Severely endangered – &quot;language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves&quot;
* Critically endangered – &quot;the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently&quot;
* Extinct – &quot;there are no speakers left; included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s&quot;

The list below includes the findings from the third edition of &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; (2010; formerly the &quot;Red Book of Endangered Languages&quot;), as well as the online edition of the aforementioned publication, both published by UNESCO.
== Other languages ==
=== Arabic ===
Arabic is used as a religious language by Muslims. The Quran, Sunnah, Hadith and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Urdu translation. Arabic is taught as a religious language in mosques, schools, colleges, universities and madrassahs. A majority of Pakistan&#x27;s Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of Arabic as part of their religious education. However, Pakistanis do not speak Arabic.

Arabic is mentioned in the constitution of Pakistan. It declares in article 31 No. 2 that &quot;The State shall endeavour, as respects the Muslims of Pakistan (a) to make the teaching of the Holy Quran and Islamiat compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of Arabic language ...&quot;

The National Education Policy 2017 declares in article 3.7.4 that: &quot;Arabic as compulsory part will be integrated in Islamiyat from Middle to Higher Secondary level to enable the students to understand the Holy Quran.&quot; Furthermore, it specifies in article 3.7.6: &quot;Arabic as elective subject shall be offered properly at Secondary and Higher Secondary level with Arabic literature and grammar in its course to enable the learners to have command in the language.&quot; This law is also valid for private schools as it defines in article 3.7.12: &quot;The curriculum in Islamiyat, Arabic and Moral Education of public sector will be adopted by the private institutions to make uniformity in the society.&quot;

=== Persian ===
Persian was the official of the region up until the late 19th century when the English passed several laws to replace it with local languages. Persian had a long history in the lands of Pakistan and was the cultural language of the erstwhile Mughal Empire, a continuation since the introduction of the language by Central Asian Turkic invaders who migrated into the Indian Subcontinent, and the patronisation of it by the earlier Turko-Persian Delhi Sultanate. Persian was officially abolished as a language of administration with the arrival of the British: in Sindh in 1843 and in Punjab in 1849.

Today the eastern Dari dialect of Persian is spoken by refugees from Afghanistan and a small number of local Balochistani Hazara community. A larger number of Pakistani Hazaras speak Hazaragi dialect. In the Madaklasht valley of Chitral, the Madaklashti dialect of Tajik Persian is spoken by the descendants of ironmongers from Badakhshan who settled there in the eighteenth century.

=== Foreign languages ===
 some Pakistanis are learning Mandarin to do business with companies from the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Classification ==

=== Indo-Iranian ===
Most of the languages of Pakistan belong to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. The common ancestor of all of the languages in this family is called Proto-Indo-Iranian—also known as Common Aryan—which was spoken in approximately the late 3rd millennium BC. The three branches of the modern Indo-Iranian languages are Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and Nuristani. A fourth independent branch, Dardic, was previously posited, but recent scholarship in general places Dardic languages as archaic members of the Indo-Aryan branch.

==== Indo-Aryan ====
Majority of the languages spoken in eastern regions of Pakistan belong to the Indo-Aryan group.

Modern Indo-Aryan languages descend from Old Indo-Aryan languages such as early Vedic Sanskrit, through Middle Indo-Aryan languages (or Prakrits).

Some of the important languages in this family are dialect continuums. One of these is Lahnda, and includes Saraiki (spoken mostly in southern Pakistani Punjab by about 26 million people), the diverse varieties of Hindko (with almost five million speakers in north-western Punjab and neighbouring regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially Hazara), Pahari/Pothwari (3.5 million speakers in the Pothohar region of Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Indian Jammu and Kashmir), Khetrani (20,000 speakers in Balochistan), and Inku (a possibly extinct language of Afghanistan).

==== Iranian ====
Majority of the languages spoken in western regions of Pakistan belong to the Iranic group. There are several dialects continuums in this family as well: Balochi, which includes Eastern, Western and Southern Balochi; and Pashto, and includes Northern, Central, and Southern Pashto.

=== Other ===
The following three languages of Pakistan are not part of the Indo-European language family:

* Brahui (spoken in central Balochistan province) is a Dravidian language. Its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by Balochi. It is an individual language in the Dravidian language family and does not belong to any subgrouping in that language family. 
* The Balti dialect of Ladakhi (spoken in an area of southern Gilgit–Baltistan) is a Tibetan language of the Tibeto-Burman language family.
* Burushaski (spoken in Hunza, Nagar, Yasin, and Ishkoman valleys in Gilgit–Baltistan) is a language isolate with no indigenous written script and instead currently uses Urdu script, based on the Perso-Arabic script.

== Writing systems ==
Most languages of Pakistan are written in the Perso-Arabic script. The Mughal Empire adopted Persian as the court language during their rule over South Asia as did their predecessors, such as the Ghaznavids. During this time, the Nastaʿlīq style of the Perso-Arabic script came into widespread use in South Asia, and the influence remains to this day. In Pakistan, almost everything in Urdu is written in the script, concentrating the greater part of Nastaʿlīq usage in the world.
The Urdu alphabet is a right-to-left alphabet. It is a modification of the Persian alphabet, which is itself a derivative of the Arabic alphabet. With 38 letters, the Urdu alphabet is typically written in the calligraphic Nasta&#x27;liq script.

Sindhi adopted a variant of the Persian alphabet as well, in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan today, albeit unlike most other native languages of Pakistan, the Naskh style is more common for Sindhi writing than the Nasta&#x27;liq style. It has a total of 52 letters, augmenting the Urdu with digraphs and eighteen new letters () for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.

Balochi and Pashto are written in Perso-Arabic script. The Shahmukhī script, a variant of the Urdu alphabet, is used to write the Punjabi language in Pakistan.

Usually, bare transliterations of Urdu into Roman letters, Roman Urdu, omit many phonemic elements that have no equivalent in English or other languages commonly written in the Latin script. The National Language Authority of Pakistan has developed a number of systems with specific notations to signify non-English sounds, but these can only be properly read by someone already familiar with Urdu.

<text>HIV/AIDS denialism is the belief, despite conclusive evidence to the contrary, that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but argue that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, haemophilia, or the effects of the medications used to treat HIV infection (antiretrovirals).

The scientific consensus is that the evidence showing HIV to be the cause of AIDS is conclusive and that HIV/AIDS denialist claims are pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories, faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. As evidence mounted against denialism, combined with those with HIV/AIDS living much longer, these claims stopped being believed. With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, HIV/AIDS denialist material is now targeted at less scientifically sophisticated audiences and spread mainly through the Internet, increased substantially since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki. Scientists and physicians have raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism, which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments. Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS-related deaths, along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections, to the South African government&#x27;s former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism. The interrupted use of antiretroviral treatments is also a major global concern as it potentially increases the likelihood of the emergence of antiretroviral-resistant strains of the virus.
==History==
A constellation of symptoms named &quot;gay-related immune deficiency&quot; was noted in 1982. In 1983, a group of scientists and doctors at the Pasteur Institute in France, led by Luc Montagnier, discovered a new virus in a patient with signs and symptoms that often preceded AIDS. They named the virus &quot;lymphadenopathy-associated virus&quot;, or LAV, and sent samples to Robert Gallo&#x27;s team in the United States. Their findings were peer reviewed and slated for publication in &quot;Science&quot;.

At a 23 April 1984 press conference in Washington, D.C., Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced that Gallo and his co-workers had discovered a virus that was the &quot;probable&quot; cause of AIDS. This virus was initially named HTLV-III. In the same year, Casper Schmidt responded to Gallo&#x27;s papers with &quot;The Group-Fantasy Origins of AIDS&quot;, published in the &quot;Journal of Psychohistory&quot;. Schmidt posited that AIDS was not an actual disease, but rather an example of &quot;epidemic hysteria&quot;, in which groups of people subconsciously act out social conflicts. Schmidt compared AIDS to documented cases of epidemic hysteria in the past which were mistakenly thought to be infectious. (Schmidt himself later died of AIDS in 1994.)

In 1986, the viruses discovered by Montagnier and Gallo, found to be genetically indistinguishable, were renamed HIV.

In 1987, molecular biologist Peter Duesberg questioned the link between HIV and AIDS in the journal &quot;Cancer Research&quot;. Duesberg&#x27;s publication coincided with the start of major public health campaigns and the development of zidovudine (AZT) as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.

In 1988, a panel of the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that &quot;the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.&quot; That same year, &quot;Science&quot; published Blattner, Gallo, and Temin&#x27;s &quot;HIV causes AIDS&quot;, and Duesberg&#x27;s &quot;HIV is not the cause of AIDS&quot;. Also that same year, the Perth Group, a group of denialists based in Perth, Western Australia, led by Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos, published in the non-peer-reviewed journal &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot; their first article questioning aspects of HIV/AIDS research, arguing that there was &quot;no compelling reason for preferring the viral hypothesis of AIDS to one based on the activity of oxidising agents.&quot;

In 1989, Duesberg exercised his right as a member of the National Academy of Sciences to bypass the peer review process and published his arguments in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; (&quot;PNAS&quot;) unreviewed. The editor of &quot;PNAS&quot; initially resisted, but ultimately allowed Duesberg to publish, saying, &quot;If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader.&quot;

In 1990, the physiologist Robert Root-Bernstein published his first peer-reviewed article detailing his objections to the mainstream view of AIDS and HIV. In it, he questioned both the mainstream view and the &quot;dissident&quot; view as potentially inaccurate.

In 1991, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, comprising twelve scientists, doctors, and activists, submitted a short letter to various journals, but the letter was rejected.

In 1993, &quot;Nature&quot; published an editorial arguing that Duesberg had forfeited his right of reply by engaging in disingenuous rhetorical techniques and ignoring any evidence that conflicted with his claims. That same year, Papadopulos-Eleopulos and coauthors from the Perth Group alleged in the journal &quot;Nature Biotechnology&quot; (then edited by fellow denialist Harvey Bialy) that the western blot test for HIV was not standardized, non-reproducible, and of unknown specificity due to a claimed lack of a &quot;gold standard&quot;.

On 28 October 1994, Robert Willner, a physician whose medical license had been revoked for, among other things, treating an AIDS patient with ozone therapy, publicly jabbed his finger with blood he said was from an HIV-infected patient. Willner died in 1995 of a heart attack.

In 1995, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis published a letter in &quot;Science&quot; similar to the one they had attempted to publish in 1991. That same year, Continuum, a denialist group, placed an advertisement in the British gay and lesbian magazine &quot;The Pink Paper&quot; offering a £1,000 reward to &quot;the first person finding one scientific paper establishing actual isolation of HIV&quot;, according to a set of seven steps they claimed to have been drawn up by the Pasteur Institute in 1973. The challenge was later dismissed by various scientists, including Duesberg, asserting that HIV undoubtedly exists. Stefan Lanka argued in the same year that HIV does not exist. Also that year, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases released a report concluding that &quot;abundant epidemiologic, virologic and immunologic data support the conclusion that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the underlying cause of AIDS.&quot;

In 1996, the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; published &quot;Response: arguments contradict the &quot;foreign protein-zidovudine&quot; hypothesis&quot; as a response to a petition by Duesberg: &quot;In 1991 Duesberg challenged researchers… We and Darby et al. have provided that evidence&quot;. The paper argued that Duesberg was wrong regarding the cause of AIDS in haemophiliacs.
In 1997, The Perth Group questioned the existence of HIV, and speculated that the production of antibodies recognizing HIV proteins can be caused by allogenic stimuli and autoimmune disorders. They continued to repeat this speculation through at least 2006.

In 1998, Joan Shenton published the book &quot;Positively False: Exposing the Myths Around HIV and AIDS&quot;, which promotes AIDS denialism. In the book, Shenton claims that AIDS is a conspiracy created by pharmaceutical companies to make money from selling antiretroviral drugs.

In 2006, Celia Farber, a journalist and prominent HIV/AIDS denialist, published an essay in the March issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science&quot;, in which she summarized a number of arguments for HIV/AIDS denialism and alleged incompetence, conspiracy, and fraud on the part of the medical community. Scientists and AIDS activists extensively criticized the article as inaccurate, misleading, and poorly fact-checked.

In 2007, members of the Perth Group testified at an appeals hearing for Andre Chad Parenzee, asserting that HIV could not be transmitted by heterosexual sex. The judge concluded, &quot;I reject the evidence of Ms Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Dr Turner. I conclude… that they are not qualified to give expert opinions.&quot;

In 2009, a paper was published in the then non-peer-reviewed journal &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot; by Duesberg and four other researchers which criticized a 2008 study by Chigwedere et al., which found that HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa resulted in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from HIV/AIDS, because the government delayed the provision of antiretroviral drugs. The paper concluded that &quot;the claims that HIV has caused huge losses of African lives are unconfirmed and that HIV is not sufficient or even necessary to cause the previously known diseases, now called AIDS in the presence of antibody against HIV.&quot; Later that year, the paper was withdrawn from the journal on the grounds of it having methodological flaws, and that it contained assertions &quot;that could potentially be damaging to global public health&quot;. A revised version was later published in &quot;Italian Journal of Anatomy and Embryology&quot;.

===US courts===
In 1998, HIV/AIDS denialism and parental rights clashed with the medical establishment in court when Maine resident Valerie Emerson fought for the right to refuse to give AZT to her four-year-old son, Nikolas Emerson, after she witnessed the death of her daughter Tia, who died at the age of three in 1996. Her right to stop treatment was upheld by the court in light of &quot;her unique experience&quot;. Nikolas Emerson died eight years later. The family refused to reveal whether the death was AIDS related.

===South Africa===
In 2000, South Africa&#x27;s President Thabo Mbeki invited several HIV/AIDS denialists to join his Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel. A response named the Durban Declaration was issued affirming the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS:The declaration has been signed by over 5,000 people, including Nobel Prize winners, directors of leading research institutions, scientific academies and medical societies, notably the US National Academy of Sciences, the US Institute of Medicine, Max Planck institutes, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, the Royal Society of London, the AIDS Society of India and the National Institute of Virology in South Africa. In addition, thousands of individual scientists and doctors have signed, including many from the countries bearing the greatest burden of the epidemic. Signatories are of MD, PhD level or equivalent, although scientists working for commercial companies were asked not to sign.In 2008, University of Cape Town researcher Nicoli Nattrass, and later that year a group of Harvard scientists led by Zimbabwean physician Pride Chigwedere, each independently estimated that Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s denialist policies led to the early deaths of more than 330,000 South Africans. Barbara Hogan, the health minister appointed by Mbeki&#x27;s successor, voiced shame over the studies&#x27; findings and stated: &quot;The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa.&quot;

In 2009, Fraser McNeill wrote an article arguing that South Africa&#x27;s reluctance to openly address HIV/AIDS resulted from social conventions that prevent people from talking about causes of death in certain situations, rather than from Mbeki&#x27;s denialist views. Similarly, political scientist Anthony Butler has argued that &quot;South African HIV/AIDS policy can be explained without appeals to leadership irrationality or wider cultural denialism.&quot;

In July 2016 Aaron Motsoaledi, the Health Minister of South Africa, wrote an article for the Centre for Health Journalism in which he criticised past South African leaders for their denialism, describing it as an &quot;unlucky moment&quot; in a country which has since become a leader in treatment and prevention.

==Denialists&#x27; claims and scientific evidence==
The term &quot;HIV/AIDS denialism&quot; denotes the rejection of the mainstream scientific view that AIDS is a medical condition that is brought about by HIV infection. The use of the term encompasses the denial of the existence of the virus (HIV denialism), the denial of the causation of AIDS by HIV (that is, the proposed link between the virus and the syndrome), and the denial of the effects on the human body that are ascribed to HIV (that is, the description and characterization of the virus). In a framework incorporating the second denial and/or the third, criticism of the current scientific view has variously been rested on the claim that HIV has not been adequately isolated, that HIV does not fulfill Koch&#x27;s postulates, HIV testing is inaccurate, and/or that antibodies to HIV neutralize the virus and render it harmless. Suggested alternative causes of AIDS variously include recreational drugs, malnutrition, and the very antiretroviral drugs used to treat the syndrome.

Such claims have been examined extensively in the peer-reviewed medical and scientific literature; a scientific consensus has arisen that denialist claims have been convincingly disproved, and that HIV does indeed cause AIDS. In the cases cited by Duesberg where HIV &quot;cannot be isolated&quot;, PCR or other techniques demonstrate the presence of the virus, and denialist claims of HIV test inaccuracy result from an incorrect or outdated understanding of how HIV antibody testing is performed and interpreted. Regarding Koch&#x27;s postulates, &quot;New Scientist&quot; reported: &quot;It is debatable how appropriate it is to focus on a set of principles devised for bacterial infections in a century when viruses had not yet been discovered. HIV does, however, meet Koch&#x27;s postulates as long as they are not applied in a ridiculously stringent way&quot;. The author then demonstrated how each postulate has been met – the suspected cause is strongly associated with the disease, the suspected pathogen can be both isolated and spread outside the host, and when the suspected pathogen is transmitted to a new and uninfected host, that host develops the disease. The latter was proven in a number of tragic accidents, including an instance when multiple scientific technicians with no other known risk factors were exposed to concentrated HIV in a laboratory accident, and transmission by a dentist to patients, the majority of whom had no other known risk factor or source of exposure except the same dentist in common. In 2010, Chigwedere and Max Essex demonstrated in the medical journal &quot;AIDS and Behavior&quot; that HIV as the cause of AIDS fulfills both Koch&#x27;s postulates and the Bradford Hill criteria for causality.

Early denialist arguments held that the HIV/AIDS paradigm was flawed because it had not led to effective treatments. However, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s and dramatic improvements in survival of HIV/AIDS patients reversed this argument, as these treatments were based directly on anti-viral activity and the HIV/AIDS paradigm. The development of effective anti-AIDS therapies based on targeting of HIV has been a major factor in convincing some denialist scientists to accept the causative role of HIV in AIDS.

In a 2010 article on conspiracy theories in science, Ted Goertzel lists HIV/AIDS denialism as an example where scientific findings are being disputed on irrational grounds. He describes proponents as relying on rhetoric, appeal to fairness, and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence. They frequently invoke the meme of a &quot;courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy&quot;, invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. Regarding this comparison, Goertzel states:
==Denialist community==
Denialists often use their critique of the link between HIV and AIDS to promote alternative medicine as a cure, and attempt to convince HIV-positive individuals to avoid ARV therapy in favour of vitamins, massage, yoga and other unproven treatments. Despite this promotion, denialists will often downplay any association with alternative therapies, and attempt to portray themselves as &quot;dissidents&quot;. An article in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; stated:
Several scientists have been associated with HIV/AIDS denialism, although they have not themselves studied AIDS or HIV. One of the most famous and influential is Duesberg, professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, who since 1987 has disputed that the scientific evidence shows that HIV causes AIDS. Other scientists associated with HIV/AIDS denialism include biochemists David Rasnick and Harvey Bialy. Biologist Lynn Margulis argued that &quot;there&#x27;s no evidence that HIV is an infectious virus&quot; and that AIDS symptoms &quot;overlap...completely&quot; with those of syphilis. Pathologist Étienne de Harven also expressed sympathy for HIV/AIDS denial. AIDS researcher Seth Kalichman lists biochemist and Nobelist Kary Mullis &quot;among the who&#x27;s who of AIDS pseudoscientists&quot;. Mullis, who did not do any HIV research, expressed skepticism about the relationship between HIV and AIDS in his 1998 autobiography.

Additional notable HIV/AIDS denialists include Australian academic ethicist Hiram Caton, the late mathematician Serge Lang, former college administrator Henry Bauer, journalist Celia Farber, American talk radio host and author on alternative and complementary medicine and nutrition Gary Null, and the late activist Christine Maggiore, who encouraged HIV-positive mothers to forgo anti-HIV treatment and whose 3-year-old daughter died of complications of untreated AIDS. Nate Mendel, bassist with the rock band Foo Fighters, expressed support for HIV/AIDS denialist ideas and organized a benefit concert in January 2000 for Maggiore&#x27;s organization Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives. Organizations of HIV/AIDS denialists include the Perth Group, composed of several Australian hospital workers, and the Immunity Resource Foundation.

HIV/AIDS denialism has received some support from political conservatives in the United States. Duesberg&#x27;s work has been published in &quot;Policy Review&quot;, a journal once published by The Heritage Foundation but later acquired by the Hoover Institution, and by Regnery Publishing. Regnery published Duesberg&#x27;s &quot;Inventing the AIDS Virus&quot; in 1996, and journalist Tom Bethell&#x27;s &quot;The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science&quot;, in which he endorses HIV/AIDS denialism, in 2005. Law professor Phillip E. Johnson has accused the Centers for Disease Control of &quot;fraud&quot; in relation to HIV/AIDS. Describing the political aspects of the HIV/AIDS denialism movement, sociology professor Steven Epstein wrote in &quot;Impure Science&quot; that &quot;... the appeal of Duesberg&#x27;s views to conservatives—certainly including those with little sympathy for the gay movement—cannot be denied.&quot; The blog LewRockwell.com has also published articles supportive of HIV/AIDS denialism.

In a follow-up article in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, Nattrass overviewed the prominent members of the HIV/AIDS denialist community and discussed the reasons of the intractable staying power of HIV/AIDS denialism in spite of scientific and medical consensus supported by over two decades of evidence. She observed that despite being a disparate group of people with very different background and professions, the HIV/AIDS denialists self-organize to fill four important roles:
* &quot;Hero scientists&quot; to provide scientific legitimacy: Most notably Duesberg who plays the central role of HIV/AIDS denialism from the beginning. Others include David Rasnick, Étienne de Harven, and Kary Mullis whose Nobel Prize makes him symbolically important.
* &quot;Cultropreneurs&quot; to offer fake cures in place of antiretroviral therapy: Matthias Rath, Gary Null, Michael Ellner, and Roberto Giraldo all promote alternative medicine and remedies with a dose of conspiracy theories in the form of books, healing products, radio shows and counseling services.
* HIV-positive &quot;living icons&quot; to provide proof of concept by appearing to live healthily without antiretroviral therapy: Christine Maggiore was and still is the most important icon in the HIV/AIDS denialist movement despite the fact that she died of AIDS related complications in 2008.
* &quot;Praise singers&quot;: sympathetic journalists and filmmakers who publicize the movement with uncritical and favorable opinion. They include journalists Celia Farber, Liam Scheff and Neville Hodgkinson; filmmakers Brent Leung and Robert Leppo.
Some of them had overlapping roles as board members of Rethinking AIDS and Alive and Well AIDS Alternatives, were involved in the film &quot;House of Numbers&quot;, &quot;The Other Side of AIDS&quot; or on Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s AIDS Advisory Panel.
Nattrass argued that HIV/AIDS denialism gains social traction through powerful community-building effects where these four organized characters form &quot;a symbiotic connection between AIDS denialism and alternative healing modalities&quot; and they are &quot;facilitated by a shared conspiratorial stance toward HIV science&quot;.

===Former denialists===
Several of the few prominent scientists who once voiced doubts about HIV/AIDS have since changed their views and accepted the fact that HIV plays a role in causing AIDS, in response to an accumulation of newer studies and data. Root-Bernstein, author of &quot;Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus&quot; and formerly a critic of the causative role of HIV in AIDS, has since distanced himself from the HIV/AIDS denialist movement, saying, &quot;Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong... The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies.&quot;

Joseph Sonnabend, who until the late 1990s regarded the issue of AIDS causation as unresolved, has reconsidered in light of the success of newer antiretroviral drugs, stating, &quot;The evidence now strongly supports a role for HIV… Drugs that can save your life can also under different circumstances kill you. This is a distinction that denialists do not seem to understand.&quot; Sonnabend has also criticized HIV/AIDS denialists for falsely implying that he supports their position, saying:
A former denialist wrote in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; in 2004:
=== Death of HIV-positive denialists ===
In 2007, aidstruth.org, a website run by HIV researchers to counter denialist claims, published a partial list of HIV/AIDS denialists who had died of AIDS-related causes. For example, the editors of the magazine &quot;Continuum&quot; consistently denied the existence of HIV/AIDS. The magazine shut down after both editors died of AIDS-related causes. In each case, the HIV/AIDS denialist community attributed the deaths to unknown causes, secret drug use, or stress rather than HIV/AIDS. Similarly, several HIV-positive former dissidents have reported being ostracized by the AIDS-denialist community after they developed AIDS and decided to pursue effective antiretroviral treatment.

In 2008, activist Christine Maggiore died at the age of 52 while under a doctor&#x27;s care for pneumonia. Maggiore, mother of two children, had founded an organisation to help other HIV-positive mothers avoid taking antiretroviral drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. After her three-year-old daughter died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 2005, Maggiore continued to believe that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, and she and her husband Robin Scovill sued Los Angeles County and others on behalf of their daughter&#x27;s estate, for allegedly violating Eliza Scovill&#x27;s civil rights by releasing an autopsy report that listed her cause of death as AIDS-related pneumonia. The litigants settled out of court, with the county paying Scovill $15,000 in March 2009, with no admission of wrongdoing. The Los Angeles coroner&#x27;s ruling that Eliza Scovill died of AIDS remains the official verdict.

===Local community group denialism===
Australia: In 2009 representing the then Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network, President Meryl Dorey signed a petition claiming that &quot;the AIDS industry and the media&quot; had tricked the public and the media into believing that HIV causes AIDS.

Canada: The Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society created the petition in March 2000 and has reportedly since attracted &quot;2,951 doubters&quot; representing groups and individuals. Signatories reportedly deny &quot;that Aids is heterosexually transmitted&quot;.

==Impact beyond the scientific community==
AIDS-denialist claims have failed to attract support in the scientific community, where the evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS is considered conclusive. However, the movement has had a significant impact in the political sphere, culminating with former South African President Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s embrace of AIDS-denialist claims. The resulting governmental refusal to provide effective anti-HIV treatment in South Africa has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature AIDS-related deaths in South Africa.

===North America and Europe===
Skepticism about HIV being the cause of AIDS began almost immediately after the discovery of HIV was announced. One of the earliest prominent skeptics was the journalist John Lauritsen, who argued in his writings for the &quot;New York Native&quot; that amyl nitrite poppers played a role in AIDS, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had used statistical methods that concealed this. Lauritsen&#x27;s &quot;The AIDS War&quot; was published in 1993.

====Scientific literature====
The publication of Duesberg&#x27;s first AIDS paper in 1987 provided visibility for denialist claims. Shortly afterwards, the journal &quot;Science&quot; reported that Duesberg&#x27;s remarks had won him &quot;a large amount of media attention, particularly in the gay press where he is something of a hero.&quot; However, Duesberg&#x27;s support in the gay community diminished as he made a series of statements perceived as homophobic; in an interview with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1988, Duesberg stated his belief that the AIDS epidemic was &quot;caused by a lifestyle that was criminal twenty years ago.&quot;

In the following few years, others became skeptical of the HIV theory as researchers initially failed to produce an effective treatment or vaccine for AIDS. Journalists such as Neville Hodgkinson and Celia Farber regularly promoted denialist ideas in the American and British media; several television documentaries were also produced to increase awareness of the alternative viewpoint. In 1992–1993, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, where Hodgkinson served as scientific editor, ran a series of articles arguing that the AIDS epidemic in Africa was a myth. These articles stressed Duesberg&#x27;s claims and argued that antiviral therapy was ineffective, HIV testing unreliable, and that AIDS was not a threat to heterosexuals. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; coverage was heavily criticized as slanted, misleading, and potentially dangerous; the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; took the unusual step of printing a 1993 editorial calling the paper&#x27;s coverage of HIV/AIDS &quot;seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous.&quot;

Finding difficulty in publishing his arguments in the scientific literature, Duesberg exercised his right as a member of the National Academy of Sciences to publish in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; (&quot;PNAS&quot;) without going through the peer review process. However, Duesberg&#x27;s paper raised a &quot;red flag&quot; at the journal and was submitted by the editor for non-binding review. All of the reviewers found major flaws in Duesberg&#x27;s paper; the reviewer specifically chosen by Duesberg noted the presence of &quot;misleading arguments&quot;, &quot;nonlogical statements&quot;, &quot;misrepresentations&quot;, and political overtones. Ultimately, the editor of &quot;PNAS&quot; acquiesced to publication, writing to Duesberg: &quot;If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader.&quot;

HIV/AIDS denialists often resort to special pleading to support their assertion, arguing for different causes of AIDS in different locations and subpopulations. In North America, AIDS is blamed on the health effects of unprotected anal sex and poppers on homosexual men, an argument which does not account for AIDS in drug-free heterosexual women who deny participating in anal sex. In this case, HIV/AIDS denialists claim the women are having anal sex but refuse to disclose it. In haemophiliac North American children who contracted HIV from blood transfusions, the haemophilia itself or its treatment is claimed to cause AIDS. In Africa, AIDS is blamed on poor nutrition and sanitation due to poverty. For wealthy populations in South Africa with adequate nutrition and sanitation, it is claimed that the antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS cause the condition. In each case, the most parsimonious explanation and uniting factor – HIV positive status – is ignored, as are the thousands of studies that converge on the common conclusion that AIDS is caused by HIV infection.

Haemophilia is considered the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and AIDS researchers. While Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a harmless passenger virus, this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood. A comparison of groups receiving high, medium and low levels of contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status. Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died. The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors. A comparison of individuals receiving blood donations also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions. Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).

==== Lay press and on the Internet ====
With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996–1997, the survival and general health of people with HIV improved significantly. The positive response to treatment with anti-HIV medication cemented the scientific acceptance of the HIV/AIDS paradigm, and led several prominent HIV/AIDS denialists to accept the causative role of HIV. Finding their arguments increasingly discredited by the scientific community, denialists took their message to the popular press. A former denialist wrote:
In addition to elements of the popular and alternative press, AIDS denialist ideas are propagated largely via the Internet.

A 2007 article in &quot;PLoS Medicine&quot; noted:
====Lay opinion and AIDS-related behaviors====
AIDS activists have expressed concern that denialist arguments about HIV&#x27;s harmlessness may be responsible for an upsurge in HIV infections. Denialist claims continue to exert a significant influence in some communities; a survey conducted at minority gay pride events in four American cities in 2005 found that 33% of attendees doubted that HIV caused AIDS. Similarly, a 2010 survey of 343 people living with HIV/AIDS found that one in five of them thought that there was no proof that HIV caused AIDS, and that HIV treatments did more harm than good. According to Stephen Thomas, director of the Center for Minority Health at University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, &quot;people are focusing on the wrong thing. They&#x27;re focusing on conspiracies rather than protecting themselves, rather than getting tested and seeking out appropriate care and treatment.&quot; African Americans are exceptionally likely to believe that HIV does not cause AIDS, partly because they sometimes perceive the role of HIV in the disease as part of a racist agenda. A 2012 survey of young adults in Cape Town, South Africa, found that belief in AIDS denialism was strongly related to an increased probability of engaging in unsafe sex.

===South Africa===

HIV/AIDS denialist claims have had a major political, social, and public health impact in South Africa. The government of then President Thabo Mbeki was sympathetic to the views of HIV/AIDS denialists, with critics charging that denialist influence was responsible for the slow and ineffective governmental response to the country&#x27;s massive AIDS epidemic.

Independent studies have arrived at almost identical estimates of the human costs of HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa. According to a paper written by researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health, between 2000 and 2005, more than 330,000 deaths and an estimated 35,000 infant HIV infections occurred &quot;because of a failure to accept the use of available [antiretroviral drugs] to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in a timely manner.&quot; Nicoli Nattrass of the University of Cape Town estimates that 343,000 excess AIDS-related deaths and 171,000 infections resulted from the Mbeki administration&#x27;s policies, an outcome she refers to in the words of Peter Mandelson as &quot;genocide by sloth&quot;.

====Durban Declaration====
In 2000, when the International AIDS Conference was held in Durban, Mbeki convened a Presidential Advisory Panel containing a number of HIV/AIDS denialists, including Duesberg and David Rasnick. The Advisory Panel meetings were closed to the general press; an invited reporter from the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote that Rasnick advocated that HIV testing be legally banned and denied that he had seen &quot;any evidence&quot; of an AIDS catastrophe in South Africa, while Duesberg &quot;gave a presentation so removed from African medical reality that it left several local doctors shaking their heads.&quot;

In his address to the International AIDS Conference, Mbeki reiterated his view that HIV was not wholly responsible for AIDS, leading hundreds of delegates to walk out on his speech. Mbeki also sent a letter to a number of world leaders likening the mainstream AIDS research community to supporters of the apartheid regime. The tone and content of Mbeki&#x27;s letter led diplomats in the U.S. to initially question whether it was a hoax.

AIDS scientists and activists were dismayed at the president&#x27;s behavior and responded with the Durban Declaration, a document affirming that HIV causes AIDS, signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians.

====Criticism of governmental response====
The former South African health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang also attracted heavy criticism, as she often promoted nutritional remedies such as garlic, lemons, beetroot and olive oil, to people suffering from AIDS, while emphasizing possible toxicities of antiretroviral drugs, which she has referred to as &quot;poison&quot;. The South African Medical Association has accused Tshabalala-Msimang of &quot;confusing a vulnerable public&quot;. In September 2006, a group of over 80 scientists and academics called for &quot;the immediate removal of Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang as minister of health and for an end to the disastrous, pseudoscientific policies that have characterized the South African government&#x27;s response to HIV/AIDS.&quot; In December 2006, deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge described &quot;denial at the very highest levels&quot; over AIDS.

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s government was widely criticized for delaying the rollout of programs to provide antiretroviral drugs to people with advanced HIV disease and to HIV-positive pregnant women. The national treatment program began only after the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) brought a legal case against Government ministers, claiming they were responsible for the deaths of 600 HIV-positive people a day who could not access medication. South Africa was one of the last countries in the region to begin such a treatment program, and roll-out has been much slower than planned.

At the XVI International AIDS Conference, Stephen Lewis, UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, attacked Mbeki&#x27;s government for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic and reliance on denialist claims:
In 2002, Mbeki requested that HIV/AIDS denialists no longer use his name in their literature and stop signing documents with &quot;Member of President Mbeki&#x27;s AIDS Advisory Panel&quot;. This coincided with the South African government&#x27;s statement accompanying its 2002 AIDS campaign, that &quot;...in conducting this campaign, government&#x27;s starting point is based on the premise that HIV causes AIDS&quot;. Nonetheless, Mbeki himself continued to promote and defend AIDS-denialist claims. His loyalists attacked former President Nelson Mandela in 2002 when Mandela questioned the government&#x27;s AIDS policy, and Mbeki attacked Malegapuru William Makgoba, one of South Africa&#x27;s leading scientists, as a racist defender of &quot;Western science&quot; for opposing HIV/AIDS denialism.

In early 2005, former South African President Nelson Mandela announced that his son had died of complications of AIDS. Mandela&#x27;s public announcement was seen as both an effort to combat the stigma associated with AIDS, and as a &quot;political statement designed to… force the President [Mbeki] out of his denial.&quot;

==== Post-Mbeki government in South Africa ====
In 2008, Mbeki was ousted from power and replaced as President of South Africa by Kgalema Motlanthe. On Motlanthe&#x27;s first day in office, he removed Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the controversial health minister who had promoted AIDS-denialist claims and recommended garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS. Barbara Hogan, newly appointed as health minister, voiced shame at the Mbeki government&#x27;s embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism and vowed a new course, stating: &quot;The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa.&quot; Since then, thanks to the introduction of fixed-dose combination and an increase in the eligibility antiretroviral therapy for South Africans, the number of South African people with HIV undergoing ART has increased to 91.5% and viral suppression in South Africans on ART has increased to 72% for women and 45.8% for men.

== 2020s resurgence ==

Following COVID-19 conspiracy theories being widely-spread beginning in 2020, AIDS denialism is increasingly being spread. Suspicion of public health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a resurgence of conspiracy theories surrounding HIV and AIDS. Social media companies like Twitter, Gab, Rumble, and Substack and companies like Amazon and Spotify are places where misinformation have been widely spread. The ideas that are increasingly circulated are often revived, debunked theories from the beginning of the epidemic.

<doc id="275053" wikidata="Q1778809" url="?curid=275053" title="Coherentism">
<text>In philosophical epistemology, there are two types of coherentism: the coherence theory of truth, and the coherence [[theory of justification]] (also known as epistemic coherentism).

Coherent truth is divided between an anthropological approach, which applies only to localized networks (&#x27;true within a given sample of a population, given our understanding of the population&#x27;), and an approach that is judged on the basis of universals, such as categorical sets. The anthropological approach belongs more properly to the correspondence theory of truth, while the universal theories are a small development within analytic philosophy.

The coherentist theory of justification, which may be interpreted as relating to either theory of coherent truth, characterizes epistemic justification as a property of a belief only if that belief is a member of a coherent set. What distinguishes coherentism from other theories of justification is that the set is the primary bearer of justification.

As an epistemological theory, coherentism opposes dogmatic foundationalism and also infinitism through its insistence on definitions. It also attempts to offer a solution to the regress argument that plagues correspondence theory. Brand Blanshard argues that where we seem to determine truth from a proposition&#x27;s self-evidence, we are in fact using coherence as a criterion of truth to certify the proposition as true. For the certainty of the truth of a proposition like &#x27;2 + 2 = 4&#x27;, one rather appeals &quot;to the coherence of [one&#x27;s] proposition with an enormous mass of others&quot; whose truth must stand or fall with it. 

Coherentism is a view either about the structure and system of knowledge and truth, or else justified belief. The coherentist&#x27;s thesis is normally formulated in terms of a denial of its contrary, such as dogmatic foundationalism, which lacks a proof-theoretical framework, or correspondence theory, which lacks universalism. Counterfactualism, through a vocabulary developed by David K. Lewis and his many worlds theory although popular with philosophers, has had the effect of creating wide disbelief of universals amongst academics. Many difficulties lie in between hypothetical coherence and its effective actualization. Coherentism claims, at a minimum, that not all knowledge &quot;and&quot; justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge &quot;or&quot; justified belief. To defend this view, they may argue that conjunctions (&quot;and&quot;) are more specific, and thus in some way more defensible, than disjunctions (&quot;or&quot;).

After responding to foundationalism, coherentists normally characterize their view positively by replacing the foundationalism metaphor of a building as a model for the structure of knowledge with different metaphors, such as the metaphor that models our knowledge on a ship at sea whose seaworthiness must be ensured by repairs to any part in need of it. This metaphor fulfills the purpose of explaining the problem of incoherence, which was first raised in mathematics. Coherentists typically hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by dogmatic foundationalists. In this way universal truths are in closer reach. Different varieties of coherentism are individuated by the specific relationship between a system of knowledge and justified belief, which can be interpreted in terms of predicate logic, or ideally, proof theory.

==Definition==
As a theory of truth, coherentism restricts &quot;true&quot; sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone&#x27;s belief is true if and only if it is &quot;coherent&quot; with all or most of his or her other (true) beliefs. The terminology of coherence is then said to correlate with truth via some concept of what qualifies all truth, such as absoluteness or universalism. These further terms become the qualifiers of what is meant by a truth statement, and the truth-statements then decide what is meant by a true belief. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of Occam&#x27;s razor are usually to be preferred.

As an illustration of the principle, if people lived in a virtual reality universe, they could see birds in the trees that aren&#x27;t really there. Not only are the birds not really there, but the trees aren&#x27;t really there either. The people may or may not &quot;know&quot; that the bird and the tree are there, but in either case there is a coherence between the virtual world and the real one, expressed in terms of true beliefs within available experience. &quot;Coherence&quot; is a way of explicating truth values while circumventing beliefs that might be false in any way. More traditional critics from the correspondence theory of truth have said that it cannot have contents and proofs at the same time, unless the contents are infinite, or unless the contents somehow exist in the form of proof. Such a form of &#x27;existing proof&#x27; might seem ridiculous, but coherentists tend to think it is non-problematic. It therefore falls into a group of theories that are sometimes deemed excessively generalistic, what Gábor Forrai calls &#x27;blob realism&#x27;.

Perhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell&#x27;s argument concerning contradiction. Russell maintained that a belief and its negation will each separately cohere with one complete set of all beliefs, thus making it internally inconsistent. For example, if someone holds a belief that is false, how might we determine whether the belief refers to something real although it is false, or whether instead the right belief is true although it is not believed? Coherence must thus rely on a theory that is either non-contradictory or accepts some limited degree of incoherence, such as relativism or paradox. Additional necessary criteria for coherence may include universalism or absoluteness, suggesting that the theory remains anthropological or incoherent when it does not use the concept of infinity. A coherentist might argue that this scenario applies regardless of the theories being considered, and so, that coherentism must be the preferred truth-theoretical framework in avoiding relativism.

==History==
In modern philosophy, the coherence theory of truth was defended by Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Harold Henry Joachim (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory). However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.

In late modern philosophy, epistemic coherentist views were held by Schlegel and Hegel, but the definitive formulation of the coherence theory of justification was provided by F. H. Bradley in his book &quot;The Principles of Logic&quot; (1883).

In contemporary philosophy, epistemologists who have significantly contributed to epistemic coherentism include: A. C. Ewing, Brand Blanshard, C. I. Lewis, Nicholas Rescher, Laurence BonJour, Keith Lehrer, and Paul Thagard. Otto Neurath is also sometimes thought to be an epistemic coherentist.

==The regress argument==
Both coherence and foundationalist theories of &quot;justification&quot; attempt to answer the regress argument, a fundamental problem in epistemology that goes as follows. Given some statement P, it appears reasonable to ask for a justification for P. If that justification takes the form of another statement, P&#x27;, one can again reasonably ask for a justification for P&#x27;, and so forth. There are three possible outcomes to this questioning process:
# the series is infinitely long, with every statement justified by some other statement.
# the series forms a loop, so that each statement is ultimately involved in its own justification.
# the series terminates with certain statements having to be self-justifying.

An infinite series appears to offer little help, unless a way is found to model infinite sets. This might entail additional assumptions. Otherwise, it is impossible to check that each justification is satisfactory without making broad generalizations.

Coherentism is sometimes characterized as accepting that the series forms a loop, but although this would produce a form of coherentism, this is not what is generally meant by the term. Those who do accept the loop theory sometimes argue that the body of assumptions used to prove the theory is not what is at question in considering a loop of premises. This would serve the typical purpose of circumventing the reliance on a regression, but might be considered a form of logical foundationalism. But otherwise, it must be assumed that a loop begs the question, meaning that it does not provide sufficient logic to constitute proof.

===Foundationalism&#x27;s response===
One might conclude that there must be some statements that, for some reason, do not need justification. This view is called foundationalism. For instance, rationalists such as Descartes and Spinoza developed axiomatic systems that relied on statements that were taken to be self-evident: &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; is the most famous example. Similarly, empiricists take observations as providing the foundation for the series.

Foundationalism relies on the claim that it is not necessary to ask for justification of certain propositions, or that they are self-justifying. Coherentists argue that this position is overly dogmatic. In other words, it does not provide real criteria for determining what is true and what is not. The Coherentist analytic project then involves a process of justifying what is meant by adequate criteria for non-dogmatic truth. As an offshoot of this, the theory insists that it is &quot;always&quot; reasonable to ask for a justification for &quot;any&quot; statement. For example, if someone makes an observational statement, such as &quot;it is raining&quot;, the coherentist contends that it is reasonable to ask for example whether this mere statement refers to anything real. What is real about the statement, it turns out, is the extended pattern of relations that we call justifications. But, unlike the relativist, the coherentist argues that these associations may be objectively real. Coherentism contends that dogmatic foundationalism does not provide the whole set of pure relations that might result in actually understanding the objective context of phenomena, because dogmatic assumptions are not proof-theoretic, and therefore remain incoherent or relativistic. Coherentists therefore argue that the only way to reach proof-theoretic truth that is not relativistic is through coherency.

===Coherentism&#x27;s response===
Coherentism rejects the soundness of the regression argument, which assumes that the justification for a proposition follows a linear sequence: P&quot; justifies P&#x27;, which in turn justifies P. According to coherentism, justification is a holistic process. Inferential justification for the belief that P is nonlinear, meaning that P&quot; and P&#x27; are not epistemically prior to P. Instead, the beliefs P&quot;, P&#x27;, and P work together to achieve epistemic justification. Catherine Elgin has expressed the same point differently, arguing that beliefs must be &quot;mutually consistent, cotenable, and supportive. That is, the components must be reasonable in light of one another. Since both cotenability and supportiveness are matters of degree, coherence is too.&quot; Usually the system of belief is taken to be the complete set of beliefs of the individual or group, that is, their theory of the world.

It is necessary for coherentism to explain in some detail what it means for a system to be coherent. At the least, coherence must include logical consistency. It also usually requires some degree of integration of the various components of the system. A system that contains more than one unrelated explanation of the same phenomenon is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation, all other things being equal. Conversely, a theory that explains divergent phenomena using unrelated explanations is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation for those divergent phenomena. These requirements are variations on Occam&#x27;s razor. The same points can be made more formally using Bayesian statistics. Finally, the greater the number of phenomena explained by the system, the greater its coherence.

===Problems for coherentism===
A problem coherentism has to face is the &quot;plurality objection&quot;. There is nothing within the definition of coherence that makes it impossible for two entirely different sets of beliefs to be internally coherent. Thus there might be several such sets. But if one supposes—in line with the principle of non-contradiction—that there can only be &quot;one&quot; complete set of truths, coherentism must therefore resolve internally that these systems are not contradictory, by establishing what is meant by truth. At this point, Coherence could be faulted for adopting its own variation of dogmatic foundationalism by arbitrarily selecting truth values. Coherentists must argue that their truth-values are not arbitrary for provable reasons.

A second objection also emerges, the &quot;finite problem&quot;: that arbitrary, ad hoc relativism could reduce statements of relatively insignificant value to non-entities during the process of establishing universalism or absoluteness. This might result in a totally flat truth-theoretic framework, or even arbitrary truth values. Coherentists generally solve this by adopting a metaphysical condition of universalism, sometimes leading to materialism, or by arguing that relativism is trivial.

A third objection that coherentism faces is the &quot;problem of isolation&quot;. Intuitively, one might think that the justification of an empirical belief must depend on some connection between the believed proposition and the way the world is. For example, a belief that &#x27;snow is white&#x27; must in some way connect to the fact that snow really is white in the external world. Such a connection could be found in how the agent in question has experiences of the world being this way. However, if coherence is sufficient for justification and coherence is &quot;only&quot; a property of sets of beliefs, hence ruling out any such connection through experience, then it seems that coherentism would allow for the justification of empirical beliefs in isolation from the external world. Coherentists have a variety of responses to this. One strategy is to argue that no set of beliefs held by an agent would remain coherent over time if it was isolated from the external world in this way. Another approach argues that coherentism should be modified such that empirical beliefs can only be justified if the relevant set includes beliefs &quot;and&quot; experiences, and hence no belief can be justified without involving experiences about the world. This latter position is known as &quot;non-doxastic coherentism.&quot; 

However, metaphysics poses another problem, the problem of the stowaway argument that might carry epistemological implications. However, a coherentist might say that if the truth conditions of the logic hold, then there will be no problem regardless of any additional conditions that happen to be true. Thus, the stress is on making the theory valid within the set, and also verifiable.

A number of philosophers have raised concerns over the link between intuitive notions of coherence that form the foundation of epistemic forms of coherentism and some formal results in Bayesian probability. This is an issue raised by Luc Bovens and Stephen Hartmann and by Erik J. Olsson in the form of &#x27;impossibility&#x27; theorems. These theorems aim to give a formal proof that there is no way to formalise the notion of coherence such that the coherence of a set of beliefs always increases the probability of the joint truth of the beliefs. Attempts have been made to construct a theoretical account of coherentist intuitions. Importantly, epistemologist Luca Moretti and mathematical economist Franz Dietrich have given a formal proof that in certain cases the coherence of a set of beliefs transmits incremental confirmation: if some evidence confirms a given belief, and this belief is sufficiently coherent with other beliefs, then the evidence also confirms these other beliefs. Moretti has then used the same formalism to show that if an &quot;evidential&quot; set (i.e. a set of propositions used as evidence) is sufficiently coherent and a proposition in the set incrementally confirms a belief, in certain cases, each proposition in the set confirms the same belief. Moretti has called this property of coherence &quot;evidence gathering&quot;..

<text>Davíð Oddsson (pronounced ; born 17 January 1948) is an Icelandic politician, and the longest-serving prime minister of Iceland, in office from 1991 to 2004. From 2004 to 2005 he served as foreign minister and as the chairman for the Independence Party from 1991 to 2005. Previously, he was Mayor of Reykjavík from 1982 to 1991, and he chaired the board of governors of the Central Bank of Iceland from 2005 to 2009. The collapse of Iceland&#x27;s banking system led to vocal demands for his resignation, both from members of the Icelandic public and from the new Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, which resulted in his being replaced as head of the Central Bank in March 2009. In September 2009 he was hired as the editor of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;, one of Iceland&#x27;s largest newspapers, a decision that caused nationwide controversy and was followed by resignations and widespread terminated subscriptions. He contested the election for President of Iceland on 25 June 2016 but lost to Guðni Jóhannesson, coming in fourth place with 13.7% of the popular vote. 

Davíð was one of the most popular and successful politicians in Icelandic history but was also highly controversial for his support for the Iraq War and for his part in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. &quot;Time&quot; named Davíð as one of the 25 people responsible the most for the crisis worldwide.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Davíð Oddsson was born in Reykjavík. His father was a doctor, and his mother a secretary. His parents were not married, and he was brought up in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s home in Selfoss until his grandfather died. He then moved with his mother and grandmother to Reykjavík.

He took an early interest in acting, and attended an acting school for a while. He also attended the gymnasium Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík where he graduated in the spring of 1970. Davíð married Ástríður Thorarensen, a nurse; they have one son, Þorsteinn, who is a judge at the district court at Akureyri. The next six years, Davíð read law at the University of Iceland, working almost full-time as well. He was assistant to the director of a small theatre (now the Borgarleikhúsið) for a while, and with two friends (Þórarinn Eldjárn and Hrafn Gunnlaugsson), he produced a popular radio comedy show for two years; he was for a while a political commentator at the newspaper &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;, and the director of publication of Almenna bókafélagið, a conservative publishing house. He had been elected to the Municipal Council in Reykjavík in 1974, for the Independence Party.

=== Mayor of Reykjavík (1982–1991) ===
Davíð Oddsson was a member of a group of young conservative-libertarians within the Independence Party who felt that the party should more strongly support attempts to extend economic freedom in the heavily regulated Icelandic economy. The group included Þorsteinn Pálsson, Geir H. Haarde, Jón Steinar Gunnlaugsson, Kjartan Gunnarsson, Magnús Gunnarsson, Brynjólfur Bjarnason and Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson, and they published the magazine &quot;Eimreiðin&quot; from 1972 to 1975; they also followed with interest what was happening in the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher and in the United States under Ronald Reagan; they also read books and articles by and about Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek and James M. Buchanan, who all visited Iceland in the early 1980s and whose messages of limited governments, privatisation, and liberalisation of the economy had a wide impact.

Davíð got a chance to further his ideals when, in 1982, the Independence Party, under his leadership, regained the majority in the Reykjavík Municipal Council which it had lost four years earlier to three left-wing parties. Davíð swiftly reduced the number of Council members from 21 to 15, and merged the largest fishing firm in Reykjavík, which belonged to the municipality and had been a huge burden, with a private fishing firm and then sold off the municipality&#x27;s assets in the new firm, Grandi, which became one of the biggest fishing firms in Iceland. Incidentally, the director of Grandi, Brynjólfur Bjarnason, later became the director of the Icelandic Telephone Company which turned out to be Davíð&#x27;s last privatisation in government (2005). As Mayor of Reykjavík, Davíð was behind the building of Reykjavík City Hall by The Pond in Reykjavík, and of Perlan, a revolving restaurant over the old water tanks in Öskjuhlíð. Despite his libertarian leanings, Davíð also supported the Reykjavík City Theatre, in particular the building of a new theatre house which was opened in 1989. In the nine years when Davíð was Mayor of Reykjavík, a new district, Grafarvogur, was built and a new shopping area around the Kringlan shopping mall. A forceful and uncompromising Mayor of Reykjavík, Davíð was much criticized by the left-wing opposition in the Municipal Council.

=== Alliance with the Social Democrats (1991–1995) ===
In 1983, Davíð Oddsson&#x27;s old friend and ally, Þorsteinn Pálsson, was elected leader of the Independence Party, and in 1989 Davíð was elected deputy leader or Vice-Chairman of the party. After Þorsteinn resigned as prime minister in 1988, after falling out with the leaders of his two coalition parties, there was a widespread feeling in the party that its leadership should be changed, and pressure was put on Davíð to run against Þorsteinn, which he did in 1991, becoming leader of the party. Under Davíð&#x27;s leadership, in 1991, the party regained most of the parliamentary support it had lost in 1987. In record time, Davíð formed a coalition government with the social democrats, Alþýðuflokkurinn, whose leader, Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson, became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Jón Baldvin and Davíð jointly decided that Iceland should become the first state to renew recognition of the sovereignty and independence of the three Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Davíð&#x27;s government inherited a huge budget deficit and a number of unproductive investments: much money had been spent on fish farming for example, with little result. Inflationary pressures were also building, while some fish stocks in Icelandic waters were being depleted. The budget deficit was turned into a surplus in 1996, not least because of the close cooperation between Davíð and Friðrik Sophusson, the Minister of Finance, who had also been a prominent young libertarian. There has been a surplus almost continuously since then, which was used to reduce the public debt, and also to reform the pension system, which is now almost wholly self-supporting. Some small companies were privatised. Monetary constraints were imposed by making the Central Bank largely independent of any political pressures. It also helped the Davíð Oddsson government that there was a consensus between the labour unions and the employers that the rampant inflation of the 1980s, with huge, but largely meaningless, wage increases, could not go on; therefore, in 1990, the unions and the employers had signed a &quot;National Accord&quot;, whereby wage increases would be moderate, and government would be assisted in bringing down inflation. From 1991, inflation in Iceland was on a level with neighbouring countries.

=== Alliance with the Progressive Party (1995–1999) ===

In 1994, the Social Democratic Party split, and as a result they suffered a huge loss in the 1995 parliamentary elections. The coalition government maintained its majority, but only by one seat. Davíð Oddsson therefore decided to form a coalition with the Progressive Party, whose leader, Halldór Ásgrímsson, became Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the new government, privatisation was continued on a much greater scale than before: a large and important chain of fish processing plants was sold; part-public or public investment funds were merged and sold as a private investment bank; the two commercial banks under government control were sold in a few stages; the two coalition parties accepted the loud demands from many people for a charge to be imposed on the holders of fishing quotas.

Davíð&#x27;s two governments were staunch allies of the United States and strongly in support of NATO, of which Iceland is a founding member. He firmly supported the actions undertaken by the U.S. and its allies in Afghanistan and Iraq, taking much criticism from the Icelandic Left. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been some uncertainty about whether the United States defence force could or should remain in Iceland, having been invited there in 1951, at the height of the Cold War. Davíð has not been enthusiastic about joining the European Union.

The latter Davíð Oddsson government (1995–2004) (under the influence of Milton Friedman&#x27;s neoliberal ideas) embarked on a course of tax cuts. It cut the corporate income tax to 18%; it abolished the net wealth tax; it lowered the personal income tax and inheritance tax. This combination of opening up of the economy, fiscal and monetary stabilisation created an entrepreneurial climate in Iceland that spurred record economic growth in the country, with the real average income of individual households increasing by more than 17%, but was also one of the causes of the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis.

=== Alliance with Progressive Party (1999–2004) ===

As a young man, Davíð Oddsson authored or co-authored several stage and TV plays. During his days as political leader, he also pursued his literary interests, and in 1997 he published a collection of short stories, &quot;Nokkrir góðir dagar án Guðnýjar&quot;, which became a best-seller in Iceland. Davíð celebrated his 50th birthday at a huge reception in Perlan, paid for by the Independence Party, and his friends published a &quot;Festschrift&quot; of more than 500 pages to which many Icelandic writers, scholars and politicians contributed papers. In the 1999 parliamentary elections, Davíð&#x27;s Independence Party retained strong support, despite an attempt by a former government minister of the party, Sverrir Hermannsson, to establish a splinter party: the minister had been appointed director of the National Bank of Iceland and had had to resign because of financial irregularities. In 2002, Davíð published another collection of short stories, &quot;Stolið frá höfundi stafrófsins&quot;, which was also well received.

However, in that same year, 2002, there began a controversy in Iceland about the Baugur Group, owned by the entrepreneurs Jóhannes Jónsson and his son, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson. A giant on the Icelandic scene, Baugur controlled the majority of the retail business in Iceland: in parliament, the then leader of the Social Democratic party, Össur Skarphéðinsson, called for closer supervision of possible monopoly pricing, specifically mentioning Baugur. Davíð concurred. In summer 2002, the Icelandic police raided the headquarters of Baugur, after a disgruntled former employee of their American operations had produced what he claimed was evidence of financial irregularities. The two main owners of Baugur did not take kindly to this, and accused Davíð of orchestrating a campaign against them. They bought a newspaper, &quot;Fréttablaðið&quot;, which is distributed free of charge to every household in Iceland. The paper opposed Davíð in the bitterly fought 2003 parliamentary election when there was talk of corruption, bribery and abuse of the police. In a speech on 9 February 2003, the main spokesperson of the Social Democratic Alliance, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, suggested that Davíð might be responsible for the tax investigation of businessman Jón Ólafsson, then owner of a private television station, and also for the police raid on Baugur. Paraphrasing Shakespeare, she asked: &quot;Are you a friend of the Prime Minister or are you not; that is the question&quot;.

In 2003, he led the liberalization of the banking laws in Iceland allowing less transparency which brought a huge amount of foreign money and high interest rates.

====Support for the Iraq War====
On 18 March 2003, Davíð and Foreign Minister Halldór Ásgrímsson declared their support of the ultimatum issued by the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain at the Azores Summit, where the three countries announced their intention to invade Iraq if the government of Saddam Hussein did not step down. Due to Davíð and Halldór&#x27;s declaration of support, Iceland was consequently put on the list of member states of the Coalition of the Willing. Davíð and Halldór did not consult the Parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs committee before making the announcement, arguing that support for the Iraq War could not be considered a major foreign policy decision. Össur Skarphéðinsson, chairman of the Social Democratic Alliance, and Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, chairman of the Left-Green Movement, accused the government of breaking with parliamentary protocol by bypassing the foreign affairs committee while announcing its support for the war.

Davíð&#x27;s government&#x27;s support for the Iraq War was largely unpopular among the Icelandic public. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, 76 percent of responders declared themselves opposed to the government&#x27;s support for the war in an opinion poll published by &quot;Fréttablaðið&quot;. In an opinion poll published by Gallup in 2005, 84 percent of responders declared their opposition to Iceland being on the list of the Coalition of the Willing.

=== Foreign minister (2004–2005) ===

After the 2003 elections, Davíð Oddsson and the leader of his coalition partners, Halldór Ásgrímsson, Minister of Foreign Affairs, agreed that Davíð should remain prime minister until 15 September 2004, at which time Halldór would become prime minister, and that the Independence Party would, in exchange for relinquishing the Prime Minister&#x27;s post, gain an additional ministry in the government from its partner.

In 2004 Davíð&#x27;s government became embroiled in controversy, when he introduced a bill which would have made it impossible for large private companies to own more than 15% of any one media company, and under which newspapers and television stations could not be owned by the same company. Davíð argued that this was to prevent concentration of the media in the hands of a few people, and to enable the media to remain independent and critical not only towards politicians, but also towards financial moguls. His critics maintained, however, that the proposal was directly aimed at Baugur Group which they claimed Davíð regarded as a political enemy. By then, Baugur had bought another newspaper, the television station from Jón Ólafsson and a few radio stations, and controlled more than half of the media market. The Alþingi passed a much-softened version of the media bill. But in summer 2004, for the first time in the history of the Icelandic Republic, the president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, refused to sign the bill into law. Davíð criticized this, pointing out that the director of the television station formerly owned by Jón Ólafsson and recently bought by Baugur, Sigurður G. Guðjónsson, had been Ólafur Ragnar&#x27;s campaign manager in his first presidential campaign, and that Ólafur&#x27;s daughter was employed by Baugur. However, Baugur enjoyed considerable goodwill in Iceland because their shops offered lower prices than competitors, while their owners, Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson and Jóhannes Jónsson, were seen as an embodiment of an Icelandic dream of rags-to-riches. Many people agreed that the media bill seemed to be a part of a political duel rather than an attempt to make general law. The conclusion of the long struggle was that Davíð Oddsson withdrew the bill instead of holding a national referendum on it, as required by the Icelandic constitution in the event that the president refuses to sign a bill into law.

During his 14 years as prime minister, Davíð became acquainted with, or a friend of, many Western leaders, including Bill Clinton and George W. Bush of the United States, Václav Klaus of Czechoslovakia and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. He has occasionally attended the meetings of the Bilderberg Group, and has read a paper to the Mont Pelerin Society. But he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for only one year. In autumn 2005, Davíð announced that he would leave politics, saying that he felt the time had come for a new generation to take over. His close ally over many years, Geir Haarde, replaced him, as both leader of the Independence Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs. A probable contribution to this decision was a short, but dramatic, bout of cancer, soon after the crisis over the failure of the media bill.

=== Central Bank Governor (2005–2009) ===
In October 2005, Davíð was appointed the Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, despite not having any formal education in economics. Following the collapse of the Icelandic banking system in the autumn of 2008, Iceland was forced to ask for financial help from the International Monetary Fund and friendly nations. Some blamed the collapse on the policies pursued by the Independence Party under Davíð&#x27;s leadership, such as deregulation, market liberalisation and privatisation which led to investigations into the collapse and a trial. Consequently, there were public calls for Davíð&#x27;s dismissal. Following protests outside the Central Bank, the new Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir requested that Davíð and his two fellow governors resign. He refused this request. On 26 February 2009, following changes to the laws concerning the Central Bank, Davíð was ousted from the bank and replaced by Norwegian economist Svein Harald Øygard.

In April 2009, Davíð stated that Iceland needs to investigate the &quot;unusual and unconventional loans&quot; given by the banks to senior politicians during the years before the crisis.

=== Editor of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; (2009–present) ===
On 24 September 2009, the new owners of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; announced that Davíð Oddsson and Haraldur Johannessen, former editor of the business-oriented newspaper &quot;Viðskiptablaðið&quot;, had been hired as editors of the paper. The decision was announced in the wake of much speculation and rumours about who would be the new editor after the dismissal of the previous editor, Ólafur Þ. Stephensen. Since Davíð took over as editor-in-chief a third of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; subscribers have cancelled their subscriptions. In 2009, the paper lost 667 million ISK. In the report of the Icelandic parliament&#x27;s Special Investigation Commission, published in April 2010, the appointment of Davíð Oddsson as editor-in-chief of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; and the firing of many experienced journalists from the newspaper is mentioned as an example of how the owners of media in Iceland engage in manipulation for political ends. &quot;Their objective seems to be to run an opinion journalism and protect special interests rather than ensure a professional and fair reporting.&quot;

=== 2016 Presidential Campaign ===
Davíð announced his bid to the Icelandic presidency on 8 May 2016 for the 2016 presidential election. After he announced his campaign, he shortly afterwards started to poll in as the second highest in the race. Davíð ended up finishing fourth in race with 13.7% of the popular vote. A lot of people have speculated that the reason for his bad performance in the election was because of people fully blaming him for the 2008-2011 Icelandic financial crisis. Another speculation for his bad performance was when he joked about the Iraq War during his campaigning.

==Political views==
===Environmental issues===
Throughout his political career, Davíð has repeatedly engaged in various forms of climate change denial and has criticized attempts to limit emissions of greenhouse gasses. Around the turn of the millennium, Davíð&#x27;s government refused to make Iceland a party to the Kyoto Accords before extracting a concession that permitted the country to exclude what amounted to around 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide from the country&#x27;s obligations in the accords. In his 1997 new year&#x27;s address, Davíð justified his stance by claiming it would be wrong to stoke people&#x27;s fears on the basis of &quot;sciences that rest on weak grounds&quot;. In a speech during the Independence Party&#x27;s 2005 convention, Davíð reiterated his view that the Kyoto Accords were based on &quot;very weak foundations&quot; and that the public discourse about climate change tended to be based on &quot;inscrutable emotionalism and, at worst, empty propaganda&quot;.

In televised debates during Davíð&#x27;s 2016 candidacy for President of Iceland, he denied that he had doubted the scientific reality of climate change and noted that it was would not do to &quot;deny the calculations and scientific tools&quot;. However, he reiterated his scepticism of ongoing attempts to combat climate change, stating that he believed them to be ineffectual without the full participation of countries like the United States, India and China.

During Davíð&#x27;s tenure as editor-in-chief of &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;, the paper has continued to regularly publish editorials and opinion pieces denying the reality of climate change and criticizing efforts to combat it.

=== Support for Donald Trump ===
In 2018, Davíð said that he was an open supporter of the then-president of the United States, Donald Trump.

In January 2021 following the January 6 United States Capitol Attack, Davíð said that no president in the history of the United States had been more “&quot;wrongfully bullied&quot;&quot; than Donald Trump. He also said that Joe Biden would be the &quot;weakest president in American history&quot;.

In February 2024, Davíð criticized the Democratic Party and sent his support for Trump in the Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York trial.

==In popular culture==
Davíð has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature since taking public office. From 1989 to 2014, he was parodied regularly on Spaugstofan and the yearly Áramótaskaupið by comedian Örn Árnason, from 1986 to 2012, including in the sketch &quot;Dabbi Kóngur&quot; in 2001. In 2009, Davíð was part of an unused sketch for the Áramótaskaupið where he played Örn Árnason playing himself.

<doc id="275064" wikidata="Q2545468" url="?curid=275064" title="Matt Jefferies">
<text>Walter Matthew Jefferies (August 12, 1921 – July 21, 2003) was an American aviation and mechanical artist, set designer, and writer. He is best known for his work on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, where he designed many of the sets and props, including the original Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the bridge and sick bay.

==Early life==
Jefferies was born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He had three brothers, John, Richard and Philip, the latter two of whom would become production designers. Their father was chief engineer at a power plant in Virginia. Matt&#x27;s younger brother John worked with him as his chief draftsman. 

He served in Europe in World War II, was inside of B-17, B-24, B-25 bombers and had four years as a flight test engineer.

==&quot;Star Trek&quot;==
Besides creating interiors and exterior of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Jefferies was responsible for designing props (including phasers), sets, the Klingon logo and D-7 battlecruiser. Years later, his concept sketches were revisited and used to design the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the Olympic class USS &quot;Pasteur&quot;, the &quot;Daedalus&quot;-class and pre-Federation Vulcan ships. Jefferies worked with NASA engineers in designing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the technology it used.

Contrary to popular belief, Jefferies did not create &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s original shuttlecraft design: although Jefferies submitted his own concept, it was too complex to build with the show&#x27;s FX and budget limitations of the time. Gene Winfield&#x27;s much simpler design was used instead, and Jefferies designed only its interior.

Jefferies had a very pragmatic design ethic: reasoning that a starship&#x27;s engines would be extremely powerful and potentially dangerous, he positioned them far away from the rest of the ship, with the added benefit of modular design so that they could be ejected quickly in an emergency. Figuring that whatever could go wrong would, he put all of the ship&#x27;s workings on the interior for easy access, eliminating the need for spacewalking in case of exterior repairs. The bridge panels were given an ergonomic design for comfort and ease of use. He was opposed to the idea of PADDs, as well as the goose-neck viewers that appeared in the first pilot. Moreover, he disliked the idea of a large engine room because by his reckoning the entire ship could be run by a single panel on the bridge. Later, Jefferies&#x27; work on the bridge of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; influenced the design of the U.S. Navy master communications center at Naval Base San Diego.

When Jefferies saw &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; he fell asleep. He never watched subsequent incarnations of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, remarking that they had turned his Navy-esque bridge into &quot;the lobby of the Hilton.&quot;

Within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, Jefferies tubes and Captain Jefferies, designer of the NX-class starships, are named in his honor. According to Jefferies, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was Starfleet&#x27;s 17th starship design and it was the first in the series, therefore the ship had the number &quot;1701&quot;. This story is documented in one of his sketches.

In June 2003, Jefferies was the guest of honor at the presentation of a documentary about him prepared for the special edition of the &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; DVD. Jefferies died the following month in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure.

==Additional activities==
Matt was a member of the Aviation Space Writers&#x27; Association and one of the original members of the American Aviation Historical Society. He restored and flew period airplanes as a hobby. He owned a Waco YOC aircraft and stored it at Santa Paula Airport, California for many years. His YOC, &quot;NC17740&quot;, c/n 4279, built in 1935, is now owned by the Virginia Aeronautical Historical Society and was on display at the Virginia Aviation Museum, Richmond, Virginia.
==Personal life==
Jefferies died July 21, 2003, in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure. He was survived by his wife, Mary Ann Jefferies, and his brothers John and Richard. His brother Philip died in 1987.

<doc id="275068" wikidata="Q168654" url="?curid=275068" title="Legio II Augusta">
<text>Legio II Augusta ( Second Legion &quot;Augustus&#x27;&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army that was founded during the late Roman Republic. Its emblems were the Capricornus, Pegasus, and Mars. It may have taken the name &quot;Augusta&quot; from a victory or reorganization that occurred during the reign of Augustus.

==In Republican service==
The Legio II, Sabina was a Roman military unit of the late Republican era, which may have been formed by Julius Caesar in the year of the consulate of 48 BC and coincide, in this case, with the Legio II. Enlisted to fight against Pompey, they took part in the subsequent Battle of Munda of 45 BC.

Alternatively it could be the Legio II, formed by the consul, Gaius Vibius Pansa in 43 BC and recruited in Sabina, hence its nickname. If this theory is true, then it probably participated in the subsequent battle of Philippi of 42 BC on the side of the triumvirate, Octavian and Marc Antony.

After the defeat of the Republicans, Legio II swore allegiance to Octavian and with the same remained until the Battle of Actium of 31 BC, after which it seems to have been dissolved in the years between 30 and 14 BC (sent on leave were between 105,000 and 120,000 veterans) and some of its soldiers may have been integrated into the new Legio II Augusta.

==In Imperial service==

=== Hispania ===
At the beginning of Augustus&#x27; rule, in 26 BC, this legion was relocated to a place north of Hispania Tarraconensis, to fight in the Cantabrian Wars. This war would definitively establish Roman power in Hispania. While the legion was in Hispania, they along with the Legio I Germanica helped build the Colonia Acci. They also constructed the city of Cartenna.

=== Germania and Gaul ===
With the annihilation of several legions at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the Legio II &quot;Augusta&quot; moved to Germania, possibly in the area of Moguntiacum. While in Germania, during the 15 AD the legion would participate in the campaigns of Germanicus against the Germanic tribes. After Germanicus was recalled the legion was stationed at Argentoratum. On its way back from Germania, the legion was drenched in heavy rain and harassed by heavy storms. After Julius Sacrovir and Julius Florus revolted against the Roman Empire in Gaul, the Legio II &quot;Augusta,&quot; under the command of Gaius Silius would help put down the revolt.

===Britain===
====Invasion of Britannia and Boudica&#x27;s revolt====
The legion was one of the four legions used during Claudius&#x27;s invasion of Britannia. The commander of the Legion at the time was Vespasian. He led the campaign against the Durotriges and Dumnonii tribes. During the campaign the Legion marched across the south of Britain, fighting many battles against the local tribes.

The Legion was first stationed at Alchester and in 49 AD it was moved to Waddon Hill. From 55 it was based at Exeter and from 66 it was possibly at Glevum.

During the uprising of queen Boudica, when its &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot; Poenius Postumus, who was then its acting commander possibly because its legatus and tribunes were with the governor Suetonius Paulinus, contravened Suetonius&#x27; orders to join him and so later committed suicide.

==== Year of the Four Emperors ====

In 69 CE, during the Year of the Four Emperors, a vexillation of the Legio II Augusta sided with emperor Otho. After Otho was defeated the vexillation switched sides and served Vitellius. This vexillation possibly took part in Vetellius&#x27;s march on Rome, and fought in the Battle at Cremona against the legions of Otho. Later these soldiers were defeated by those of Vespasian and returned to Britain in 70. It is possible that the main body of the legion had always been loyal towards Vespasian.

==== Continued service in Britain ====
Julius Frontinus, the governor of Britain from 74 to 78 ordered several campaigns against the Silures tribe and during the war the fortress of Caerleon in Wales was constructed where from 75 the legion was based. The legion remained there, even during Agricola&#x27;s term as governor of Britain although several vexillations of the Legio II &quot;Augusta&quot; fought in the Battle of Mons Graupius.

In 139 the Legion helped build the short lived Antonine Wall. During the years 155 and 158 a revolt spread across Britain, the Legio II Augusta was one of those that fought against the revolt. The legions in Britain suffered greatly, causing reinforcements from the Germanic provinces to be brought over.

In 196 Decimus Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, declared himself emperor and the Legio II Augusta supported his claim. The legions were defeated by the current emperor, Septimus Severus. Although, while the legions were absent from Britain, the province was overrun with Pictish tribes. Emperor Severus attempted to conquer Scotland in order to stop the tribes, while Severus was fighting the Picts, Legio II Augusta was stationed at a fort near Carpow. It is unknown when, but the II Augusta received the surname &quot;Antonina&quot;, which meant that the soldiers were particularly dear to the emperor. This happened either under Caracalla or Heliogabalus,

During Severus Alexanders reign as emperor of Rome, the conquests in Scotland were given up and the Second Legion returned to Caerleon. The legion was still there in 255. The last known mention of the Legion was the Notitia Dignitatum which places the legion at Richborough, suggesting Caerleon was abandoned.
== Attested members ==

==In popular culture==
*In his fantasy novel &quot;Grail&quot;, the author Stephen R. Lawhead states that the legion was ensnared by the black magic of the witch Morgan le Fay, doomed to perpetually wander the mists of Lyonesse.
*Lindsey Davis&#x27; character Marcus Didius Falco and his best friend Lucius Petronius Longus both served in the legion during Boadicea&#x27;s Revolt in AD 60/61, while they were teenagers (probably 19–20 years old). Marcus and Lucius only refer to their service in asides, due to the bad memories of the Revolt and the boredom in a cold, unfriendly country. The scenes of carnage and destruction in Londinium left a deep impression on both of them, with neither keen to return to Britannia. Their internal references also hint that their disgraced prefect, Postumius, did not commit suicide, but instead was executed by the legionaries for his refusal to march to Governor Suetonius&#x27;s aid during the Revolt, but the legionaries swore an oath never to speak of this to outsiders. Novels that most directly refer to their service in Britain are &quot;The Silver Pigs&quot;, &quot;The Iron Hand of Mars&quot;, &quot;A Body in the Bath House&quot; and &quot;The Jupiter Myth&quot;.
*It is also the Legion in which &quot;Optio&quot; Quintus Licinius Cato and Centurion Lucius Cornelius Macro serve during the first five books of the Eagles of the Empire series by Simon Scarrow. The books also cover Vespasian&#x27;s career as commander of the legion and the invasion of Britain.
*The story of the legion&#x27;s role in Boadicea&#x27;s Revolt and the subsequent suicide of its acting commander features in &quot;Imperial Governor&quot;, George Shipway&#x27;s 1968 novel about Gaius Suetonius Paulinus.
*The II Legion features in Adrian Goldsworthy&#x27;s novel series, beginning with &quot;Vindolanda&quot;, about a fictitious centurion of the legion.

<text>The Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) was a conflict between the Ottoman Empire and a coalition led by the Russian Empire which included Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro. Additional factors included the Russian goals of recovering territorial losses endured during the Crimean War of 1853–1856, re-establishing itself in the Black Sea and supporting the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire.
The Romanian army had around 114,000 soldiers in the war. In Romania the war is called the Russo-Romanian-Turkish War (1877–1878) or the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878).

The Russian-led coalition won the war, pushing the Ottomans back all the way to the gates of Constantinople, leading to the intervention of the Western European great powers. As a result, Russia succeeded in claiming provinces in the Caucasus, namely Kars and Batum, and also annexed the Budjak region. The principalities of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, each of which had had &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty for some years, formally proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire. After almost five centuries of Ottoman domination (1396–1878), Bulgaria emerged as an autonomous state with support and military intervention from Russia.

==Background==

=== Treatment of Christians in the Ottoman Empire ===
Article 9 of the 1856 Paris Peace Treaty, concluded at the end of the Crimean War, obliged the Ottoman Empire to grant Christians equal rights with Muslims. Before the treaty was signed, the Ottoman government issued an edict, the Edict of Gülhane, which proclaimed the principle of the equality of Muslims and non-Muslims, and produced some specific reforms to this end. For example, the jizya tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.

====Crisis in Lebanon, 1860====

In 1858, stirred by their clergy, the Maronite peasants of northern Lebanon revolted against their predominantly Druze feudal overlords and established a peasant republic. In southern Beirut vilayet, where both Maronite and Druze peasants worked under Druze overlords, Druze peasants sided with their co-religious and against the Maronites, transforming the conflict into a civil war. Although both sides suffered, about 10,000 Maronites were massacred at the hands of the Druze.

Fearing European intervention, the Ottoman foreign minister Mehmed Fuad Pasha was dispatched to Syria and immediately set about trying to resolve the conflict as swiftly as possible. Mehmed sought out and executed the agitators on all sides, including the governor and other officials. Order was soon restored, and preparations made to give Lebanon new autonomy. These efforts were ultimately not enough to prevent European intervention, however, with France deploying a fleet in September 1860. Fearing that a unilateral intervention would increase French influence in the region at their expense, the British joined the French expedition. Faced with further European pressure, the Sultan agreed to appoint a Christian governor in Lebanon, whose candidacy was to be submitted by the Sultan and approved by the European powers.

====The revolt in Crete, 1866–1869====

The Cretan Revolt, which began in 1866, resulted from the failure of the Ottoman Empire to apply reforms for improving the life of the population and the Cretans&#x27; desire for enosis – union with Greece. The insurgents gained control over the whole island, except for five fortified cities where the Muslims took refuge. The Greek press claimed that Muslims had massacred Greeks and the word was spread throughout Europe. Thousands of Greek volunteers were mobilized and sent to the island.

The siege of Arkadi Monastery became particularly well known. In November 1866, about 250 Cretan Greek combatants and around 600 women and children were besieged by about 23,000 mainly Cretan Muslims aided by Ottoman troops, and this became widely known in Europe. After a bloody battle with a large number of casualties on both sides, the Cretan Greeks finally surrendered when their ammunition ran out but were killed upon surrender.

By early 1869, the insurrection was suppressed, but the Porte offered some concessions, introducing island self-rule and increasing Christian rights on the island. Although the Cretan crisis ended better for the Ottomans than almost any other diplomatic confrontation of the century, the insurrection, and especially the brutality with which it was suppressed, led to greater public attention in Europe to the oppression of Christians in the Ottoman Empire.

===Changing balance of power in Europe===

Although on the winning side in the Crimean War, the Ottoman Empire continued to decline in power and prestige. The financial strain on the treasury forced the Ottoman government to take a series of foreign loans at such steep interest rates that, despite all the fiscal reforms that followed, pushed it into unpayable debts and economic difficulties. This was further aggravated by the need to accommodate more than 600,000 Muslim Circassians, expelled by the Russians from the Caucasus, to the Black Sea ports of north Anatolia and the Balkan ports of Constanța and Varna, which cost a great deal in money and in civil disorder to the Ottoman authorities.

====The New European Concert====
The Concert of Europe established in 1814 was shaken in 1859 when France and Austria fought over Italy. It came apart completely as a result of the wars of German Unification, when the Kingdom of Prussia, led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, defeated Austria in 1866 and France in 1870, replacing Austria as the dominant power in Central Europe. Britain, diverted by the Irish question and averse to warfare, chose not to intervene again to restore the European balance. Bismarck did not wish the breakup of the Ottoman Empire to create rivalries that might lead to war, so he took up Tsar Alexander II of Russia&#x27;s earlier suggestion that arrangements be made in case the Ottoman Empire fell apart, creating the Three Emperors&#x27; League with Austria-Hungary and Russia to keep France isolated on the continent.

France responded by supporting self-determination movements, particularly if they concerned the three emperors and the Sultan. Thus revolts in Poland against Russia and national aspirations in the Balkans were encouraged by France. Russia worked to regain its right to maintain a fleet on the Black Sea and vied with the French in gaining influence in the Balkans by using the new Pan-Slavic idea that all Slavs should be united under Russian leadership. This could be done only by destroying the two empires where most non-Russian Slavs lived, the Habsburg and the Ottoman Empires. The ambitions and the rivalries of the Russians and French in the Balkans surfaced in Serbia, which was experiencing its own national revival and had ambitions that partly conflicted with those of the great powers.

====Russia after the Crimean War====
Russia ended the Crimean War with minimal territorial losses, but was forced to destroy its Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol fortifications. Russian international prestige was damaged, and for many years revenge for the Crimean War became the main goal of Russian foreign policy. This was not easy though: the Paris peace treaty included guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria, and only Prussia remained friendly to Russia.

The newly appointed Russian chancellor, Alexander Gorchakov, depended upon alliance with Prussia and its chancellor Bismarck. Russia consistently supported Prussia in her wars with Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1870). In March 1871, using the crushing French defeat and the support of a grateful Germany, Russia achieved international recognition of its earlier denouncement of Article 11 of the Paris Peace Treaty, thus enabling it to revive the Black Sea Fleet.

Other clauses of the Paris Peace Treaty, however, remained in force, specifically Article 8 with guarantees of Ottoman territorial integrity by Great Britain, France and Austria. Therefore, Russia was extremely cautious in its relations with the Ottoman Empire, coordinating all its actions with other European powers. A Russian war with Turkey would require at least the tacit support of all other Great Powers, and Russian diplomacy was waiting for a convenient moment.

==Balkan crisis of 1875–1876==
In 1875, a series of Balkan events brought Europe to the brink of war. The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent ending in 1862.

Austria-Hungary consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its centuries long policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of Serbia and Montenegro also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots. Nationalist and irredentist sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents. At the same time, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the Empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare bankruptcy in October 1875 and increase taxes on outlying provinces including the Balkans.

===Balkan uprisings===

====Albanian revolts====
István Deák states that the Albanian highlanders resented new taxes and conscription, and fought against the Ottomans in the war.

====Herzegovina Uprising====
An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. By August almost all of Herzegovina had been seized and the revolt had spread into Bosnia. Supported by nationalist volunteers from Serbia and Montenegro, the uprising continued as the Ottomans committed more and more troops to suppress it.
With its origin in the vicinity of the town of Nevesinje the uprising was also known as &quot;Nevesinjska puška&quot; - the rifle of Nevesinje.

====Bulgarian Uprising====
The revolt of Bosnia and Herzegovina spurred Bucharest-based Bulgarian revolutionaries into action. In 1875, a Bulgarian uprising was hastily prepared to take advantage of Ottoman preoccupation, but it fizzled before it started. In the spring of 1876, another uprising erupted in the south-central Bulgarian lands despite the fact that there were numerous regular Turkish troops in those areas.

A special Turkish military committee was established to quell the uprising. Regular troops (&quot;Nizam&quot;) and irregulars (&quot;Redif&quot; or Bashi-bazouk) were directed to fight the Bulgarians (11 May – 9 June 1876). The irregulars were mostly drawn from the Muslim inhabitants of the Bulgarian region. Many were Circassians from the Caucasus or Crimean Tatars who were expelled during the Crimean War; some were Islamized Bulgarians. The Ottoman army suppressed the revolt, massacring up to 30,000 people in the process. Five thousand out of the seven thousand villagers of Batak were put to death. Both Batak and Perushtitsa, where the majority of the population was also massacred, participated in the rebellion. Many of the perpetrators of those massacres were later decorated by the Ottoman high command.

===International reaction to atrocities in Bulgaria===
Word of the bashi-bazouks&#x27; atrocities filtered to the outside world by way of the American-run Robert College located in Constantinople. The majority of the students were Bulgarian, and many received news of the events from their families back home. Soon the Western diplomatic community in Constantinople was abuzz with rumours, which eventually found their way into newspapers in the West. While in Constantinople in 1879, Protestant missionary George Warren Wood reported Turkish authorities in Amasia brutally persecuting Christian Armenian refugees from Soukoum Kaleh. He was able to coordinate with British diplomat Edward Malet to bring the matter to the attention of the Sublime Porte, and then to the British Foreign Secretary Robert Gascoyne-Cecil (the Marquess of Salisbury). In Britain, where Disraeli&#x27;s government was committed to supporting the Ottomans in the ongoing Balkan crisis, the Liberal opposition newspaper &quot;The Daily News&quot; hired American journalist Januarius A. MacGahan to report on the massacre stories first-hand.

MacGahan toured the stricken regions of the Bulgarian uprising, and his report, splashed across &quot;The Daily News&quot;″s front pages, galvanized British public opinion against Disraeli&#x27;s pro-Ottoman policy. In September, opposition leader William Ewart Gladstone published his &quot;Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East&quot; calling upon Britain to withdraw its support for Turkey and proposing that Europe demand independence for Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the details became known across Europe, many dignitaries, including Charles Darwin, Oscar Wilde, Victor Hugo and Giuseppe Garibaldi, publicly condemned the Ottoman abuses in Bulgaria.

The strongest reaction came from Russia. Widespread sympathy for the Bulgarian cause led to a nationwide surge in patriotism on a scale comparable with the one during the Patriotic War of 1812. From autumn 1875, the movement to support the Bulgarian uprising involved all classes of Russian society. This was accompanied by sharp public discussions about Russian goals in this conflict: Slavophiles, including Fyodor Dostoevsky, saw in the impending war the chance to unite all Orthodox nations under Russia&#x27;s helm, thus fulfilling what they believed was the historic mission of Russia, while their opponents, westernizers, inspired by Ivan Turgenev, denied the importance of religion and believed that Russian goals should not be defense of Orthodoxy but liberation of Bulgaria.

===Serbo-Turkish War and diplomatic maneuvering===
On 30 June 1876, Serbia, followed by Montenegro, declared war on the Ottoman Empire. In July and August, the ill-prepared and poorly equipped Serbian army helped by Russian volunteers failed to achieve offensive objectives but did manage to repulse the Ottoman offensive into Serbia. Meanwhile, Alexander II of Russia and Prince Gorchakov met Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Franz Joseph I and Count Andrássy in the Reichstadt castle in Bohemia. No written agreement was made, but during the discussions, Russia agreed to support Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Austria-Hungary, in exchange, agreed to support the return of Southern Bessarabialost by Russia during the Crimean Warand Russian annexation of the port of Batum on the east coast of the Black Sea. Bulgaria was to become autonomous (independent, according to the Russian records).

As the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued, Serbia suffered a string of setbacks and asked the European powers to mediate an end to the war. A joint ultimatum by the European powers forced the Porte to give Serbia a one-month truce and start peace negotiations. Turkish peace conditions however were refused by European powers as too harsh. In early October, after the truce expired, the Turkish army resumed its offensive and the Serbian position quickly became desperate. On 31 October, Russia issued an ultimatum requiring the Ottoman Empire to stop the hostilities and sign a new truce with Serbia within 48 hours. This was supported by the partial mobilization of the Imperial Russian Army (up to 20 divisions). Sultan Abdul Hamid II accepted the conditions of the ultimatum.

To resolve the crisis, on 11 December 1876, the Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers was opened in Constantinople (to which Ottoman representatives were not invited). A compromise solution was negotiated, granting autonomy to Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina under the joint control of European powers. The Ottomans, however, refused to sacrifice their independence by allowing international representatives to oversee the institution of reforms and sought to discredit the conference by announcing on 23 December, the day the conference was closed, that a constitution was adopted that declared equal rights for religious minorities within the Empire. The Ottomans attempted to use this manoeuver to get their objections and amendments to the agreement heard. When they were rejected by the Great Powers, the Ottoman Empire announced its decision to disregard the results of the conference.

On 15 January 1877, Russia and Austria-Hungary signed a written agreement confirming the results of the earlier Reichstadt Agreement of July 1876. This assured Russia of the benevolent neutrality of Austria-Hungary in the impending war. These terms meant that in case of war Russia would do the fighting and Austria-Hungary would derive most of the advantage. Russia therefore made a final effort for a peaceful settlement. After reaching an agreement with its main Balkan rival and with anti-Ottoman sympathies running high throughout Europe due to the Bulgarian atrocities and the rejection of the Constantinople agreements, Russia finally felt free to declare war.

== Status of combatants ==

=== The Ottoman Army ===

The Ottoman army at this time solely conscripted Muslims with non-Muslims paying a poll tax in lieu of service, the army itself was divided into four categories: the Nizam (standing army), who served for four years (five for cavalry and engineers); the Ithiat, or first reserve, where a further two years were served (one year for the cavalry and artillery); the Redif, which took veterans of the Nizam and Ithiat categories and men who did not serve; and the Moustafiz, where all men who had completed their service in the Redif (approximately 300,000 troops) served for a further six years.

The Redif itself was divided into four categories: the first category consisted of veterans of the Nizam category, who served in the first Redif subcategory for four years before entering the second Redif sub-category; men who were not conscripted served in the third sub-category of the Redif for four years before entering the fourth subcategory. The Redif itself was grouped into battalions and classes, with whole battalions taken out to serve as new units. The annual draft conscripted 37,500 men; following mobilisation of the Nizam and Ithiat, these two portions of the army totaled approximately 210,000 men. An additional 20,000 men of the Gendarme were included in the Nizam. The Redif was theoretically capable of providing 190,000–200,000 troops.

Sultan Abdulaziz had reorganised the military school during his reign to educate officers. However, the turnout of this academy was poor and only 1,600 of the 20,000 regular officers of the army were academy trained, though the artillery saw the highest concentration of academy trained officers at 20% of the total. For the entire Ottoman army, only 132 academy-trained generals were available.

The Ottoman army was organised at the battalion level with a battalion nominally holding 800 men subdivided into companies of 100 men, for formations above the battalion level these were to be assembled ad-hoc this results in difficulty at estimating Ottoman troop strength throughout the war as many units were below strength before entering the war due to the many rebellions affecting the empire. However, the Ottoman army was well prepared for war, as it had increasingly called up its reserves up to the third subcategory of the Redif when Russian forces began gathering in Bessarabia. Olender gives the Ottoman battalion (tabor) of infantry at 774 men on paper and 650 in practice, the cavalry squadron containing 143 men on paper and 100 in practice, with the artillery being organised into six gun batteries.

The Ottoman army was also well equipped; 75% of its troops were equipped with Peabody-Martini rifles (accurate to 1,800 yards), with 300,000 of these guns having been purchased prior to the war. The remainder of the regular troops used Snider rifles; the irregulars used Winchester repeating rifles, and the Egyptians used Remington rifles. The Ottoman support services were, however, less impressive, with the army often forced to resort to foraging. On the other hand, Ottoman forces were equipped with entrenching tools (which they used extensively at Plevna) and had sufficient ammunition for their repeating rifles. The Ottoman artillery were armed with Krupp guns of the 8cm and 9cm types for field usage, with 12 cm and 15cm guns also being used (but less commonly) and various older guns found primarily in fortresses.

At the outbreak of war, the Ottoman army was divided into several groups. The largest was the 168,000-man contingent under the command of Abdülkerim Nadir Pasha, based out of Shumla. 140,000 were assigned to the general task of fighting threats in the European provinces of the Empire, with 45,000 in various garrisons in Anatolia, Europe, and Crete. With the Caucasus army containing 70,000 men, the total of number of troops amounted to 378,000.

Olender gives a breakdown of Ottoman troops in the spring of 1877 as containing 571 infantry battalions (181 of which were Nizam), 147 cavalry squadrons and 143 artillery batteries not including the fortress and garrison companies or irregulars. On paper this would amount to 441,954 infantry (140,094 being nizam troops), 21,021 cavalry and 858 guns. However, due to other conflicts and the ongoing process of mobilisation of the Redif units at this process the Regular Ottoman army amounted to 400,000 troops with an additional 90,000 irregular troops and Egyptian troops.

=== The Russian Army ===

The Russian army in the decade prior to the war underwent major modernisation spearheaded by the Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin, this programme of reform gave Russia a large army that was capable of fighting a war against the Ottomans. All Russian men were to serve 6 years in the active army and 9 years in the reserves though through exemption the effective intake of conscription was considerably less (in 1874 of 724,648 eligible men only 150,000 were enlisted, this having risen to 218,000 by 1877) in peacetime, though this was still sufficient to meet the Russian need for manpower. The active portion of the army was subdivided into 2 portions. The first portion was the local troops, who were garrison soldiers in Europe, regular soldiers in Asia, stationary forces and gendarmes. The other portion was the Field Army. In addition to these forces there was the militia (opolcheniye), which contained all men exempted from conscription and men under 40 who had completed their terms of service.

The Field Army was organised into 48 infantry divisions (3 of which were guard and 4 Grenadier). There were also 8 rifle brigades, 19 cavalry divisions, 35 horse gun batteries, 19 engineer battalions and 49 field gun brigades. The Russian divisions were organised into corps of 2 to 3 divisions, a corps excluding support and command staff would consist of 20,160 infantry, 2,048 cavalry, 96 field guns and 12 horse drawn guns (this is for a 2 division corps).

The Russian army in 1874 contained 754,265 men and by 1 January 1878, this had risen to over 1.5 million men. The Russian army used 2 rifles, the Krnka rifle, which they possessed 800,000 of at the minimum and was accurate to only 600 yards (to the Turkish Peabody&#x27;s 1,800), and the Berdan rifle, which equipped the Line, Grenadier, Rifle and Guard formations and was accurate to 1,500 yards. However, the Russian army, despite possessing breechloading rifles, was still holding to the maxims of Suvorov, which called for the usage of the bayonet as the principal weapon, Russian soldiers also lacked entrenching equipment to an adequate level. Russian artillery, despite being breechloaded, were nearing obsolescence

==Course of the war==

===Balkan theatre/Romanian War of Independence===
On 12 April 1877, Romania gave permission to the Russian troops to pass through its territory to attack the Turks.

On 24 April 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottomans, and its troops entered Romania through the newly built Eiffel Bridge near Ungheni, on the Prut river, resulting in Turkish bombardments of Romanian towns on the Danube.

On 10 May 1877, the Principality of Romania, which was under nominal Turkish suzerainty, declared its independence.

At the beginning of the war, the outcome was far from obvious. The Russians could send a larger army into the Balkans: about 300,000 troops were within reach. The Ottomans had about 200,000 troops on the Balkan peninsula, of which about 100,000 were assigned to fortified garrisons, leaving about 100,000 for the army of operation. The Ottomans had the advantage of being fortified, complete command of the Black Sea, and patrol boats along the Danube river. They also possessed superior arms, including new British and American-made rifles and German-made artillery.

In the event, however, the Ottomans usually resorted to passive defense, leaving the strategic initiative to the Russians, who, after making some mistakes, found a winning strategy for the war. The Ottoman military command in Constantinople made poor assumptions about Russian intentions. They decided that Russians would be too lazy to march along the Danube and cross it away from the delta, and would prefer the short way along the Black Sea coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the River Danube, Vidin. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Nuri Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.

The Russian campaign was better planned, but it relied heavily on Turkish passivity. A crucial Russian mistake was sending too few troops initially; an expeditionary force of about 185,000 crossed the Danube in June, slightly fewer than the combined Turkish forces in the Balkans (about 200,000). After setbacks in July (at Pleven and Stara Zagora), the Russian military command realized it did not have the reserves to keep the offensive going and switched to a defensive posture. The Russians did not even have enough forces to blockade Pleven properly until late August, which effectively delayed the whole campaign for about two months.

At the start of the war, Russia and Romania destroyed all vessels along the Danube and mined the river, thus ensuring that Russian forces could cross the Danube at any point without resistance from the Ottoman Navy. The Ottoman command did not appreciate the significance of the Russians&#x27; actions. In June, a small Russian unit crossed the Danube close to the delta, at Galați, and marched towards Ruschuk (today Ruse). This made the Ottomans even more confident that the big Russian force would come right through the middle of the Ottoman stronghold.

In the first month of the war, the Ottomans suffered a pair of significant naval losses on the Danube. The turret ship was destroyed by a Russian artillery battery on 11 May. And on the night of 25–26 May, a Romanian torpedo boat with a mixed Romanian-Russian crew attacked and sank the Ottoman monitor on the Danube. Under the direct command of Major-General Mikhail Ivanovich Dragomirov, on the night of 27/28 June 1877 (NS) the Russians constructed a pontoon bridge across the Danube at Svishtov. After a short battle in which the Russians suffered 812 killed and wounded, the Russians secured the opposing bank and drove off the Ottoman infantry brigade defending Svishtov. At this point the Russian force was divided into three parts: the Eastern Detachment under the command of Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich, the future Tsar Alexander III of Russia, assigned to capture the fortress of Ruschuk and cover the army&#x27;s eastern flank; the Western Detachment, to capture the fortress of Nikopol, Bulgaria and cover the army&#x27;s western flank; and the Advance Detachment under Count Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko, which was assigned to quickly move via Veliko Tarnovo and penetrate the Balkan Mountains, the most significant barrier between the Danube and Constantinople.

Responding to the Russian crossing of the Danube, the Ottoman high command in Constantinople ordered Osman Nuri Pasha to advance east from Vidin and occupy the fortress of Nikopol, just west of the Russian crossing. On his way to Nikopol, Osman Pasha learned that the Russians had already captured the fortress and so moved to the crossroads town of Plevna (now known as Pleven), which he occupied with a force of approximately 15,000 on 19 July (NS). The Russians, approximately 9,000 under the command of General Schilder-Schuldner, reached Plevna early in the morning. Thus began the Siege of Plevna, lasting for 145 days until 10 December.

Osman Pasha organized a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side. At that point, the sides were almost equal in numbers and the Russian army was very discouraged. A counter-attack might have allowed the Ottomans to control and destroy the Russians&#x27; bridge, but Osman Pasha did not leave the fortress because he had orders to stay fortified in Plevna.

Russia had no more troops to throw against Plevna, so the Russians besieged it, and subsequently asked the Romanians to cross the Danube and help them. On 9 August, Suleiman Pasha made an attempt to help Osman Pasha with 30,000 troops, but he was stopped by Bulgarians at the Battle of Shipka Pass. After three days of fighting, the volunteers were relieved by a Russian force led by General Fyodor Radetsky, and the Turkish forces withdrew. Soon afterwards, Romanian forces crossed the Danube and joined the siege. On 16 August, at Gorni-Studen, the armies around Plevna were placed under the command of the Romanian Prince Carol I, aided by the Russian general Pavel Dmitrievich Zotov and the Romanian general Alexandru Cernat.

The Turks maintained several fortresses around Pleven which the Russian and Romanian forces gradually reduced. The Romanian 4th Division led by General Gheorghe Manu took the Grivitsa redoubt after four bloody assaults and managed to keep it until the very end of the siege. The Siege of Plevna (July–December 1877) turned to victory only after Russian and Romanian forces cut off all supply routes to the fortified Ottomans. With supplies running low, Osman Pasha made an attempt to break the Russian siege in the direction of Opanets. On 9 December, in the middle of the night the Ottomans threw bridges over the Vit river and crossed it, attacked on a front and broke through the first line of Russian trenches. Here they fought hand to hand and bayonet to bayonet, with little advantage to either side. Outnumbering the Ottomans almost 5 to 1, the Russians drove the Ottomans back across the Vit. Osman Pasha was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet, which killed his horse beneath him. Making a brief stand, the Ottomans eventually found themselves driven back into the city, losing 5,000 men to the Russians&#x27; 2,000. The next day, Osman surrendered the city, the garrison, and his sword to the Romanian colonel, Mihail Cerchez. He was treated honorably, but his troops perished in the snow by the thousands as they straggled off into captivity.

At this point, Serbia, having finally secured monetary aid from Russia, declared war on the Ottoman Empire again. This time there were far fewer Russian officers in the Serbian army but this was more than offset by the experience gained from the 1876–77 war. Under nominal command of Prince Milan Obrenović (effective command was in hands of general Kosta Protić, the army chief of staff), the Serbian Army went on offensive in what is now eastern south Serbia. A planned offensive into the Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar was called off due to strong diplomatic pressure from Austria-Hungary, which wanted to prevent Serbia and Montenegro from coming into contact, and which had designs to spread Austria-Hungary&#x27;s influence through the area. The Ottomans, outnumbered unlike two years before, mostly confined themselves to passive defence of fortified positions. By the end of hostilities the Serbs had captured Ak-Palanka (today Bela Palanka), Pirot, Niš and Vranje.
Russians under Field Marshal Gourko succeeded in capturing the passes at the Stara Planina mountain, which were crucial for maneuvering. Next, both sides fought a series of battles for Shipka Pass. Gourko made several attacks on the Pass and eventually secured it. Ottoman troops spent much effort to recapture this important route, to use it to reinforce Osman Pasha in Pleven, but failed. Eventually Gourko led a final offensive that crushed the Ottomans around Shipka Pass. The Ottoman offensive against Shipka Pass is considered one of the major mistakes of the war, as other passes were virtually unguarded. At this time a huge number of Ottoman troops stayed fortified along the Black Sea coast and engaged in very few operations.

A Russian army crossed the Stara Planina by a high snowy pass in winter, guided and helped by local Bulgarians, not expected by the Ottoman army, and defeated the Turks at the Battle of Tashkessen and took Sofia. The way was now open for a quick advance through Plovdiv and Adrianople to Constantinople.

Besides the Romanian Army (which mobilized around 114,000 soldiers), more than 12,000 volunteer Bulgarian troops (&quot;Opalchenie&quot;) from the local Bulgarian population as well as many &quot;hajduk&quot; detachments fought in the war on the side of the Russians.

===Caucasian theatre===
The Russian 1st Caucasus Army Corps was stationed in Georgia and Armenia, composed of approximately 50,000 men and 202 guns under the overall command of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich, Governor General of the Caucasus. The Russian force stood opposed by an Ottoman Army of 100,000 men led by General Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. While the Russian army was better prepared for the fighting in the region, it lagged behind technologically in certain areas such as heavy artillery and was outgunned, for example, by the superior long-range Krupp artillery that Germany had supplied to the Ottomans.

The Caucasus Corps was led by a quartet of Armenian commanders: Generals Mikhail Loris-Melikov, Arshak Ter-Gukasov (Ter-Ghukasov/Ter-Ghukasyan), Ivan Lazarev and Beybut Shelkovnikov. Forces under Lieutenant-General Ter-Gukasov, stationed near Yerevan, commenced the first assault into Ottoman territory by capturing the town of Bayazid on 27 April 1877. Capitalizing on Ter-Gukasov&#x27;s victory there, Russian forces advanced, taking the region of Ardahan on 17 May; Russian units also besieged the city of Kars in the final week of May, although Ottoman reinforcements lifted the siege and drove them back. Bolstered by reinforcements, in November 1877 General Lazarev launched a new attack on Kars, suppressing the southern forts leading to the city and capturing Kars itself on 18 November. On 19 February 1878, the strategic fortress town of Erzurum was taken by the Russians after a lengthy siege. Although they relinquished control of Erzurum to the Ottomans at the end the war, the Russians acquired the regions of Batum, Ardahan, Kars, Olti, and Sarikamish and reconstituted them into the Kars Oblast.

=== Greek involvement ===

During the course of the war, the majority of Greeks wanted to enter the war on Russia&#x27;s side, however the Greek government decided reluctantly to not intervene, due to British neutrality. The British guaranteed that after the end of the war they would intervene themselves and assure equal rights for the Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire, as long as Greece didn&#x27;t join the war. Nevertheless, several Greek revolts broke out in Crete, Epirus, Macedonia and Thessaly demanding union with Greece. The Greek Army invaded Thessaly in January 1878, but didn&#x27;t officially declare war on the Ottomans; along with Greek irregular revolutionaries, the Greek Army won the Battle of Mouzaki. However, the Great Powers asked for Greece to recall its army, in return, they ensured that issues regarding the Greek communities would be raised in the post-war Peace Conference. The Greek government accepted and, as a result, the rebellions were left unsupported and were crushed by the Ottomans. Three years later, with the Convention of Constantinople, most of Thessaly (excluding Elassona) as well as Arta were ceded to Greece.

=== Kurdish uprising ===

As the Russo-Turkish war came to a close, a Kurdish uprising began. It was led by two brothers, Husein and Osman Pasha. The rebellion held most of the region of Bohtan for 9 months. It was ended only through duplicity, after force of arms had failed. In Kars, Kurdish notables like Abdürrezzak Bedir Khan and a son of Sheikh Ubeydullah were supporters of the Russians.

=== Civilian government in Bulgaria during the war ===
After Bulgarian territories were liberated by the Russian Army during the war, they were governed initially by a provisional Russian administration, which was established in April 1877. The Treaty of Berlin (1878) provided for the termination of this provisional Russian administration in May 1879, when the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia were established. The main objectives of the temporary Russian administration were to secure peace and order and to prepare for a revival of the Bulgarian state.

==Aftermath==

===Intervention by the Great Powers===
Under pressure from the British, Russia accepted the truce offered by the Ottoman Empire on 31 January 1878, but continued to move towards Constantinople.

The British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the city, and Russian forces stopped at San Stefano. Eventually Russia entered into a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on 3 March, by which the Ottoman Empire would recognize the independence of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro, and the autonomy of Bulgaria.

Alarmed by the extension of Russian power into the Balkans, the Great Powers later forced modifications of the treaty in the Congress of Berlin. The main change here was that Bulgaria would be split, according to earlier agreements among the Great Powers that precluded the creation of a large new Slavic state: the northern and eastern parts to become principalities as before (Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia), though with different governors; and the Macedonian region, originally part of Bulgaria under San Stefano, would return to direct Ottoman administration.

The was a further continuation of negotiations between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. While reaffirming provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano which had not been modified by the Berlin Treaty, it set compensation terms owed by Ottoman Empire to Russia for losses sustained during the war. It contained terms to release prisoners of war and to grant amnesty to Ottoman subjects, as well as providing terms for the inhabitants nationality after the annexations. Article VII allowed subjects to opt within six months of the signing of the treaty to retain Ottoman subjecthood or become Russian subjects.

A surprising consequence came in Hungary (part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). Despite memories of the terrible defeat at Mohács in 1526, elite Hungarian attitudes were becoming strongly anti-Russian. This led to active support for the Turks in the media, but only in a peaceful way, since the foreign policy of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy remained neutral.

===Effects on Bulgaria&#x27;s Jewish population===
The &quot;Bulletins de l&#x27;Alliance Israélite Universelle&quot; reported that thousands of Bulgarian Jews found refuge at Constantinople and reported that many Jewish communities had fled in their entirety with the retreating Turks as their protectors.

However, this is directly contradicted by census figures, which, instead of a decrease, indicate a &quot;substantial increase&quot; in Bulgaria&#x27;s Jewish population before and after the war. While there were only 4,595 &quot;males&quot; or 9,190 &quot;male and female&quot; Jews in the five vilayets to form the future Principality of BulgariaRusçuk, Vidin, Sofia, Tirnova, and Varnaaccording to the pre-war Ottoman salname of 1875 (0.4% of the population), the 1880 Bulgarian census indicated a total of 14,342 Jews, who accounted for 0.7% of the post-war Bulgarian population. Moreover, an increase by 5,152 people, or 56%, in less than five years, cannot be explained by natural increase alone and would rather indicate substantial net immigration rather than emigration of Jews from the principality. Obviously, any such immigration or return of refugees would happen only after the postwar situation stabilized, offering necessary personal and economic security.

===Internationalization of the Armenian Question===

The conclusion of the Russo-Turkish war also led to the internationalization of the Armenian Question. Many Armenians in the eastern provinces (Turkish Armenia) of the Ottoman Empire greeted the advancing Russians as liberators. Violence and instability directed at Armenians during the war by Kurd and Circassian bands had left many Armenians looking toward the invading Russians as the ultimate guarantors of their security. Influential pro-Russian Armenian thinker Grigor Artsruni encouraged Armenians to migrate to Russia in order to form a more concentrated block. In January 1878, Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople Nerses II Varzhapetian approached the Russian leadership with the view of receiving assurances that the Russians would introduce provisions in the prospective peace treaty for self-administration in the Armenian provinces. Though not as explicit, Article 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano read:
The Armenian Patriarch discouraged Armenian migration to Russia and encouraged Armenians to &quot;remain faithful to the Sultan&quot;. The Patriarch held the belief that Armenian-inhabited areas could remain under Ottoman rule, but under Christian control, and that Muslims who were dissatisfied with how the Ottomans had been governing the provinces would tolerate life under Christian leadership. In attempting to persuade the British to drive a hard bargain with the Ottoman Empire, he asserted to British Ambassador Austen Henry Layard that the &quot;only thing … that could induce the Armenians to refrain from listening to the advice of Russia to emigrate, and to be content to remain under the rule of the Sultan, would be the appointment of an Armenian as Vali of Armenia&quot;. Great Britain, however, took objection to Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations by convening the Congress of Berlin in June 1878. An Armenian delegation led by prelate Mkrtich Khrimian traveled to Berlin to present the case of the Armenians but, much to its chagrin, was left out of the negotiations. Article 16 was modified and watered down, and all mention of the Russian forces remaining in the provinces was removed. In the final text of the Treaty of Berlin, it was transformed into Article 61, which read:
As it turned out, the reforms were not forthcoming. Khrimian returned to Constantinople and delivered a famous speech in which he likened the peace conference to a big cauldron of Liberty Stew&#x27; into which the big nations dipped their &#x27;iron ladles&#x27; for real results, while the Armenian delegation had only a &#x27;Paper Ladle&#x27;. &#x27;Ah dear Armenian people,&#x27; Khrimian said, &#x27;could I have dipped my Paper Ladle in the cauldron it would sog and remain there! Where guns talk and sabers shine, what significance do appeals and petitions have? Given the absence of tangible improvements in the plight of the Armenian community, a number of Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia in the 1880s and 1890s formed political parties and revolutionary societies to secure better conditions for their compatriots in Ottoman Armenia and other parts of the Ottoman Empire.

==Civilian casualties==

=== Atrocities and ethnic cleansing ===
Both sides carried out massacres and an ethnic cleansing policy during the war.

====Against Turks====

In January 1878, advancing coalition forces started committing atrocities against Muslim populations in the region. British reports from that time have detailed information about atrocities and massacres. According to those reports, in the village of İssova Bâlâ, the school and 96 of the 170 houses were burned to the ground. The inhabitants of Yukarı Sofular were slaughtered and 12 of the 130 houses in village, a mosque, and a school were burned. In Kozluca, 18 Turks were killed. Massacres of Muslim inhabitants occurred in Kazanlak too. In the village of Muflis, 127 Muslim inhabitants were kidnapped by a group of Russian and Bulgarian troops. 20 managed to escape. The rest were killed. 400 people from Muflis were killed according to Ottoman sources. 11 inhabitants were killed in Keçidere. According to John Joseph the Russian troops frequently killed Muslim peasants to prevent them from disrupting their supply and troop movements. During the Battle of Harmanli accompanying this retaliation on Muslim non-combatants, it was reported that a huge group of Muslim townspeople were attacked by the Russian army. Thousands died and their goods were confiscated. The correspondent of &quot;The Daily News&quot; describes as an eyewitness the burning of four or five Turkish villages by the Russian troops in response to the Turks firing at the Russians from the villages, instead of behind rocks or trees, which must have appeared to the Russian soldiers as guerrilla attempts by the local Muslim populace upon the Russian contingencies operating against the Ottoman forces embedded in the area. During the conflict a number of Muslim buildings and cultural centres were also destroyed. A large library of old Turkish books was destroyed when a mosque in Turnovo was burned in 1877. Most mosques in Sofia were destroyed, seven of them in one night in December 1878 when &quot;a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers.&quot;

Many villages in the Kars region were pillaged by Russian army during the war. The war in Caucasus caused many Muslims to migrate to remaining Ottoman lands, mostly in poverty and with poor conditions. Between 1878 and 1881, 82,000 Muslims migrated to the Ottoman Empire from lands ceded to Russia in Caucasus.

=====Muslim war refugees according to census data and Ottoman official documents=====
According to Ottoman official records, the total number of refugees from the lands ceded in 1878 to the Principality of Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia, Serbia, Romania and Austria-Hungary (from Bosnia) from 1876 to 1879 stands at 571,152 people: 276,389 in 1876, 198,000 in 1877, 76,000 in 1878 and 20,763 in 1879. However, it is unclear if the numbers include refugees who emigrated after the suspension of hostilities.

According to the pre-war Ottoman salname of 1875, the total male Muslim population of the five vilayets to form the future Principality of BulgariaRusçuk, Vidin, Sofia, Tirnova, and Varnastood at 405,450 (total population of 810,900), however, inclusive of Circassian Muhacir and Muslim Romani. The Danube vilayet census of 1874, which covered all sanjaks in the vilayet except Niš counted a total of 963,596 Muslims. The total Muslim population of the Danube Vilayet for the same year, Niš included, stood at 1,055,650. This number included not only Ottoman Turks, but also Crimean Tatars, Circassians, Pomaks, Romani as well as a substantial number of Albanians.

At the same time, the 1876 Ottoman population records for the Sanjaks of Filibe and İslimye, which were detached from the Adrianople Vilayet to form Eastern Rumelia in 1878, indicated 171,777 male Turks and 16,353 male Muslim Roma, or total Muslim population of 376,260. This figure however included the Rhodopian kazas of Ahi Çelebi and Sultanyeri (male Muslim population of 8,197 and 13,336, respectively, or total Muslim population for both of 43,066), which remained part of in the Ottoman Empire. Without Ahi Çelebi and Sultanyeri, the Muslim population of Eastern Rumelia was 333,194.

Thus, according to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s own population records, the total number of Muslims in the territories ceded by the Empire to the Principality of Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia, Serbia and Romania, did not exceed 1,388,844 people (1,055,650 for the Danube Vilayet and 333,194 for the Filibe and İslimye Sanjaks), a figure that is lower than the approx. 1.5 million Turks who had reportedly perished or been forced to migrate according to both Karpat and İpekwhose estimates would also necessarily mean that no Muslims whatsoever remained in either the Principality of Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia, Serbia or Romanian Dobruja.

At the same time, the 1880 population census of the Principality of Bulgaria gave 578,060 Muslims; the 1880 population census of Eastern Rumelia indicated 174,749 Turks and 19,254 Romani (total Muslim population of 194,003); the 1880 population census of Romanian North Dobruja showed 18,624 Turks and 29,476 Crimean Tatars (total of 48,100 Muslims), while the 1880 population census of Serbia stated only 6,567 Muslims in the Niš area.

Thus, as of 1880, the total number of Muslims who lived in the territories ceded by the Ottoman Empire stood at 827,000 people, down from 1,388,844 Muslims counted by the pre-war Ottoman statistics, signifying a net loss of 561,844 Muslims (40.4%). While shockingly high, this figure falls short by more than 200,000 people of Dennis P. Hupchick and Justin McCarthy&#x27;s estimates of some 260,000 Muslims missing/dead and 500,000 forced to emigrate and is way more off compared to the figure of more than 750,000 Muslim casualties and victims of ethnic cleansing from the Bulgarian lands alone quoted by Douglas Arthur Howard.

The Principality of Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia and Romania accounted for a negative net balance of 472,792 Muslims (or a net loss of 36.5%).

By comparison, Serbia, the only country in the region, which did indeed engage in ethnic cleansing and forced expulsion of its Muslim population, effectively reduced its Muslim population between 1877 and 1880 from 95,619 to 6,567 people (cf. Expulsion of the Albanians, 1877–1878), i.e., a net loss of 89,052 Muslims, or 93%.

=====Historians&#x27; estimates about Muslim population losses=====
20th century historians have made different guesses about the total Muslim losses during the Russo-Turkish war. Dennis P. Hupchick and Justin McCarthy says that 260,000 people went missing and 500,000 became refugees. Turkish historian Kemal Karpat claims that 250–300,000 people, about 17% of the former Muslim population of Bulgaria, died as a consequence of famine, disease, and massacres, and 1 to 1.5 million people were forced to migrate. Turkish author Nedim İpek gives the same numbers as Karpat. Another source claims 400,000 Turks were massacred and 1,000,000 Turks had to migrate during the war. The perpetrators of those massacres are also disputed, with Justin McCarthy claiming that they were carried out by Russian soldiers, Cossacks as well as Bulgarian volunteers and villagers, though there were few civilian casualties in battle. while James J. Reid claims that Circassians were significantly responsible for the refugee flow, that there were civilian casualties from battle and even that the Ottoman army was responsible for casualties among the Muslim population. The number of Muslim refugees is estimated by R.J. Crampton to be 130,000. Richard C. Frucht estimates that only half (700,000) of the prewar Muslim population remained after the war, 216,000 had died and the rest emigrated. Douglas Arthur Howard estimates that half the 1.5 million Muslims, for the most part Turks, in prewar Bulgaria had disappeared by 1879. 200,000 had died, the rest became permanently refugees in Ottoman territories.

In this connection, it is important to note that Justin McCarthy, who is the author of the estimates above and has been requoted by both Hupchik and Howard, is an Armenian Genocide denialist who has been criticised severely by many of his colleagues for whitewashing Ottoman history. Moreover, McCarthy is a member of, and has received grants from, the Institute of Turkish Studies. Throughout his career, he has been accused, among other things, of being &quot;an apologist for the Turkish state&quot;, of having &quot;an indefensible bias toward the Turkish official position&quot;, of selectively using sources and of always ascribing intent to non-Ottoman troops while making excuses for Ottoman ones for similar events.

==== Against Albanians ====
====Against Bulgarians====
The most notable massacre of Bulgarian civilians during the Russo-Turkish War took place during the Battle of Stara Zagora in July 1877, when Gurko&#x27;s forces had to retreat back to the Shipka pass. In the aftermath of the battle, Suleiman Pasha&#x27;s forces burned down and plundered the city of Stara Zagora and subjected its population to indiscriminate slaughter.

At the time, Stara Zagora was not only one of the biggest Bulgarian cities, but it also accommodated some 20,000 refugees from nearby villages, seeking shelter from Ottoman reprisals. The number of massacred Christian civilians in the course of the battle is estimated at between 14,000 and 14,500, which would make it the biggest war crime in modern-era Bulgaria. In addition to the massacre carried out by the Suleiman&#x27;s regular forces, Circassian bashi-bazouks engaged in numerous acts of looting, plunder and killing, among other things, The Terror in Karlovo, the Kalofer massacre, the Kavarna uprising etc. etc.

Moreover, Suleiman Pasha&#x27;s forces also established an entire system of police and judicial terror across the entire valley of the Maritsa, where any Bulgarian who had ever in any way assisted the Russians was hanged. However, even villages that had not assisted the Russians were destroyed and their inhabitants massacred. As a result, as many as 100,000 civilian Bulgarians fled north to the Russian occupied territories. Later on in the campaign, the Ottoman forces planned to burn the town of Sofia after Gurko had managed to overcome their resistance in the passes of Western part of the Balkan Mountains.

Only the refusal of the Italian Consul Vito Positano, the French Vice Consul Leandre le Gay and the Austro–Hungarian Vice Consul to leave Sofia prevented that from happening. After the Ottoman retreat, Positano even organized armed detachments to protect the population from marauders (regular Ottoman Army deserters and bashi-bazouks). Circassians in the Ottoman forces also raped and murdered Bulgarians during the 1877 Russo-Turkish war.

According to Bulgarian historians, 30,000 Bulgarian civilians were killed during the war, with two-thirds of the killings being committed in the Stara Zagora area.

====Against Circassians====
Russians raped Circassian girls during the 1877 Russo-Turkish war from the Circassian refugees who were settled in the Ottoman Balkans. After the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano, the 10,000-strong Circassian minority in Dobruja was expelled.

==Lasting effects==

===International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement===

This war caused a division in the emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement which continues to this day. Both Russia and the Ottoman Empire had signed the First Geneva Convention (1864), which made the Red Cross, a colour reversal of the flag of neutral Switzerland, the sole emblem of protection for military medical personnel and facilities. However, during this war the cross instead reminded the Ottomans of the Crusades; so they elected to replace the cross with the Red Crescent instead. This ultimately became the symbol of the Movement&#x27;s national societies in most Muslim countries, and was ratified as an emblem of protection by later Geneva Conventions in 1929 and again in 1949 (the current version).

Iran, which neighbored both the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire, considered them to be rivals, and probably considered the Red Crescent in particular to be an Ottoman symbol; except for the Red Crescent being centred and without a star, it is a colour reversal of the Ottoman flag (and the modern Turkish flag). This appears to have led to their national society in the Movement being initially known as the Red Lion and Sun Society, using a red version of the Lion and Sun, a traditional Iranian symbol. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran switched to the Red Crescent, but the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize the Red Lion and Sun as an emblem of protection.

==In popular culture==

The novella &quot;Jalaleddin&quot;, published in 1878 by the novelist Raffi describes the Kurdish massacres of Armenians in the eastern Ottoman Empire at the time of the Russo-Turkish war. The novella follows the journey of a young man through the mountains of Anatolia. The historical descriptions in the novella correspond with information from British sources at the time.

The novel &quot;The Doll&quot; (Polish title: &quot;Lalka&quot;), written in 1887–1889 by Bolesław Prus, describes consequences of the Russo-Turkish war for merchants living in Russia and partitioned Poland. The main protagonist helped his Russian friend, a multi-millionaire, and made a fortune supplying the Russian Army in 1877–1878. The novel describes trading during political instability, and its ambiguous results for Russian and Polish societies.

The 1912 silent film &quot;Independența României&quot; depicted the war in Romania.

Russian writer Boris Akunin uses the war as the setting for the novel &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot; (1998).

<text>Jesús Luis Ocaña Pernía (; 9 June 1945 – 19 May 1994) was a Spanish road bicycle racer who won the 1973 Tour de France and the 1970 Vuelta a España. During the 1971 Tour de France he launched an amazing solo breakaway that put him into the Yellow Jersey and stunned the rest of the main field, including back to back Tour champion Eddy Merckx, but abandoned in the fourteenth stage after a crash on the descent of the Col de Menté. Ocaña would abandon many Tours, but he finished every Vuelta a España he entered except for his first, and finished in the top 5 seven times in a row.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
Ocaña was born in Priego, Cuenca, Spain but his family moved to Mont-de-Marsan (Landes, France) in 1957. Ocaña took up racing with a club in Mont-de-Marsan and began his professional career in 1968 with the Spanish Fagor team, becoming Spanish champion that year. The following year he won the prologue and two time trials, the mountains classification as well as finishing second in the Vuelta a España.

In 1969, he won the Catalan Cycling Week.

In 1970, Ocaña signed with the French team Bic. In the 1970 Vuelta a España, he battled with Agustín Tamames, losing the leader&#x27;s jersey to him on the 13th stage. Ocaña performed well in the time-trial on the final day putting himself back into the Gold jersey as he won his first Grand Tour with an advantage of 1:18 over Tamames. The Spanish newspaper Dicen said Ocaña was &quot;the best time-trialist that Spanish cycling has ever had&quot;. In the 1970 Tour de France, Ocaña won the stage to Puy-de-Dôme and finished 31st in the Tour.

=== 1971 Tour de France ===
Before the Tour de France, Ocaña finished third behind Eddy Merckx in Paris–Nice and second behind Merckx in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. On the uphill finish of stage eight with four kilometres to go, Ocaña launched the decisive move and broke away from the favourites for that year&#x27;s Tour, which included Merckx. He succeeded in a 15-second gain on Merckx but built on that the following day. Then on stage 11 to Orcières-Merlette, Ocaña rode himself into the yellow jersey with eight minutes over Merckx.

After a rest day, Merckx cut that lead to 7 minutes and in the Pyrenees, on the Col de Menté, Merckx attacked as he descended the mountain. Merckx lost control and skidded into a low wall. Ocaña could not avoid Merckx and fell himself. Merckx was up quickly and sped away. Ocaña struggled to release his cleats from the toe clips and was struck by the pursuing Joop Zoetemelk. The leader of the general classification lay on the ground screaming with pain. He was taken by helicopter to the hospital in Saint-Gaudens. He recovered but his 1971 Tour dreams had come to an end. The following day Merckx refused to wear the yellow jersey, in tribute to Ocaña. There is a memorial at the scene of the accident on the western side of the Col de Menté in the Pyrenees (at ).

The following year, 1972, Merckx had intended on not participating in the 1972 Tour de France in order to ride the Vuelta a España for the first time, but due to critics saying that Merckx only won the Tour because of Ocaña&#x27;s fall, Merckx decided to ride. There was speculation of a duel. Ocaña had won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the national championship. In the Pyrenees, Ocaña repeatedly attacked Merckx without success, before withdrawing with bronchitis.

In 1973, Merckx decided to ride the Vuelta a España and Giro d&#x27;Italia. It was the first time that Merckx contested the Vuelta a España and that year he would not be contesting the Tour de France. Ocaña battled Merckx in the race with Bernard Thévenet also present. In the end Ocaña finished second, almost 4 minutes behind Merckx.

=== 1973 Winner of the Tour de France ===

Because Ocaña had only finished one of the four previous editions of the Tour de France that he had started, he was not considered a favourite for overall victory. Merckx, who was not competing, had picked José Manuel Fuente, Joop Zoetemelk and Raymond Poulidor for the podium. Indeed, Zoetemelk and Poulidor had finished first and second after the prologue while Ocaña crashed during the first stage when a dog ran into the peloton. However, on the third stage, Ocaña and his team distanced his rivals. The stage began in Roubaix and when the peloton went over cobblestones at Querenaing, Ocaña and four teammates together with six others, attacked, and gained five minutes at one point, although the chasing group reduced this to two and a half minutes at the finish. However, Fuente finished seven minutes back.

Ocaña won the first mountain stage and took the yellow jersey, while Thévenet won the second mountain stage. L&#x27;Equipe newspaper predicted a duel. However, on the third mountain stage, Ocaña delivered a crushing defeat to his rivals. Fuente attacked early on the Col du Télégraphe and a group of favourites was established. On the following climb of the Col du Galibier, Ocaña led. After the descent, Ocaña and Fuente had a minute on Thévenet, while the next group were five minutes and 30 seconds behind. Fuente suffered a flat tire and Ocaña won by 52 seconds over Fuente, almost seven minutes over Thévenet &amp; Martinez, and 20 minutes &amp; 24 seconds over Zoetemelk, Van Impe and Poulidor. Ocaña then led the general classification by nine minutes over Fuente, ten minutes on Thevénet, with Zoetemelk fifth, over 23 minutes behind. Ocaña then won the stage 12 time trial. A duel in the Pyrenees was expected between Ocaña and Fuente but Ocaña won the longest stage in the Pyrenees. L&#x27;Equipe had the headline &quot;Ocaña appuie sur l&#x27;accélérateur&quot; translated as &quot;Ocaña steps on the accelerator&quot;. Ocaña won the last individual time trial and also the mountain stage to Puy-de-Dôme, eventually winning the race with 15 minutes over Bernard Thévenet. He also won the combativity award. After his win, Ocaña declared that after the 1974 Tour de France, he wanted to try the hour record.
=== Post-Tour career ===
After his win in the Tour de France, Ocaña finished third and won the bronze medal in the world championship road race. He also won the Vuelta Ciclista al País Vasco in 1973 and finished fourth in the 1974 Vuelta a España, won by Fuente. Ocaña was unable to defend his Tour de France win in 1974 due to an injury sustained during the Midi-Libre. He finished fourth again in the 1975 Vuelta a España. In 1976, he was back to top form and finished third in Paris–Nice and second overall in the Vuelta a España, a minute behind José Pesarrodona.

Ocaña retired at the end of 1977 after finishing 25th in the 1975 Tour de France. He had won 110 races including nine stages of the Tour de France. He retired to his vineyard in 1977. It is said that despite their rivalry on the road, Merckx organised for a Belgian distributor to order a sizeable quantity of wine from Ocaña&#x27;s ailing vineyard.

== Death ==
Ocaña died by suicide, in Nogaro, Gers, France by gunshot in 1994. It is said he was depressed over financial matters and was also suffering from liver cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and cancer.

<text>The Oxford Movement was a movement of high church members of the Church of England which began in the 1830s and eventually developed into Anglo-Catholicism. The movement, whose original devotees were mostly associated with the University of Oxford, argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. They thought of Anglicanism as one of three branches of the &quot;one, holy, catholic, and apostolic&quot; Christian church. Many key participants subsequently converted to Roman Catholicism. 

The movement&#x27;s philosophy was known as Tractarianism after its series of publications, the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, published from 1833 to 1841. Tractarians were also disparagingly referred to as &quot;Newmanites&quot; (before 1845) and &quot;Puseyites&quot; after two prominent Tractarians, John Henry Newman and Edward Bouverie Pusey. Other well-known Tractarians included John Keble, Charles Marriott, Richard Froude, Robert Wilberforce, Isaac Williams and William Palmer. All except Williams and Palmer were fellows of Oriel College, Oxford.

==History==

In the early nineteenth century, many of the clergymen of the Church of England, particularly those in high office, saw themselves as latitudinarian (liberal). Conversely, many clergy in the parishes were Evangelicals, as a result of the revival led by John Wesley. Alongside this, the universities became the breeding ground for a movement to restore liturgical and devotional customs which borrowed deeply from traditions before the English Reformation, as well as from contemporary Roman Catholic traditions.

The immediate impetus for the Tractarian movement was a perceived attack by the reforming Whig administration on the structure and revenues of the Church of Ireland (the established church in Ireland), with the Irish Church Temporalities Bill (1833). The Act provided for the merging of dioceses and provinces of the Church of Ireland, and the elimination of Vestry Assessment (church rates or &quot;parish cess&quot;), a cause of grievance in the Tithe War. The bill also made changes to the leasing of church lands. Some politicians and clergy (including a number of Whigs) feared that the Church of England might be disestablished and lose its endowments. John Keble criticised these proposals as &quot;National Apostasy&quot; in his Assize Sermon in Oxford in 1833, in which he denied the authority of the British Parliament to abolish several dioceses in Ireland. 

The Gorham Case, in which secular courts overruled an ecclesiastical court on the matter of a priest with somewhat unorthodox views on the efficacy of infant baptism, was also deeply unsettling. Keble, Edward Bouverie Pusey, Newman, and others began to publish a series known as &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, which called the Church of England to return to the ways of the ancient and undivided church in matters of doctrine, liturgy and devotion. They believed that the Church of England needed to affirm that its authority did not come from the authority of the state, but from God. 

Even if the Anglican Church were completely separated from the state, it could still claim the loyalty of Englishmen because it rested on divine authority and the principle of apostolic succession. With a wide distribution and a price in pennies, the Tracts succeeded in drawing attention to the views of the Oxford Movement on points of doctrine, but also to its overall approach, to the extent that Tractarian became a synonym for supporter of the movement. 
The Tractarians postulated the Branch Theory, which states that Anglicanism, along with Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, form three &quot;branches&quot; of the historic pre-schism Catholic Church. Tractarians argued for the inclusion of traditional aspects of liturgy from medieval religious practice, as they believed the church had become too &quot;plain&quot;. In the final tract, &quot;Tract 90&quot;, Newman argued that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, as defined by the Council of Trent, were compatible with the Thirty-Nine Articles of the 16th-century Church of England. Newman&#x27;s eventual reception into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845, followed by Henry Edward Manning in 1851, had a profound effect on the movement.

==Publications==
Apart from the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, the group began a collection of translations of the Church Fathers, which they termed the &quot;Library of the Fathers&quot;. The collection eventually comprised 48 volumes, the last published three years after Pusey&#x27;s death. They were issued through Rivington&#x27;s company with the imprint of the Holyrood Press. The main editor for many of these was Charles Marriott. A number of volumes of original Greek and Latin texts were also published. One of the main contributions that resulted from Tractarianism is the hymnbook entitled &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; which was published in 1861.

==Influence and criticism==
The Oxford Movement was criticised as being a mere &quot;Romanising&quot; tendency, but it began to influence the theory and practice of Anglicanism more broadly, spreading to cities such as Bristol during the 1840s-50s. The Oxford Movement was also criticised as both secretive and collusive.

The Oxford Movement resulted in the establishment of Anglican religious orders, both of men and of women. It incorporated ideas and practices related to the practice of liturgy and ceremony to incorporate more powerful emotional symbolism in the church. In particular, it brought the insights of the Liturgical Movement into the life of the church. Its effects were so widespread that the Eucharist gradually became more central to worship, vestments became common, and numerous Roman Catholic practices were re-introduced into worship. This led to controversies within churches that resulted in court cases, as in the dispute about ritualism.

Many of the Tractarian priests began working in slums. This was partly because bishops refused to give livings to Tractarian priests, and partly due to an ethos of concern for the poor. From their new ministries, they developed a critique of British social policy, both local and national. One of the results was the establishment of the Christian Social Union, of which a number of bishops were members, where issues such as the just wage, the system of property renting, infant mortality and industrial conditions were debated. The more radical Catholic Crusade was a much smaller organisation than the Oxford Movement. Anglo-Catholicism – as this complex of ideas, styles and organisations became known – had a significant influence on global Anglicanism.

Gu Hongming, an early twentieth-century Chinese author, used the concept of the Oxford Movement to argue for a return to traditional Confucianism in China.

==End of Newman&#x27;s involvement and receptions into Roman Catholicism==

One of the principal writers and proponents of Tractarianism was John Henry Newman, a popular Oxford priest who, after writing his final tract, &quot;Tract 90&quot;, became convinced that the Branch Theory was inadequate. Concerns that Tractarianism was disguised Roman Catholicism were not unfounded; Newman believed that the Roman and Anglican churches were wholly compatible. He was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845 and was ordained a Catholic priest two years later. He later became a cardinal (but not a bishop). Writing on the end of Tractarianism as a movement, Newman stated:I saw indeed clearly that my place in the Movement was lost; public confidence was at an end; my occupation was gone. It was simply an impossibility that I could say any thing henceforth to good effect, when I had been posted up by the marshal on the buttery-hatch of every College of my University, after the manner of discommoned pastry-cooks, and when in every part of the country and every class of society, through every organ and opportunity of opinion, in newspapers, in periodicals, at meetings, in pulpits, at dinner-tables, in coffee-rooms, in railway carriages, I was denounced as a traitor who had laid his train and was detected in the very act of firing it against the time-honoured Establishment. Newman was one of a number of Anglican clergy who were received into the Roman Catholic Church during the 1840s who were either members of, or were influenced by, Tractarianism.

<text>The European Academy for Environmental Affairs (also known as European Academy of Environmental Affairs) is a private organization which cosponsored the 1995 conference that produced the Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change, a SEPP-initiated document in which some scientists argue against global warming theories. Founder and president of the Academy was the late Prof. Dr. hc. Helmut Metzner (1925-1999), who was professor for chemical plant physiology. Metzner was accused of having connections to the Studienzentrum Weikersheim, a right-wing think-tank in Baden-Württemberg.

In 1993 the Academy also held a conference in Mannheim under the title &quot;Globale Erwärmung - Tatsache oder Behauptung?&quot; (Global warming—fact or fiction?). The Academy was recognized in a consultative function by the Council of Europe, but the status was withdrawn because of the Academy&#x27;s failure to comply with its obligations.

The Academy has no active web pages, and it may be defunct. A list of textbooks on ecology issued by the Academy is available online.

<doc id="275103" wikidata="Q295207" url="?curid=275103" title="Joel Schumacher">
<text>Joel T. Schumacher (; August 29, 1939 – June 22, 2020) was an American film director, producer and screenwriter. Raised in New York City by his mother, Schumacher graduated from Parsons School of Design and originally became a fashion designer. He first entered filmmaking as a production and costume designer before gaining writing credits on &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;Sparkle&quot;, and &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

Schumacher received little attention for his first theatrically released films, &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot; and &quot;D.C. Cab&quot;, but rose to prominence after directing &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;The Client&quot; and &quot;Falling Down&quot;. Schumacher was selected to replace Tim Burton as director of the Batman film franchise, and oversaw two of the series&#x27; most commercially-oriented entries, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997). The latter&#x27;s failure foresaw a steep career decline, although Schumacher continued directing work on smaller-budgeted films, such as &quot;Tigerland&quot; and &quot;Phone Booth&quot;. In 2004, he directed &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which was released to mixed reviews. His final directorial work was two episodes of &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Joel T. Schumacher was born on August 29, 1939, in New York City. His parents were Francis Schumacher, a Baptist from Knoxville, Tennessee, who died from pneumonia when Joel was four, and Marian (Kantor), a Swedish Jew. He was raised by his widowed mother in Long Island City. During his youth, he used LSD and methamphetamine and started drinking alcohol by age nine. In 1965, he graduated from Parsons School of Design, after having studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology, and later became a designer for Revlon in 1966.

At the time of his mother&#x27;s death in 1965, Schumacher stated that his &quot;life seemed like a joke&quot; as he was $50,000 in debt, lost multiple teeth, and only weighed . However, in 1970, he stopped using drugs and became employed at Henri Bendel. He later stated that &quot;I got my self-respect back getting a good day&#x27;s pay for a good day&#x27;s work.&quot;

==Career==
===Production designer===

In 1972, Schumacher served as a costume designer for &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; and designed the wardrobes of Dyan Cannon, Joan Hackett, and Raquel Welch for the film &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;. In 1973, he served as a costume designer for Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot;, and Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Blume in Love&quot;. In 1974, he served as the production designer of &quot;Killer Bees&quot;. He later served as a costume designer for &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; and &quot;Interiors&quot;.

===Early filmmaking===

In 1974, Schumacher wrote a script for an eponymous biographic made-for-television movie based on the life of Virginia Hill. He was selected to serve as the movie&#x27;s director and started filming on September 9.

In 1974, he and Howard Rosenman wrote the script for &quot;Sparkle&quot; which later went into production in 1975, and was released in 1976. His original plan for the film was for the film to be a &quot;black &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;&quot;, but had to be modest due to the limited budget given to the production by Warner Bros. According to Schumacher the film represented his &quot;personal fascination&quot; with Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross. He was later selected to write the screenplays for &quot;Car Wash&quot; and &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

In 1978, Schumacher was selected to serve as the director of &quot;Amateur Night at the Dixie Bar and Grill&quot; which was later released in 1979. On January 31, 1980, he submitted a script for &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, but the film underwent rewrites in development hell.

In 1979, he was selected to serve as the director of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, his first theatrically released film, to replace John Landis, who had left after Universal Pictures had reduced the film&#x27;s budget. In 1981, the film was released to negative reviews, and was a box office bomb. The film was initially given a $30 million budget, but it was reduced to $11–13 million although it would later rise to over $20 million due to the cost of special effects.

In 1983, he directed &quot;D.C. Cab&quot; starring Mr. T, but later stated that he only worked on the film as he needed a job.

===&quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; and &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;===

In 1984, Schumacher was selected by Columbia Pictures to direct &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; and was secretive during the production of the film. In 1987, he directed &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. Both films were successful among young people and were his first major critical and commercial successes.

Following &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, Schumacher directed &quot;Cousins&quot; (a remake of the French film &quot;Cousin Cousine&quot;), &quot;Flatliners&quot;, &quot;Dying Young&quot;, &quot;Falling Down&quot;, and &quot;The Client&quot;.

===Batman===
Schumacher was selected by Warner Bros. in 1993 to replace Tim Burton as the director of the Batman franchise. He directed &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, which was a stylistic departure from Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; was released to mixed reviews, but was more financially successful than &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.

He later directed &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, which was rushed into production following &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and was intentionally made toyetic and light-hearted to appeal to children and sell merchandise. The film was released to largely negative reviews and did not perform as well at the box-office as any of its predecessors, causing a planned sequel, &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;, to be cancelled. Schumacher later approached Warner Bros. to pitch concepts for a new Batman movie which were inspired by Frank Miller&#x27;s graphic novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, but due to the box-office bomb of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, along with the negative impact that the film had on his reputation, Warner Bros. refused to let him develop another Batman film. Schumacher later apologized for the quality of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; in 2017.

It was alleged that Schumacher, a gay man, had added homoerotic elements to the film with the most prominent being the rubber nipples, codpieces, and close-up camera shots of Batman and Robin&#x27;s buttocks. Schumacher stated that the designs of the suits had been based on anatomically correct Greek statues and medical drawings. However, George Clooney, who played Batman in the film, said in 2005 that Schumacher told him that Batman was gay.

===Later career===

Following &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Schumacher directed &quot;8mm&quot;, &quot;Flawless&quot;, &quot;Tigerland&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;The Number 23&quot;, &quot;Blood Creek&quot;, &quot;Twelve&quot;, and &quot;Trespass&quot;.

In August 2008, Schumacher directed the music video for American rock band Scars on Broadway, for their single &quot;World Long Gone&quot;.

In 2013, he directed two episodes of the television series &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

===Unrealized projects===

==Personal life==
Schumacher was openly gay and described himself as &quot;extremely promiscuous&quot;, saying in a 2019 interview that he became sexually active at age eleven, estimating that he had sex with between 10,000 and 20,000 men over the course of his life. He said the first person he knew who died from the AIDS epidemic, in 1983, &quot;was not promiscuous&quot;, which led Schumacher to believe he would die soon after, recalling that he thought at the time, &quot;If he has it, I must have it quadrupled [...] I was sure I had it, I was planning my death&quot;, though he never contracted the disease.

In 1984, Schumacher purchased the horse stables that had belonged to Rudolph Valentino from Doris Duke.

Schumacher donated to Democratic Party candidates, including multiple congressional campaigns as well as John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign.

==Death==
On June 22, 2020, Schumacher died from cancer. Following his death, he was praised by Jim Carrey as well as Matthew McConaughey who credited Schumacher with launching his career.

<doc id="275108" wikidata="Q5122985" url="?curid=275108" title="Sydney Trains M set">
<text>The Sydney Trains M sets, also referred to as the Millennium trains, are a class of electric multiple units (EMU) that operate on the Sydney Trains network. Built by EDi Rail between 2002 and 2005, the first sets initially entered service under the CityRail brand on 1 July 2002 after short delays due to electrical defects. The M sets were built as &quot;fourth generation&quot; trains for Sydney&#x27;s suburban rail fleet, replacing the 1960s Tulloch carriages and providing extra capacity on the suburban rail network. The sets currently operate on the T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West, T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West, T5 Cumberland, T6 Lidcombe &amp; Bankstown, T7 Olympic Park and T8 Airport &amp; South lines.

== Design ==

The Millennium train, just like the entire Sydney Trains fleet and electric NSW TrainLink fleet, is a double decker. It is a four car consist, with the middle two cars being non-control motor cars and the two outer cars being driving control trailer cars fitted with the pantograph. The Millennium train was the first to be equipped with an AC drive system unlike the Tangara, which has a DC drive system. The sets usually operate in eight-car formations with two four-car sets combined.
While the Millennium train concept is an evolution of the Tangara concept (manufactured by A Goninan &amp; Co), the Millennium train introduced new features such as internal electronic destination indicators, automated digital voice announcements for upcoming stops, a return to reversible seating, surveillance cameras, wider stairways, a new safety yellow colour scheme, and push-button opened internal doors. The Millennium Train also introduced crumple zones to absorb impact in a collision. Interiors were designed by Transport Design International.

The train also features emergency help points, allowing passengers to contact the train crew in an emergency. The help points are located on the sides of the stairwell to the upper deck. There are actually two help points in the same location, with a large one at face height with a microphone and speaker, and a lower one with a microphone only. There are also emergency door releases which were retrofitted to the trains. These allow passengers to manually open the doors in an emergency, as recommended in the report for the Waterfall rail accident. The retrofit program was stated as having been completed in November 2014.

Like with the T, A and B sets, the M sets feature Scharfenberg couplers.

M sets are wide, being classed by Transport for NSW as medium width trains, which allows them to operate within the whole Sydney Trains suburban network.

Unlike sets M2–M35, set M1 has a slightly different interior design with differently coloured doors and different seat handles for unknown reasons.

== Delivery ==
The cars were constructed by EDi Rail at Cardiff Workshops. The contract included a 15-year maintenance agreement with EDi Rail to maintain the trains at a specialised maintenance centre at Eveleigh. During testing and initial revenue service, they ran as four car sets, with eight car sets commencing service towards the end of 2002 after further testing. All 35 four car sets were delivered by October 2005.

The initial order signed in October 1998 was for 81 carriages, in December 2002 an option was taken up for an additional 60. In February 2017, Sydney Trains exercised an option to extend Downer&#x27;s maintenance of the trains for a further 10 years.

=== Criticisms ===
The Millennium trains were criticised for having several technical problems and causing problems with Sydney Trains, they were referred to in the media reports as The &quot;Mi-lemon&quot; and &quot;Millenni-Bug&quot; as a result. Some of the problems were caused by insufficient power supply on the overhead to cope with the power demands of the more technologically advanced trains causing them to shut down. Software bugs also contributed to the trains&#x27; poor reliability.

The Millennium trains were withdrawn from service in April 2003 while the problems were being rectified and a full audit was carried out. They were subsequently reintroduced into service in June 2003.

As of the new timetable since 20 October 2024, M Sets now run 8-car services on the T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West, T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West, T5 Cumberland and T8 Airport &amp; South lines, while also running 4-car services T5 Cumberland, T6 Lidcombe &amp; Bankstown and T7 Olympic Park lines.

== In service ==
=== External Carriage Camera Trial ===

In late 2008, two Millennium trains were fitted with external cameras atop of carriages near the doors, testing their use for the then-future Waratah trains. These cameras were subsequently incorporated into the final design of the Waratah train.

=== Lines serviced ===
The Millennium trains typically operate on the following lines (normally described as Sector 2):
*T2 Inner West &amp; Leppington Line: Leppington or Parramatta to City Circle via Granville (Weekdays)
*T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West: Liverpool to City Circle via Regents Park and Lidcombe (Weekdays)
*T5 Cumberland Line: Schofields to Leppington or Blacktown to Liverpool
*T6 Lidcombe &amp; Bankstown Line: Bankstown to Lidcombe
*T7 Olympic Park Line: Shuttle from Lidcombe to Olympic Park on weekdays
*T8 Airport &amp; South Line: Macarthur to City Circle via Airport or Sydenham (Weekdays)

=== Maintenance Depots ===
The trains were originally maintained at Eveleigh Maintenance Centre, they are now maintained at Auburn Maintenance Centre.

As with all other trains, these trains are not exclusively kept in Auburn overnight. They only need to return to the depot for maintenance, and at other times, they may be stabled at various yards on the lines that they operate, such as Blacktown, Liverpool and Rossmore yards.

<text>The T sets, also referred to as the Tangara trains, are a class of electric multiple units (EMU) that operate on the Sydney Trains network. Built by A Goninan &amp; Co, the sets entered service between 1988 and 1995, initially under the State Rail Authority and later on CityRail. The T sets were built as &quot;third-generation&quot; trains for Sydney&#x27;s rail fleet, coinciding with the final withdrawals of the &quot;Red Rattler&quot; sets from service in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Tangaras were initially built as two classes; the long-distance intercity G sets and the suburban T sets, before being merged after successive refurbishments.

== Design ==

The Tangara is a double-deck four-car set, with the two outer cars being driving control trailers (carrying a D prefix) that are fitted with one pantograph each and the middle two cars being non-control motor cars (carrying an N prefix). All sets are equipped with Mitsubishi Electric chopper control.

Unlike most other Sydney Trains rolling stock, the seats on the suburban T sets are fixed, meaning that half the seats face backwards. Former G sets, however, do have reversible seats.

== History ==
=== Initial delivery ===
In July 1986, the Government of New South Wales awarded A Goninan &amp; Co a contract for 450 carriages for $530 million. In 1993, it was decided that the last 80 carriages of the order would be built to a modified design to operate peak-hour services to Wyong, Port Kembla and Dapto. In 1996, five spare driving trailers were ordered.

The Tangara name is from an Aboriginal language, meaning &quot;to go&quot;.

Two subclasses of Tangara were built, the suburban sets targeted as T sets, and outer-suburban sets originally targeted as G sets. The T sets replaced the first generation of Sydney&#x27;s electric rolling stock.
The first train (set T20) was unveiled at Sydney Central in December 1987, heavily promoted as the &quot;train of the 21st century&quot;, operating a promotional service on 28 January 1988 targeted as TAN1, and entering regular service on 12 April 1988. The final T set (set T59, formerly T92) was delivered in February 1994 and the final G set (set T100, formerly G32) in October 1995.

The cars built were:
*T set driving trailer cars: D6101-D6284 with additional spare cars D6285-D6289
*T set non-driving motor cars: N5101-N5284 with additional spare car N5285
*G set driving trailer cars: OD6801-OD6840 with additional spare car OD6841
*G set non-driving motor cars: ON5801-ON5820
*G set non-driving motor cars with toilet: ONL5851-ONL5870
Set G7 was fitted with an AC drive system for evaluation purposes with the existing DC stock and compatibility with signalling and communication systems on the network. . G7 was scrapped in 2005 at Maintrain, Auburn after the Waterfall rail accident, as all four cars were beyond repair.

=== High Speed Trials ===
In early 2000, set G7 was also subject to high-speed testing (to the XPT speed limits) up to 150 km/h between Blacktown and St Marys and 140km/h between Hornsby and Newcastle.
=== Upgrades in the 2010s ===

In 2010, a refresh of the Tangaras commenced with the interiors repainted, and new seat moquette and handrails fitted.

In July 2013, Sydney Trains trialled rearranging the seating on the upper and lower decks of two carriages. There were 16 fewer seats per carriage; 3x2 seats were replaced by 2x2 seats in one carriage (N5134 on set T78) while in the other carriage (N5131 on set T77) there are double seats on one side and a bench style seating on the other. Both carriages were later returned to the normal 3x2 arrangement.

In 2014, phase one of a technology upgrade program, aiming to improve reliability and upgrade ageing components, was underway. A contract for phase two of the program, aiming to extend the life of these trains and bring technology into line with newer trains was awarded to UGL Limited in August 2015. This was expected to be completed by July 2018. The expected completion date was revised to 2019, however as of February 2023 only 2 sets have entered service with the second phase upgrades.

The first phase of the program involved upgrading the passenger doors to cut down on vandalism, as the steel panels on the original doors were prone to being kicked out by vandals. The door kicking incidents often led to unnecessary delays as the guard had to lock off the affected carriage. The new lightweight passenger doors have a similar design to the doors on the M sets. This phase of the project was completed at the end of July 2016. The first set to receive the new doors was T96, in October 2014.

The second phase of the program was initially set to include destination indicators and digital voice announcements, which were installed in T72 and T106, were not installed in other sets due to delays and issues with the DVA system. The upgrade still went ahead however, with vestibules given modifications including marked priority seating and Automatic Train Protection (ATP). The first sets with this revised phase 2 upgrade, T52 and T73, re-entered service on 12 November 2021. As of 26 February 2022, sixteen sets have entered service with the upgrade.

The program includes overhauling air conditioning units, Static Inverter upgrades, and modifications to the Driver&#x27;s desk/cab.

Other anti-vandal improvements included the introduction of &#x27;Mousetrap&#x27; sensors. Trialed in 2015, these sensors are able to detect vapors from strong permanent markers and spray paint; triggering an in-built camera feed which is relayed to Sydney Trains staff as well as the Police Transport Command. They were then installed in most converted G sets.

=== Upgrades in the 2020s ===
On 5 June 2024, it was announced the Tangaras would be receiving a life extension to enable operation until at least 2036. The upgrades will see upgrades to the doors, train operating system, and improved disability access and passenger information systems.

== Service ==
=== Lines serviced ===
The Tangaras usually operate on the following lines: 
*T1 North Shore &amp; Western Line: Emu Plains to City via Parramatta, City to Berowra or Hornsby via Gordon
*T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line: Bondi Junction to Waterfall &amp; Cronulla via Hurstville &amp; Sutherland
*T7 Olympic Park Line: Lidcombe to Olympic Park
*T9 Northern Line: Gordon to Hornsby via Strathfield
*South Coast Line: Waterfall &amp; Thirroul to Port Kembla

Since 2013, their operation on Sector 2 has ended timetable services with all of them being displaced to Sector 1 since A sets do not operate on that sector.

== Incidents ==

=== Wentworthville derailment ===
Driving trailer car D6127 and motor car N5127 were both involved in the Wentworthville train derailment on 27 December 1989, the first major accident involving the Tangara fleet. D6127 was written off, having collided with the platform. N5127 was sent to Dunheved on the Ropes Creek line for training fire fighters, along with S Set car C3866.

=== Vineyard collision ===
On 10 February 1994, set T99 travelling from Richmond towards Blacktown collided with a van at the level crossing at . The first 3 cars derailed in a zig-zag format, starting a nearby grassfire.

===Waterfall derailment===

Set G7 derailed on 31 January 2003 near Waterfall, killing seven people aboard including the train driver. The driver suffered a sudden heart attack and lost control of the train while the deadman&#x27;s brake failed to activate as intended. Investigations found the train to be travelling in excess of as it approached the curve where the accident occurred.

=== Unanderra derailment ===
On 24 January 2009 at 2:35 AM, set G4 (now T104) was departing from Unanderra towards Wollongong and derailed due to the train passing a signal at Danger, and the catch-points derailing the train to avoid a collision with a freight train. The first 2 cars and the front bogie of the third car derailed and stopped safely 50 metres from the signal. Subsequently because of this incident, G4 was the first G set to undergo conversion to suburban T set T104.

=== Carriage pierced by guard rail ===
During evening peak on 15 January 2014, motor car N5222 on set T10 was pierced by a guard rail near Edgecliff railway station while on a service to Cronulla. Issues with the train were already developing on the previous run, triggering wheelslip sensors on the train multiple times. As the train entered the Eastern Suburbs Line, a strong burning smell was reported at several stations. It was later revealed that an incorrectly repaired axle on N5222 led to the force of the 440-tonne train picking up the piece of guard rail.

=== Kembla Grange derailment ===
On 20 October 2021 at 4:09 AM, Tangara set T42 derailed near Kembla Grange station on a level crossing. It was caused by a motor vehicle that was stolen and driven up the rail corridor near the railway crossing. Car D6212 fell onto its side and car N5212 also derailed, while cars N5211 and D6211 did not derail and only had minor damage. There were no serious passenger injuries or deaths as a result of this incident, however two passengers, as well as the guard and the driver, were hospitalised to be checked. The Driver was badly injured during the rollover of the Driver trailer carriage. T sets typically did not operate through Kembla Grange, however they were used on the day of the incident instead of the usual H sets due to industrial action.

== 4D ==
A train bearing strong resemblance to a Tangara, known as the 4D, was built by A Goninan &amp; Co in 1991 for the Public Transport Corporation. Although outwardly similar to the Tangaras it was mechanically very different being built to be compatible with the Comeng trains operated in Melbourne. It was included in the sale of Hillside Trains to Connex Melbourne in August 1999. It wasn&#x27;t successful and after spending large periods out of service, being withdrawn in December 2002 and stored at Newport Workshops.
The 4D was bought by CityRail for parts and then scrapped in March 2006 by them at Sims Metal, Brooklyn, Victoria. The G sets&#x27; cab ends have a design similar to the 4D, with the bottom part being bent inwards.

<doc id="275122" wikidata="Q5659405" url="?curid=275122" title="Harmony, Maryland">
<text>Harmony is an unincorporated community in Caroline County, Maryland, United States. It is little more than an intersection of state Routes 16 and 578 on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. Its original name was Fowling Creek, named after a stream nearby that is a tributary of the Choptank River.

Harmony was the scene of a murder in 1895.

There is a small country store with one gas pump, a church, a local produce stand, and farmland. While many of the farmers in the area are of German descent as can be seen in last names such as Mueller, Kraus, Thomas, Steenken, and Worm; they settled after the Civil War, filling the void of the men lost in the war. The older families of Towers, Todd, and Wyddel were the original settlers who came from England in the early eighteenth century, as can be confirmed from the original patents granted to them one of which is Wyddels Venture, the oldest century farm in the county. These names can be seen on the 1875 Map of Caroline County.

The soil is sandy and requires irrigation. There are many cash crops grown such as sweet corn, cantaloupes, tomatoes and squash. Some farms also have chicken houses as a second means of income.

<text>The Ginza Rabba (), Ginza Rba, or Sidra Rabba (), and formerly the Codex Nasaraeus, is the longest and the most important holy scripture of Mandaeism. 

The Ginza Rabba is composed of two parts: the Right Ginza (GR) and the Left Ginza (GL). The Right Ginza is composed of eighteen tractates and covers a variety of themes and topics, whereas the three tractates that make up the Left Ginza are unified in their focus on the fate of the soul after death. The Left Ginza is also occasionally referred to as the Book of Adam.

==Language and authorship==
The language used is Classical Mandaic, a variety of Eastern Aramaic written in the Mandaic script (Parthian chancellory script), similar to the Syriac script. The authorship is unknown, and dating is a matter of debate, with estimates ranging from the first to third centuries. Determining date and authorship is complicated by the late date of the earliest manuscripts, the potentially lengthy oral transmission of Mandaean religious texts prior to their being written, and that conclusions about the dating of some tractates or either GR (Right Ginza) or GL (Left Ginza) may not carry over for material elsewhere in the Ginza.

== Dating ==
The date of Mandaean texts remains heavily contested. Even within the scope of the Ginza Rabba, the GL and GR are separate compositions with separate dates, making the Ginza Rabba a composite text of diverse origins. Furthermore, the individual tractates within these collections appear to have separate origins by virtue of their distinct genre, grammar, and according to their colophon evidence. The GL has its own colophon, as do the first thirteen tractates of the GR. Each from the fourteenth through eighteenth subsequent tractates have their own colophons. The current form and final compilation of the Ginza as a whole must come from Islamic times as it contains numerous references to the Arabs and the Islamic conquest.

=== Left Ginza ===
In 1949, Torgny Säve-Söderbergh argued that the third-century Coptic Manichaean Psalms of Thomas depended on the Left Ginza, A 2017 study by Kevin van Bladel instead suggests that both sources derived their shared material from a common source, perhaps Elcesaite funerary hymns.

In 1965, Rudolf Macúch argued for a third-century date on the basis of a colophon note saying that Zazai of Gawazta copied important Mandaean texts 368 years prior to the Arab conquest of Iraq 640, resulting in the date of 272. However, this note, extant from one manuscript, only refers to an unspecified year of the &quot;hijri&quot; calendar and not the point in time before 640. This means that 272 is the earliest possible date if the very first &quot;hijri&quot; year is being referenced, though later dates are not excluded. The number 368 itself may be invented.

=== Right Ginza ===

==== Book of Kings (GR 18) ====
GR 18, also known as the &quot;Book of Kings&quot;, says that &quot;after the Persian kings there will be Arabian kings. They will reign seventy-one years.&quot; Starting with Theodor Nöldeke, historians have widely interpreted this as a reference to the Islamic-era Arab rulers, and so have dated GR 18 to the Islamic era. Recently, Häberl has argued from the colophons and external references that GR 18s dates to the rule of Lakhmid Arab kings in the pre-Islamic period. The latter is argued to place GR 18, separately from the rest of the Ginza Rabba, in the hands of a copyist at one point named Ennoš b. Danqā, who appears to have worked in the mid-7th century, implying the text is no later than ~650. The Arab kings reigning for 71 years are identified to be the Lakhmid kings starting with Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu&#x27;man, installed into power in 531 by Khosrow I (r. 531–579), to Khosrow II who deposed Al-Nu&#x27;man III ibn al-Mundhir in 602. To supplement this observation, Häberl points to the absence of Arabic language on or explicit references to Islam in GR 18 unlike later Mandaean texts. The final Sassanid ruler mentioned by the text is interpreted to be Kavad II, who ruled until 628, roughly giving the date soon after which the text entered its current form. Häberl offers the following chronology for the events mentioned in GR 18, alongside the earlier chronology implied by Nöldeke&#x27;s work.
==== Other tractates ====
Book 7 of the Right Ginza uses the name Yahyā for John, which is the form of the name John that appears in the Quran. However, Häberl has argued that the use of this name is known in pre-Islamic Arabic text, and so its presence does not conclusively argue for an Islamic-era dating.

The Ginza may have been composed, at least partially, as a response to the Arab conquests, along with other pieces of Mandaean literature such as the Mandaean Book of John, and a study of the colophons of the Ginza date the emergence of the text to the second half of the seventh century.

==Structure==

The &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; is divided into two parts – the Right Ginza, containing 18 books, and the Left Ginza, containing 3 books. In Mandaic studies, the Right Ginza is commonly abbreviated as &quot;GR&quot;, while the Left Ginza is commonly abbreviated as &quot;GL&quot;. Alternatively, sometimes the Right Ginza is abbreviated as &quot;GY&quot; or &quot;Gy&quot; after the Mandaic &quot;Ginza Yamina&quot;, while the Left Ginza is commonly abbreviated as &quot;GS&quot; or &quot;Gs&quot; after the Mandaic &quot;Ginza Smala&quot;.

Ginza Rabba codices traditionally contain the Right Ginza on one side, and, when turned upside-down and back to front, contain the Left Ginza (the Left Ginza is also called &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;). The Right Ginza part of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; contains sections dealing with theology, creation, ethics, historical, and mythical narratives; its six colophons reveal that it was last redacted in the early Islamic Era. The Left Ginza section of &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; deals with man&#x27;s soul in the afterlife; its colophon reveals that it was redacted for the last time hundreds of years before the Islamic Era.

There are various manuscript versions that differ from each other. The versions order chapters differently from each other, and textual content also differs.

==Contents==
The Ginza Rabba is a compilation of various oral teachings and written texts, most predating their editing into the two volumes. It includes literature on a wide variety of topics, including liturgy and hymns, theological texts, didactic texts, as well as both religious and secular poetry.

For a comprehensive listing of summaries of each chapter in the Ginza Rabba, see the articles Right Ginza and Left Ginza.

==Manuscript versions==

Manuscript versions of the Ginza include the following. Two are held in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, three in the British Library in London, four in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, and others are in private ownership. All extant manuscripts of the Ginza appear to derive from a few copies that were produced around 1500.

*Bodleian Library manuscripts
**DC 22 (copied by Ram Zihrun in 1831)
**Huntington Ms. 6 (copied by Adam Paraš in 1615)
*British Library manuscripts catalogued under the same title, &quot;Liber Adami Mendaice&quot;
**Add. 23,599 (copied by female priests during the 1700s)
**Add. 23,600 (copied by Yahya Bihram bar Adam, of the Manduia and ‛Kuma clans, in 1735–36, who also copied Paris Ms. D)
**Add. 23,601 (copied by Adam Yuhana bar Sam in 1824)
*Paris manuscripts, Bibliothèque nationale de France (consulted by Lidzbarski for his 1925 German translation)
**Paris Ms. A (copied by Ram Baktiar in 1560)
**Paris Ms. B (copied by Baktiar Bulbul in 1632; also called the &quot;Norberg version,&quot; since it was used by Norberg during the early 1800s)
**Paris Ms. C (copied by Yahya Adam in 1680)
**Paris Ms. D (copied by Yahya Bihram in the early 1700s)

**RRC 5L (copied at the Margab quarter of Suq eš-Šuyūḵ in AH 1256 (1840–1841 AD))
For his 1925 German translation of the Ginza, Lidzbarski also consulted other Ginza manuscripts that were held at Leiden (complete) and Munich (fragmentary).

Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley has also found Ginza manuscripts that are privately held by Mandaeans in the United States. Two are in San Diego, California, which belong to Lamea Abbas Amara; they were originally copied by Mhatam Zihrun (Sheikh Dakhil Aidan) in 1935, and by a copyist named Adam (Sheikh Aidan, father of Dakhil) in 1886, respectively. One is in Flushing, New York, which belonged to Nasser Sobbi (1924–2018) and was originally copied by Adam Zihrun in 1928. Another one is in Lake Grove, New York, and belongs to Mamoon Aldulaimi, which was originally given to him by Sheikh Abdullah, son of Sheikh Negm and was copied by Yahya Ram Zihrun in 1940. A version of the Ginza by Mhatam Yuhana was also used by Carlos Gelbert in his 2011 English translation of the Ginza. Another manuscript known to Gelbert is a privately owned Ginza manuscript in Ahvaz belonging to Shaikh Abdullah Khaffaji, the grandson of Ram Zihrun.

Printed versions of the Ginza in Mandaic include:
*Norberg version (Mandaic, in Syriac script): A printed Ginza in Mandaic (printed using the Syriac alphabet) was published by Matthias Norberg in 1816. Based on Code Sabéen 2 (Paris Ms. B). It was republished by Gorgias Press in 2007.
*Petermann version (Mandaic): In 1867, Julius Heinrich Petermann published Mandaic and Syriac transcriptions of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;. His work was based on four different Ginza manuscripts held at Paris, and relied most heavily on MS Paris A (also known as ). Only 100 copies were printed, 13 of which Petermann kept himself. A three-volume set of Petermann&#x27;s work was republished by Gorgias Press in 2007.
*Mubaraki version (Mandaic, in both Mandaic and Roman scripts): The full Ginza Rba in printed Mandaic script, compiled primarily from the Mhatam Zihrun br rbai Adam manuscript from Iraq (copied in 1898 and dated 6 July 1899), was first published by Majid Fandi Al-Mubaraki, Haitham Mahdi Saed (also known as Brikha Nasoraia), and Brian Mubaraki in Sydney, Australia in March 1998 during Parwanaya. Two other Ginza versions were also consulted, including one copied by Ram Zihrun in Šuštar in 1843, and another one by Sam bar Zihrun, from the Manduia and ‛Kuma clans. A Roman transliteration of the entire Ginza Rba was also published in 1998 by Majid Fandi Al-Mubaraki and Brian Mubaraki. At present, there are two published Mandaic-language editions of the Ginza published by Mandaeans themselves. The &quot;Concordance of the Mandaean Ginza Rba&quot; was published by Brian Mubaraki and Majid Fandi Al-Mubaraki in 2004.
*Gelbert version (Mandaic, in Arabic script; derived from the Mhatam Yuhana version): The full Mhatam Yuhana Ginza manuscript from Ahvaz, Iran was transcribed in Arabic script by Carlos Gelbert in 2021. As the fourth edition of the Gelbert&#x27;s Arabic Ginza, Gelbert (2021) contains an Arabic translation side by side with the Mandaic transcription.
*Al-Sabti version (Mandaic): In 2022, Rbai Rafid al-Sabti published a printed Mandaic version of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; based on a comparison of 22 manuscripts. The Al-Sabti Ginza contains 157 chapters, 602 pages, 111,684 words, and 560,825 letters.

==Translations==
Notable translations and printed versions of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; include:

*Norberg version (Latin, 1816): From 1815 to 1816, Matthias Norberg published a Latin translation of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, titled &quot;Codex Nasaraeus liber Adami appellatus&quot; (3 volumes). The original Mandaic text, based on MS Paris B, was also printed in Syriac script alongside the Latin translation. There are also additional &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (glossary of names) and &quot;Lexidion&quot; (dictionary) volumes. Norberg&#x27;s &quot;Codex Nasaraeus&quot; is known for influencing Helena Blavatsky, the 19th-century founder of the Theosophy movement, by way of Samuel Fales Dunlap&#x27;s works.
*Lidzbarski version (German, 1925): In 1925, Mark Lidzbarski published the German translation &quot;Ginzā: Der Schatz, oder das grosse Buch der Mandäer&quot;. Lidzbarski translated an edition of the Ginza by Julius Heinrich Petermann from the 1860s, which in turn relied upon four different Ginza manuscripts held at Paris. Lidzbarski was also able to include some material from a fifth Ginza which was held at Leiden. In 2022, an unproofed English translation of Lidzbarski (1925) was published online by Ram Al Sabiry.
*Baghdad version (Arabic, abridged, 2000): An Arabic version of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, similar to that of the Al-Saadi (Drabsha) version, was first published in Baghdad in 2000. A Persian translation based on the 2000 Arabic Ginza was completed by Salem Choheili in 2021.
*Al-Saadi (Drabsha) version (English, abridged, 2012): Under the official auspices of the Mandaean spiritual leadership, Drs. Qais Al-Saadi and Hamed Al-Saadi published an English translation of the &quot;Ginza Rabba: The Great Treasure&quot; in 2012. In 2019, the second edition was published by Drabsha in Germany. The translation, endorsed by the Mandaean rishamas Salah Choheili (Salah Jabbar Tawos) and Sattar Jabbar Hilo, is designed for contemporary use by the Mandaean community and is based on an Arabic translation of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; that was published in Baghdad. However, it has been criticized for being overly abridged and paraphrased.
*Gelbert version (English translation in 2011; Arabic translation in 2000, revised 2021): The first full English translation of the &quot;Ginza Rba&quot; was published by Carlos Gelbert in 2011, with the collaboration of Mark J. Lofts and other editors. The Mandaic transcription is mostly based on the Mhatam Yuhana &quot;Ginza Rba&quot; from Iran (transcribed in the late 1990s and published in 2004 under the supervision of Mhatam Yuhana, the &quot;ganzibra&quot; or head-priest of the Mandaean Council of Ahvaz in Iran). Most of the English translation was based on Mark Lidzbarski&#x27;s 1925 German translation of the Ginza, along with additional English translations of passages from the Mubaraki and Mhatam Yuhana Ginzas that are not found in Lidzbarski (1925). Gelbert&#x27;s 2011 edition is currently the only full-length English translation of the Ginza that contains detailed commentary, with extensive footnotes and many original Mandaic phrases transcribed in the text. An Arabic translation of the Ginza was also published by Gelbert in 2000, with the fourth edition published in 2021. The Arabic edition also contains the original Mandaic text transcribed in Arabic script.

Häberl (2022) is an English translation and analysis of the &quot;Book of Kings&quot;, the final book of the Right Ginza.

<doc id="275125" wikidata="Q17004953" url="?curid=275125" title="Hong Kong tea culture">
<text>The tea-drinking habits of Hong Kong residents derive from Chinese tea culture, primarily the Cantonese traditions such as yum cha. Because of Hong Kong&#x27;s period as a British colony, Hong Kong tea culture is distinct from the tea culture of the mainland. The uniqueness of its tea culture applies both to the tea itself, and also the underlying social and cultural values.

== History of Teahouses in Hong Kong ==
The first teahouse in Hong Kong was established at the end of the 19th century. At that time people bought tea leaves from tea houses so that they could serve tea to visiting guests. Tea would be brewed at the beginning of the day and would be served as guests arrived during the day. At night, the remaining tea would be poured away. They did this whether or not visitors actually arrived. This gave rise to the idiom &quot;Tea is for pouring away.&quot;

In contemporary society, Hong Kong people buy tea at teahouses not only for serving their guests, but also for themselves.

== Tea Packing in Hong Kong ==

Tea-house staff used to store tea leaves in a large, foil container, then weigh them and pack them with papers and a plastic bag. This type of packaging would negatively affect the quality of the tea leaves as they would oxidize quickly, thereby losing their aroma. The packaging of tea leaves has greatly improved since then. Now tea leaves are vacuum-packed in high density plastic packs with fancy packaging. Not only is the quality raised, but the market value of the tea is also increased.

However, this only applies to non-fermented or semi-fermented teas (such as green or oolong teas). For fermented tea, like black tea, it is not recommended that plastic wares be used as the tea should be allowed to continue to oxidize and mature.

== &quot;Tea Pocket&quot; Trend ==
&quot;Tea pockets&quot;, also known as tea bags, have in recent years been used in Chinese tea. Initially they could be found in the supermarket, but were not popular as they were not well-publicized and not very attractively packaged. As earlier with tea leaves, there has been an increase of well-packaged tea bags with any number of varieties of tea leave contained within. Most modern packages can be resealed so as to keep the tea dry. One of the brands has even made an inspiring design of the tea pocket that it gives the tea pocket a tetrahedral (pyramid-like) shape which allows more volume for larger sized tea leaves to expand and impart their flavor.

== Ritual of Tea Drinking in Hong Kong – &quot;Morning Tea and Newspaper&quot; ==

Hong Kong is a place with plenty of night life. In contrast, streets are almost empty from seven to eight in the morning. Most shops open at or after nine o&#x27;clock in the morning, where Cantonese restaurants open at about six or even earlier (restaurants in the Western District open at about 4:00a.m.). The working class of Hong Kong usually have breakfast in these Cantonese restaurants in the early morning. They enjoy 一盅兩件 (Lit. &quot;One bowl with two pieces&quot;, meaning a cup of tea with two Dim sums) and they read newspapers in the morning before they go to work. Many elderly people bring their caged birds to the restaurants and chat with others. They can spend a whole morning doing this.

== Hong Kong style tea – Milk Tea ==
The unique taste of Hong Kong milk tea is a blend of strong Ceylon black tea with other teas mixed with milk. The addition of milk to tea was introduced during the British colonial period

== Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware ==
The Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware is a branch museum of Hong Kong Museum of Art, located centrally in Hong Kong Park. It is a place for collecting, studying and displaying tea ware and holding regular presentation or demonstration lectures to promote Chinese tea drinking culture. Many famous Yixing teapots are exhibited in the museum.

<doc id="275126" wikidata="Q123876" url="?curid=275126" title="Carl Nägeli">
<text>Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli (26 or 27 March 1817 – 10 May 1891) was a Swiss botanist. He studied cell division and pollination but became known as the man who discouraged Gregor Mendel from further work on genetics. He rejected natural selection as a mechanism of evolution, favouring orthogenesis driven by a supposed &quot;inner perfecting principle&quot;.

==Birth and education==
Nägeli was born in Kilchberg near Zürich, where he studied medicine at the University of Zürich. From 1839, he studied botany under A. P. de Candolle at Geneva, and graduated with a botanical thesis at Zürich in 1840. His attention having been directed by Matthias Jakob Schleiden, then professor of botany at Jena, to the microscopical study of plants, he engaged more particularly in that branch of research. He also coined the term &quot;meristematic tissue&quot; in 1858.

==Academic career==
Soon after graduation he became Privatdozent and subsequently professor extraordinary, in the University of Zürich; later he was called to fill the chair of botany at the University of Freiburg; and in 1857 he was promoted to Munich, where he remained as professor until his death.

==Contributions==
It was thought that Nägeli had first observed cell division during the formation of pollen, in 1842. However, this is disputed by Henry Harris, who writes: &quot;What Nägeli saw and did not see in plant material at about the same time [as Robert Remak] is somewhat obscure... I conclude... that, unlike Remak, he did not observe nuclear division... it is clear that Nägeli did not in 1844 have any idea of the importance of the nucleus in the life of the cell.&quot;

In 1857, Nägeli first described microsporidia, the causative agent of pebrine disease in silkworms, which has historically devastated the silk industry in Europe.

Among his other contributions to science were a series of papers in the &quot;Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Botanik&quot; (1844–1846); &quot;Die neueren Algensysteme&quot; (1847); &quot;Gattungen einzelliger Algen&quot; (1849); &quot;Pflanzenphysiologische Untersuchungen&quot; (1855–1858), with Carl Eduard Cramer; &quot;Beiträge zur wissenschaftlichen Botanik&quot; (1858–1868); a number of papers contributed to the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences, forming three volumes of &quot;Botanische Mitteilungen&quot; (1861–1881); and, finally, his volume, &quot;Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre&quot;, published in 1884. However, perhaps Nägeli is best known nowadays for his unproductive correspondence (1866–1873) with Gregor Mendel concerning the latter&#x27;s celebrated work on &quot;Pisum sativum&quot;, the garden pea.

The writer Simon Mawer, in his book &quot;Gregor Mendel: planting the seeds of genetics&quot; (2006), gives an account of Nägeli&#x27;s correspondence with Mendel, underlining that, at the time Nägeli was writing to the friar from Moravia, Nägeli &quot;must have been preparing his great work entitled &quot;A mechanico-physiological theory of organic evolution&quot; (published in 1884, the year of Mendel&#x27;s death) in which he proposes the concept of the &#x27;idioplasm&#x27; as the hypothetical transmitter of inherited characters&quot;. Mawer notes that, in this Nägeli book, there is not a single mention of the work of Gregor Mendel. That prompted him to write: &quot;We can forgive von Nägeli for being obtuse and supercilious. We can forgive him for being ignorant, a scientist of his time who did not really have the equipment to understand the significance of what Mendel had done despite the fact that he (von Nägeli) speculated extensively about inheritance. But omitting an account of Mendel&#x27;s work from his book is, perhaps, unforgivable.&quot;

Nägeli and Hugo von Mohl were the first scientists to distinguish the plant cell wall from the inner contents, which was named the protoplasm in 1846. Nägeli believed that cells receive their hereditary characters from a part of the protoplasm which he called the idioplasma. Nägeli was an advocate of orthogenesis and an opponent of Darwinism. He developed an &quot;inner perfecting principle&quot; which he believed directed evolution. He wrote that many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed.

Nägeli also coined the terms &#x27;Meristem&#x27;, &#x27;Xylem&#x27; and &#x27;Phloem&#x27; (all in 1858) while he and Hofmeister gave the &#x27;Apical Cell Theory&#x27; (1846) which aimed to explain origin and functioning of the shoot apical meristem in plants.

<doc id="275128" wikidata="Q468438" url="?curid=275128" title="Tektite">
<text>Tektites () are gravel-sized bodies composed of black, green, brown or grey natural glass formed from terrestrial debris ejected during meteorite impacts. The term was coined by Austrian geologist Franz Eduard Suess (1867–1941), son of Eduard Suess. They generally range in size from millimetres to centimetres. Millimetre-scale tektites are known as microtektites.

Tektites are characterized by:
# a fairly homogeneous composition
# an extremely low content of water and other volatiles
# an abundance of lechatelierite
# a general lack of microscopic crystals known as microlites
# not having a chemical relationship to the local bedrock or local sediments
# their distribution within geographically extensive strewn fields

== Characteristics ==

Although tektites are superficially similar to some terrestrial volcanic glasses (obsidians), they have unusual distinctive physical characteristics that distinguish them from such glasses. First, they are completely glassy and lack any microlites or phenocrysts, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in silica (&gt;65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of shales and similar sedimentary rocks and quite different from the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (&lt;0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of shocked and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. quartz, apatite, and zircon, as well as coesite.

The difference in water content can be used to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite produces only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.

== Classification ==
On the basis of morphology and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. Those found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on the basis of their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed re-entry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10 cm in size and 24 kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite, and coesite.

Microtektites, the fourth group of tektites, are less than 1 mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. Their colors range from colorless and transparent to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in deep-sea sediments that are of the same ages as those of the four known strewn fields. Microtektites of the Australasian strewn field have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits, and in sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.

== Occurrence ==

Most tektites have been found within four geographically extensive strewn fields: the Australasian, Central European, Ivory Coast, and North American. As summarized by Koeberl, the tektites within each strewn field are related to each other with respect to the criteria of petrological, physical, and chemical properties, as well as their age. In addition, three of the four strewn fields have been clearly linked with impact craters using those same criteria. Recognized types of tektites, grouped according to their known strewn fields, their associated craters, and ages are:
* Australasian strewnfield Approximate age: 0.77–0.78 million years), no confirmed crater:
** Australites (Australia, dark, mostly black);
** Indochinites (South East Asia, dark, mostly black);
** Philippinites (Philippines, black).
* Central European strewnfield (Nördlinger Ries impact crater (24 km), Germany, age: 15 million years):
** Moldavites (Czech Republic, green).
* Ivory Coast strewnfield (Lake Bosumtwi impact crater (10 km), Ghana, age: 1 million years):
** Ivorites (Ivory Coast, black).
* North American tektite strewn field (Chesapeake Bay impact crater (40 km), United States – age: 34 million years):
** Bediasites (Texas – black to dark brown, some with metallic finish);
** Georgiaites (Georgia – green).

Comparing the number of known impact craters versus the number of known strewn fields, Natalia Artemieva considered essential factors such as the crater must exceed a certain diameter to produce distal ejecta, and that the event must be relatively recent. Limiting to diameters 10 km or more and younger than 50 Ma, the study yielded a list of 13 candidate craters, of which the youngest eight are given below. 
Preliminary papers in the late 1970s suggested either Zhamanshin or Elgygytgyn as the source of the Australasian strewnfield.

Povenmire and others have proposed the existence of an additional tektite strewn field, the Central American strewn field. Evidence for this reported tektite strewn field consists of tektites recovered from western Belize in the area of the villages of Bullet Tree Falls, Santa Familia, and Billy White. This area lies about 55 km east-southeast of Tikal, where 13 tektites, two of which were dated as being 820,000 years old, of unknown origin were found. A limited amount of evidence is interpreted as indicating that the proposed Central American strewn field likely covers Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and possibly parts of southern Mexico. The hypothesized Pantasma Impact Crater in northern Nicaragua might be the source of these tektites.

== Age ==

The ages of tektites from the four strewnfields have been determined using radiometric dating methods. The age of moldavites, a type of tektite found in the Czech Republic, was determined to be 14 million years, which agrees well with the age determined for the Nördlinger Ries crater (a few hundred kilometers away in Germany) by radiometric dating of Suevite (an impact breccia found at the crater). Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the Lake Bosumtwi Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques. Tektites in geological and archaeological deposits have been used as age markers of stratified deposits, but this practice is controversial.

== Origins ==
=== Terrestrial source theory ===
The overwhelming consensus of Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during the formation of an impact crater. During the extreme conditions created by a hypervelocity meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these, and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.

The terrestrial source for tektites is supported by well-documented evidence. The chemical and isotopic composition of tektites indicates that they are derived from the melting of silica-rich crustal and sedimentary rocks, which are not found on the Moon. In addition, some tektites contain relict mineral inclusions (quartz, zircon, rutile, chromite, and monazite) that are characteristic of terrestrial sediments and crustal and sedimentary source rocks. Also, three of the four tektite strewnfields have been linked by their age and chemical and isotopic composition to known impact craters. A number of different geochemical studies of tektites from the Australasian strewnfield concluded that these tektites consist of melted Jurassic sediments, or sedimentary rocks that were weathered and deposited about 167 Mya. Their geochemistry suggests that the source of Australasian tektites is a single sedimentary formation with a narrow range of stratigraphic ages close to 170 Mya, more or less. This effectively refutes multiple impact hypotheses.

Although the formation and widespread distribution of tektites is widely accepted to require the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism for the formation of tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.

=== Nonterrestrial source theories ===

Though the meteorite impact theory of tektite formation is widely accepted, there has been considerable controversy about their origin in the past. As early as 1897, the Dutch geologist Rogier Diederik Marius Verbeek (1845–1926) suggested an extraterrestrial origin for tektites: he proposed that they fell to Earth from the Moon. Verbeek&#x27;s proposal of an extraterrestrial origin for tektites was soon seconded by the Austrian geologist Franz E. Suess. Subsequently, it was argued that tektites consist of material that was ejected from the Moon by major hydrogen-driven lunar volcanic eruptions and then drifted through space to later fall to Earth as tektites. The major proponents of the lunar origin of tektites include NASA scientist John A. O&#x27;Keefe, NASA aerodynamicist Dean R. Chapman, meteorite and tektite collector Darryl Futrell, and long-time tektite researcher Hal Povenmire. From the 1950s to the 1990s, O&#x27;Keefe argued for the lunar origin of tektites based upon their chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk, composition and physical properties. Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests to argue that the so-called Australasian tektites originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of the large crater Tycho on the Moon&#x27;s near side. O&#x27;Keefe, Povenmire, and Futrell claimed on the basis of behavior of glass melts that the homogenization, which is called &quot;fining&quot;, of silica melts that characterize tektites could not be explained by the terrestrial-impact theory. They also argued that the terrestrial-impact theory could not explain the vesicles and extremely low water and other volatile content of tektites. Futrell also reported the presence of microscopic internal features within tektites, which argued for a volcanic origin.

At one time, theories advocating the lunar origin of tektites enjoyed considerable support as part of a spirited controversy about the origin of tektites that occurred during the 1960s. Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and planetary scientists shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that are vastly uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of hypervelocity impacts. In addition, various studies have shown that hypervelocity impacts are likely quite capable of producing low-volatile melts with extremely low water content. The consensus of Earth and planetary scientists regards the chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk composition evidence as decisively demonstrating that tektites are derived from terrestrial crustal rock, i.e. sedimentary rocks, that are unlike any known lunar crust.

<doc id="275131" wikidata="Q174855" url="?curid=275131" title="Whitechapel Bell Foundry">
<text>The Whitechapel Bell Foundry was a business in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. At the time of the closure of its Whitechapel premises, it was the oldest manufacturing company in Great Britain. 

The bell foundry primarily made church bells and their fittings and accessories, although it also provided single tolling bells, carillon bells and handbells. The foundry was notable for being the original manufacturer of the Liberty Bell, a famous symbol of American independence, and for re-casting Big Ben, which rings from the north clock tower (the Elizabeth Tower) at the Houses of Parliament in London.

The Whitechapel premises are a Grade II* listed building. The foundry closed on 12 June 2017, after nearly 450 years of bell-making and 250 years at its Whitechapel site, with the final bell cast given to the Museum of London along with other artefacts used in the manufacturing process, and the building has been sold.

Following the sale of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, the bell patents were sold to the bell-hanging company Whites of Appleton in Oxfordshire, with which the foundry had a business relationship for 197 years. The rights to tower bell production are now under the ownership of Westley Group Ltd. Production of presentation and hand bells continues under the name Bells of Whitechapel Ltd.

==History==
The bell founding industry around Aldgate and Whitechapel can be traced back to at least 1360, and a few years later, Geoffrey Chaucer, living in a room in the Aldgate itself, described the presence of a bell founding industry in the area. The Master Founders (bell makers) of Aldgate and Whitechapel, can be traced back to 1420. 

The Whitechapel Bell Foundry company began in 1570. The last premises at 32–34 Whitechapel Road, backing on to Plumbers Row, dates from 1670 and was formerly a coaching inn called &quot;The Artichoke&quot; which had been damaged in the Great Fire of London. The Artichoke ceased trading in 1738 and the following year the Whitechapel Bell Foundry moved into the premises. The foundry remained at the site until May 2017. It was one of only two bell foundries left in the UK and had been in continuous production for almost 450 years.

The three bells manufacturer&#x27;s mark can be seen on the bells and the three bells sign hung over the door of the Whitechapel site. According to previous owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes, the foundry had been a family-owned company throughout its history continuing when Alan Hughes&#x27;s grandfather bought the company in 1904, until its sale to Westley group in 2017.

The business had to adapt throughout the centuries and in modern times, with new churches being built less frequently, produced handbells and doorbells. It responded to a surge in orders for table bells, following the popularity of the ITV period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, with a third of its sales going overseas. In 2013 the foundry launched an online shop selling house bells, musical instruments and personalised merchandise. The large bell business has been largely unaffected by periods of financial depression, partly because from enquiry to completion an order takes on average 11 years. During World War II the foundry was used as a munitions production line, making casings for the War Office. The foundry was particularly busy after the war, replacing bells lost or damaged by fire in bombing raids across London. Hughes said &quot;Our business runs counter to the national economy. If the economy goes down and unemployment rises, we start to get busy. Last year was our busiest in thirty years, an increase of 27% on the previous year. Similarly, the nineteen twenties were very busy.&quot; Hughes also tells a story of an order requested of his grandfather in the 1890s which his father quoted again for in the 1950s and he himself gave a quote for in the 1970s. The order was finally completed in 1998.

In March 2017 a consortium of heritage groups, including Save Britain&#x27;s Heritage, the East End Preservation Society, the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the Ancient Monuments Society and the Royal Academy of Arts attempted to have the foundry&#x27;s Grade II* premises re-listed as a Grade I listed building as an asset of community value to preserve the historical importance of the building within the wider east end community.

The foundry was sold to US investor Raycliff who proposed their intention to convert the site into a 100 to 108 room hotel at the rear of the building with a bell themed cafe while maintaining space for the production of smaller bells including hand bells. Raycliff hired local architectural practice 31/44 for the design.
The plan has the support of Historic England, described by one journalist as “a public body which gives paid advice to property developers to encourage them to get through the existing planning systems.” The application has been controversial. The application was called in by the government on 22 January 2020, preventing the London Borough of Tower Hamlets from proceeding with the planning application pending the outcome of further public inquiry. The London Bell Foundry, a not for profit company dedicated to saving the historic foundry as a working enterprise, made an offer to purchase the site in November 2022.

==Notable bells==
Many churches across the world have bells cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, but arguably its two best-known examples are not in places of worship. In 1752 the foundry (known at the time as Lester and Pack) cast the Liberty Bell, which was commissioned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of William Penn&#x27;s 1701 Charter of Privileges, Pennsylvania&#x27;s original constitution. 

As a result of damage sustained during its stormy passage across the Atlantic, the bell cracked when it was first rung, and after repeated repairs cracked again in 1846 when rung to mark the birthday of George Washington. Since 2003, the bell has been housed at the Liberty Bell Center near Independence Hall.

Big Ben, which tolls the hour at the Palace of Westminster, was cast in 1858 and rung for the first time on 31 May 1859. &quot;Big Ben&quot; weighs 13½ tons and is the largest bell ever cast at the foundry. This bell also cracked because a too heavy hammer was initially used. The crack and the subsequent retuning gives Big Ben its present distinctive tone. A profile template of Big Ben surrounds the entrance door of the Whitechapel Foundry, while the original moulding gauge is retained near the furnaces. The final bill for Big Ben came to £572.

Whitechapel has supplied bells to several cathedrals. Guildford Cathedral in Surrey had a peal of 10 bells (later augmented to 12), Canterbury Cathedral augmented its bells to a peal of 14 in 1981, and the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. in 1962. The foundry produced &quot;Great Tom&quot; at Lincoln Cathedral, the &quot;Clock Bells&quot; at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the bells of Westminster Abbey Upon the construction of its tower between 1924 and 1942, the foundry cast 14 bells for the Liverpool Cathedral which all include psalm texts engravings. The bells are notable for being the heaviest change ringing peal of bells in the world. The foundry&#x27;s bellfounder at that time, Albert Hughes, is commemorated in a stained glass window in the nave.

Churches with bells from Whitechapel include ones as near as St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside and as far as the Armenian Church, Chennai, India. English examples include St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney and St Dunstan&#x27;s, Mayfield; St Michael&#x27;s, Beckwithshaw; St Mary-le-More, Wallingford Church of St Thomas the Apostle, Killinghall; and St Michael and All Angels, Leaden Roding. American churches in the Anglican Communion, for example St. Michael&#x27;s Church, in Charleston, South Carolina. Australian churches include St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Burnley, St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church, Newtown; St Philip&#x27;s Church and St James&#x27; Church, Sydney. In Canada, the towers of Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal house one of the world&#x27;s largest bells and a ten-bell carillon.

Bells not in churches include civic focal points such as a clock tower; Thomas Mears II cast the bell for Herne Bay Clock Tower in 1837. The Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., USA, has a ring of 10 bells in the key of D (tenor 26 cwt) that were cast by the Whitechapel Foundry in 1976, installed in 1982, and dedicated in 1983. The bells range in weight from 581 to 2953 pounds. These bells, referred to as The Congress Bells, were a gift to the US Congress from Britain&#x27;s Ditchley Foundation to celebrate the bicentennial of American independence.

The sterling silver bell silver ships bell on post WW II HMS Ark Royals (4 - 1955) and (5 - 1985) is said (by Taylor&#x27;s of Loughborough to have been cast by Whitechapel Foundry) 

Following the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the company made a tribute bell, the Bell of Hope, as a gift from the people of London to the city of New York. It is rung at 08:46 each year on the anniversary of the tragedy, the time the first plane hit the first tower. It was designed by architect Paul Byard and was rung for the first time on American soil by the Bishop of New York, the Rt. Rev. Mark S. Sisk. The bell resided at Trinity Church (Manhattan), before being moved to St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel. In 2005 it was rung again four times for the people killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

The Whitechapel Bell Foundry designed the Olympic Bell seen at the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic Games, although it was not cast on the premises. The furnaces at Whitechapel could not provide the 23 tons of molten metal required to make the bell, so it was manufactured at a factory in the Netherlands which normally produces ship&#x27;s propellers. 

The Olympic Bell is the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world and the widest bell in Britain. It now hangs in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but is not rung because it is deemed too loud to be rung without disturbing local residents.

The Foundry cast the Royal Jubilee Bells used on the lead barge for the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant the same summer, which now hang in the church of St James Garlickhythe.

Damon Albarn had three bells cast from the foundry for &quot;On Melancholy Hill&quot; for the Gorillaz album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, although they were not used on the final song. These were cast in the notes D, A and C-sharp. However one of the bells is often used on live versions of &quot;We Got the Power&quot;.

The last bell to be cast at the foundry was on 22 March 2017, and was given to the Museum of London along with historical artefacts from the premises. The manufacturing patents for the Whitechapel bells have been sold to the bell-hanging company, Whites of Appleton in Oxfordshire, with whom the foundry has had a business relationship for 197 years.

==Master founders==

The names on this list are those that are cast into the surface of Whitechapel bells of different dates. Prior to Robert Mot, in 1574, the &quot;sign of three bells&quot; was often cast to indicate that it was a Whitechapel (or Aldgate) bell.

<doc id="275132" wikidata="Q6889129" url="?curid=275132" title="Modernist poetry in English">
<text>Modernist poetry in English started in the early years of the 20th century with the appearance of the Imagists. Like other modernists, Imagist poets wrote in reaction to the perceived excesses of Victorian poetry, and its emphasis on traditional formalism and ornate diction. 

In &quot;Preface to the Lyrical Ballads&quot;, published in 1800, William Wordsworth criticized what he perceived to be the gauche and pompous nature of British poetry over a century earlier, and instead sought to bring poetry to the layman. Modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient Greek literature, Chinese and Japanese poetry, the troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian philosophical poets, such as Guido Cavalcanti, and the English Metaphysical poets.

Much of early modernist poetry took the form of short, compact lyrics. Ultimately, however, longer poems gained in favor, representing the modernist movement of the 20th-century.

==English-language modernism==
The roots of English-language poetic modernism can be traced back to the works of a number of earlier writers, including Walt Whitman, whose long lines approached a type of free verse, the prose poetry of Oscar Wilde, Robert Browning&#x27;s subversion of the poetic self, Emily Dickinson&#x27;s compression and the writings of the early English Symbolists, such as Arthur Symons. These poets largely remained true to the basic tenets of the Romantic movement and the appearance of the Imagists marked the first emergence of a distinctly modernist poetic in the language. Gerard Manley Hopkins, for instance, wrote in a radically experimental prosody about radically conservative ideals, much like Ezra Pound later did, and he believed that sound could drive poetry. Poetic sonic effects selected for verbal and aural felicity, not just images selected for their visual evocativeness also became an influential poetic device of modernism.

===Imagism===


The origins of Imagism and cubist poetry are found in two poems by T. E. Hulme, published in 1909 by the Poets&#x27; Club in London. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy who had established the Poets&#x27; Club to discuss his theories of poetry. The poet and critic F. S. Flint, who was a champion of free verse and modern French poetry, was highly critical of the club and its publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. They started meeting with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Soho to discuss reform of contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems.

The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to this group and they found that their ideas resembled his. 

In 1911, Pound introduced two other poets, H.D. and Richard Aldington, to the Eiffel Tower group. Both of these poets were students of the early Greek lyric poetry, especially the works of Sappho. 

In October 1912, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the rubric &quot;Imagiste&quot; to &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. That month Pound&#x27;s book &quot;Ripostes&quot; was published with an appendix called &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme&quot;, which carried a note that saw the first appearance of the word &quot;Imagiste&quot; in print. Aldington&#x27;s poems were in the November issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; and H.D.&#x27;s in January 1913 and Imagism as a movement was launched. The March issue contained Pound&#x27;s &quot;A Few Don&#x27;ts by an Imagiste&quot; and Flint&#x27;s &quot;Imagisme&quot;. The latter contained this succinct statement of the group&#x27;s position:

# Direct treatment of the &quot;thing&quot;, whether subjective or objective.
# To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.
# As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of the metronome.
# Complete freedom of subject matter.
# Free verse was encouraged along with other new rhythms.
# Common speech language was used, and the exact word was always to be used, as opposed to the almost exact word.

In setting these criteria for poetry, the Imagists saw themselves as looking backward to the best practices of pre-Romantic writing. Imagistic poets used sharp language and embraced imagery. Their work, however, was to have a revolutionary impact on English-language writing for the rest of the 20th century.

In 1913, Pound was contacted by the widow of the recently deceased Orientalist Ernest Fenollosa, who while in Japan had collected word-by-word translations and notes for 150 classical Chinese poems that fit in closely with this program. Chinese grammar offers different expressive possibilities from English grammar, a point that Pound later made. In Chinese, the first line of Li Po&#x27;s, called &quot;Rihaku&quot; by Fenollosa&#x27;s Japanese informants, poem &quot;The River Merchant&#x27;s Wife: A Letter,&quot; is a spare, direct juxtaposition of five characters that appear in Fenollosa&#x27;s notes as mistress       hair       first       cover       browIn his resulting 1915 &quot;Cathay&quot;, Pound rendered this in simple English as While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead

Between 1914 and 1917, four anthologies of Imagist poetry were published. In addition to Pound, Flint, H.D. and Aldington, these included work by Skipwith Cannell, Amy Lowell, William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, Allen Upward, John Cournos, D. H. Lawrence and Marianne Moore. With a few exceptions, this represents a roll-call of English-language modernist poets of the time. After the 1914 volume, Pound distanced himself from the group and the remaining anthologies appeared under the editorial control of Amy Lowell.

Lowell expressed her extreme debt to the French, to what she preferred to call &quot;unrhymed cadence&quot; instead of the more common &quot;verse libre.&quot;

Henry Gore (1902–1956), whose work is undergoing something of a revival was also heavily influenced by the Imagist movement, although from a different generation from H.D., Flint, and others.

===World War I and after===
The outbreak of World War I represented a setback for the budding modernist movement for several reasons. First, writers like Aldington found themselves in active service; second, paper shortages and related factors meant that publication of new work became increasingly difficult; and, third, public sentiment in time of war meant that war poets such as Wilfred Owen, who wrote more conventional verse, became increasingly popular. One poet who served in the war, the visual artist David Jones, later resisted this trend in his long experimental war poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, which was written directly out of his trench experiences but was not published until 1937.

The war also tended to undermine the optimism of the Imagists. This was reflected in a number of major poems written in its aftermath. Pound&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot; (1919) uses the loose translations and transformations of the Latin poet Propertius to ridicule war propaganda and the idea of empire. His &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot;, published in (1921, represents his farewell to Imagism and lyric poetry in general. The writing of these poems coincided with Pound&#x27;s decision to abandon London permanently.

Sound poetry emerged in this period as a response to the war. For many Dadaists, including German writer Hugo Ball and New York poet and performer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, sound poems were protestations against the sounds of war. As Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo write, “Born as the trench warfare intensified, phonetic poetry was the language of trauma, a new language to counter the noise of the cannons”. The Baroness’s poem “Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)”, written in response to her husband’s suicide after the war’s end, was “a mourning song in nonsense sounds that transcended national boundaries”. Working from a confrontational feminist and artistic agenda, the Baroness asserted a distinctly female subjectivity in the post-World War I era.

The most famous English-language modernist work arising out of this post-war disillusionment is T. S. Eliot&#x27;s epic &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922). Eliot was an American poet who had been living in London for some time. Although he was never formally associated with the Imagist group, his work was admired by Pound, who, in 1915, helped him publish &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, which brought him to prominence. When Eliot had completed his original draft of a long poem based on both the disintegration of his personal life and mental stability, and the culture around him, he gave the manuscript, provisionally titled &quot;He Do the Police in Different Voices&quot;, to Pound for comment. After some heavy editing, &quot;The Waste Land&quot; in the form in which we now know it was published, and Eliot came to be seen as the voice of a generation. The addition of notes to the published poem served to highlight the use of collage as a literary technique, paralleling similar practice by the cubists and other visual artists. From this point on, modernism in English tended towards a poetry of the fragment that rejected the idea that the poet could present a comfortingly coherent view of life.

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; is a foundational text of modernism, representing the moment at which Imagism moves into modernism proper. Broken, fragmented and seemingly unrelated slices of imagery come together to form a disjunctive anti-narrative. The motif of sight and vision is as central to the poem as it is to modernism; the omni-present character Tiresias acting as a unifying theme. The reader is thrown into confusion, unable to see anything but a heap of broken images. The narrator, however (in &quot;The Waste Land&quot; as in other texts), promises to show the reader a different meaning; that is, how to &quot;make&quot; meaning from dislocation and fragmentation. This construction of an exclusive meaning is essential to modernism.

===&quot;Others&quot; and others and brother and mothers===

Although London and Paris were key centres of activity for English-language modernists, much important activity took place elsewhere, including early publication in &quot;Poetry magazine&quot; in the United States. When Mina Loy moved to New York in 1916, she became part of a circle of writers involved with &quot;&quot; which included William Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore, among others. This magazine, which ran from 1915 to 1919, was edited by Alfred Kreymborg. Contributors also included Pound, Eliot, H.D., Djuna Barnes, Amy Lowell, Conrad Aiken, Carl Sandburg, and Wallace Stevens. 

The U.S. modernist poets were concerned to create work in a distinctively American idiom. Williams, a doctor who worked in general practice in a working-class area of Rutherford, New Jersey, explained this approach by saying that he made his poems from &#x27;the speech of Polish mothers&#x27;. In this, they were placing themselves in a tradition stretching back to Whitman.

After her initial association with the Imagists, Marianne Moore carved out a niche for herself among 20th-century poets. Much of her poetry is written in syllabic verse, repeating the number of syllables rather than stresses or beats, per line. She also experimented with stanza forms borrowed from troubadour poetry.

Wallace Stevens&#x27; work falls somewhat outside this mainstream of modernism. Indeed, he deprecated the work of both Eliot and Pound as &quot;mannered.&quot; His poetry is a complex exploration of the relationship between imagination and reality. Unlike many other modernists, but like the English Romantics, by whom he was influenced, Stevens thought that poetry was what all humans did; the poet was merely self-conscious about the activity.

In Scotland, the poet Hugh MacDiarmid formed something of a one-man modernist movement. An admirer of Joyce and Pound, MacDiarmid wrote much of his early poetry in anglicised Lowland Scots, a literary dialect which had also been used by Robert Burns. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I and was invalided out in 1918. After the war, he set up a literary magazine, &quot;Scottish Chapbook&quot;, with &#x27;Not traditions - Precedents!&#x27; as its motto. His later work reflected an increasing interest in found poetry and other formal innovations.

In Canada, the Montreal Group of modernist poets, including A.M. Klein, A.J.M. Smith, and F.R. Scott, formed at that city&#x27;s McGill University in the mid-1920s. Though the poets of the group made little headway for the next twenty years, they were ultimately successful in establishing a modernist hegemony and in that country that would endure until at least the end of the 20th century.

===Wallace Stevens&#x27; &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot;===

Wallace Stevens&#x27; essential modernist poem, &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot;(1942) sounds as if the verbs are left out. The verb &#x27;to be&#x27; is omitted from the first and final lines. The poem itself opens and closes with the act of finding. The poem and the mind become synonymous: a collapse between the poem, the act, and the mind. In the poem, the dyad becomes further collapsed into one: a spatial and a temporal collapse between the subject and the object; form and content equal each other; form becomes not simply expressive of, but constitutive of. The poem goes from being a static object to being an action. The poem of the mind has to be alternative and listening; it is experimental. The poem resists and refuses transcendentalism, but remains within the conceptual limits of the mind and the poem.

==Maturity==
With the publication of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, modernist poetry appeared to have made a breakthrough into wider critical discourse and a broader readership. However, the economic collapse of the late 1920s and early 1930s had a serious negative impact on the new writing. For American writers, living in Europe became more difficult as their incomes lost a great deal of their relative value. Gertrude Stein, Barney, and Joyce remained Paris, where much of the scene they had presided over began to scatter. Pound left for Italy. Eliot left for London. H.D. moved between London and Switzerland, and many of the other writers associated with the movement were then living in the United States.

The economic depression, combined with the impact of the Spanish Civil War, also saw the emergence, in the Britain of the 1930s, of a more overtly political poetry, as represented by such writers as W. H. Auden and Stephen Spender. Although nominally admirers of Eliot, these poets tended towards a poetry of radical content but formal conservativeness. For example, they rarely wrote free verse, preferring rhyme and regular stanza patterns in much of their work.

===1930s modernism===
Modernism in English remained in the role of an &quot;avant garde&quot; movement, depending on little presses and magazines and a small but dedicated readership. The key group to emerge during this time were the Objectivist poets, consisting of Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, Basil Bunting and Lorine Niedecker. The Objectivists were admirers of Stein, Pound and Williams and Pound actively promoted their work. Thanks to his influence, Zukofsky was asked to edit a special Objectivist issue of the Chicago-based journal &quot;Poetry&quot; in 1931 to launch the group. The basic tenets of Objectivist poetics were to treat the poem as an object and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence, and the poet&#x27;s ability to look clearly at the world, and in this they can be viewed as direct descendants of the Imagists. Continuing a tradition established in Paris, Zukofsky, Reznikoff, and Oppen went on to form the Objectivist Press to publish books by themselves and by Williams. In his later work, Zukofsky developed his view of the poem as object to include experimenting with mathematical models for creating poems, producing effects similar to the creation of a Bach fugue or a piece of serial music.

A number of Irish poets and writers moved to Paris in the early 1930s to join the circle around James Joyce. These included Samuel Beckett, Thomas MacGreevy, Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin. These writers were aware of Pound and Eliot, but they were also Francophone and took an interest in contemporary French poetry, especially the surrealists. Indeed, Coffey and Devlin were amongst the first to translate the works of Paul Éluard into English. Around the same time, a number of British surrealist poets were beginning to emerge, among them David Gascoyne, George Barker and Hugh Sykes Davies. Like the Objectivists, these poets were relatively neglected by their native literary cultures and had to wait for a revival of interest in British and Irish modernism in the 1960s before their contributions to the development of this alternative tradition were properly assessed.

===Long poems===
Pound&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Sextus Propertius&quot; and &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot; and Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; marked a transition from the short imagistic poems that were typical of earlier modernist writing towards the writing of longer poems or poem-sequences. A number of long poems were also written during the 1920s, including Mina Loy&#x27;s &#x27;auto-mythology&#x27;, &quot;Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose&quot; and Hugh MacDiarmid&#x27;s satire on Scottish society, &quot;A Drunk Man Looks At The Thistle&quot;. MacDiarmid wrote a number of long poems, including &quot;On a Raised Beach&quot;, &quot;Three Hymns to Lenin&quot; and &quot;In Memoriam James Joyce&quot;, in which he incorporated materials from science, linguistics, history and even found poems based on texts from the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;. David Jones&#x27; war poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; was a book-length work that drew on the matter of Britain to illuminate his experiences in the trenches, and his later epic &quot;The Anathemata&quot;, itself hewn from a much longer manuscript, is a meditation on empire and resistance, the local and the global, which uses materials from Christian, Roman and Celtic history and mythology.

One of the most influential of all the modernist long poems was Pound&#x27;s &quot;The Cantos&quot;, a &#x27;poem containing history&#x27; that he started in 1915 and continued to work on for the rest of his writing life. From a starting point that combines Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; to create a personal epic of 20th-century life, the poem uses materials from history, politics, literature, art, music, economics, philosophy, mythology, ecology and the poet&#x27;s personal experiences and ranges across European, American, African and Asian cultures. Pound coined the term &#x27;ideogrammatic method&#x27; to describe his technique of placing these materials in relation to each other so as to open up new and unexpected relationships. This can be seen as paralleling techniques used by modernist artists and composers to similar ends.

Other Imagist-associated poets also went on to write long poems. William Carlos Williams&#x27; &quot;Paterson&quot; applied the techniques developed by Pound to a specific location and in a specific, American, dialect. H.D. wrote &quot;Trilogy&quot; out of her experiences in London during World War II and &quot;Helen in Egypt&quot;, a reworking of the Helen of Troy story from the perspective of the female protagonist, as a kind of feminist response to the masculine mind-set behind Pound&#x27;s epic. Eliot&#x27;s experiences of war-torn London also underpinned his &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. A number of Objectivists also wrote long poems, including Zukofsky&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;, Charles Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot;, and Basil Bunting&#x27;s &quot;Briggflatts&quot;. Brian Coffey&#x27;s &quot;Advent&quot; is the key long poem by an Irish modernist. All these poems, to one extent or another, use a range of techniques to blend personal experience with materials from a wide range of cultural and intellectual activities to create collage-like texts on an epic scale.

A long poem that is often overlooked, because it first appeared in the commercially unsuccessful 1936 anthology &quot;New Provinces&quot;, is Canadian poet A. M. Klein&#x27;s meditation on Spinoza, &quot;Out of the Pulver and the Polished Lens.&quot;

==Politics==
Poetic modernism was an overtly revolutionary literary movement, a revolution of the word, and, for a number of its practitioners, this interest in radical change spilled over into politics. A number of the leading early modernists became known for their right-wing views; these included Eliot, who once described himself as a Royalist, Stein, who supported the Vichy government for a time at least, and, most notoriously, Pound, who, after moving to Italy in the early 1930s, openly admired Benito Mussolini and began to include anti-Semitic sentiments in his writings. He was arrested towards the end of World War II on charges of treason arising out of broadcasts he made on Italian radio during the war but never faced trial because of his mental health.

A number of leading modernists took a more left-wing political view. Hugh MacDiarmid helped found the National Party of Scotland and was also a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the 1930s, he was expelled from National Party of Scotland for being a communist and from the Communist Party for being a nationalist, although he later rejoined the Communist Party in 1956. The Objectivists Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi were all, at one time or another, committed Marxists and Oppen spent a number of years in Mexico to escape the attention of Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s United States Senate committee. A number of the British surrealists, especially David Gascoyne, also supported communism.

Other modernists took up political positions that did not fit neatly into the traditional left vs. right model. H.D., Mina Loy, and Nathalie Barney, for instance, are now seen as proto-feminists and their openness about their various sexualities can be read as foreshadowing the 1970s view that the personal is political. H.D., especially after World War I, came to view the goal of modernism as being the bringing about of world peace. However, she also displayed anti-Semitic views in the notebooks for her book &quot;Tribute to Freud&quot;. Basil Bunting, who came from a Quaker background, was a conscientious objector during World War I, but because of his opposition to Fascism, served in British Military Intelligence in Persia (Iran) during World War II. William Carlos Williams&#x27; political views arose from his daily contact with the poor who attended his surgery. He was another for whom the personal and political blended, an approach best summed up in his statement that &#x27;A new world is only a new mind&#x27;.

Although many modernist poets were politically engaged, there is no single political position that can be said to be closely allied to the modernist movement in English-language poetry. These poets came from a wide range of backgrounds and had a wide range of personal experiences and their political stances reflect these facts.

==Legacy==
The modernist revolution of the word was not universally welcomed by readers or writers. By the 1930s, a new generation of poets had emerged who looked to more formally conservative poets like Thomas Hardy and W. B. Yeats as models, and these writers struck a chord with a readership who were uncomfortable with the experimentation and uncertainty preferred by the modernists. Notwithstanding, modernist poetry cannot be positively characterised, there being no mainstream or dominant mode.

However, the 1950s saw the emergence, particularly in the United States, of a new generation of poets who looked to the modernists for inspiration. The influence of modernism can be seen in these poetic groups and movements, especially those associated with the San Francisco Renaissance, the Beat generation, the Black Mountain poets, and the deep image group. Charles Olson, the theorist of the Black Mountain group, wrote in his 1950 essay, &quot;Projectivist Verse&quot; &#x27;ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION&#x27;, a statement that links back directly to the Imagists. Robert Duncan, another Black Mountain poet admired H.D. while a third member of the group, Robert Creeley did much to help revive interest in Zukofsky and other Objectivists.

Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg studied Pound closely and were heavily influenced by his interest in Chinese and Japanese poetry and the ecological concerns evident in the later &quot;Cantos&quot;. William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong impact on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg&#x27;s seminal poem, &quot;Howl&quot;. Many of these writers found a major platform for their work in Cid Corman&#x27;s &quot;Origin&quot; magazine and press. &quot;Origin&quot; also published work by Louis Zukofsky, Lorine Niedecker and Wallace Stevens, helping to revive interest in these early modernist writers. The Objectivists, especially the strict formal experimentation of Zukofsky&#x27;s later works, were also formative for the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets.

As the Beats and other American poets began to find readers in the UK and Ireland, a new generation of British poets with an interest in modernist experimentation began to appear. These poets, who included Tom Raworth, Bob Cobbing, Gael Turnbull, Tom Pickard and others formed the nucleus of the British Poetry Revival. This new generation helped bring about a renewed interest in the writings of Bunting, MacDiarmid, David Jones and David Gascoyne. Current practice includes the enormously influential canon of Roy Fisher (also a major player in the Revival).

Contemporary poets associated with Irish modernism include those associated with New Writers Press and &quot;The Beau&quot; magazine; these include Trevor Joyce, Michael Smith, Geoffrey Squires, Randolph Healy, Billy Mills, Catherine Walsh, and Maurice Scully. New Writers Press also published work by Thomas MacGreevy, Brian Coffey and Denis Devlin, introducing them to a new audience, and, in Coffey&#x27;s case, facilitating a late flowering of new work.

<text>The Aquifoliales are an order of flowering plants, including the Aquifoliaceae (holly) family, and also the Helwingiaceae (2-5 species of temperate Asian shrubs) and the Phyllonomaceae (4 species of Central American trees and shrubs). In 2001, the families Stemonuraceae and Cardiopteridaceae were added to this order. This circumscription of Aquifoliales was recognized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group when they published the APG II system in 2003. In the Cronquist system, there is no Aquifoliales order: the Aquifoliaceae are placed within the order Celastrales and the others are in other families.

<text>Middletown is a city in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. Located along the Connecticut River, in the central part of the state, 16 miles (25.749504 km) south of Hartford. Middletown is the largest city in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Planning Region. In 1650, it was incorporated by English settlers as a town under its original Native American name, Mattabeseck, after the local Wangunk village of the same name. They were among many tribes along the Atlantic coast who spoke Algonquian languages. The colonists renamed the settlement in 1653. 

When Hartford County was organized on May 10, 1666, Middletown was included within its boundaries. In 1784, the central settlement was incorporated as a city distinct from the town. Both were included within newly formed Middlesex County in May 1785. In 1923, the City of Middletown was consolidated with the Town, making the city limits extensive.

Originally developed as a sailing port and then an industrial center on the Connecticut River, it is now largely residential. Its downtown, based on Main Street, serves as a popular retail, dining, and bar district near Wesleyan University. Middletown was the county seat of Middlesex County from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 47,717. Middletown, Connecticut is considered the southernmost city in the Hartford-Springfield &quot;Knowledge Corridor&quot; Metropolitan Region, which features a combined metro population of 1.9 million. Middletown is largely a politically progressive city, and is home to one of the largest pride events in all of Connecticut.

==History==

The land on the western bank of the Connecticut River where Middletown now lies was home to a village of the Wangunk, a tribe of Algongquian-speaking Native Americans. The village was named Mattabesset (also spelled &quot;Mattabesett, Mattabesec,&quot; &quot;Mattabeseck,&quot; and &quot;Mattabesek&quot;); the area they inhabited—now Middletown and the surrounding area—was named after it. When the primarily-English European settlers arrived in the region the Mattabesset were a part of the Wangunk, a large tribe in the Connecticut Valley, at the time under a sachem named Sowheag.

Plans for the colonial settlement were drawn up by the General Court in 1646; the first migrants came from nearby Connecticut colonies in 1650. On September 11, 1651, the General Court of Connecticut established the town of &quot;Mattabesett&quot;. A couple of years later in November 1653, the settlement was renamed as Middletown. This name was chosen because the site was approximately halfway between Windsor and Saybrook on the Great River. Life was not easy for these early colonial Puritans; clearing the land and building houses, and tending farms in the rocky soil of New England was a labor-intensive ordeal. They had a strict society; offenses legally punishable by death in the Connecticut colonies included &quot;witchcraft, blasphemy, cursing or smiting of parents, and incorrigible stubbornness of children.&quot;

The Pequot Mohegan, at that time traditional allies of the English colonists and enemies of the Wangunk, arrived in the Middletown area in the latter half of the 17th century; conflict between them and local Native American tribes ensued. The inhabitants of Mattabesett and others referred to the Mohegan as &quot;destroyers of men.&quot; Sowheag hoped that the colonists would intervene. They did not. Smallpox epidemics caused high mortality, reducing their ability to resist and disrupting their cohesion as a tribe. Records show that, over time, Sowheag was forced to sell off most of Mattabesett to the local colonists; by 1676 the Puritans owned all but of the former territory. Native Americans suffered similar fates of illness and dispossession at other colonial sites in 17th-century New England.

During the 18th century, Middletown became the largest and most prosperous settlement in Connecticut. By the time of the American Revolution, Middletown was a thriving port, where one-third of its residents were involved in merchant and maritime activities. Some settlers held enslaved Africans as workers in the early economy of Middletown; they worked as domestic servants, laborers, and in shipping. African slaves were imported by the English in 1661 from Barbados in the Caribbean. By 1756 Middletown had the third-largest African slave population in the state of Connecticut—218 slaves to 5,446 whites. 

Middletown merchant traders pushed for the clearance of the Saybrook Bar at the mouth of the Connecticut River, and later sought the creation of Middlesex County in 1785. The name &#x27;Middlesex&#x27; was chosen because the intention was to make Middletown the head of a long river port, much as London was at the head of its long river port on the Thames in Middlesex County, England. The same persons also established the Middlesex Turnpike (now Route 154) to link all the settlements on the western side of the Connecticut, again with the intent of creating one long port.

After the American Revolution, Connecticut and most northern states abolished slavery. The port&#x27;s decline began in the early 19th century during the period of strained American-British relations and resulting trade restrictions, which led to the War of 1812. The port never recovered from the restrictions of the war. The city&#x27;s men distinguished themselves in the war effort, as Middletown&#x27;s Commodore Thomas Macdonough led American forces to the victory on Lake Champlain in 1814 which ended British hopes for an invasion of New York. After the war, migration of New England families continued west to New York and, later, to the Midwest around the Great Lakes, where more land was available.

In the 19th century, Middletown became a major center for firearms manufacturing. Numerous gun manufacturers in the area supplied the majority of pistols to the United States government during the War of 1812. After that war, however, the center of this business shifted to Springfield, Massachusetts; and Hartford, and New Haven, Connecticut. (See also History of Connecticut industry.)

In 1831 Wesleyan College was established. It became one of the United States&#x27; leading liberal arts universities. The college replaced an earlier educational institution on the same site, Partridge&#x27;s American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. It had moved to Norwich, Vermont and later developed as Norwich University. 

The two main buildings of the original campus were built by the people of Middletown in order to attract an academic institution to the city. In 1841, Middletown established the state&#x27;s first public high school, which at first enrolled all students from age nine through age sixteen who had previously attended district schools.
During the mid-19th century, manufacturing replaced trade as Middletown&#x27;s economic mainstay. But industrial growth was limited after railroad operators bypassed Middletown in their construction of a railway between Hartford and New Haven. There had been an ambitious plan to build a railroad suspension bridge in the White Rock, Middletown to Bodkin Rock, Portland vicinity, which was seen as an unpractical solution.

Middletonians played an active role in the American Civil War. General Joseph K. Mansfield was a Union general at the Battle of Antietam, where he died in action in 1862. Another casualty at Antietam was Brigadier General George Taylor, who had been educated at a private military academy in Middletown. The popular Civil War marching song &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; was written by Henry Clay Work, a Middletown resident. Some residents were active in the abolitionism movement, and the city was a hub along the underground railway.
In the latter half of the 19th century, manufacturing was the mainstay of the city&#x27;s economy, especially finely made metal parts, such as marine hardware (Wilcox, Crittendon &amp; Co.) and typewriters (Royal Typewriters). There were also several machine tool &amp; die manufacturers in the city. Middletown was the site of a major unit of Goodyear. In addition, there was the pioneer automobile manufacturer Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company. Other manufacturers included in national expositions and now museum collections include the Middletown Plate Company (silver), Middletown Silver Co. and I. E. Palmer (hammocks).
Middletown also briefly was the home of a major-league baseball team, the Middletown Mansfields of the National Association.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the city underwent a demographic transformation, after having been settled primarily by Protestant people from the British Isles. First the Irish, in response to the Great Famine, and then large numbers of Italian immigrants arrived to work in Middletown&#x27;s factories and farms. Many of the Italians were immigrants from Melilli, Sicily. Both groups were primarily Roman Catholic. 

Polish and German arrivals followed, and many of these immigrants were also Catholic. By 1910 the population had swelled to nearly 21,000. Meanwhile, the number of African Americans dwindled to 53 persons. Employers chose to hire white immigrants. Later in the century, more African Americans from the South migrated to the area for its industrial jobs and better social conditions. They were part of the Great Migration during the 20th century, up to 1970. 

In the early 1980s, two Wesleyan professors arranged to bring a small group of Cambodian refugees to Middletown, who were exiled following the US involvement in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam War. They developed a thriving Cambodian community, as have later migrants from Tibet. Middletown also attracted Hindu immigrants from India and other parts of Southeast Asia, who established the first Hindu temple in Connecticut in Middletown. 

Over the decades the new immigrants stimulated the rise of a range of cuisines offered by restaurants. This has become one of the most well-known aspects of the city.
Middletown was hit by floods in 1927 and 1936, and by The Great New England Hurricane in 1938. The Arrigoni Bridge was completed over the Connecticut River in 1938. It replaced an earlier bridge to connect Middletown to Portland and points east.

During the 1950s, as the prevalence of the automobile increased, government officials approved the construction of a highway that effectively separated Middletown from the Connecticut River, which had long supported its development. Highway construction demolished historic neighborhoods, including many buildings from the 18th century. New suburban developments were built outside older neighborhoods, attracting the people with money to buy new. In the mid-20th century, Middletown and similar towns lost heavy industry and manufacturing jobs that moved offshore, resulting in a general decline in population. An alternate economy began to develop by the 1990s.

During this period, the city tore down many older buildings in the name of &#x27;urban renewal&#x27;, but sometimes new development was delayed for years. Downtown area had large flat parking lots, or buildings were abandoned and left empty. With high unemployment and limited opportunities, and increasing problems with drugs, crime increased. During the 1960s, Pratt &amp; Whitney opened a large aircraft engine plant in the Maromas section of Middletown. Concurrently, developers bought much of the city&#x27;s remaining farms, including most of Oak Grove Dairy, to redevelop as residential suburbs for local workers and commuters to surrounding cities.

During the 1970s, Oddfellows Playhouse was established. The theater attracts hundreds of young people every year from around the state to perform in plays and other performances. The playhouse is one of the few youth theaters in the state of Connecticut. It is located on 128 Washington Street, around the corner from Middletown&#x27;s Main Street.

During the 1990s, a partnership between the city, the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, and Wesleyan University invested substantially in Middletown&#x27;s Main Street, improving urban design and supporting new businesses. Their actions helped the revival of downtown Middletown. Crime decreased, and new restaurants and shops opened.

=== 21st century ===
In recent decades, Middletown has focused on balancing the needs and comforts of its residents with the commercial development required to help fund services. These efforts date at least from 1931, when the city was one of the first in America to establish a planning board. Progress continued under the leadership of Democratic mayor, Domenique S. Thornton, who served a record eight years (four terms) as mayor. The city attracted a 12-screen movie theater and numerous restaurants and other businesses to the downtown area, the city provided free Wi-Fi service along Main Street and the historic Inn at Middletown a luxury four and half star boutique hotel transformed the former vacant National Guard Armory. On November 8, 2005, Republican Sebastian Giuliano won the mayor&#x27;s office, replacing Thornton, whom he criticized for raising taxes and for the awarding of a contract for the construction of a new high school to Tomasso Brothers, Inc., a firm that had been the target of a federal corruption probe. During Giuliano&#x27;s three terms in office, Middletown&#x27;s Main Street became a hub for small businesses, and the city began investing heavily in the arts. Democrat Daniel T. Drew defeated Giuliano in 2011. Drew has pushed for increased development in the city&#x27;s North End, an area that has been plagued by poverty and crime in recent decades. In November 2012, voters approved a $37 (~$ in ) Million initiative to move Middletown&#x27;s wastewater to the Mattabassett Sewer District treatment plant in nearby Cromwell. Previously, the city had operated its own sewage treatment plant on the banks of the Connecticut River. The city has made plans to tear down this older plant and develop the riverfront property on which it sits. Middletown continues to support manufacturing and small business.

Middletown has remained an important government administrative center. From the creation of Middlesex County in 1798 until the elimination of county government in 1965 Middletown was the county seat. Middletown today retains Middlesex Superior Court, and the Judicial District remains that of the former county court. Other county functions were either centralized to the state or transferred to the towns. The former county building has been removed, but there are other state agency buildings elsewhere in the city, such as the Dept. of Social Services on Main Street Ext. Middletown&#x27;s Probate Court district includes the towns of Cromwell, Portland, Middlefield and Haddam. The city is also the site of the controversial State Juvenile Training Center.
Culturally and politically, Middletown is in the midst of an effort to revitalize its historically disadvantaged North End. Economic development projects recently completed in the North End include Wharfside Commons, a 96-unit mixed income apartment block, and the new Community Health Center (completed in 2012 at the corner of Main and Grand Streets). The Green Street Arts Center, founded by Wesleyan and a coalition of community groups in 2000, is a pioneering attempt to attract residents and businesses to the neighborhood by promoting arts education and outreach. For decades, the famous O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Diner has done much to bring some stability to the North End. A fire on August 31, 2006, gutted much of the historic structure. The Middletown community held many fundraising events to raise money for the diner&#x27;s rebuilding. Reconstruction began in September 2007, and O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Diner re-opened in February 2008. Mayor Daniel Drew (2011–2019) supported citizen-oriented efforts to revitalize the North End, such as the local nonprofit NEAT (North End Action Team). In 2012, the City of Middletown and NEAT partnered to form the &quot;I Heart the North End&quot; initiative, which plans to raise public awareness of the economic and cultural opportunities available in the area.
Middletown is the only location of a well-known youth theater group, Oddfellows Playhouse, which is located on Washington Street and pulls in children of all ages from all over the state to learn theater skills. Oddfellows also runs the Children&#x27;s Circus of Middletown where children learn circus skills and put on a free show for close to a thousand people.

Middletown is also host to the Kidcity Children&#x27;s Museum located in a renovated and recently expanded former home of Judge Elmer, which was moved down Washington Street to its current location.
Kidcity is a hands-on playspace where children ages 1 through 8 come with parents and other significant adults to learn through play.

The Downtown Business District continues to revitalize the downtown area. Pratt and Whitney, Aetna, Middlesex Hospital, Connecticut Valley Hospital, Liberty Bank, and Wesleyan University are major employers. Located on the western border of the city, in an area known as Westlake, is an 84 house community known as The Farms. This architectural award-winning community was developed in 1969 by George Achenbach, and was one of the first communities in Connecticut designed for &quot;cluster living&quot;, with open areas designated as &quot;common land&quot;.

There are also many parks and nature trails including the Middletown Nature Gardens, Wadsworth Falls State Park and Smith Park, and of open property at the Guida Farm Conservation Area for families to enjoy. Harbor Park is a recreation area on the Connecticut River, featuring a boardwalk, restaurant/nightclub, fishing, seasonal boat excursions, and the Middletown High School and Wesleyan University crew boathouses. July 4 festivities, as well as the head of the Connecticut Regatta event in October are conducted from Harbor Park.

Middlesex Hospital a major employer in Middletown and throughout Middlesex County, is spending $31 million to build a new emergency department. The new emergency department opened on March 24, 2008. Along with the new department, a helipad will be added along with 70 new parking spaces for patients.

At 11:17 a.m. on February 7, 2010, a large explosion occurred at a power plant under construction in Middletown.There are numerous houses, buildings and historic districts in Middletown listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and two are further designated as National Historic Landmarks. The Samuel Wadsworth Russell House on High Street, built in 1827, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001. The Alsop House, also located on High Street, and built in 1840, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2009. Both buildings are part of the Wesleyan campus.

The saltbox Samuel Harris House, built in 1686 and not listed on the National Register, may be the oldest surviving house in Middletown.

==Geography==
 Middletown sits on the west bank of the Connecticut River, in the south-central portion of the state. Running alongside the river, Route 9 bisects the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 42.3 square miles (109.6 km), of which 40.9 square miles (105.9 km) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.7 km) is water. The total area is 3.36% water. Middletown shares borders with the neighboring towns of Cromwell, Portland, East Hampton, Haddam, Durham, Middlefield, Berlin, and Meriden. Of all the neighboring towns, Portland and East Hampton are the only ones that do not have any land boundaries, as they are located on the eastern side of the Connecticut River.

The west side of Middletown is flanked by the Metacomet Ridge—a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet Ridge in Middletown include Higby Mountain and the north side of Lamentation Mountain. The Mattabesett Trail traverses the ridge. The Nature Conservancy manages the summit and ledges of Higby Mountain. Major bodies of water include the Connecticut River along the towns eastern boundary, the Mattabesset River along its northern boundary, Crystal Lake in the southern end of town, and Pameacha Pond along South Main Street. The Mount Higby and Adder reservoirs also fall along its western boundary with Middlefield.

<text>The Garryales are a small order of dicotyledons, including only two families and three genera.

==Description==
Garryales are woody plants that are either hairless or have very fine hairs. Members of the family Garryaceae are evergreen, whereas those of the Eucommiaceae are deciduous and produce latex. All members are dioecious.

==Taxonomy==
These belong among the asterids. Under the Cronquist system, the Garryaceae were placed among the Cornales. The Eucommiaceae were given their own order and placed among the Hamamelidae. The Oncothecaceae family has been associated with Garryales, though the link is not strong enough to prove they are related.

===Subdivisions===
The order is made up of two families which, between them, contain three genera. These are:
* Family Garryaceae
**&quot;Garrya&quot;
**&quot;Aucuba&quot;
* Family Eucommiaceae
**&quot;Eucommia&quot;

==Distribution==
Species in the order are spread between North America and Asia. The various &quot;Garrya&quot; species are found in North America, in southern and western coastal regions of the United States. &quot;Aucuba&quot; species are found across eastern parts of Asia, while &quot;Eucommia&quot; species are within China.

==Uses==
Plants within the Garryales may be cultivated for ornamental purposes; &quot;Aucuba japonica&quot; is grown as a decorative hedge.

<text>The Celastrales are an order of flowering plants found throughout the tropics and subtropics, with only a few species extending far into the temperate regions. The 1200 to 1350 species are in about 100 genera. All but seven of these genera are in the large family Celastraceae. Until recently, the composition of the order and its division into families varied greatly from one author to another.

== Description ==
The Celastrales are a diverse order that has no conspicuous distinguishing characteristic, so is consequently hard to recognize. The flowers are usually small with a conspicuous nectary disk. The stipules are small or rarely absent. The micropyle has two openings and is therefore called a bistomal micropyle. Flowers with well-developed male and female parts are often functionally unisexual. The seed often has an aril. In bud, the sepals have a quincuncial arrangement. This means that two sepals are inside, two are outside, and the remaining sepal is half inside and half outside.

== Relationships ==
Perhaps the most conspicuous and unusual trait of the Celastrales is the nectary disk, a feature that it shares with another rosid order, Sapindales. Since the orders are not closely related, the disk must have been an independent development in each of these lines.

The Celastrales are a member of the Celastrales, Oxalidales (including Huaceae), and Malpighiales (COM) clade of Fabidae, with Fabidae being one of the two groups of Eurosids.

== Circumscription ==
The name Celastrales was first used by Thomas Baskerville in 1839. In the time since Baskerville first defined the order, until the 21st century, great differences of opinion occurred about what should be included in the order and in its largest family, the Celastraceae. The family Celastraceae was the only group consistently placed in the order by all authors who accepted it. Because of the ambiguity and complexity of its definition, the Celastraceae became a dumping ground for genera of dubious affinity. Several genera were assigned to this family with considerable doubt about whether they really belonged there. Also, some genera that properly belong in the Celastraceae were placed elsewhere.

By the end of the 20th century, &quot;Goupia&quot; and &quot;Forsellesia&quot; had been excluded from the Celastraceae and also from the Celastrales. &quot;Goupia&quot; is now in the Malpighiales. &quot;Forsellesia&quot; is now in the Crossosomatales. It continues to be the subject of a dispute about whether its proper name is &quot;Forsellesia&quot; or &quot;Glossopetalon&quot;.

After being placed elsewhere, &quot;Canotia, Brexia&quot;, and &quot;Plagiopteron&quot; were found to belong in the Celastraceae. The family Hippocrateaceae was found to be deeply nested within the Celastraceae and is no longer recognized as a separate family.

In 2000, Vincent Savolainen et alii found that three families - Lepidobotryaceae, Parnassiaceae, and Celastraceae - were closely related. They stated that these three families should constitute the order Celastrales, and this idea was accepted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, which later subsumed the Parnassiaceae into the Celastraceae. Savolainen and co-authors also excluded &quot;Lophopyxis&quot; from the Celastrales. &quot;Lophopyxis&quot; now constitutes a monogeneric family in the Malpighiales.

In 2001, in a molecular phylogenetic study of DNA sequences, Mark Simmons and others confirmed all of these results except for the placement of &quot;Lophopyxis&quot; and the Lepidobotryaceae, which they did not sample.

In 2006, Li-Bing Zhang and Mark Simmons produced a phylogeny of the Celastrales based on nuclear ribosomal, and chloroplast DNA. Their results showed that &quot;Bhesa&quot; and &quot;Perrottetia&quot; were misplaced in the Celastraceae. &quot;Bhesa&quot; is now in the Centroplacaceae, a family in the Malpighiales. and &quot;Perrottetia&quot; is in the Huerteales. Zhang and Simmons found &quot;Pottingeria&quot; and &quot;Mortonia&quot; to be closely related to the families Parnassiaceae and Celastraceae, as they were then defined, but not in either of them. These two genera are therefore in the Celastrales. They found that &quot;Siphonodon&quot; and &quot;Empleuridium&quot; are proper members of the Celastraceae, removing considerable doubt about their placement there. They also showed that the small family Stackhousiaceae, consisting of three genera, is embedded in the Celastraceae. Except for taxa that were not sampled, these results were confirmed by the second phylogeny of the Celastrales, which was produced by Mark Simmons and several co-authors in 2008.

&quot;Nicobariodendron sleumeri&quot;, the only member of its genus, continues to be an enigma. It is a small tree from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. Little is known of it and it has never been sampled for DNA. It is generally thought to belong in the Celastrales, but this is not a certainty. It is one of the five taxa placed &quot;incertae sedis&quot; in the angiosperms in the APG III system of classification.

== Families ==

The Celastrales have been divided into families in various ways. In their APG II classification in 2003, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group recognized three families in the Celastrales – Lepidobotryaceae, Parnassiaceae, and Celastraceae. When they revised their classification in 2009, they recognized only two families because &quot;Pottingeria&quot; and the two genera of Parnassiaceae were transferred to the Celastraceae. &quot;Nicobariodendron&quot; became one of the five taxa placed &quot;incertae sedis&quot; in the angiosperms.

In the 2006 phylogeny, &quot;Nicobariodendron&quot; was not sampled, but those species that were sampled fell into two strongly supported clades. One was a small clade consisting only of the family Lepidobotryaceae. Its sister was a very large clade containing the rest of the order. The large clade consisted of five strongly supported groups. These are the family Parnassiaceae, the genus &quot;Pottingeria&quot;, the genus &quot;Mortonia&quot; (in the Celastraceae), and a pair of genera from the Celastraceae (&quot;Quetzalia&quot; and &quot;Zinowiewia&quot;), and the rest of the Celastraceae. No relationships were resolved among these groups.

In 2008, Simmons and others produced a phylogeny of the Celastrales that achieved better resolution than the 2006 study by sampling more species and more DNA. They found the same pentatomy of five strongly supported groups that the previous study had found, but only weak to moderate support for any relationships between the five groups. In the APG III system, the family Celastraceae was expanded to consist of these five groups. No one has yet published an intrafamilial classification for the expanded Celastraceae.

== Phylogeny ==

The following phylogenetic tree was made by combining parts of three different trees. Bootstrap support is 100% except where shown. Branches with less than 50% bootstrap support are collapsed. The clade numbers are from Simmons &quot;et al.&quot; (2008).

<doc id="275148" wikidata="Q5262522" url="?curid=275148" title="Dereliction of duty in American law">
<text>Dereliction of duty is a specific offense under United States Code Title 10, Section 892, Article 92 and applies to all branches of the US military. A service member who is derelict has willfully refused to perform his duties (or follow a given order) or has incapacitated himself in such a way that he &quot;cannot&quot; perform his duties. Such incapacitation includes the person falling asleep while on duty requiring wakefulness, his getting drunk or otherwise intoxicated and consequently being unable to perform his duties, shooting himself and thus being unable to perform any duty, or his vacating his post contrary to regulations.

== Details ==
In the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), dereliction of duty is addressed within the regulations governing the failure to obey an order or regulation.

Punishment can include sanctions up to and including the death penalty (in times of war). Outside of wartime, the maximum punishment allowed is a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year (10 years for service members receiving special pay under 37 USC 310).

== Proving dereliction ==
In order to prosecute a service member under Article 92, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the service member knew (or should have reasonably known) his duties and that he was either, through neglect or culpable inefficiency (i.e., being inefficient without just cause), derelict in the performance of those duties.

A duty is imposed in any one of the following ways:

* via a treaty,
* statute,
* regulation,
* lawful order,
* standard operating procedure, or
* custom of the service

That the service member possessed actual knowledge of his duties may be proved via:
* regulations,
* training / operating manuals,
* academic literature,
* testimony of service members who held similar positions,
* customs of the service

== Sentinel / lookout ==
UCMJ Article 113 (&quot;Misbehavior of sentinel&quot;) includes components of behavior that are, in themselves, examples of dereliction of duty:

# Drunk while on post
# Sleeping while on post
# Leaving one&#x27;s post without being properly relieved

== Examples: non-judicial punishment ==

=== Failure to follow instructions and directives ===
Both a Staff Sergeant and an Airman First Class stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base had their pay reduced by $300 and $200 pay per month, respectively, for two months, when their actions resulted in a delayed launch and subsequent aircraft shutdown. They were found guilty of failing to follow Air Force Instruction 21-101, Air Force Policy Directive 31-3, and Technical Order 00-20-1. They were also given 14 days extra duty and had a reprimand inserted into their files.

=== Misuse of government property ===
An Airman First Class stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base was reduced to Airman when she received non-judicial punishment for dereliction of duty. She was found to have charged over $700 on her Travel Card for personal uses.

== Example: court-martial ==

=== &quot;United States v. Allen Lawson&quot; 33 M.J. 946 ===
In August 1988, Marine Lance Corporal Jason Rother died on a desert exercise at Twentynine Palms, California. First Lieutenant Allen Lawson was charged and convicted of dereliction of duty for disobeying orders (to submit a roster of posted Marines and locations to his superior officer, Captain Edwards) and for failing to post two subordinates as a pair (as ordered by the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Robeson).

<text>Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska. Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel. The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a major street which cuts through midtown Omaha and also the beginnings of a scene whose members included Justin&#x27;s brother Conor Oberst (at the time a solo artist and now from Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos, and Monsters of Folk), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia, currently of Cursive and The Good Life), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the &quot;Creekers&quot;. Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to &quot;Spend an evening with Saddle Creek&quot; (later to be the title of the label&#x27;s DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by Redeye Distribution.

SCR continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called &quot;The Omaha Sound&quot;, characterized by a slight country twang. It is increasingly inaccurate, though to reference it as such with the rise of more electronic sounds like those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles. The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek&#x27;s disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together. A &quot;sister label&quot; of sorts, to Saddle Creek is Team Love which was begun by Conor Oberst in 2004.

==History==
The label opened its arms to the first bands on its roster not based in Omaha in 2001 with releases by Now It&#x27;s Overhead and Sorry About Dresden. Other artists not from Nebraska followed including Los Angeles&#x27; Rilo Kiley, Eric Bachmann (formerly the leader of Archers of Loaf from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Crooked Fingers from North Carolina), Georgie James (Washington D.C.), Two Gallants (San Francisco), and most recently Tokyo Police Club (Toronto).

In 2005, &quot;Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek&quot;, a documentary detailing the first ten years of the record label&#x27;s history, was released. The DVD features extensive interviews with the Saddle Creek bands, archival footage, and rare live performances. On June 8, 2007, the label opened their own music venue named Slowdown (after the group Slowdown Virginia) which is located in downtown Omaha.

The label&#x27;s name was inspired partially by the A-side single of Polecat&#x27;s 1994 -ismist Recordings release &quot;2500 Ft of Our Love&quot;, &quot;Saddle Creek.&quot;
