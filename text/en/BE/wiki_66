<text>In mathematical physics, a closed timelike curve (CTC) is a world line in a Lorentzian manifold, of a material particle in spacetime, that is &quot;closed&quot;, returning to its starting point. This possibility was first discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1937 and later confirmed by Kurt Gödel in 1949, who discovered a solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) allowing CTCs known as the Gödel metric; and since then other GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes. If CTCs exist, their existence would seem to imply at least the theoretical possibility of time travel backwards in time, raising the spectre of the grandfather paradox, although the Novikov self-consistency principle seems to show that such paradoxes could be avoided. Some physicists speculate that the CTCs which appear in certain GR solutions might be ruled out by a future theory of quantum gravity which would replace GR, an idea which Stephen Hawking labeled the chronology protection conjecture. Others note that if every closed timelike curve in a given spacetime passes through an event horizon, a property which can be called chronological censorship, then that spacetime with event horizons excised would still be causally well behaved and an observer might not be able to detect the causal violation.

== Light cones ==
When discussing the evolution of a system in general relativity, or more specifically Minkowski space, physicists often refer to a &quot;light cone&quot;. A light cone represents any possible future evolution of an object given its current state, or every possible location given its current location. An object&#x27;s possible future locations are limited by the speed that the object can move, which is at best the speed of light. For instance, an object located at position &quot;p&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;0 can only move to locations within &quot;p&quot; + &quot;c&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1 − &quot;t&quot;0) by time &quot;t&quot;1.

This is commonly represented on a graph with physical locations along the horizontal axis and time running vertically, with units of formula_1 for time and &quot;ct&quot; for space. Light cones in this representation appear as lines at 45 degrees centered on the object, as light travels at formula_2 per formula_1. On such a diagram, every possible future location of the object lies within the cone. Additionally, every space location has a future time, implying that an object may stay at any location in space indefinitely.

Any single point on such a diagram is known as an &quot;event&quot;. Separate events are considered to be &quot;timewise separated&quot; if they differ along the time axis, or &quot;spacewise separated&quot; if they differ along the space axis. If the object were in free fall, it would travel up the &quot;t&quot;-axis; if it accelerates, it moves across the x axis as well. The actual path an object takes through spacetime, as opposed to the ones it &quot;could&quot; take, is known as the &quot;worldline&quot;. Another definition is that the light cone represents all possible worldlines.

In &quot;simple&quot; examples of spacetime metrics the light cone is directed forward in time. This corresponds to the common case that an object cannot be in two places at once, or alternately that it cannot move instantly to another location. In these spacetimes, the worldlines of physical objects are, by definition, timewise. However this orientation is only true of &quot;locally flat&quot; spacetimes. In curved spacetimes the light cone will be &quot;tilted&quot; along the spacetime&#x27;s geodesic. For instance, while moving in the vicinity of a star, the star&#x27;s gravity will &quot;pull&quot; on the object, affecting its worldline, so its possible future positions lie closer to the star. This appears as a slightly tilted lightcone on the corresponding spacetime diagram. An object in free fall in this circumstance continues to move along its local formula_1 axis, but to an external observer it appears it is accelerating in space as well—a common situation if the object is in orbit, for instance.

In extreme examples, in spacetimes with suitably high-curvature metrics, the light cone can be tilted beyond 45 degrees. That means there are potential &quot;future&quot; positions, from the object&#x27;s frame of reference, that are spacelike separated to observers in an external rest frame. From this outside viewpoint, the object can move instantaneously through space. In these situations the object would have to move, since its present spatial location would not be in its own future light cone. Additionally, with enough of a tilt, there are event locations that lie in the &quot;past&quot; as seen from the outside. With a suitable movement of what appears to it its own space axis, the object appears to travel through time as seen externally.

A closed timelike curve can be created if a series of such light cones are set up so as to loop back on themselves, so it would be possible for an object to move around this loop and return to the same place and time that it started. An object in such an orbit would repeatedly return to the same point in spacetime if it stays in free fall. Returning to the original spacetime location would be only one possibility; the object&#x27;s future light cone would include spacetime points both forwards and backwards in time, and so it should be possible for the object to engage in time travel under these conditions.

== General relativity ==
CTCs appear in &quot;locally&quot; unobjectionable exact solutions to the Einstein field equation of general relativity, including some of the most important solutions. These include:
*the Misner space (which is Minkowski space orbifolded by a discrete boost)
*the Kerr vacuum (which models a rotating uncharged black hole)
*the interior of a rotating BTZ black hole
*the van Stockum dust (which models a cylindrically symmetric configuration of dust)
*the Gödel lambda dust (which models a dust with a carefully chosen cosmological constant term)
*the Tipler cylinder (a cylindrically symmetric metric with CTCs)
*Bonnor-Steadman solutions describing laboratory situations such as two spinning balls
*J. Richard Gott has proposed a mechanism for creating CTCs using cosmic strings.

Some of these examples are, like the Tipler cylinder, rather artificial, but the &quot;exterior&quot; part of the Kerr solution is thought to be in some sense generic, so it is rather unnerving to learn that its &quot;interior&quot; contains CTCs. Most physicists feel that CTCs in such solutions are artifacts.

== Consequences ==
One feature of a CTC is that it opens the possibility of a worldline which is not connected to earlier times, and so the existence of events that cannot be traced to an earlier cause. Ordinarily, causality demands that each event in spacetime is preceded by its cause in every rest frame. This principle is critical in determinism, which in the language of general relativity states complete knowledge of the universe on a spacelike Cauchy surface can be used to calculate the complete state of the rest of spacetime. However, in a CTC, causality breaks down, because an event can be &quot;simultaneous&quot; with its cause—in some sense an event may be able to cause itself. It is impossible to determine based only on knowledge of the past whether or not something exists in the CTC that can interfere with other objects in spacetime. A CTC therefore results in a Cauchy horizon, and a region of spacetime that cannot be predicted from perfect knowledge of some past time.

No CTC can be continuously deformed as a CTC to a point (that is, a CTC and a point are not timelike homotopic), as the manifold would not be causally well behaved at that point. The topological feature which prevents the CTC from being deformed to a point is known as a timelike topological feature.

The existence of CTCs would arguably place restrictions on physically allowable states of matter-energy fields in the universe. Propagating a field configuration along the family of closed timelike worldlines must, according to such arguments, eventually result in the state that is identical to the original one. This idea has been explored by some scientists as a possible approach towards disproving the existence of CTCs.

While quantum formulations of CTCs have been proposed, a strong challenge to them is their ability to freely create entanglement, which quantum theory predicts is impossible. If Deutsch&#x27;s prescription holds, the existence of these CTCs implies also equivalence of quantum and classical computation (both in PSPACE). If Lloyd&#x27;s prescription holds, quantum computations would be PP-complete.

== Contractible versus noncontractible ==
There are two classes of CTCs. We have CTCs contractible to a point (if we no longer insist it has to be future-directed timelike everywhere), and we have CTCs which are not contractible. For the latter, we can always go to the universal covering space, and reestablish causality. For the former, such a procedure is not possible. No closed timelike curve is contractible to a point by a timelike homotopy among timelike curves, as that point would not be causally well behaved.

== Cauchy horizon ==
The chronology violating set is the set of points through which CTCs pass. The boundary of this set is the Cauchy horizon. The Cauchy horizon is generated by closed null geodesics. Associated with each closed null geodesic is a redshift factor describing the rescaling of the rate of change of the affine parameter around a loop. Because of this redshift factor, the affine parameter terminates at a finite value after infinitely many revolutions because the geometric series converges.

<text>Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, Comtesse de La Fayette (baptized 18 March 1634 – 25 May 1693), better known as Madame de La Fayette, was a French writer; she authored &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, France&#x27;s first historical novel and one of the earliest novels in literature.

== Life ==
Christened Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, she was born in Paris to a family of minor but wealthy nobility. At 16, de la Vergne became the maid of honour to Queen Anne of Austria and began also to acquire a literary education from Gilles Ménage, who gave her lessons in Italian and Latin. Ménage led her to join the fashionable salons of Madame de Rambouillet and Madeleine de Scudéry. Her father, Marc Pioche de la Vergne, had died a year before, and the same year her mother married Renaud de Sévigné, uncle of Madame de Sévigné, who remained her lifelong intimate friend.

In 1655, de la Vergne married François Motier, comte de La Fayette, a widowed nobleman some eighteen years her senior, with whom she had two sons. She accompanied him to country estates in Auvergne and Bourbonnais although she made frequent trips back to Paris, where she began to mix with court society and formed her own successful salon. Her sister-in-law was Louise de La Fayette (1618–1665), favourite of Louis XIII of France. Some of her acquaintances included Henrietta of England, future Duchess of Orleans, who asked La Fayette to write her biography; Antoine Arnauld; and the leading French writers Segrais and Huet. Earlier on, during the Fronde, La Fayette had also befriended the Cardinal de Retz with whom her stepfather was associated.

Settling permanently in Paris in 1659, La Fayette published, anonymously, &quot;La Princesse de Montpensier&quot; in 1662. From 1665 onwards she formed a close relationship with François de La Rochefoucauld, author of &quot;Maximes&quot;, who introduced her to many literary luminaries of the time, including Racine and Boileau. 1669 saw the publication of the first volume of &quot;Zaïde&quot;, a Hispano-Moorish romance which was signed by Segrais but is almost certainly attributable to La Fayette. The second volume appeared in 1671. The title ran through reprints and translations mostly thanks to the preface Huet had offered.

La Fayette&#x27;s most famous novel was &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, first published anonymously in March 1678. An immense success, the work is often taken to be the first true French novel and a prototype of the early psychological novel.

Her correspondence showed her as the acute diplomatic agent of Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours, duchess of Savoy, at the court of Louis XIV.

The death of La Rochefoucauld in 1680 and her husband in 1683 led La Fayette to lead a less active social life in her later years. Three works were published posthumously: &quot;La Comtesse de Tende&quot; (1718), &quot;Histoire d&#x27;Henriette d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (1720), and &quot;Memoires de la Cour de France&quot; (1731).

== Family ==
Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne was the eldest daughter of Marc Pioche (–1649), Esquire to the King, Sieur de La Vergne and the tutor to Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s nephew, Jean Armand de Maille-Breze, and Isabella Pena (–1656) daughter of François Pena, physician of the King, and his wife, Michelle Coupe.

Her baptism took place March 18, 1634 in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. Her godfather was Urbain de Maillé-Brézé, Marshal of France, and her godmother was Marie-Madeleine de Vignerot, lady Combalet, later Duchess of Aiguillon, a niece of Richelieu.

Her marriage took place in the Church of Saint-Sulpice.

She is buried in the Church of Saint-Sulpice.

Marie-Madeleine had two younger sisters:
* Eléonore-Armande, baptized 1635
* Isabelle Louise, born 1636

Her mother, Isabella Pena, remarried in 1650 to René Renaud de Sévigné (–1656), uncle of the Marquise de Sévigné.

She married on February 15, 1655 François Motier, comte de La Fayette (brother of Louise de La Fayette) (1616–1683). He held several lands in the Auvergne region such as de La Fayette, de Goutenoutouse, de Médat and de Forest. They had two sons:
* Louis de Lafayette (1658–1729), baptized March 7, 1658, commendatory abbot of Notre-Dame de Valmont;
* Armand Renaud de La Fayette (1659–1694), &quot;Brigadier des armées&quot;, count and marquis de La Fayette.
After the birth of her two sons, her husband disappeared from her life so effectively that it was long supposed that he died about 1660.

<text>Jean Hérault, [[Baron]] of Gourville (July 10, 1625 – June 14, 1703) was a French adventurer and aristocrat. 

He was born in La Rochefoucauld, in today&#x27;s Charente &quot;département&quot;. At the age of eighteen he entered the house of La Rochefoucauld as a servant, and in 1646 became secretary to François de La Rochefoucauld, author of the &quot;Maximes&quot;. Resourceful and quick-witted, he rendered services to his master during the Fronde, in his intrigues with the parliament, the court or the princes. In these negotiations he made the acquaintance of Condé, whom he wished to help to escape from the château of Vincennes; of Mazarin, for whom he negotiated the reconciliation with the princes; and of Nicolas Fouquet.

After the Fronde he engaged in financial affairs, thanks to Fouquet. In 1658 he farmed the &quot;taille&quot; in Guienne. He bought depreciated &quot;rentes&quot; and had them raised to their nominal value by the treasury; he extorted gifts from the financiers for his protection, being Fouquet&#x27;s confidant in many operations of which he shared the profits. In three years he accumulated an enormous fortune, still further increased by his unfailing good fortune at cards, playing even with the king. He was involved in the trial of Fouquet, and in April 1663 was condemned to death for peculation and embezzlement of public funds; but escaping, was executed in effigy. He sent a valet one night to take the effigy down from the gallows in the court of the &quot;Palais de Justice&quot;, and then fled the country.

He remained five years abroad, being excepted in 1665 from the amnesty accorded by Louis XIV to the condemned financiers. Having returned secretly to France, he entered the service of Condé, who, unable to meet his creditors, had need of a clever manager to put his affairs in order. In this way he was able to reappear at court, to assist at the campaigns of the war with Holland, and to offer himself for all the delicate negotiations for his master or the king. He received diplomatic missions in Germany, in Holland, and especially in Spain, though it was only in 1694, that he was freed from the condemnation pronounced against him by the chamber of justice. From 1696 he fell ill and withdrew to his estate, where he dictated to his secretary, in four months and a half, his &quot;Mémoires&quot;, an important source for the history of his time. In spite of several errors, introduced purposely, they give a clear idea of the life and morals of a financier of the age of Fouquet, and throw light on certain points of the diplomatic history. They were first published in 1724.

Gourville died in Paris on June 14, 1703.

<text>Politiken is a leading Danish daily broadsheet newspaper, published by JP/Politikens Hus in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was founded in 1884 and played a role in the formation of the Danish Social Liberal Party. Since 1970 it has been independent of the party but maintains a liberal stance. It now runs an online newspaper, &quot;politiken.dk&quot;. The paper&#x27;s design has won several international awards, and a number of its journalists have won the Cavling Prize.

==History and profile==
&quot;Dagbladet Politiken&quot; was founded on 1 October 1884 in Copenhagen by Viggo Hørup, Edvard Brandes and Hermann Bing. Hørup and Brandes formed the newspaper after being fired as editors from the &quot;Morgenbladet&quot; over political differences. Hørup led the paper as editor-in-chief for fifteen years from its start in 1884.

In 1904, the tabloid was founded as a supplement to &quot;Politiken &quot;and was later spun off as an independent newspaper on 1 January 1905. The paper established its present location in central Copenhagen at The City Hall Square in 1912.

In 1987 &quot;Politiken&quot; started its business supplement. The paper was published by Politikens Hus until 1 January 2003 when the company merged with Jyllands-Posten A/S to form JP/Politikens Hus. Thus, became its sister paper. &quot;Politiken&quot; is published in broadsheet format.

The newspaper also publishes an international edition named &quot;Politiken Weekly&quot; which compiles the most important stories of the week for Danes living abroad.

In 2012, &quot;Politiken Foundation&quot; became one of the founding members of the European Press Prize.

In February 2020 &quot;Politiken&quot; and its editor-in-chief, Christian Jensen, had to pay a fine due to the publication of the sections from a book on the security and intelligence of Denmark in 2016.

Since 2016, Danish journalist Mette Davidsen-Nielsen has worked as the cultural editor at &quot;Politiken Foundation.&quot;

In November 2023, &quot;Politiken&quot; joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes. 

==Wartime reporting==
On 28 April 1940, three weeks after the German invasion of Denmark, &quot;Politiken&quot; ran an editorial in which Winston Churchill was called &quot;a dangerous man&quot;. The editorial was written by foreign affairs editor Einard Schou after a conversation in the editor-in-chief&#x27;s office with chairman of the board and soon-to-be-again Danish foreign minister Erik Scavenius. The aim is thought to have been to please the German occupation force, though no other Danish newspaper took such steps at the time. Usually, it was enough to keep within the newly introduced censorship. The article led to 15,000 readers, about 10% of subscribers, cancelling their subscriptions in protest.

==Editorial line==
During the early 1900s &quot;Politiken&quot; had a cultural radical political stance. Historically the paper was connected to the Danish Social Liberal Party (Det Radikale Venstre), but the newspaper declared its political independence in 1970. The paper has a far-leaning social, liberal and centre-left stance.

In February 2010 the editor in chief at the time Tøger Seidenfaden apologized to anyone who was offended by the newspaper&#x27;s decision to reprint the cartoon drawing by Kurt Westergaard depicting Muhammed with a bomb in his turban, which was originally published in &quot;Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten&quot;. Seidenfaden explained that &quot;&quot;Politiken&quot; has never intended to reprint the cartoon drawing as a statement of editorial opinion or values but merely as part of the newspaper&#x27;s news coverage&quot;.

==Circulation==
&quot;Politiken&quot; started with a daily circulation of 2,000 copies. Its circulation was 23,142 copies in 1901. In 1910 its circulation rose to 41,400 copies. Later it became one of Denmark&#x27;s leading newspapers in terms of both circulated copies and number of readers. Its circulation was 165,615 copies in 1950. During the last six months of 1957 the paper had a circulation of 148,169 copies on weekdays. It fell to 142,847 copies in 1960. The circulation of the paper was 134,728 in 1970, 138,921 copies in 1980 and 152,435 copies in 1990. During the second half of 1997 its circulation was 146,000 copies on weekdays.

&quot;Politiken&quot; had a circulation of 143,000 copies on weekdays and 185,000 copies on Sundays in the first quarter of 2000, making it the third best selling newspaper in the country. It was 142,780 copies in 2000. In 2002 it was the third best-selling newspaper in the country with a circulation of 142,000 copies. The circulation of the paper was 137,000 copies in 2003, making it again the third best selling newspaper in the country. In 2004 the paper had a circulation of 134,000 copies.

The circulation of &quot;Politiken&quot; was 110,230 copies in 2007. The number of copies sold per day in the first half of 2012 were 97,820 on weekdays and Saturdays, and 120,411 on Sundays. The same year the number of readers were 375,000 on weekdays and Saturdays, and 479,000 readers on Sundays. The paper had a circulation of 88,597 copies in 2013.

Its online newspaper, politiken.dk, received around 800,000 monthly users in 2011 and was the tenth most viewed page among the members of the Association of Danish Interactive Media.

==Awards==
Internationally, &quot;Politiken&quot; has received recognition for its design through the form of several awards. In 2012 &quot;Politiken&quot; was declared &#x27;World&#x27;s Best&#x27; along with four other newspapers in a competition carried out by the Society for News Design. In 2014 the paper was chosen as one of Scandinavia’s best-designed newspapers in the Best of Scandinavian News Design competition.

The paper&#x27;s design, format, and brand was given as the reason, when in 2010, the European Newspapers Congress awarded &quot;Politiken&quot; with the European Newspaper Award in the national newspaper category.

&quot;Politiken&quot; has also been known for its photography. Jan Grarup, winner of several World Press Photo Awards and numerous other prizes, was a staff photographer from 2003 until 2009.

Anselm Hüwe is one of the contemporary awarded photographers.

===The Cavling Award===
&quot;Cavlingprisen&quot; (&quot;The Cavling Award&quot;) is a Danish honorary award for journalism. It was named after a former reporter and editor-in-chief at &quot;Politiken&quot; Henrik Cavling.

<text>A harpoon is a long, spear-like projectile used in fishing, whaling, sealing, and other hunting to shoot, kill, and capture large fish or marine mammals such as seals, sea cows, and whales. It impales the target and secures it with barb or toggling claws, allowing the fishermen or hunters to use an attached rope or chain to pull and retrieve the animal. A harpoon can also be used as a ranged weapon against other watercraft in naval warfare.

Certain harpoons are made with different builds to perform better with the type of target. For example, the Inuit have short, fixed-foreshaft harpoons for hunting at breathing holes, while loose-shafted ones are made for throwing and remaining attached to the game.

==History==

In the 1990s, harpoon points, known as the Semliki harpoons or the Katanda harpoons, were found in the Katanda region in Zaire. As the earliest known harpoons, these weapons were made and used 90,000 years ago, most likely to spear catfishes. Later, in Japan, spearfishing with poles was widespread in palaeolithic times, especially during the Solutrean and Magdalenian periods. Cosquer Cave in southern France has cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals that appear to have been harpooned.

There are references to harpoons in ancient literature, though in most cases the descriptions do not go into detail. An early example can be found in the Bible in Job 41:7 (NIV): &quot;Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears?&quot; The Greek historian Polybius (c. 203 BC – 120 BC), in his &quot;Histories&quot;, describes hunting for swordfish by using a harpoon with a barbed and detachable head. Copper harpoons were known to the seafaring Harappans well into antiquity. Early hunters in India include the Mincopie people, aboriginal inhabitants of India&#x27;s Andaman and Nicobar islands, who have used harpoons with long cords for fishing since early times.

===Whaling===
In the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Herman Melville explained the reason for the harpoon&#x27;s effectiveness:
He also describes another device that was at times a necessary addition to harpoons:

===Explosive harpoons===
The first use of explosives in the hunting of whales was made by the British South Sea Company in 1737, after some years of declining catches. A large fleet was sent, armed with cannon-fired harpoons. Although the weaponry was successful in killing the whales, most of the catch sank before being retrieved. However, the system was still occasionally used, and underwent successive improvements at the hands of various inventors over the next century, including Abraham Stagholt in the 1770s and George Manby in the early 19th century.

William Congreve, who invented some of the first rockets for British Army use, designed a rocket-propelled whaling harpoon in the 1820s. The shell was designed to explode on contact and impale the whale with the harpoon. The weapon was in turn attached by a line to the boat, and the hope was that the explosion would generate enough gas within the whale to keep it afloat for retrieval. Expeditions were sent out to try this new technology; many whales were killed, but most of them sank. These early devices, called bomb lances, became widely used for the hunting of humpbacks and right whales. A notable user of these early explosive harpoons was the American Thomas Welcome Roys in 1865, who set up a shore station in Seydisfjördur, Iceland. A slump in oil prices after the American Civil War forced their endeavor into bankruptcy in 1867. 

An early version of the explosive harpoon was designed by Jacob Nicolai Walsøe, a Norwegian painter and inventor. His 1851 application was rejected by the interior ministry on the grounds that he had received public funding for his experiments. In 1867, a Danish fireworks manufacturer, Gaetano Amici, patented a cannon-fired harpoon, and in the same year, an Englishman, George Welch, patented a grenade harpoon very similar to the version which transformed whaling in the following decade.

In 1870, the Norwegian shipping magnate Svend Foyn patented and pioneered the modern exploding whaling harpoon and gun. Foyn had studied the American method in Iceland. His basic design is still in use today. He perceived the failings of other methods and solved these problems in his own system. He included, with the help of H.M.T. Esmark, a grenade tip that exploded inside the whale. This harpoon design also utilized a shaft that was connected to the head with a moveable joint. His original cannons were muzzle-loaded with special padding and also used a unique form of gunpowder. The cannons were later replaced with safer breech-loading types. 

Together with the steam engine, this development ushered in the modern age of commercial whaling. Euro-American whalers were now equipped to hunt faster and more powerful species, such as the rorquals. Because rorquals sank when they died, later versions of the exploding harpoon injected air into the carcass to keep it afloat.

The modern whaling harpoon consists of a deck-mounted launcher (mostly a cannon) and a projectile which is a large harpoon with an explosive (penthrite) charge, attached to a thick rope. The spearhead is shaped in a manner which allows it to penetrate the thick layers of whale blubber and stick in the flesh. It has sharp spikes to prevent the harpoon from sliding out. Thus, by pulling the rope with a motor, the whalers can drag the whale back to their ship.

A recent development in harpoon technology is the hand-held speargun. Divers use the speargun for spearing fish. They may also be used for defense against dangerous marine animals. Spearguns may be powered by pressurized gas or with mechanical means like springs or elastic bands.

==Space==
The Philae spacecraft carried harpoons for helping the probe anchor itself to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. However, the harpoons failed to fire.

<doc id="287102" wikidata="Q586211" url="?curid=287102" title="Antoine Furetière">
<text>Antoine Furetière (28 December 161914 May 1688) was a French scholar, writer, and lexicographer, known best for his satirical novel &quot;Scarron&#x27;s City Romance&quot;, and also his famous Dictionnaire universel . He was expelled from the Académie Française for seeking to publish his own French language dictionary.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Furetière was born in Paris, the son of an employee of the royal household. He studied law and worked for a time as an attorney and tax assessor. Later he became a Catholic clergyman and, after various promotions, the abbé of Chalivoy in the diocese of Bourges in 1662. Thanks to the leisure he enjoyed as a clergyman, he was able to devote himself to writing. 

=== Career ===
He was admitted to the Académie Française in 1662 by virtue of his satire (1658), among other works.

One of Furetière&#x27;s most important literary works was &quot;Le Roman bourgeois&quot; (1666). This satirical novel described everyday life, especially within the legal profession, and ridiculed the fashionable romances of Madeleine de Scudéry and of Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède. Because of its similarity to Paul Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Le Roman comique&quot; (1651, 1657), it was translated into English as &quot;Scarron&#x27;s City Romance&quot; in 1671. With a self-conscious narrator who comments on his techniques and disregards the conventions of the novel, it anticipates Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (1759–1767).

==== French dictionary project ====
At its founding, the Académie Française had been entrusted with the task of producing a complete dictionary of the French language. Furetière initially participated in the collaborative project with enthusiasm, but eventually grew frustrated with his colleagues&#x27; approach and slow progress and began work on his own dictionary, probably around 1676–1678. When members of the academy heard that Furetière was about to publish his dictionary, they interfered, alleging that he had stolen their material and violated the monopoly they had held on French dictionaries since 1672. In 1685, after fierce recrimination on both sides, Furetière was expelled from the academy, and the French government revoked his permission to publish the dictionary. In 1690, Furetière&#x27;s &quot;Dictionaire universel&quot; was published posthumously in the Netherlands with a &quot;Preface&quot; prepared by his friend Pierre Bayle.

<text>Gauthier de Costes, seigneur de la Calprenède (1609 or 1610 – 1663) was a French novelist and dramatist. He was born at the Château of Tolgou in Salignac-Eyvigues (Dordogne). After studying at Toulouse, he came to Paris and entered the regiment of the guards, becoming in 1650 gentleman-in-ordinary of the royal household. He died in 1663 in consequence of a kick from his horse.

La Calprenède wrote several long heroic romances that were later ridiculed by Boileau, and most of them were also referenced in Charlotte Lennox&#x27;s &quot;The Female Quixote&quot;. They are: &quot;Cassandre&quot; (5 vols., 1642–1650); &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; (1648); &quot;Faramond&quot; (1661); and &quot;Les Nouvelles, ou les Divertissements de la princesse Alcidiane&quot; (1661) published under his wife&#x27;s name, but generally attributed to him. His &quot;Le Comte d&#x27;Essex&quot;, produced in 1638, supplied some ideas to Thomas Corneille for his tragedy of the same name.

<text>Information (), full name: Dagbladet Information (), is a Danish newspaper published Monday through Saturday.

==History and profile==

&quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; was established and published by the Danish resistance movement in 1943 during World War II. The paper was edited by Børge Outze and was illegal during the war as it was not regulated by the German occupying power. Following the liberation on 5 May 1945 &quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; was a reality and was officially founded in August 1945. Outze continued to work as the paper&#x27;s editor in chief to his death in 1980. It has its headquarters in Copenhagen.

&quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; is the youngest major newspaper in Denmark and remains independent of the larger publishing houses. The paper is owned by A/S Information and is published by A/S Dagbladet Information from Monday to Saturday. It is based in Copenhagen.

In the 1970s &quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; was one of the alternative media together with &quot;Politisk Revy&quot; in Denmark and covered all dimensions of new social movements.

The newspaper, which despite being politically independent, is regarded as left liberal and leftist by some, but known as being equally critical in its point of view of all political organizations. It prints letters from prominent conservative figures and it tries to see several sides of a case. The tone is serious and the number of charts and pictures is limited, comparable to the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;. &quot;Information&quot; has a syndication agreement with the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and often collaborates with &quot;The Independent&quot; for articles and reports. The paper covers in-depth analytical articles.

&quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; was published in broadsheet format until 30 November 2004 when it switched to a compact format.

On 8 September 2006, the newspaper printed six of the less offensive entries from the Iranian Holocaust cartoon exhibition, which was a response to the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy. The editor chose the cartoons after consulting the main rabbi in Copenhagen.

Danish journalist Mette Davidsen-Nielsen served as the paper&#x27;s CEO from 2010 to 2016.

==Circulation==
During the last six months of 1957 &quot;Dagbladet Information&quot; had a circulation of 24,214 copies on weekdays. The circulation of the paper was 22,000 copies on weekdays during the second half of 1997. Its circulation was also 22,000 copies in the first quarter of 2000. The paper had a circulation of 20,000 copies in 2004 and 20,600 copies in 2005. In 2009 it had a daily circulation of 22,000 copies, making it the smallest national daily newspaper in Denmark.

<text>Mary O&#x27;Rourke (; 31 May 1937 – 3 October 2024) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Leader of the Seanad and Leader of Fianna Fáil in the Seanad from 2002 to 2007, Deputy leader of Fianna Fáil from 1994 to 2002, Minister for Public Enterprise from 1997 to 2002, Minister for Health from 1991 to 1992 and Minister for Education from 1987 to 1991. She also served as a Minister of State from 1992 to 1994. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1982 to 2002 and 2007 to 2011. She served as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1981 to 1982 and from 2002 to 2007, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Rourke was born in Athlone, County Westmeath on 31 May 1937. She came from a strong political family, her father Patrick Lenihan served as a TD for Longford–Westmeath from 1965 to 1970. Her brother Brian Lenihan was a senior government minister and Tánaiste. Another brother Paddy Lenihan was a county councillor in Roscommon but resigned from Fianna Fáil in 1983 and became associated with Neil Blaney&#x27;s Independent Fianna Fáil party. Two of her nephews, Brian Lenihan Jnr and Conor Lenihan, both sons of her brother Brian, served as ministers. Brian Lenihan Jnr was the Minister for Finance. Conor Lenihan was a Minister of State.

She was educated at St. Peter&#x27;s, Athlone; Loreto Bray Convent, County Wicklow; University College Dublin and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth. She worked as a secondary school teacher before she began her political career.

==Political career==

O&#x27;Rourke began her political career in local politics, serving on Athlone Urban District Council between 1974 and 1987 and on Westmeath County Council between 1979 and 1987. She was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1981 as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel. She stood unsuccessfully for the Dáil at the February 1982 general election but was subsequently re-elected to the Seanad. At the November 1982 general election, she was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Longford–Westmeath constituency, and from 1992 for the new Westmeath constituency.
In 1987, she was appointed Minister for Education by Charles Haughey. O&#x27;Rourke and her brother, Brian Lenihan, became the first siblings in Irish history to serve in the same cabinet. In November 1991 cabinet reshuffle, O&#x27;Rourke became Minister for Health. In February 1992, Charles Haughey resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. O&#x27;Rourke contested the subsequent leadership election along with Michael Woods and Albert Reynolds. Reynolds defeated the other two contenders and O&#x27;Rourke was subsequently dropped from her ministerial position but was appointed to a junior ministry as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for Trade and Marketing. In January 1993, she was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Labour Affairs, serving until the fall of the Reynolds government in December 1994.

In 1994, Bertie Ahern became party leader and he appointed O&#x27;Rourke as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, serving in the position until 2002. Following Ahern&#x27;s election as Taoiseach in June 1997, O&#x27;Rourke became Minister for Public Enterprise, holding this position until she lost her Dáil seat at the 2002 general election. This followed a vote management strategy from Fianna Fáil head office which restricted her from campaigning in her traditional areas around Kilbeggan, in an attempt to win 2 of the 3 seats in Westmeath. The loss of her Dáil seat has also been attributed to her association with and the championing of, the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, which proved a financial disaster for many small investors, due to the share price falling radically, after privatisation. Following the loss of her Dáil seat, she was nominated to Seanad Éireann as a Senator by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern where she became Leader of the Seanad and leader of Fianna Fáil in the Seanad.

In January 2006, O&#x27;Rourke received the party nomination to stand at the 2007 general election. She narrowly defeated her nearest rival and Dáil election running mate, Kevin &quot;Boxer&quot; Moran of Athlone Town Council, causing a controversy when she thanked her election team for working &quot;like blacks.&quot; In May 2007, she was re-elected to the Dáil at the 2007 general election, with her highest ever vote.

In November 2008, during a march against the re-introduction of college fees, students from the Athlone Institute of Technology laid a funeral wreath at the door of O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s constituency office. The card on the wreath stated &quot;Sincere sympathies on the death of free fees. We will remember this.&quot; O&#x27;Rourke described the act as &quot;heinous&quot;. The wreath was placed there because O&#x27;Rourke was not speaking at a rally against the fees.

In July 2010, O&#x27;Rourke conceded that she did not expect the party to be in power after the next general election. On RTÉ Radio&#x27;s &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; programme, O&#x27;Rourke said the government was making tough decisions to steer the country through the financial crisis and this would make it easy for the opposition. She said there was a general air of &quot;crossness&quot; within the Fianna Fáil party over their standing in the polls, but nobody was harbouring leadership ambitions to challenge Brian Cowen.

O&#x27;Rourke in November 2010 said there was then more to unite her party and Fine Gael than to divide them. She pointed to the common approach of the two parties to Northern Ireland, Europe and the current financial crisis. In an address to the 1916–1921 Club in Dublin Castle, she said that most voters no longer defined themselves in terms of Civil War politics. Having pointed to the shared values of the two parties on several issues, she said the last issue she wanted to mention was the &quot;dreaded b&quot; word.

Her senior years led her to often being referred to as the &quot;Mammy of the Dáil&quot;.

She contested the 2011 general election but was defeated. O&#x27;Rourke criticised former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, saying that he should have resigned after his infamous &quot;congested&quot; radio interview. She supported the attack on Cowen by her nephew, former Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, who said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; by Cowen&#x27;s performance and he had to provide the leadership when the Taoiseach did not.

In retirement, she received a lump sum of €237,000 and an annual pension of €97,000.

==Other activities==
As well as being a well-known politician, O&#x27;Rourke made regular appearances in the media in a non-political capacity. She was a contestant on RTÉ&#x27;s reality series &quot;Celebrity Bainisteoir&quot;, as well as other shows such as &quot;Sex &amp; Sensibility&quot;. She guest presented &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Just Mary: My Memoir&quot; was published. It won the 2012 Irish Book Award in the &quot;Listeners&#x27; Choice&quot; category.

==Personal life and death==
She married Enda O&#x27;Rourke in 1962, and they had two sons. One of them, Aengus O&#x27;Rourke, has been a member of Westmeath County Council since 2014. The other, Feargal O&#x27;Rourke, became Managing Partner of PriceWaterHouseCoopers in Ireland in 2015 and is considered the &quot;grand architect&quot; of the double Irish tax system, a major contributor to Ireland&#x27;s economic success in attracting US multinationals to Ireland.

Her husband Enda died in January 2001. O&#x27;Rourke died in Deansgrange, Dublin on 3 October 2024, at the age of 87.

<doc id="287108" wikidata="Q237095" url="?curid=287108" title="Madeleine de Scudéry">
<text>Madeleine de Scudéry (; 15 November 1607 – 2 June 1701), often known simply as [[Mademoiselle (title)|Mademoiselle]] de Scudéry (), was a French writer. 

Her works demonstrate such comprehensive knowledge of ancient history that it is suspected she had received instruction in Greek and Latin. In 1637, following the death of her uncle, Scudéry established herself in Paris with her brother, Georges de Scudéry, who became a playwright. Madeleine often used her older brother&#x27;s name, George, to publish her works. She was at once admitted to the Hôtel de Rambouillet coterie of préciosité, and afterwards established a salon of her own under the title of the &quot;Société du samedi&quot; (&quot;Saturday Society&quot;). For the last half of the 17th century, under the pseudonym of Sapho or her own name, she was acknowledged as the first bluestocking of France and of the world. She formed a close romantic relationship with Paul Pellisson which was only ended by his death in 1693. She never married.

==Biography==
Born at Le Havre, Normandy, in northern France, she was without fortune, but she was exceedingly well-educated. Her father, captain of the port in Le Havre, died in 1613 with her mother following shortly after. Madeleine and her brother Georges de Scudéry were placed in the care of an uncle who cared for them very well. He gave Madeleine an abnormally well-rounded education: she studied writing, spelling, drawing, dancing, painting, and needlework. In addition, on her own, Madeleine studied agriculture, medicine, cooking, Spanish, and Italian. 

==Works==

Her lengthy novels, such as &quot;Artamène, ou le Grand Cyrus&quot; (10 vols., 1648–53), &quot;Clélie&quot; (10 vols., 1654–61), &quot;Ibrahim, ou l&#x27;illustre Bassa&quot; (4 vols., 1641), &quot;Almahide, ou l&#x27;esclave reine&quot; (8 vols., 1661–63) were the delight of Europe, commended by other literary figures such as Madame de Sévigné. &quot;Artamène&quot;, which contains about 2.1 million words, ranks among the longest novels ever published. Her novels derive their length from endless conversations and, as far as incidents go, successive abductions of the heroines, conceived and told decorously. Contemporary readers also enjoyed these novels because they gave a glimpse into the life of important society figures. These figures were often disguised as Persian, Greek, and Roman warriors and maidens. In fact, Scudéry created the roman à clef to provide a forum for her thinly veiled fiction featuring political and public figures.

&quot;Les Femmes Illustres&quot; (1642) addresses itself to women and defends education, rather than the beauty or cosmetic, as a means of social mobility for women. This text was a means to justify women&#x27;s participation in rhetoric and literary culture. It uses women speakers as models for the speeches, including Cleopatra of Egypt. In &quot;Les Femmes Illustres&quot; (1642), &quot;Conversations Sur Divers Sujets&quot; (1680), and &quot;Conversations Nouvelles sur Divers Sujets, Dediees Au Roy&quot; (1684), Madeleine de Scudéry adapted classical rhetorical theory from Cicero, Quintilian, Aristotle, and the sophists to a theory of salon conversation and letter writing. Scudéry&#x27;s Conversations Sur Divers Sujets, included dialogues covering &quot;Conversation,&quot; &quot;The Art of Speaking,&quot; &quot;Raillery,&quot; &quot;Invention,&quot; and &quot;The Manner of Writing Letters.&quot; This text offers the rhetoric of salon conversation and model scenarios where women take intellectual control of the conversation. Other works devoted to conversations, pertaining to the education of women include: &quot;The Slave Queen&quot; (1660), &quot;Mathilda of Aguilar, a Spanish Tale,&quot; (1667), and &quot;The Versailles Promenade, or the Tale of Celanire&quot; (1669). These covered the art of speaking, invention, the manner of writing letters, and scenarios where women had control of the intellectual conversation.

Scudéry&#x27;s novels are usually set in the classical world or &quot;the Orient&quot;, but their language and action reflect fashionable ideas of the 17th century, and the characters can be identified with Mademoiselle de Scudéry&#x27;s contemporaries. In &quot;Clélie&quot;, Herminius represents Paul Pellisson; Scaurus and Lyriane were Paul Scarron and his wife (who became Mme de Maintenon); and in the description of Sapho in vol. 10 of &quot;Le Grand Cyrus&quot; the author paints herself.

In &quot;Clélie&quot;, Scudéry invented the famous &quot;Carte de Tendre&quot;, a map of an Arcadia where the geography is all based around the theme of love: the river of Inclination flows past the villages of &quot;Billet Doux&quot; (love letter), &quot;Petits Soins&quot; (Little Trinkets) and so forth.
Scudéry was a skilled conversationalist; several volumes purporting to report her conversations upon various topics were published during her lifetime. She had a distinct vocation as a pedagogue.
==Later years==
Madeleine survived her brother by more than thirty years, and in her later days published numerous volumes of conversations, to a great extent extracted from her novels, thus forming a kind of anthology of her work. Scudéry was deaf for the last 40 years of her life. She outlived her vogue to some extent, but retained a circle of friends, like Marie Dupré, to whom she was always the &quot;incomparable Sapho.&quot;

Her &quot;Life and Correspondence&quot; was published at Paris by MM. Rathery and Boutron in 1873.

==Legacy==

Madeleine de Scudéry was part of a movement in the late Renaissance in England and France where women used classical rhetorical theory for their own. She revised discourse to be modeled on conversation rather than public speaking, favoring that as a means of rhetoric, the speaker in the salon built on the ideas of the speaker before them, opting for consensus rather than argument. She is one of the central figures associated with the &quot;salon&quot; conversation and letter writing.

Controversial in her own era, Mademoiselle de Scudéry was satirized by Molière in his plays &quot;Les Précieuses ridicules&quot; (1659) and &quot;Les Femmes savantes&quot; (1672) and by Antoine Furetière in his &quot;Roman Bourgeois&quot; (1666).

The 19th century German writer E.T.A. Hoffmann wrote what is usually referred to as the first German-language detective story, featuring Scudéry as the central figure. &quot;Das Fräulein von Scuderi&quot; (Mademoiselle de Scudery) is still widely read today, and is the origin of the &quot;Cardillac syndrome&quot; in psychology.
Mademoiselle de Scudéry is also featured prominently in &quot;Madeleine: One of Love&#x27;s Jansenists&quot;, a novel published in 1919 by modernist writer Hope Mirrlees. The novel is set in and around the literary circles of the 17th Century Précieuses. The protagonist, a young woman named Madeleine Troqueville, becomes enamored of Mademoiselle de Scudéry, who snubs young Madeleine. It has been suggested that the novel is a roman à clef with Natalie Clifford Barney portrayed as Mademoiselle de Scudéry.

<text>Eoin MacNeill (; born John McNeill; 15 May 1867 – 15 October 1945) was an Irish scholar, Irish language enthusiast, Gaelic revivalist, nationalist, and politician who served as Minister for Education from 1922 to 1925, Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1921 to 1922, Minister for Industries 1919 to 1921 and Minister for Finance January 1919 to April 1919. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1927. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry City from 1918 to 1922 and a Member of the Northern Ireland Parliament (MP) for Londonderry from 1921 to 1925.

A key figure of the Gaelic revival, MacNeill was a co-founder of the Gaelic League, to preserve the Irish language and culture. He has been described as &quot;the father of the modern study of early Irish medieval history&quot;.

He established the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and served as Chief-of-Staff of the minority faction after it split in 1914 at the start of the World War. He held that position at the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916 but had no role in the Rising or its planning, which was carried out by his nominal subordinates, including Patrick Pearse, who were members of the secret society, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. On learning of the plans to launch an uprising on Easter Sunday, and after confronting Pearse about it, MacNeill issued a countermanding order, placing a last-minute newspaper advertisement instructing Volunteers not to participate.

In 1918 he was elected to the First Dáil as a member of Sinn Féin.

==Early life==
MacNeill was born John McNeill, one of five children born to Archibald McNeill, a Roman Catholic working-class baker, sailor and merchant, and his wife, Rosetta (&quot;née&quot; McAuley) McNeill, also a Catholic. He was raised in Glenarm, County Antrim, an area which &quot;still retained some Irish-language traditions&quot;. His niece was nationalist and teacher, Máirín Beaumont.

MacNeill was educated at St Malachy&#x27;s College (Belfast) and Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast. He was interested in Irish history and immersed himself in its study. He achieved a BA degree in economics, jurisprudence and constitutional history in 1888, and then worked in the British Civil Service.

He co-founded the Gaelic League in 1893, along with Douglas Hyde; MacNeill was unpaid secretary from 1893 to 1897 and then became the initial editor of the League&#x27;s official newspaper &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot; (1899–1901). He was also editor of the &quot;Gaelic Journal&quot; from 1894 to 1899. In 1908, he was appointed professor of early Irish history at University College Dublin.

He married Agnes Moore on 19 April 1898. The couple had eight children, four sons and four daughters (though the 1911 census entry for Mac Neill noted 11 children, seven of whom were still alive).

==Irish Volunteers==
The Gaelic League was from the start strictly non-political, but in 1915, a proposal was put forward to abandon that policy and become a semi-political organisation. MacNeill strongly supported that and rallied to his side a majority of delegates at the 1915 &quot;Oireachtas&quot;. Douglas Hyde, a non-political Protestant, who had co-founded the League and been its president for 22 years, resigned immediately afterwards.

Through the Gaelic League, MacNeill met members of Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and other nationalists and republicans. One such colleague, The O&#x27;Rahilly, ran the league&#x27;s newspaper &quot;An Claidheamh Soluis&quot;, and in October 1913 they asked MacNeill to write an editorial for it on a subject broader than Irish language issues. MacNeill submitted a piece called &quot;The North Began&quot;, encouraging the formation of a nationalist volunteer force committed to Irish Home Rule, much as the unionists had done earlier that year with the Ulster Volunteers to thwart Home Rule in Ireland.

Bulmer Hobson, a member of the IRB, approached MacNeill about bringing the idea to fruition, and, through a series of meetings, MacNeill became chair of the council that formed the Irish Volunteers, later becoming its chief of staff. Unlike the IRB, MacNeill was opposed to the idea of an armed rebellion, except in resisting any suppression of the Volunteers, seeing little hope of success in open battle against the British army.

The Irish Volunteers had been infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which planned on using the organisation to stage an armed rebellion, to separate Ireland from the United Kingdom and establishing an Irish Republic. The entry of the UK into the First World War was, in their view, a perfect opportunity to do that. With the cooperation of James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army, a secret council of IRB officials planned a general rising at Easter 1916. On the Wednesday before Easter, they presented MacNeill with a letter, allegedly stolen from high-ranking British staff in Dublin Castle, indicating that the British were going to arrest him and all the other nationalist leaders. Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the letter—called the Castle Document—was a forgery.

When MacNeill learned about the IRB&#x27;s plans, and when he was informed that Roger Casement was about to land in County Kerry with a shipment of German arms, he was reluctantly persuaded to go along with them, believing British action was now imminent and that mobilization of the Irish Volunteers would be justified as a defensive act. However, after learning that the German arms shipment had been intercepted and Casement arrested, and having confronted Patrick Pearse, who refused to relent, MacNeill countermanded the order for the Rising by sending written messages to leaders around the country, and placing a notice in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; cancelling the planned &quot;manoeuvres&quot;. That greatly reduced the number of volunteers who reported for duty on the day of the Easter Rising.

Pearse, Connolly and the others agreed that the uprising would go ahead anyway, but it began one day later than originally intended to ensure that the authorities were taken by surprise. Beginning on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, the Rising lasted less than a week. After the surrender of the rebels, MacNeill was arrested although he had taken no part in the insurrection. The rebel leader Tom Clarke, according to his wife Kathleen, warned her on the day before his execution, &quot;I want you to see to it that our people know of his treachery to us. He must never be allowed back into the National life of this country, for so sure as he is, so sure will he act treacherously in a crisis. He is a weak man, but I know every effort will be made to whitewash him.&quot;

==Political life==
MacNeill was released from prison in 1917 and was elected MP for the National University and Londonderry City constituencies for Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election. In line with abstentionist Sinn Féin policy, he refused to take his seat in the British House of Commons in London and sat instead in the newly convened Dáil Éireann in Dublin, where he was made Secretary for Industries in the second ministry of the First Dáil. He was a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for Londonderry between 1921 and 1925, although he never took his seat. In 1921, he supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In 1922, he was in a minority of pro-Treaty delegates at the Irish Race Convention in Paris. Following the establishment of the Irish Free State, he became Minister for Education in its second (provisional) government, the third Dáil. He strongly supported the execution of Richard Barrett, Liam Mellows, Joe McKelvey and Rory O&#x27;Connor during the Irish Civil War. 

In 1923, MacNeill, a committed internationalist, was also a key member of the diplomatic team that oversaw Ireland&#x27;s entry to the League of Nations.

MacNeill&#x27;s family was split on the treaty issue. One son, Brian, took the anti-Treaty side and was killed in disputed circumstances near Sligo by Free State troops during the Irish Civil War in September 1922. Two other sons, Niall and Turloch, as well as nephew Hugo MacNeill, served as officers in the Free State Army. One of Eoin&#x27;s brothers, James McNeill, was the second and penultimate Governor-General of the Irish Free State.

==Irish Boundary Commission==
In 1924 the three-man Irish Boundary Commission was set up to settle the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State; MacNeill represented the Irish Free State. MacNeill was the only member of the Commission without legal training and has been described as having been “pathetically out of his depth”. However, each of the Commissioners was selected out of political expediency rather than for any established competence or insight into boundary making. On 7 November 1925, a conservative British newspaper, &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, published a leaked map showing a part of eastern County Donegal (mainly The Laggan district) that was to be transferred to Northern Ireland; the opposite of the main aims of the Commission. Perhaps embarrassed by that, especially since he said that it had declined to respect the terms of the Treaty, MacNeill resigned from the Commission on 20 November. On 24 November 1925 he also resigned as Minister for Education, a position unrelated to his work on the Commission.

On 3 December 1925, the Free State government agreed with the governments in London and Belfast to end its onerous treaty requirement to pay its share of the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;imperial debt&quot; and, in exchange, agreed that the 1920 boundary would remain as it was, overriding the Commission. That angered many nationalists and MacNeill was the subject of much criticism, but in reality, he and the Commission had been sidestepped by the intergovernmental debt renegotiation. In any case, despite his resignations, the intergovernmental boundary deal was approved by a Dáil vote of 71–20 on 10 December 1925, and MacNeill is listed as voting with the majority in favour. He lost his Dáil seat at the June 1927 election.

==Academic==
MacNeill was an important scholar of Irish history and among the first to study Early Irish law, offering both his interpretations, which at times were coloured by his nationalism, and translations into English. He was also the first to uncover the nature of succession in Irish kingship, and his theories are the foundation for modern ideas on the subject.

He was a contributor to the Royal Irish Academy&#x27;s Clare Island Survey, recording the Irish place names of the island. On 25 February 1911, he delivered the inaugural address on &quot;Academic Education and Practical Politics&quot; to the Legal and Economic Society of University College Dublin.. His disagreements and disputes with Goddard Henry Orpen, particularly over the latter&#x27;s book &quot;Ireland under the Normans&quot;, generated controversy.

He was President of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland from 1937 to 1940 and President of the Royal Irish Academy from 1940 to 1943.

==Later life and death==
He retired from politics completely and became Chair of the Irish Manuscripts Commission. In his later years he devoted his life to scholarship, he published several books on Irish history. MacNeill died in Dublin of natural causes, aged 78 in 1945. He is buried in Kilbarrack Cemetery.

==Legacy==
His grandson Michael McDowell served as Tánaiste, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, TD and a Senator. Another grandson, Myles Tierney, served as a member of Dublin County Council, where he was Fine Gael whip on the council.

<text>Gerard Fitt, Baron Fitt (9 April 1926 – 26 August 2005), was a politician from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was a founder and the first leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), a social democratic and Irish nationalist party.

==Early years==
Fitt was born in Belfast in the Lisburn Road Workhouse to the unmarried Rose Martin on 8 April 1926. He was christened Gerald in the infirmary at the Workhouse by Fr JB Murray, a curate at St Brigid&#x27;s Church. He was subsequently adopted by George and Mary Fitt and assumed their name; however, he changed his first name to Gerard. When he did so is not recorded, but written evidence shows he was using his new name by 1942. He was educated at a local Christian Brothers school. He served in the Merchant Navy as a stoker until 1953, having joined in 1941 during World War II and served on convoy duty. He witnessed the sinking of HMS &quot;Bluebell&quot; from which there was one survivor. His elder brother George, an Irish Guardsman, was killed during the Battle of Normandy.

Living in the nationalist Beechmount neighbourhood of the Falls, he stood for the Falls as a candidate for the Dock Labour Party in a city council by-election in 1956, but lost to Paddy Devlin of the Irish Labour Party, who would later be his close ally. In 1958, he was elected to Belfast City Council as a member of the Irish Labour Party.

==1960s==
In 1962, he won a Stormont seat from the Ulster Unionist Party, becoming the only Irish Labour member. Two years later, he left Irish Labour and joined with Harry Diamond, the sole Socialist Republican Party Stormont MP, to form the Republican Labour Party.

At the 1966 general election, Fitt won the Belfast West seat in the Westminster parliament. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was launched in 1967 with Fitt as a prominent spokesperson for the movement.

He used Westminster as a platform to interest British members of parliament (MPs) in the problems and issues of Northern Ireland. On 28 August 1968, he tabled a House of Commons motion, signed by 60 Labour Party backbenchers, criticising RUC action in Dungannon on 24 August at the first civil rights march in Northern Ireland, demanding that: &quot;citizens of Northern Ireland should be allowed the same rights of peaceful demonstration as those in other parts of the United Kingdom&quot;.

Many sympathetic MPs were present at the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968 when Fitt and others were beaten by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. RTÉ&#x27;s film, in which Fitt featured prominently, of the police baton charge on the peaceful, but illegal, demonstration drew world attention to the claims of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association.

The following year, Fitt announced at a press conference subsequent to the August 1969 rioting in Belfast that disturbance were created by a decision to &quot;take some action to try to draw off the forces engaged in the Bogside area.&quot;

Fitt also supported the 1969 candidacy of Bernadette Devlin in the Mid Ulster by-election who ran as an anti-abstentionist &#x27;Unity&#x27; candidate. Devlin&#x27;s success greatly increased the authority of Fitt in the eyes of many British commentators, particularly as it produced a second voice on the floor of the British House of Commons who challenged the Unionist viewpoint at a time when Harold Wilson and other British ministers were beginning to take notice. In his maiden speech, he called for an inquiry into the unionist government of Northern Ireland.

Fitt was elected as a socialist republican and unveiled a plaque at the house on the Falls Road where James Connolly, the socialist leader of the Irish Easter Rising had lived. He was anxious to build a broader movement that would challenge Unionist hegemony. At the same time, a new generation of Catholics, many with secondary education and university degrees for the first time as a consequence of the post-War creation of the welfare state, were determined to make their voices heard.

==1970s==
In August 1970, Fitt became the first leader of a coalition of civil rights and nationalist leaders who created the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The party was founded on high hopes – rejecting abstentionism and containing a number of prominent Protestants and without the stigma of conservatism and impotency that surrounded the old nationalist party. But already by then Northern Ireland was charging headlong towards near-civil war and the majority of unionists remained hostile.

After the collapse of Stormont in 1972 and the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1973 he became deputy chief executive of the short-lived Power-Sharing Executive created by the Sunningdale Agreement. 1 January 1974 was a historic day with the power-sharing Executive taking office. The years of Unionist single-party rule had come to an end with the SDLP and Alliance parties joining the Executive alongside the Brian Faulkner wing of Unionism. Arguments still rage over the extent to which Fitt, as opposed to John Hume, helped shape the agreement. Fitt certainly was becoming less engaged with the nationalist concerns of the majority of the SDLP.

Within the nationalist community, the Provisionals condemned the powersharing agreement as falling short of British withdrawal and a united Ireland. A majority of Unionists opposed the Sunningdale agreement and the Executive collapsed when confronted by the Ulster Workers Council strike.

The SDLP had developed a political strategy of calling for powersharing within Northern Ireland alongside the adoption of an all-Ireland dimension. Fitt had always seen powersharing as the priority and he felt the calls for an all-Ireland dimension were alienating Unionists while promising little. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Executive, the British Government became less hopeful of achieving powersharing and, as a result, the all-Ireland dimension became the bigger policy priority for the SDLP.

Fitt became increasingly unhappy with what he saw as the SDLP&#x27;s shift towards green nationalism and its emphasis on the all-Ireland dimension. He also became more outspoken in his condemnation of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. He became a target for republican sympathisers in 1976 when they attacked his home.

Fitt became disillusioned with the handling of Northern Ireland by the British government. Labour&#x27;s Northern Ireland Secretary of State Roy Mason spent little time and effort on local political initiatives instead opting for a strategy of criminalisation and attempting to militarily defeat the IRA. This policy shift resulted in growing complaints of mistreatment of prisoners. The minority Labour Government was relying on Unionist votes in Parliament to survive and promised extra Westminster seats for Northern Ireland, which pointed to integration with Britain instead of devolved powersharing as the Government&#x27;s emerging political preference. In 1979, Fitt abstained from a crucial vote in the House of Commons which brought down the Labour government, citing the way that the government had failed to help the nationalist population and tried to form a deal with the Ulster Unionist Party: &quot;under no circumstances will I support the Labour government in a vote of confidence because of the attitude of the Secretary of State and the policies of the government in Northern Ireland&quot;.

As the 1970s were coming to a close, Fitt believed that the SDLP had changed and had become simply a &quot;Catholic nationalist party&quot;. He increasingly felt isolated within the party with &quot;Fortnight&quot;, a Belfast current affairs magazine, describing him at the time as the &quot;only Labour man&quot; left. 

In 1979, Gerry Fitt left the party altogether after he had agreed to constitutional talks with British Secretary of State Humphrey Atkins without any provision for an &#x27;Irish dimension&#x27; and had then seen his decision overturned by the SDLP party conference. Like Paddy Devlin before him, he claimed the SDLP had ceased to be a socialist force.

==1980s==
Gerry Fitt enters the 1980s no longer a member of the SDLP but is still the MP for West Belfast. Politics in nationalist communities were about to change as the prison protests over political status became the hunger strikes and Provisional Sinn Féin make a strategic turn towards electoral politics.

In 1981, Fitt opposed the hunger strikes in the Maze prison in Belfast. In April of that year, he contacted the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) to seek assurances that the British government would not give in to the hunger strikers&#x27; demands for political status. In the Westminster parliament, he urged the Conservative Government &quot;not to make the mistake of granting political status&quot;.

The following month, May 1981, Fitt lost his seat on Belfast City Council to Fergus O&#x27;Hare, a member of the left-wing Peoples Democracy group and a prominent campaigner for political status and rights for the prisoners in the H Blocks. The loss of his seat on Belfast Council where he had been a prominent and long serving member, was to signal the beginning of Gerry Fitt&#x27;s electoral decline.

Fitt&#x27;s seat in Westminster was targeted by Sinn Féin as well as by the SDLP. In June 1983, he lost his seat in Belfast West to Gerry Adams, in part due to competition from an SDLP candidate. Fitt, standing as an Independent Socialist with no party machine behind him and with widespread nationalist criticism over his stance on the H Block hunger strikes, still received over 10,326 votes but he lost the seat to Gerry Adams who polled 16,379 votes with the SDLP&#x27;s Joe Hendron coming second with 10,934 votes.

The following month, on 14 October 1983, he was created a UK life peer as Baron Fitt, of Bell&#x27;s Hill in the County of Down. (The Fitt family were evacuated to Bell&#x27;s Hill during the Belfast Blitz.) His Belfast Antrim Road home, close to the republican New Lodge, was firebombed a month after he was made a peer and he moved to live in London.

==Later career==
In his later life he was an active member of the House of Lords, where he was strongly critical of some aspects of the political developments of Northern Ireland. Until the appointment of Margaret Ritchie in 2019 he was unique in that he was the only nationalist or republican from Northern Ireland to have been elevated to the House of Lords.

==Political beliefs==
Although Fitt was initially considered a nationalist politician, his career often defied the traditional terms used for the discussion of Northern Irish politics. He sometimes said that he considered himself first and foremost a socialist politician rather than a nationalist. For example, on 11 October 1974 he stated, &quot;In Northern Ireland it is very difficult to be a socialist without being labelled a Unionist socialist or an anti-partitionist socialist, but I am a socialist...&quot;.

==Death==
Lord Fitt died on 26 August 2005, at the age of 79, after a long history of heart disease, a widower survived by five of his daughters, one having predeceased him. When his daughters had campaigned for him in elections, they were nicknamed &#x27;the Miss Fitts&#x27;.

<text>Georges de Scudéry (; 22 August 1601 – 14 May 1667), the elder brother of Madeleine de Scudéry, was a French novelist, dramatist and poet.

==Life==
Georges de Scudéry was born in Le Havre, in Normandy, whither his father had moved from Provence. He served in the army for some time, and, though in the vein of gasconading which was almost peculiar to him he no doubt exaggerated his services, there seems little doubt that he was a stout soldier.

He conceived a fancy for literature before he was thirty, and during the whole of the middle of the century he was one of the most characteristic figures of Paris. He gained the favour of Richelieu by his opposition to Corneille. He wrote a letter to the &quot;Académie française&quot; criticizing &quot;Le Cid&quot;, and his play, &quot;L&#x27;Amour tyrannique&quot; (1640), was patronized by the cardinal in opposition to Corneille.

Possibly these circumstances had something to do with his appointment as governor of the fortress of Notre-Dame de la Garde, near Marseille in 1643, and in 1650 he was elected to the &quot;Académie&quot;. During the troubles of the Fronde he was exiled to Normandy, where he made his fortune by a rich marriage. He was an industrious dramatist, but &quot;L&#x27;Amour tyrannique&quot; is practically the only piece among his numerous tragi-comedies and pastorals that has escaped oblivion. His other most famous work was the epic of &quot;Alaric&quot; (1659). He lent his name to his sister&#x27;s first romances, but did little beyond correcting the proofs.

Scudéry&#x27;s swashbuckler affectations were rather exaggerated by literary gossip and tradition. Although possibly not quite sane, he had some poetical power, a fervent love of literature, a high sense of honour and of friendship.

Scudéry also wrote CURIA POLITIAE, OR, THE APOLOGIES OF SEVERALL PRINCES: Justifying to the WORLD Their Most Eminent Actions&quot;, which had been translated into English and printed by Humphrey Moseley &quot;at the sign of the Prince&#x27;s-Arms, in St. Paul&#x27;s Church-Yard&quot;, in 1654.

Georges de Scudéry was sketched by Théophile Gautier in his &quot;Grotesques&quot;.

<doc id="287119" wikidata="Q55037230" url="?curid=287119" title="Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis">
<text>Caroline-Stéphanie-Félicité, Madame de Genlis (25 January 1746 – 31 December 1830) was a French writer of the late 18th and early 19th century, known for her novels and theories of children&#x27;s education. She is now best remembered for her journals and the historical perspective they provide on her life and times.

==Life==

Caroline-Stéphanie-Félicité du Crest de Saint-Aubin was born on 25 April 1746 at Champcéry near Autun, in the Saône-et-Loire region. Her parents were Pierre César du Crest (1711–1763), later Marquis de Saint Aubin, and Marie Françoise Félicité Mauget de Mézières (1717–1790).

Her father&#x27;s debts forced him to sell their home in 1757 and move to Paris. She and her mother spent interludes at the estates of Charles Guillaume Le Normant d&#x27;Étiolles and Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière, where she was taught dancing by a ballet master of the Comédie-Française and singing by Ferdinando Pellegrini. She also learned to play the harp, a skill which later in Paris she used to support them. Pierre César was captured by the English while returning from Santo Domingo in 1760 and one of his fellow prisoners was Charles-Alexis Brûlart, Comte de Genlis (1737–1793), whom he introduced to his daughter after their release. After Pierre died in 1763, his sister married de Genlis at midnight on 8 November 1763; as a younger son, his title &#x27;Comte&#x27; was complimentary and she was always known as Madame de Genlis.

In 1782 she published her first epistolary novel &quot;Adèle et Thèodore&quot; written while on holiday in Lusignano in Liguria. Its basic theme is education, where she takes a position unlike Rousseau in &quot;Emile&quot;. For her the condition of women depends on the education that is imparted to take the role that belongs to her in society, while for Jean-Jacques Rousseau the sphere of female action is restricted to the domestic sphere and therefore their education remains limited; for Genlis, education represents a step forward for her emancipation but on the other hand she submits first to the will of her mother and then of her husband. The success of this novel was due to the fact that she is the first woman to be &quot;gouverneur&quot; of princes of royal blood.

Since Charles-Alexis&#x27; own parents were dead, they went to live with his godfather, the Marquis de Puisieux and had three children; Caroline (1765–1786), Pulchérie (1767–1847) and Casimir (1768–1773). It is possible that she also had one or more secret offspring; as Talleyrand later wrote: &quot;In spite of the strictness which she preached and the morality which she professed in her writing, one always meets in her later novels something of the easiness of her earlier morals; one always finds in them love affairs and illegitimate children.&quot;

She died in Paris on 31 December 1830 and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Career==
Her relative, Madame de Montesson (1738-1806), was also known for her beauty and intelligence, later becoming a playwright. She married the duc d&#x27;Orléans in 1773, although barred from using the title &#x27;Duchess of Orléans.&#x27; With her support, Stéphanie-Félicité became lady-in-waiting to Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, wife of the Duke&#x27;s son Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Chartres, and with her husband joined the Duke&#x27;s entourage in the Palais-Royal in early 1772, drawing a stipend of 10,000 livres.

She began an affair with Chartres almost immediately, their love letters being published in 1904 by Gaston Maugras as &quot;L’idylle d’un gouverneur.&quot; As Talleyrand noted, &quot;The Duc de Chartres found her charming, told her this, and was quickly listened to, for Madame de Genlis, to avoid the scandal of coquetry, always yielded easily.&quot; Although their affair was short-lived, in 1777 he appointed her governess to his daughters, who were joined by two &#x27;adopted&#x27; English girls, Stephanie Caroline Anne Syms or &quot;Pamela&quot; and Hermine Syms. This was in line with her theory of educating her pupils with children of different nationalities to better learn foreign languages; the household already contained English and Italian servants. Although it has often been suggested Pamela was the product of her relationship with Chartres, this has been challenged by recent scholarship. In 1781, Chartres took the then unusual step of putting her in charge of his sons&#x27; education, which led to the resignation of their existing tutors; she and Charles-Alexis formally separated the following year. 

For her husband&#x27;s amusement, Madame de Montesson set up their own theatre, for which she and Madame de Genlis wrote plays, the parts being taken by their children. Audiences numbered as many as 500 aristocrats and writers, including Diderot and D&#x27;Alembert. This developed her approach to education, later set out in &quot;Théâtre d&#x27;éducation&quot; (4 vols., 1779–1780), a collection of short comedies for young people, &quot;Les Annales de la vertu&quot; (2 vols., 1781) and &quot;Adèle et Théodore&quot; (3 vols., 1782). Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve claims she anticipated many modern methods of teaching; history was taught using magic lantern slides and her pupils learnt botany from a botanist during their walks.

In 1785, Chartres succeeded as duc d&#x27;Orléans; her brother Charles-Louis Ducrest became his secretary. When the French Revolution began in 1789, both he and Charles-Alexis joined the Girondins faction and were executed in 1793 with many of their political colleagues. Stéphanie-Félicité and her pupil Mademoiselle d&#x27;Orléans took refuge in Switzerland, before moving to Berlin in 1794. Considered too liberal by Frederick William II, she was forced to live in Hamburg but returned when his son succeeded him in 1797. 

After Napoleon came to power in 1799, she returned to France. Her aunt was a close friend of Napoleon&#x27;s wife Joséphine de Beauharnais and this connection resulted in her being given rooms at the Arsenal and a small pension. Her best known romance &quot;Mademoiselle de Clermont&quot; was published in 1802, along with a number of other novels. Her government pension was discontinued after the 1814 Bourbon Restoration; her former pupil Louis Philippe gave her a small pension but she relied on the income from her writing.

Her later years were occupied with literary quarrels, notably those arising from her 1822 publication &quot;Diners du Baron d&#x27;Holbach&quot;, which attacked what she viewed as &#x27;the intolerance, fanaticism, and eccentricities of the &quot;philosophes&quot; of the 18th century.&#x27; She survived long enough to see her former pupil, Louis Philippe, become king in 1830. The vast majority of her works are now little read but provide interesting historical background, especially &quot;Mémoires inédits sur le XVIII&#x27; siècle&quot;, published in 1825.

==Legacy==
In Britain, she was best known for her children&#x27;s works, which many welcomed as they presented many of Rousseau&#x27;s methods, while attacking his principles. They also avoided libertinism and Roman Catholicism, concepts often associated with the French by the British, who appreciated her innovative educational methods, particularly her morality plays. According to Magdi Wahba, another reason for her popularity was the belief she was as moral as the Baronne d&#x27;Almane in &quot;Adèle et Théodore&quot;. They discovered this was not the case when she fled to London in 1791 but while she lost the esteem of some, including Frances Burney, it had little effect on her book sales.

Jane Austen was familiar with her works, although she returned the novel &#x27;Alphonsine&#x27; to the Lending Library, claiming it &quot;did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as, independent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so pure&quot;. However, in &quot;Emma&quot; her heroine suggests her governess would raise her own daughter the better for having practised upon her, &quot;like La Baronne d&#x27;Almane on La Countesse d&#x27;Ostalis in Madame de Genlis&#x27; Adelaide and Theodore&quot;. Modern critics claim other themes addressed by Genlis appear in both &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;. Austen continued to read (and lend out) her works however, complaining in 1816 for example that she couldn&#x27;t &quot;read &quot;Olimpe et Theophile&quot; without being in a rage. It is really too bad! – Not allowing them to be happy together when they &quot;are&quot; married.&quot; Austen&#x27;s nieces Anna and Caroline also drew inspiration for their own writings from Madame de Genlis.

British women writers of the late eighteenth century were particularly inspired by Genlis&#x27;s novel of education &quot;Adèle et Théodore&quot;, which Anna Letitia Barbauld compared to Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Emile&quot; as a type of &quot;preceptive fiction.&quot; Anna Barbauld admired Genlis&#x27;s &quot;system of education, the whole of which is given in action&quot; with &quot;infinite ingenuity in the various illustrative incidents.&quot; Clara Reeve described Genlis&#x27;s educational program as &quot;the most perfect of any&quot; in &quot;Plans of Education&quot; (1794), an epistolary work loosely based on Genlis&#x27;s novel. Adelaide O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;Dudley&quot;(1819) was modeled directly after Genlis&#x27;s work, and other texts such as Anna Letitia Barbauld and John Aikin&#x27;s &quot;Evenings at Home&quot; were inspired by Genlis&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Castle&quot;, a &quot;spin-off&quot; of &quot;Adèle et Théodore&quot;. As Donelle Ruwe notes, Genlis&#x27;s emphasis on the mother as a powerful educating heroine was inspirational, but so too were her books&#x27; demonstrations of how to create homemade literacy objects such as flash cards and other teaching aids.

==In literature==
Félicité de Genlis appears as a character in the works of Honoré de Balzac (&quot;Illusions perdues&quot;) and Victor Hugo (&quot;Les Misérables&quot;), among others. She is also mentioned in &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy, &quot;Our Village&quot; by Mary Russell Mitford, &quot;Oblomov&quot; by Ivan Goncharov, humourist story &quot;M-me Genlis&#x27;s spirit&quot; by Nikolai Leskov, &quot;The Angel in the House&quot; by Coventry Patmore, &quot;The Rector of Justin&quot; by Louis Auchincloss, &quot;Nausea&quot; by Jean-Paul Sartre, &quot;Emma&quot; by Jane Austen, and &quot;A Place of Greater Safety&quot; by Hilary Mantel.

==Selected works==
Madame de Genlis was a prodigious author. As Saint-Beuve observed in one of his &quot;Causeries de Lundi&quot;, &quot;if the inkstand had not existed, she would have invented it.&quot;

*Genlis, Stéphanie Félicité du Crest de Saint Aubin, Madame de GENLIS (1746-1830) Correspondance en grande partie inédite adressée par Madame de Genlis à M. Anatole de Montesquiou (1788-1878), officier d&#x27;ordonnance de l&#x27;Empereur et aide de camp. L&#x27;ensemble des lettres, au nombre de 520 environ, couvre la période 1810 à 1830, mais surtout les années 1825 et 1826. L&#x27;année 1826 représente une correspondance presque journalière comme novembre et décembre 1825. Cette correspondance est parfois très intime, Madame de Genlis appelle d&#x27;ailleurs M. de Montesquiou : &quot;Mon cher Anatole&quot;, elle est aussi très en relation avec les idées et les choses du temps. Elle parle beaucoup de magnétisme, de religion, d&#x27;éducation bien sûr mais aussi de personnages tels que Voltaire, Talma ou Madame Récamier. Chaque lettre est généralement signée et comporte une à deux pages in-4 avec adresse. On trouve dans l&#x27;année 1820 un petit manuscrit de 30 pages intitulé &quot;Cantique des fleurs&quot; fait pour Pulchérie, sa fille(1830). La correspondance d’Anatole de Montesquiou à Madame de Genlis est , elle, conservée aux Archives Nationales.

<text>&quot;Charlotte&quot;-Jeanne Béraud de La Haye de Riou (4 October 1738 – 6 February 1806) was a mistress to Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans, and ultimately, his wife; however, Louis XV would not allow her to become the Duchess. She wrote and acted in several plays. She is known simply as &quot;Madame de Montesson&quot;.

==Life==

&quot;Charlotte&quot;-Jeanne Béraud de La Haye de Riou was born in Paris of an old Breton family.

On 11 October 1757, she married the seventy-year-old widower Jean Baptiste, Marquis of Montesson, who died in 1769. Her beauty and intelligence attracted the attention of the widowed Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, &quot;the fat&quot; (his wife Louise Henriette de Bourbon had died in 1759), whom she secretly married in 1773 with the authorisation of Louis XV of France. After her marriage to the Duke of Orléans, a member of the royal family and a &quot;Prince du Sang&quot;, her low rank did not allow her the title of &quot;Duchess of Orléans&quot;.

For her husband&#x27;s amusement and her own, she set up a little theater and wrote several plays, in the acting of which she herself took part.

She was arrested on 20 April 1793 (&quot;1 floréal an II&quot; of the Republican calendar) during the Terror, and first imprisoned in the &quot;La Force&quot; prison in Paris. She was released on 28 September 1794 (after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre), befriended Joséphine de Beauharnais, and was a prominent figure at the beginning of the empire.

===Works===
The best edition of her works appeared under the title of &quot;Œuvres anonymes&quot; in 1782–1785. See Charles Collé, &quot;Journal&quot; (1868); the &quot;Memoirs of St Simon, Madame de Genlis, the duchesse d&#x27;Abrantes and Mme de Levis&quot;; G Strenger, &quot;La Société de la marquise de Montesson,&quot; in the &quot;Nouvelle revue&quot; (1902); J Turquan, &quot;Madame de Montesson douairière d&#x27;Orléans&quot; (Paris, 1904); and G.

<text>The Piper PA-23, named Apache and later Aztec, is an American four- to six-seat twin-engined light aircraft aimed at the general aviation market. The United States Navy and military forces in other countries also used it in small numbers. Originally designed as the Twin Stinson in the 1950s by the Stinson Aircraft Company, Piper Aircraft manufactured the Apache and a more powerful version, the Aztec, in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s.

==Design and development==
The PA-23 was the first twin-engined Piper aircraft, and was developed from a proposed &quot;Twin Stinson&quot; design, inherited when Piper bought the Stinson Division of the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation. The prototype PA-23 was a four-seat, low-wing, all-metal monoplane with a twin tail, powered by two 125 hp Lycoming O-290-D piston engines; it first flew on March 2, 1952. The aircraft performed poorly, so it was redesigned with a single vertical stabilizer and an all-metal rear fuselage and more powerful 150 hp Lycoming O-320-A engines.

===Apache===
(ICAO code: PA23)

Two new prototypes of the redesigned aircraft, now named Apache, were built in 1953 and entered production in 1954; 1,231 were built. In 1958, the Apache 160 was produced by upgrading the engines to 160 hp (119 kW); 816 were built.
The Apache 160 was superseded in 1962 by the Aztec-derived Apache 235. With a 1962 price of $45,000, the Apache 235 featured the Aztec&#x27;s 235 hp (175 kW) engines and swept tail surfaces (119 built).

===Aztec===
(ICAO code: PA27)

In 1959, Piper produced an upgraded version with 250 hp (186 kW) Lycoming O-540 engines and a swept vertical tail as the PA-23-250, and named it Aztec. The first models came in a five-seat configuration. In 1961, a longer-nosed variant, the Aztec B, entered production. Later Aztecs were equipped with Lycoming IO-540 fuel-injected engines and six-seat capacity, and remained in production until 1982. Turbocharged versions of the later models could fly at higher altitudes.

The United States Navy acquired 20 Aztecs, designating them UO-1, which changed to U-11A when unified designations were adopted in 1962.

In 1974, Piper produced a single experimental PA-41P Pressurized Aztec concept. This concept was short-lived, however, as the aspects of the Aztec that made it so popular for its spacious interior and ability to haul large loads did not lend themselves well to supporting the sealed pressure vessel required for a pressurized aircraft. The project was scrapped, and the one pressurized Aztec produced, N9941P, was donated to Mississippi State University, where it was used for testing purposes. In 2000, N9941P was donated to the Piper Aviation Museum in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, on the condition that it never be flown again. It is now there on display.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 21 March 1964, a Piper PA-23-160 Apache (G-ASHC) crashed on its approach to the Aintree racecourse, near Liverpool, England, killing all 5 on board. The flight had taken off from Luton Airport and included broadcaster Nancy Spain, who was covering the Grand National, and her friend Joan Werner Laurie, who was learning to fly. The CAA accident report stated that passenger interference could not be ruled out as a cause of the accident.
*On 18 July 1967, Aztec C &quot;PP-ETT&quot; was hit by a Lockheed T-33 of the Brazilian Air Force near Mondubim, Brazil, killing former Brazilian President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco. 
*On 18 April 1974, Aztec &quot;G-AYDE&quot; collided with Court Line Flight 95, a BAC One-Eleven, at London Luton Airport after the pilot of the Aztec entered the active runway without clearance. He was killed and his passenger was injured. All 91 people on board the One-Eleven successfully evacuated after the takeoff was aborted.
*On 29 November 1975, retired Formula One racing driver and Embassy Hill team owner Graham Hill was piloting a Piper PA-23-250 Turbo Aztec D, marked as N6645Y, from Circuit Paul Ricard, France, to London, United Kingdom. His passengers were Embassy Hill race driver Tony Brise, team manager Ray Brimble, designer Andy Smallman, and mechanics Terry Richards and Tony Alcock. While on approach to land at Elstree Airfield, Hertfordshire, shortly before 10 pm, the aircraft hit trees on a golf course at Arkley, Hertfordshire in thick fog. The ensuing crash and explosion killed everyone on board.
*On 15 April 1978, Hollywood stunt flyer Frank Tallman was ferrying a Piper Aztec from Santa Monica Airport, California, to Phoenix, Arizona under visual flight rules when he continued the flight into deteriorating weather, a lowering ceiling, and rain. He struck the side of Santiago Peak in the Santa Ana Mountains near Trabuco Canyon at cruise altitude, dying in the ensuing crash.

<text>The Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (RFK Bridge; also known by its previous name, the Triborough Bridge) is a complex of bridges and elevated expressway viaducts in New York City. The bridges link the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. The viaducts cross Randalls and Wards Islands, previously two islands and now joined by landfill.

The RFK Bridge, a toll bridge, carries Interstate 278 (I-278) as well as the unsigned highway New York State Route 900G. It connects with the FDR Drive and the Harlem River Drive in Manhattan, the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) and the Major Deegan Expressway (Interstate 87) in the Bronx, and the Grand Central Parkway (I-278) and Astoria Boulevard in Queens. The three primary bridges of the RFK Bridge complex are:
* The vertical-lift bridge over the Harlem River, the largest in the world, connecting Manhattan Island to Randalls Island (all within Manhattan)
* The truss bridge over Bronx Kill, connecting Randalls Island to the Bronx
* The suspension bridge over Hell Gate (a strait of the East River), connecting Wards Island to Astoria in Queens

These three bridges are connected by an elevated highway viaduct across Randalls and Wards Islands and of support roads. The viaduct includes a smaller span across the former site of Little Hell Gate, which separated Randalls and Wards Islands. Also part of the complex is a grade-separated T-interchange on Randalls Island, which sorted out traffic in a way that ensured that drivers paid a toll at only one bank of tollbooths. The tollbooths have since been removed, and all tolls are collected electronically at the approaches to each bridge.

The bridge complex was designed by Allston Dana with the collaboration of Othmar Ammann and architect Aymar Embury II, and has been called &quot;not a bridge so much as a traffic machine, the largest ever built&quot;. The American Society of Civil Engineers designated the Triborough Bridge Project as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1986. The bridge is owned and operated by MTA Bridges and Tunnels (formally the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, or TBTA), an affiliate of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

==Description==
The RFK Bridge is made of four segments. The three primary spans traverse the East River to Queens; the Harlem River to Manhattan; and Bronx Kill to the Bronx, while the fourth is a T-shaped approach viaduct that leads to an interchange plaza between the three primary spans on Randalls Island. The Queens arm of the viaduct formerly crossed Little Hell Gate, a creek located between Randalls Island to the north and Wards Island to the south. Excluding elevated ramps, the segments are a total of long, with a span between the Bronx and Queens, and a span between Manhattan and the interchange plaza. In total, the bridge contains of roadway, including elevated ramps.

The bridge was primarily designed by chief engineer Othmar H. Ammann and architect Aymar Embury II. Wharton Green served as the Public Works Administration (PWA)&#x27;s resident engineer for the project.

===East River suspension bridge (I-278)===

The East River span, a suspension bridge across the Hell Gate of the East River, connects Queens with Wards Island. It carries eight lanes of Interstate 278, four in each direction, as well as a sidewalk on the northeastern side. The span connects to Grand Central Parkway, and indirectly to the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (I-278), in Astoria, Queens. Originally it connected to the intersection of 25th Avenue and 31st Street; the former was later renamed Hoyt Avenue. The suspension span was designed by chief engineer Othmar Ammann. The span was originally designed to be double-decked, with eight lanes on each deck. When the construction of the Triborough Bridge was paused in 1932 due to lack of funding, the suspension span was downsized to a single deck. There are Warren trusses on each side of the span, which stiffen the deck.

The center span between the two suspension towers is long, and the side spans between the suspension towers and the anchorages are each long. The total length of the bridge is , and the deck is wide. The columns under the Wards Island approach roadway were originally placed atop 400,000 steel ball bearings, allowing the roadway to move sideways by up to in either direction.

At mean high water, the towers are tall, and there is of clearance under the middle of the main span. The suspension towers were originally designed by Arthur I. Perry. Each tower was supposed to have two ornate arches at the top, similar to the Brooklyn Bridge, and was to have been supported by four legs: two on the outside and two in the center. A 1932 article described that each tower would be made of 5,000 tons of material, including 3,680 tons of steel. The final design of the suspension towers, by Ammann, consists of comparatively simple cross bracing supported by two legs. The tops of each tower contain cast iron saddles in the Art Deco style, over which the bridge&#x27;s main cables run. These are topped by decorative lanterns with red aircraft warning lights.

The span is supported by two main cables, which suspend the deck and are held up by the suspension towers. Each cable is in diameter and contains of individual wires. Each main cable is composed of 37 strands of 248 wires, for a total of 9,176 wires in each cable. The wires are fastened together by &quot;strand shoes&quot;, placed at regular intervals. At the Wards Island and Astoria ends of the suspension span, there are two anchorages that hold the main cables. The anchorages contain a combined 133,500 tons of concrete. There are also bents atop each anchorage, which conceal the ends of each main cable.

===Harlem River lift bridge (NY 900G)===

The Harlem River span is a lift bridge that connects Manhattan with Randalls Island, designed by chief engineer Ammann. It carries six lanes of New York State Route 900G (NY 900G), an unsigned reference route, as well as two sidewalks, one on each side. The span connects to FDR Drive and Harlem River Drive, as well as the intersection of Second Avenue and East 125th Street, in East Harlem, Manhattan. At the time of its completion, the Harlem River lift bridge had the largest deck of any lift bridge in the world, with a surface area of . To lighten the deck, it was made of asphalt paved onto steel girders, rather than of concrete.

The movable span is long and wide. The side spans between the movable span and the approach viaducts are each long. The total length of the bridge is . The towers are above mean high water. Each of the lift towers is supported by two clusters of four columns, which supports the bridge deck. A curved truss at the top of each pair of column clusters forms an arch directly underneath the deck.

The lift span is above mean high water in the &quot;closed&quot; position, but can be raised to . The movable section is suspended by a total of 96 wire ropes, which are wrapped around pulleys with diameters. These pulleys, in turn, are powered by four motors that can operate at .

====Exit list====
NY 900G is officially maintained as a north–south route, despite its largely east-west progression. 


===Bronx Kill crossing (I-278)===
The Bronx Kill span is a truss bridge that connects the Bronx with Randalls Island. It carries eight lanes of I-278, as well as two sidewalks, one on each side. The span connects to Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) and the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) in Mott Haven, Bronx. It originally connected to the intersection of East 134th Street and Cypress Avenue, a site now occupied by the interchange between I-87 and I-278. The truss span was designed by consulting engineers Ash-Howard-Needles and Tammen.

The Bronx Kill span contains three main truss crossings, which are fixed spans because the Bronx Kill is not used by regular boat traffic. The main truss span across the Bronx Kill is long, while the approaches are a combined . The total length of the bridge is . The truss span is above mean high water.

===Interchange plaza and approach viaducts===
The three spans of the RFK Bridge intersect at a grade-separated T-interchange on Randalls Island. The span to Manhattan intersects perpendicularly with the I-278 viaduct between the Bronx and Queens spans. Although I-278 is signed as a west-east highway, the orientation of I-278 on the bridge is closer to a north-south alignment, with the southbound roadway carrying westbound traffic, and the northbound roadway carrying eastbound traffic. Two circular ramps carry traffic to and from eastbound I-278 and the RFK lift bridge to Manhattan. Randalls and Wards Islands are accessed via exits and entrances to and from westbound I-278; to and from the westbound lift bridge viaduct; to eastbound I-278; and from the eastbound lift bridge viaduct. Eastbound traffic on I-278 accesses the island by first exiting onto the lift bridge viaduct.

The interchange plaza originally contained two tollbooths: one for traffic traveling to and from Manhattan, and one for traffic traveling on I-278 between the Bronx and Queens. The tollbooths were arranged so vehicles only paid one toll upon entering Randalls and Wards Islands, and there was no charge to exit the island. The elevated toll plazas had a surface area of about and were supported by 1,700 columns, all hidden behind a concrete retaining wall. In 2017, the MTA started collecting all tolls electronically at the approaches to each bridge, and the tollbooths were removed from the toll plazas on the RFK Bridge and all other MTA Bridges and Tunnels crossings.

The Robert Moses Administration Building, a two-story Art Deco structure designed by Embury, served as the headquarters of the TBTA (now the MTA&#x27;s Bridges and Tunnels division). The building was next to the Manhattan span&#x27;s plaza, to which it was connected. In 1969, the Manhattan span&#x27;s toll plaza was moved west and the I-278 toll plaza was moved south, and both toll plazas were expanded more than threefold. This required the destruction of the building&#x27;s original towers. A room was built in 1966 to store Moses&#x27;s models and blueprints of planned roads and crossings, but they were moved to the MTA&#x27;s headquarters at 2 Broadway in the 1980s. The building was renamed after Moses in 1989.

The interchange plaza connects with the over-water spans via a three-legged concrete viaduct that has a total length of more than . The segments of the viaduct rest atop steel girders, which in turn are placed perpendicularly between concrete piers spaced apart. Each pier is supported by a set of three octagonal columns. The viaduct is mostly eight lanes wide, except at the former locations of the toll plazas, where it widens. The viaduct once traversed Little Hell Gate, a small creek that formerly separated Randalls Island to the north and Wards Island to the south; the waterway has since been filled in. The viaduct rose above the mean high water of Little Hell Gate.

==Development==
===Planning===

==== Initial plans ====
Edward A. Byrne, chief engineer of the New York City Department of Plant and Structures, first announced plans for connecting Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx in 1916. The next year, the Harlem Boards of Trade and Commerce and the Harlem Luncheon Association announced their support for such a bridge, which was proposed to cost $10 million. The &quot;Tri-Borough Bridge&quot;, as it was called, would connect 125th Street in Manhattan, St. Ann&#x27;s Avenue in the Bronx, and an as-yet-undetermined location in Queens. It would parallel the Hell Gate Bridge, a railroad bridge connecting Queens and the Bronx via Randalls and Wards Islands. Plans for the Tri-Borough Bridge were bolstered by the 1919 closure of a ferry between Yorkville in Manhattan and Astoria in Queens.

A bill to construct the bridge was proposed in the New York State Legislature in 1920. Gustav Lindenthal, who had designed the Hell Gate Bridge, criticized the Tri-Borough plan as &quot;uncalled for&quot;, as the new Tri-Borough Bridge would parallel the existing Hell Gate Bridge. He stated that the Hell Gate Bridge could be retrofitted with an upper deck for vehicular and pedestrian use. Queens borough president Maurice K. Connolly also opposed the bridge, arguing that there was no need to construct a span between Queens and the Bronx due to low demand. Connolly also said that a bridge between Queens and Manhattan needed to be built further downstream, closer to the Queensboro Bridge, which at the time was the only bridge between the two boroughs.

The Port of New York Authority included the proposed Tri-Borough Bridge in a report to the New York state legislature in 1921. The following year, the planned bridge was also included in a &quot;transit plan&quot; published by Mayor John Francis Hylan, who called for the construction of the Tri-Borough Bridge as part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (see ). In March 1923, a vote was held on whether to allocate money to perform surveys and test borings, as well as create structural plans for the Tri-Borough Bridge. The borough presidents of Manhattan and the Bronx voted for the allocation of the funds, while the presidents of Queens and Staten Island agreed with Hylan, who preferred the construction of the new subway system instead of the Tri-Borough Bridge. The bridge allocation was ultimately not approved. Another attempt at obtaining funds was declined in 1924, although there was a possibility that the bridge could be built based on assessment plans that were being procured.

==== Funding ====
The Tri-Borough Bridge project finally received funding in June 1925, when the city appropriated $50,000 for surveys, test borings and structural plans. Work started on a tentative design for the bridge. By December 1926, the $50,000 allotment had been spent on bores. Around the same time, the proposal to convert the Hell Gate Bridge resurfaced. Albert Goldman, the Commissioner of Plant and Structures, had finished a tentative report for the Tri-Borough Bridge by that time; however, it was not immediately submitted to the New York City Board of Estimate as a result of a reorganization of the city&#x27;s proposed budget. Goldman finally published the report in March 1927, stating that the bridge was estimated to cost $24.6 million. He explained that the Hell Gate Bridge only had enough space for five lanes of roadway, so a new bridge would have to be constructed parallel to it.

Though two mayoral committees endorsed the Tri-Borough plan, as did several merchants&#x27; associations, construction was delayed for a year because of a lack of funds. The Board of Estimate did approve $150,000 in May 1927 for preliminary borings and soundings. That September, a group of entrepreneurs proposed to fund the bridge privately. Under this plan, the bridge would be set up as a toll bridge, and ownership would be transferred to the city once the bridge was paid for. In August 1928, Mayor Jimmy Walker received a similar proposal from the Long Island Board of Commerce to build the Tri-Borough Bridge using $32 million of private capital. The Queens Chamber of Commerce also favored setting up tolls on the bridge to pay for its construction. Yet another plan called for financing the bridge using proceeds from a bond issue, which would also pay for the proposed Queens–Midtown Tunnel.

The Tri-Borough Bridge was being planned in conjunction with the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, which would create a continuous highway between the Bronx and Brooklyn with a southward extension over The Narrows to Staten Island. In January 1929, New York City aldermanic president Joseph V. McKee endorsed the bridge, saying there was enough funding to begin one of four proposed bridges on the expressway&#x27;s route. The newly elected borough president of Queens, George U. Harvey, also endorsed the bridge, as did Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce leader George Vincent McLaughlin. Trade groups petitioned Mayor Walker to take up the bridge&#x27;s construction. By the end of the month, Walker acquiesced, and he had included both the Tri-Borough Bridge and a tunnel under the Narrows in his 10-year traffic program. The preliminary borings were completed by late February 1929. The results of the preliminary borings showed that the bedrock in the ground underneath the proposed bridge was sufficient to support the spans&#x27; foundations.

In early March, the Board of Estimate voted to start construction on the bridge and on the Narrows tunnel once funding was obtained. The same month, the board allocated $3 million toward the bridge&#x27;s construction. Separately, the Board of Estimate voted to create an authority to impose toll charges on both crossings. In April 1929, the New York state legislature voted to approve the Tri-Borough Bridge as well as a prison on Rikers Island before adjourning for the fiscal year. The same month, New York state governor Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill to approve the move of about 700 beds in Wards Island&#x27;s mental hospital, which were in the way of the proposed bridge&#x27;s suspension span to Queens. The New York state legislature later approved a bill that provided for moving the Queens span&#x27;s Wards Island end, to the west, thereby preserving hospital buildings from demolition.

==== Finalization of plans ====

The bridge was ultimately planned to cost $24 million and was planned to start construction in August 1929. By July, the groundbreaking was scheduled for September. The preliminary Triborough Bridge proposal comprised four bridges: a suspension span across the East River to Queens; a truss span across Bronx Kill to the Bronx; a fixed span across the Harlem River to Manhattan; and a steel arch viaduct across the no-longer-extant Little Hell Gate between Randalls and Wards Islands.

In August 1929, plans for the bridge were submitted to the United States Department of War for approval to ensure that the proposed Tri-Borough Bridge would not block any maritime navigation routes. Railroad and shipping groups objected that the proposed Harlem River span, with a height of above mean high water, was too short for most ships, and suggested building a suspension span over the Harlem River instead. Because of complaints about maritime navigational clearance, the Department of War approved an increase in the Harlem River fixed bridge&#x27;s height to , as well as an increase in the length of the Hell Gate suspension bridge&#x27;s main span from .

=== Initial construction ===
The scale of the Triborough Bridge project, including its approaches, was such that hundreds of large apartment buildings were demolished to make way for it. The structure used concrete from factories &quot;from Maine to the Mississippi&quot;, and steel from 50 mills in Pennsylvania. To make the formwork for pouring the concrete, a forest&#x27;s worth of trees on the Pacific Coast was cut down. Robert Caro, the author of a biography on Long Island State Parks commissioner and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman Robert Moses, wrote about the project:Triborough was not a bridge so much as a traffic machine, the largest ever built. The amount of human energy expended in its construction gives some idea of its immensity: more than five thousand men would be working at the site, and these men would only be putting into place the materials furnished by the labor of many times five thousand men; before the Triborough Bridge was completed, its construction would have generated more than 31,000,000 man-hours of work in 134 cities in twenty states.

==== First contracts ====
The Board of Estimate approved the first contracts for the Triborough Bridge in early October 1929, specifically for the construction bridge piers on Randalls and Wards Islands and in Queens. This allowed for the start of construction on the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s suspension span to Queens. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in Astoria Park, Queens, on October 25, 1929, just a day after Black Thursday, which started the Great Depression. Mayor Walker turned over the first spadeful of dirt for the bridge in front of 10,000 visitors. After the groundbreaking ceremony, further construction was delayed because the company originally contracted to build the piers, the Albert A. Volk Company, refused to carry out the contract. In early December, the contract for the piers was reassigned to the McMullen Company. Meanwhile, the Board was condemning the land in the path of the bridge&#x27;s approaches. However, this process was also postponed because homeowners wanted to sell their property to the city at exceedingly high prices.

The War Department gave its approval to the Bronx Kills, East River, and Little Hell Gate spans in late April 1930, after construction was already underway on the Queens suspension span across the East River. A week later, the War Department also approved the Harlem River span, with another amendment: the span was now a movable lift bridge, which could be raised to allow maritime traffic to pass. Shortly afterward, a special mayoral committee sanctioned a $5 million expenditure for the Triborough project, and in July 1930, a $5 million bond issue to fund the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s construction was passed.

Plans for an expressway to connect to the bridge&#x27;s Queens end were also filed in July 1930. This later became the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, which was connected to the bridge via the Grand Central Parkway. There were also proposals for an expressway to connect to the Bronx end of the bridge along Southern Boulevard. Robert Moses, the Long Island state parks commissioner, wanted to expand Grand Central Parkway from its western terminus at the time, Union Turnpike in Kew Gardens, Queens, northwest to the proposed bridge. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway proposal, which would create a highway from the Queens end of the bridge to Queens Boulevard in Woodside, Queens, was also considered.

A contract to build the suspension anchorage on Wards Island was awarded in January 1931. At the time, progress on the bridge approaches was proceeding rapidly, and it was expected that the entire Triborough Bridge complex would be completed in 1934. By August 1931, it was reported that the Wards Island anchorage was 33% completed, and that the corresponding anchorage on the Queens side was 15% completed. Work on drainage dikes, as well as contracts for bridge approach piers, were also progressing. A report the next month indicated that the overall project was 6% completed, and that another $2.45 million in contracts was planned to be awarded over the following year. In October, contracts for constructing the bridge piers were advertised. By December 1931, the project was 15% completed, and the city was accepting designs for the Queens span&#x27;s suspension towers. The granite foundations in the water near each bank of the East River, which would support the suspension towers, were completed in early or mid-1932. At the time, there were no funds to build six additional piers on Randalls Island and one in Little Hell Gate, nor were there funds to build the suspension towers themselves.

==== Funding issues ====

The Great Depression severely impacted the city&#x27;s ability to finance the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s construction. City comptroller Charles W. Berry had stated in February 1930 that the city was in sound financial condition, even though other large cities were nearing bankruptcy. However, the New York City government was running out of money by that July. The Triborough project&#x27;s outlook soon began to look bleak. Chief engineer Othmar Ammann was enlisted to help guide the project, but the combination of Tammany Hall graft, the stock market crash, and the Great Depression which followed it, brought the project to a virtual halt. Investors shied away from purchasing the municipal bonds needed to fund it.

By early 1932, the Triborough Bridge project was in danger of cancellation. As part of $213 million in cuts to the city&#x27;s budget, Berry wanted to halt construction on the span in order to avoid a $43.7 million budget shortage by the end of that year. With no new contracts being awarded, the chief engineer of the Department of Plant and Structures, Edward A. Byrne, warned in March 1932 that construction on the Triborough Bridge would have to be halted. Though Queens borough president Harvey objected to the impending postponement of the bridge&#x27;s construction, the project was still included in the $213 million worth of budget cuts. Following this, Goldman submitted a proposal to fund the planning stages for the remaining portions of construction, so that work could resume immediately once sufficient funding was available.

In August 1932, Senator Robert F. Wagner announced that he would ask for a $26 million loan from the federal government, namely President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Reconstruction Finance Corporation, so there could be funds for the construction of both the Triborough Bridge and Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Queens borough president Harvey also went to the RFC to ask for funding for the bridge. Soon after, the RFC moved to prepare the loan for the Triborough Bridge project. However, when Mayor Walker resigned suddenly in September 1932, his successor Joseph V. McKee refused to seek RFC or other federal aid for the two projects, stating, &quot;If we go to Washington for funds to complete the Triborough Bridge [...] where would we draw the line?&quot; Governor Al Smith agreed, saying that such requests were unnecessary because the bridge could pay for itself. Harvey continued to push for federal funding for the Triborough Bridge, prioritizing its completion over other projects such as the development of Jamaica Bay in southern Queens. Civic groups also advocated for the city to apply for RFC funding.

In February 1933, a nine-person committee, appointed by Lehman and chaired by Moses, applied to the RFC for a $150 million loan for projects in New York state, including the Triborough Bridge. However, although the RFC favored a loan for the Triborough project, the new mayor, John P. O&#x27;Brien, banned the RFC from giving loans to the city. Instead, O&#x27;Brien wanted to create a bridge authority to sell bonds to pay for the construction of the Triborough Bridge as well as for the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Robert Moses was also pushing the state legislature to create an authority to fund, build, and operate the Triborough Bridge. A bill to create the Triborough Bridge Authority (TBA) passed quickly through both houses of the state legislature, and was signed by Governor Herbert H. Lehman that April. The bill included a provision that the authority could sell up to $35 million in bonds and fund the remainder of construction through bridge tolls. George Gordon Battle, a Tammany Hall attorney, was appointed as chairman of the new authority, and three commissioners were appointed.

Shortly after the TBA bill was signed, the War Department extended its deadline for the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s completion by three years, to April 28, 1936. Lehman also signed bills to clear land for a bridge approach in the Bronx, and he promised to resume construction of the bridge. That May, the TBA asked the RFC for a $35 million loan to pay for the bridge. The RFC ultimately agreed in August to grant $44.2 million, to be composed of a loan of $37 million, as well as a $7.2 million subsidy. However, the loan would only be given under a condition that 18,000 workers be hired first, so the city&#x27;s Board of Estimate voted to hire 18,000 workers to work on the Triborough project. The funds for the Triborough Bridge, as well as for the Lincoln Tunnel from Manhattan to New Jersey, were ready by the beginning of September.

=== Construction resumes ===
The city purchased land in the path of the Triborough Bridge in September 1933, and construction on the Triborough Bridge resumed that November. By January 1934, contracts were being prepared for the completion of the suspension span and the construction of the other three spans; one of these contracts included the construction of the bridge&#x27;s piers. That February, the TBA contemplated condensing the Queens span&#x27;s 16-lane, double-deck roadway into an 8-lane, single deck road, as well as simplify the suspension towers&#x27; designs, to save $5 million. According to the agency, it would take 40 years for the bridge to reach a level of traffic where all sixteen lanes were needed. In April, a new plan was approved that would reduce the bridge&#x27;s cost from $51 million to $42 million. Chief engineer Ammann had decided to collapse the original design&#x27;s two-deck roadway into one, requiring lighter towers and lighter piers. The steel company constructing the towers challenged the TBA&#x27;s decision in an appellate court, but the court ruled in favor of the TBA.

==== 1934 progress ====
By January 1934, the TBA was in turmoil: one of the TBA&#x27;s commissioners had resigned, and New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia was trying another TBA commissioner, John Stratton O&#x27;Leary, for corruption. The TBA&#x27;s general counsel also resigned. As a result, Public Works Administration (PWA) administrator Harold L. Ickes refused to distribute more of the RFC grant until the existing funds could be accounted for. Ickes also warned that he would cancel the RFC grant if the political disputes regarding the TBA were not cleared up. After O&#x27;Leary was removed, La Guardia appointed Moses to fill O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s position, and Ickes also promised to give $1.5 million toward the bridge&#x27;s construction, which the city received that March. Moses became the chairman of the TBA in April 1934, after a series of interim chairmen had held the post. Moses, who also had positions in the state and city governments, sought to expedite the project, awarding a contract in May for the construction of an approach highway to the Queens span.

A contract to clear land in the bridge&#x27;s right-of-way was awarded in April 1934, and work began that month. Over 300 buildings had to be destroyed. Families living in the path of the bridge&#x27;s approaches protested the eviction notices given to them. The Harlem Market on First Avenue, which stood in the way of the Manhattan approach, was to be moved to the Bronx Terminal Market. The construction of the Triborough Bridge across Little Hell Gate also required the demolition of hospital buildings on Randalls and Wards Islands. The New York City Department of Hospitals applied for funds to build the Seaview Hospital on Staten Island, which would house the hospital facilities displaced by the Triborough Bridge. Homes in Astoria and wooden docks were also demolished to make way for the bridge.

Moses continued to advocate for new roads and parkways to connect with the bridge as part of an interconnected parkway system. The complex of roads included the Grand Central Parkway and Astoria Boulevard in Queens; 125th Street, the East River Drive (now the FDR Drive), and Harlem River Drive in Manhattan; and Whitlock Avenue and Eastern Boulevard (now Bruckner Expressway) in the Bronx. The first of those roads, the Grand Central Parkway, was planned to start construction in early 1934. That July, the Department of War approved the Bronx Kill span as a fixed truss span, since the Bronx Kill was not a navigable waterway; the span could be replaced with a lift bridge if needed. The same month, the city approved the first segment of the East River Drive, leading from the intersection of York Avenue and 92nd Street to the Triborough Bridge approach at 125th Street. The bridge approach on the Bronx side was also finalized, running along Southern and Eastern boulevards, with a future extension to Pelham Bay Park in the northeastern Bronx.

Civic groups advocated for an approach highway from the West Bronx, and Bronx borough president James J. Lyons tried to block the Board of Estimate from approving the Manhattan approach highway until a West Bronx approach was also provided for. Despite this, in October 1934, the Board of Estimate approved the East River Drive approach while rejecting the West Bronx approach. While reformers embraced Moses&#x27;s plans to expand the parkway system, state and city officials were overwhelmed by their scale, and slow to move to provide financing for the vast system. Partial funding came from interest-bearing bonds issued by the Triborough Bridge Authority, to be secured by future toll revenue.

==== 1935 progress ====
Financing disputes with the PWA involved complex political infighting. The disputes peaked in January 1935, when Ickes passed a rule that effectively prohibited PWA funding for the TBA unless Moses resigned the post of either TBA chairman or New York City Parks Commissioner. This came as a result of Moses&#x27;s criticism that New Deal funding programs like the PWA were too slow to disburse funds. Moses refused to resign in spite of Ickes&#x27;s persistence, and Ickes threatened to withhold salaries for TBA workers as well. Though La Guardia was supportive of Moses, even petitioning Roosevelt for help, he was willing to replace the TBA chairman if it resulted in funding for the bridge. In mid-March, Ickes suddenly backed down on his ultimatum; not only was Moses allowed to keep both of his positions, but the PWA also resumed its payments to the TBA. La Guardia re-appointed Moses to the TBA the same year.

Meanwhile, in February 1935, the TBA awarded a contract to construct the piers for the Harlem River lift structure. Despite an impending lack of funds due to the dispute between Moses and Ickes, the TBA announced its intent to open bids for bridge steelwork. By March, the suspension towers for the East River span to Queens were nearing completion, and support piers on Randalls and Wards Islands had progressed substantially. After the Moses–Ickes dispute had subsided, the TBA started advertising for bids to build the steel roadways of the Randalls and Wards Islands viaducts, as well as the East River suspension span. Less than a week afterward, the first temporary wires were strung between the two towers of the suspension span. The wires in the main cables were laid by machines that traveled along these temporary wires. A contract for the Harlem River lift span&#x27;s steel superstructure was awarded that May, followed by a contract for the Bronx Kill truss span&#x27;s structure the following month.

The spinning of the main span&#x27;s suspension cables was finished in July 1935. By that time, half of the $41 million federal grant had been spent on construction, and the bridge was expected to open the following year. The bridge was expected to relieve traffic on nearby highways, and, with the upcoming 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair being held in Queens, would also provide a new route to the fairground at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The construction of the Bronx approach was delayed after the city&#x27;s corporation council found that the approach could not be built using federal funds. By October 1935, the Queens approach and the Randalls and Wards Islands viaduct was nearly complete. Vertical suspender cables had been hung from the main cables of the Queens suspension span, and the steel slabs to support the span&#x27;s roadway deck were being erected. The concrete piers supporting Bronx span were still being constructed, and the site of the Manhattan span was marked only by its foundations. The deck of the Queens suspension span was completed the following month. The work was dangerous, as some workers fell off the scaffolding that had been erected to allow them to build the suspension span, while others died due to lead poisoning.

In November 1935, a controversy emerged over the fact that the Triborough Bridge would use steel imported from Nazi Germany, rather than American producers. Although American steel producers objected to the contract, the PWA approved of it anyway, because the German steel contract was cheaper than any of the bids presented by American producers. Moses also approved of the decision because it would save money, and the TBA said that federal regulations had forced the agency to turn to a German manufacturer. La Guardia blocked the deal, writing that &quot;the only commodity we can get from Hitlerland [Germany] is hatred, and we don&#x27;t want any in our country&quot;, and Ickes also banned the use of imported materials on PWA projects. The TBA then re-awarded the contract to the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company.

==== 1936 progress ====
By February 1936, the TBA had awarded contracts for paving the Bronx Kill and East River spans, as well as for constructing several administrative buildings for the TBA near the bridge. Lyons continued to object to Moses&#x27;s plans for the bridge&#x27;s Bronx approach. Moses wanted to speed up construction on the Triborough Bridge so that it would meet a deadline of July 11, 1936. He objected to Ickes&#x27;s decision, in March 1936, to decentralize control of PWA resident engineers, who would report to state PWA bosses instead of directly to the PWA&#x27;s main office in Washington, D.C. Moses believed that the PWA boss for New York, Arthur S. Tuttle, was indecisive. In return, Ickes assured Moses of Tuttle&#x27;s full cooperation.

The 300-by-84-foot superstructure of the Harlem River lift span was assembled in Weehawken, New Jersey. It was floated northward to the Triborough Bridge site in April 1936. Early the next month, the 200-ton main lift span was hoisted into place above the Harlem River in a process that took sixteen minutes. In addition, the city gave the New York City Omnibus Corporation a temporary permit to operate bus routes on the Triborough Bridge, connecting the bus stops at each of the bridge&#x27;s ends, during the summer months. Moses appealed to Ickes to increase the construction workers&#x27; workweeks from 30 to 40 hours so the bridge would be able to open on time, but was initially rejected. A 40-hour workweek was approved that June. As late as the day before the bridge&#x27;s opening on July 11, workers were still putting finishing touches on the bridge and surrounding highways.

A byproduct of the Triborough project was the creation of parks and playgrounds in the lands underneath the bridges and approaches. The largest of these parks was Randall&#x27;s Island Park, located on Wards and Randalls Islands. The park on Randalls Island was approved in February 1935 and included an Olympic-sized running track called Downing Stadium, work on which began in mid-1935; the stadium was incomplete at the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening. The plan included infilling a strait, Little Hell Gate, between the two islands. Smaller parks were also built in Astoria and Manhattan.

When the Triborough Bridge was finished, it was the largest PWA project in the eastern U.S., having cost $60.3 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) according to final TBA figures. Based on expenditures, the PWA had originally estimated the bridge&#x27;s cost to be as high as $64 million. In either case, the Triborough Bridge was one of the largest public works projects of the Great Depression, more expensive than the Hoover Dam. Of this, $16 million came from the city and $9 million directly from the PWA. The latter also purchased $35 million worth of TBA bonds, which were eventually bought back and resold to the public. The PWA had finished giving out the $35 million loan by February 1937, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had sold the last of the TBA&#x27;s funds that July. Additional income came from toll collection: the toll was initially set at 25 cents per passenger car, with lower rates for motorcycles and higher rates for commercial vehicles.

==Operational history ==

=== Opening ===
The toll rates for the bridge were decided upon in March 1936. By May, the opening ceremonies for both the Triborough Bridge and the Downing Stadium were scheduled for July 11. The dedication was scheduled to occur on the Manhattan lift span, prompting objections from both Bronx and Queens officials. Due to the previous conflicts between President Roosevelt and Robert Moses, the attendance of the former was not certain until two weeks before the ceremony. PWA administrator Ickes&#x27;s attendance was finalized only four days beforehand.

The completed structure, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;Y-shaped sky highway&quot;, was dedicated on Saturday, July 11, 1936, along with Downing Stadium. The ceremony for the Triborough Bridge was held at the interchange plaza, and was attended by Roosevelt, La Guardia, Lehman, Ickes, and Postmaster General James A. Farley, who all gave speeches. Robert Moses acted as the master of ceremonies. The ceremonies were broadcast nationwide via radio, and a parade was also held on 125th Street in Manhattan to celebrate the bridge&#x27;s opening. Queens residents, excluded from the official ceremony, hosted an unofficial gathering in Astoria. The Triborough Bridge opened to the general public at 1:30 p.m., and by that midnight an estimated 200,000 people had visited the bridge. The bridge saw 40,000 vehicles on its first full day, July 12, and about 1,000 vehicles an hour on July 13, its first full weekdays. The TBA recorded 242,000 total vehicles in the bridge&#x27;s first week, 953,100 during the first month, and 2.7 million in its first three months.

After the bridge&#x27;s opening, one Queens civic group predicted that the bridge would increase real-estate values in Queens and on Long Island at large. The ferry between Yorkville, Manhattan, and Astoria, Queens, was made redundant by the new Triborough Bridge, and the city had closed the ferry by the end of July 1936. Traffic on the Queensboro Bridge, the only other vehicular bridge that connected Manhattan and Queens, declined after the Triborough Bridge opened, though not by as much as city officials had anticipated. In 1937, the first full year of the bridge&#x27;s operation, it generated $2.85 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in revenue from 11.18 million vehicles. This was far more than the 8 million vehicles that TBA officials had originally anticipated. The American Institute of Steel Construction declared the Triborough Bridge the &quot;most beautiful&quot; steel bridge constructed during 1936. &quot;Newsday&quot;, writing retrospectively in 1994, said: &quot;More than any other structure, the Triborough unified the boroughs of New York City.&quot;

=== 1930s to mid-1960s ===

==== Highway construction ====
When the bridge opened, none of the spans had direct connections to the greater system of highways in New York City. In Queens, the Grand Central Parkway extension to the Triborough Bridge was nearly completed at the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening. The Manhattan span was planned to connect to the East River Drive (now the FDR Drive), the first segments of which were still under construction. The section of the East River Drive from the bridge south to 92nd Street opened that October. Originally, there was no direct access from the Queens span to Wards Island, but in November 1937, Moses announced the construction of a ramp from the Queens span that would lead down to the island. The next year, a lawsuit was filed by two Wards Islands landowners, who alleged that the Triborough Bridge had been built on portions of their land. They each received nominal damages of $1.

The Bronx span ended in local traffic at the no-longer extant intersection of 135th Street and Cypress Avenue. The first of two approach highways in the Bronx was approved late in 1936 and was partially funded by the PWA. Consisting of ramps to the intersection of 138th Street and Grand Concourse, this highway opened in April 1939 and later became part of the Major Deegan Expressway (Interstate 87). Another approach highway in the Bronx, the present Bruckner Boulevard, was approved in 1938 and extended eastward to the Bruckner Interchange. Both Bronx approach roads were completed in time for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, which was held in Queens.

Moses continued expanding the system of highways in the mid-20th century, including arteries that led to the Triborough Bridge, namely the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in Queens and the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx. Both highways became part of I-278, as did the Queens and Bronx spans of the Triborough Bridge, by the 1960s. In the 1950s, there were also plans for a highway to be constructed between the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s Manhattan span and a never-built 125th Street Hudson River bridge, which would have allowed direct highway access to the New Jersey Turnpike.

==== Bridge traffic and modifications ====
The Triborough Bridge Authority was headquartered in an administration building adjacent to the Manhattan span&#x27;s toll plaza, where by 1940, it controlled the operation of all toll bridges located entirely within New York City. Though the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge between the Bronx and Queens opened in April 1939, the Triborough Bridge did not see any initial decline in traffic, likely because both spans were heavily used during the World&#x27;s Fair. Soon after, vehicle rationing caused by the onset of World War II resulted in a decline in traffic at crossings operated by the TBA including the Triborough Bridge. Still, by 1940, the Triborough Bridge was the most profitable crossing operated by the TBA. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing the bridge as &quot;generally recognized as a monument to engineering ingenuity&quot;, attributed the bridge&#x27;s popularity to the design of its three spans. In 1941, one of the lift span&#x27;s original gates was removed after a motorist damaged it.

Traffic decreased significantly during the war, declining to 5.1 million vehicles in 1943, though traffic counts again increased afterward. The TBA became the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) in 1946, though TBTA operations continued to be managed from the Triborough Bridge. The bridge was repainted for the first time in September 1946 for $600,000. The bridge recorded over 100 million total vehicles in its first decade of operation. By 1951, the bridge accommodated 29.4 million vehicles a year, more than any other toll road in the U.S.; the TBTA claimed in early 1952 that the bridge was the busiest toll road in the world.

=== Late 1960s to 1990s ===
In 1968, the Triborough Bridge received its first major renovation in its 31-year history. Seven tollbooths were added, three at the Manhattan span&#x27;s toll plaza and four at the Queens/Bronx spans&#x27; toll plaza, and several ramps were widened at a cost of $20 million. The project also added a direct ramp from the Manhattan span to the southbound lanes of Second Avenue in East Harlem. The TBTA administration building was also expanded during this project. Traffic from the Manhattan span was temporarily diverted during this project.

At some point in the 20th century, a sign on the bridge informed travelers, &quot;In event of attack, drive off bridge&quot;; according to &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist William Safire, the &quot;somewhat macabre sign&quot; must have &quot;drawn a wry smile from millions of motorists&quot;. The TBTA replaced the movable toll gates across all of its toll booths in 1989, including those at the Triborough Bridge. By that year, pieces of concrete were falling off the bridge, prompting concerns about deterioration. By the early 1990s, the bridge accommodated about 160,000 daily vehicles, and the TBTA employed 140 toll collectors there. During that decade, the TBTA discovered high concentrations of lead under the bridge&#x27;s Queens approaches, prompting the agency to remove the lead. The TBTA also rearranged the lanes at the bridge&#x27;s toll plazas in 1992. The Triborough Bridge remained the TBTA&#x27;s busiest facility in the 1990s, with over 200,000 daily vehicles.

In 1997, more renovations of the bridge were announced. The project consisted of three phases. The first phase involved renovating the Queens span and approach ramps, as well as replacing the suspender cables; work on the Queens span&#x27;s anchorage began in February 1997. On the Queens side, an exit ramp from westbound I-278 to 31st Street necessitated the destruction of the entrance to the southern sidewalk. The second phase involved renovating the Bronx span and approach ramps. The third phase involved renovating the Manhattan span and approach ramps. By early 1999, there were more than 500 potholes on the bridge, requiring workers to use of concrete and of asphalt to repave the deck. Work on replacing the Queens span&#x27;s suspender cables and adding an orthotropic deck to the Queens suspension span started in 2000. The replacement of the deck was estimated to cost $125 million.

=== 2000s to present ===

In January 2008, then-governor Eliot Spitzer proposed renaming the bridge after former U.S. senator Robert F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated during a 1968 presidential bid. Though the Kennedy family supported the renaming, there were initial doubts over whether local residents would use the new name. The New York State Legislature approved the bill that June, and the Triborough Bridge was officially renamed after Kennedy on November 19, 2008. The MTA announced further renovations to the Triborough Bridge in 2008; the work included the replacement of the roadways at the toll plazas, as well as the rehabilitation of various ramps and the construction of a new service building. The same year, the MTA awarded contracts to renovate the Queens span&#x27;s anchorages.

In 2015, the MTA started two reconstruction projects on different parts of the bridge as part of a $1 billion, 15-year program to renovate the bridge complex. The MTA commenced construction on a $213 million rehabilitation of the 1930s-era toll plaza between the Queens and Bronx spans, which included a rebuilding of the roadway and the supporting structure underneath. The new toll plaza structure was completed in 2019. Cashless tolling was implemented on June 15, 2017, allowing drivers to pay tolls electronically via E-ZPass or Toll-by-Mail without having to stop at any tollbooths. Shortly afterward, the tollbooths were demolished.

A ramp from the Manhattan span to the northbound Harlem River Drive was being built for $68.3 million, and was to be finished by December 2017; this was delayed pending the reconstruction of the Harlem River Drive viaduct around the area. In February 2020, the northbound Harlem River Drive ramp&#x27;s completion was tentatively announced for 2021, though the ramp ultimately opened in November 2020. The project was expected to cost $72.6 million and involved designing a new overpass to fit between the Harlem River Drive&#x27;s two existing roadways. The Harlem River lift span was also rehabilitated prior to 2020.
==Usage==
The toll revenues from the RFK Bridge pay for a portion of the public transit funding for the New York City Transit Authority and the commuter railroads. The bridge had annual average daily traffic of 164,116 in 2014. For that year, the bridge saw annual toll-paying traffic rise by 2.9% to 59.9 million, generating $393.6 million in revenue at an average toll of $6.57.

===Pedestrian and bicycle sidewalks===
The bridge has sidewalks on all three spans where the TBTA officially requires bicyclists to walk their bicycles across due to safety concerns. However, the signs stating this requirement have been usually ignored by bicyclists, and the New York City Government has recommended that the TBTA should reassess this kind of bicycling ban. Stairs on the Queens span impede access by disabled people, and only the northern sidewalk on that span is open to traffic; the Queens end of the southern sidewalk was demolished in the early 2000s. The two sidewalks of the Bronx span are connected to one long and winding ramp at the Randalls Island end, though another pedestrian bridge between Randalls Island and the neighborhood of Port Morris, Bronx, opened to the east of the RFK Bridge in November 2015.

===Public transportation===
The RFK Bridge carries the bus routes operated by MTA New York City Transit, as well as several express bus routes operated by the MTA Bus Company: . The M35 travels from Manhattan to Randalls and Wards Islands (with the X80 also operating during special events), while the M60 SBS runs between Manhattan and Queens, and the MTA Bus express routes travel between Manhattan and the Bronx. The M60 has used the bridge since the early 1990s.

In the 1920s, John F. Hylan proposed building the Triborough Bridge as part of his planned Independent Subway System. The proposal entailed extending the New York City Subway&#x27;s BMT Astoria Line along the same route the Triborough now follows. It would have created a crosstown subway line along 125th Street, as well as a new subway line in the Bronx under St. Ann&#x27;s Avenue.

==Tolls==
, drivers pay $11.19 per car or $4.71 per motorcycle for tolls by mail/non-NYCSC E-Z Pass. E-ZPass users with transponders issued by the New York E‑ZPass Customer Service Center pay $6.94 per car or $3.02 per motorcycle. Mid-Tier NYCSC E-Z Pass users pay $8.36 per car or $3.57 per motorcycle. All E-ZPass users with transponders not issued by the New York E-ZPass CSC will be required to pay Toll-by-mail rates.

When the Triborough Bridge opened, it had a combined 22 tollbooths spread across two toll plazas. Motorists were first able to pay with E‑ZPass in lanes for automatic coin machines at the toll plazas on August 21, 1996; in contrast to other MTA Bridges &amp; Tunnels facilities where E-ZPass lanes were interspersed with cash only lanes, all of the E-ZPass lanes at either of the Triborough Bridge&#x27;s toll plazas were grouped together. The implementation of E-ZPass allowed each toll lane to accommodate 900 vehicles an hour, compared with the 250 to 400 vehicles that the old toll lanes could accommodate.

Open-road cashless tolling began on June 15, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore near where the booths were formerly located. A vehicle without an E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

<text>John William Stevens (10 June 1940 – 13 September 1994) was an English drummer, and a founding member of the Spontaneous Music Ensemble.

==Biography==
Stevens was born in Brentford, Middlesex, England, the son of a tap dancer. He listened to jazz as a child but was more interested in drawing and painting, through which he expressed himself throughout his life. He studied at the Ealing Art College and then started work in a design studio, but left at 19 to join the Royal Air Force. He studied the drums at the Royal Air Force School of Music in Uxbridge, and while there met Trevor Watts and Paul Rutherford, two musicians who became close collaborators.

In the mid-1960s, Stevens began to play in London jazz groups with Tubby Hayes and Ronnie Scott, and in 1965 he led a quartet. He moved away from mainstream jazz when he heard free jazz from the U.S. by musicians like Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler. In 1966, he formed the Spontaneous Music Ensemble (SME) with Watts and Rutherford. The band moved into the Little Theatre Club at Garrick Yard, St Martin&#x27;s Lane, London. In 1967, their first album, &quot;Challenge&quot;, was released. Stevens then became interested in the music of Anton Webern, and the SME began to play quiet music. Stevens also became interested in non-Western music.

Stevens also devised a number of basic starting points for improvisation. These were not &quot;compositions&quot; as such, but rather a means of getting improvisational activity started, which could then go off in any direction. One of these was the so-called &quot;Click Piece&quot; which essentially asked for each player to repeatedly play a note as short as possible.

Stevens played alongside a large number of prominent free improvisors in the SME, including Derek Bailey, Peter Kowald, Julie Tippetts and Robert Calvert, but from the mid-1970s, the make-up of the SME began to settle down to a regular group of Stevens, Nigel Coombes on violin, and Roger Smith on guitar. During the mid-1970s Stevens played regularly with guitarist and songwriter John Martyn as part of a trio that included bassist Danny Thompson. This line up can be heard on Martyn&#x27;s 1976 recording &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;.

From 1983, Stevens was involved with , an organisation through which he took his form of music making to youth clubs, mental health institutions, the Lewisham Academy of Music, and other unusual places. Notes taken during these sessions were later turned into a book for the Open University called &quot;Search and Reflect&quot; (1985). In the late 70s and early 1980s, John was a regular performer at the Bracknell Jazz Festival.

Stevens ran or helped to organise groups that were more jazz or jazz-rock based, such as Splinters, the John Stevens Dance Orchestra, Away, Freebop, Folkus, Fast Colour, PRS, and the John Stevens Quintet and Quartet. He contributed to Trevor Watts&#x27;s group Amalgam, Frode Gjerstad&#x27;s Detail, and collaborated with Bobby Bradford on several occasions.

SME played for its last time in 1994, when it included John Butcher. Stevens died later that year, from a heart attack, aged 54.

<text>John Arthur Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, (born 21 October 1942) is a former Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (head of the Metropolitan Police Service), having served from 2000 until 2005. From 1991 to 1996, he was Chief Constable of Northumbria Police before being appointed one of HM Inspectors of Constabulary in September 1996. He was then appointed Deputy Commissioner of the Met in 1998 until his promotion to Commissioner in 2000. He was a writer for the &quot;News of the World&quot;, for £7,000 an article, until his resignation as the hacking scandal progressed.

He sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

==Police career==
Stevens was educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, the University of Leicester, where he took an LLB degree, and the University of Southampton, where he did his MPhil degree. Before becoming Chief Constable of Northumbria, he served as Assistant Chief Constable of the Hampshire Constabulary (1986–88) and Deputy Chief Constable of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary (1988–91). 

He presided over an external police inquiry into allegations in Northern Ireland of collusion between the British security services and loyalist paramilitaries in a series of killings during the Troubles. Stevens&#x27;s third report, published on 17 April 2003, upheld the claim and explicitly said that collusion leading to the murder of Catholics (and some Protestant wrongly thought to be Catholic or nationalist) had taken place. In the aftermath of the report, David Trimble, then-leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, called for a parliamentary inquiry into the collusion, while the leaders of the SDLP and Sinn Féin called for a full public inquiry. A subsequent government ordered review by Sir Desmond de Silva, QC, announced in December 2012, confirmed the findings of the Stevens 1, 2 and 3 Inquiries regarding collusion between British security forces and loyalist paramilitary groups in killings in Northern Ireland, which resulted in 97 convictions, and a large number of recommendations, which were accepted. 

==Post-retirement==
After his retirement as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, on 6 April 2005 he was created a life peer as Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, of Kirkwhelpington in the County of Northumberland. He headed a Metropolitan Police inquiry, Operation Paget, into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on 31 August 1997, which reported its findings in 2006.

Lord Stevens was asked by the Conservatives, under David Cameron, to be their candidate for the London Mayoral elections. He declined this offer.

On 29 June 2007, having become one of the UK&#x27;s leading security experts, in-coming Prime Minister Gordon Brown appointed Lord Stevens as his Senior Advisor on International Security Issues. David Cameron appointed Stevens as Chair of the Borders Policing Committee in 2007, a position he held for 9 months focusing on the reorganisation and policing of the UK&#x27;s borders. In 2011, he was appointed by Yvette Cooper MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Home Affairs to Chair an Independent Commission Policing Commission into the Future of Policing in England and Wales.

The Commission, which reported its findings in Spring 2013, was set up in place of a Royal Commission and is made up of nearly 40 members all of whom are experts in the fields of academia, politics, national and international policing/security as well as key figures from community initiatives and business. In addition the Commission has secured contributions from 35 academics from 25 Universities from around the world including, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Northumbria University and Harvard University. 

Lord Stevens became Honorary President of the Police Credit Union in 2007.

He is also Patron of the Police History Society.

Lord Stevens holds positions at a number of security consultancy companies. Since 2014, he has been Chairman of the private investigative and security consulting firm Quest Global Limited, where he is also a person with significant control. In 2020, Lord Stevens was forced to apologise when he was &quot;found in breach of the House of Lords&#x27; code of conduct for failing to correctly declare his work for foreign governments&quot; in connection with his position at Quest Global Limited and his other consultancy work. Quest Global Limited was also mentioned in connection with the alleged bugging of Sir Frederick Barclay at the London Ritz hotel in 2020 and the subsequent legal action brought by Sir Frederick and his daughter against other members of their family.

==Honours==
Awarded the Queen&#x27;s Police Medal in the 1992 New Year Honours, he was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours and made Deputy Lieutenant of London in 2001. In 2002 he was made a Knight of the Order of Saint John.

&lt;br&gt;

In April 2007 Lord Stevens became Honorary Air Commodore of No 3 (Royal Auxiliary) Air Force Police Squadron. He is the Honorary Colonel of Northumbria Army Cadet Force. On 28 November 2005, he was appointed Chancellor of Northumbria University. 

He holds an Honours Degree in Law, a master&#x27;s degree of Philosophy, a Doctor of Law, Honorary Degrees of Doctor in Civil Law, Doctor of Letters and a Doctor of Philosophy. 

He is a Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge, and was a visiting professor at City University of New York (CUNY).

Lord Stevens holds a Commercial Pilot&#x27;s Licence and is part owner of several aircraft.

<text>Mirandese (&quot;mirandés&quot; ; &quot;lhéngua mirandesa&quot; in Central and Raiano, and &quot;léngua mirandesa&quot; in Sendinese) is an Asturleonese language or variety that is sparsely spoken in a small area of northeastern Portugal in eastern Tierra de Miranda (made up of the municipalities of Miranda de l Douro, Mogadouro and Bumioso, being extinct in Mogadouro and present in Bumioso only in some eastern villages, like Angueira). The Assembly of the Republic granted it official recognition alongside Portuguese for local matters with Law 7/99 of 29 January 1999. In 2001, Mirandese was officially recognised by the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, which aims to promote the survival of the least spoken European languages.

Mirandese has a distinct phonology, morphology and syntax. It has its roots in the local Vulgar Latin spoken in the northern Iberian Peninsula.

Mirandese is a descendant of the Astur-Leonese variety spoken in the Kingdom of León and has both archaisms and innovations that differentiate it from the modern varieties of Astur-Leonese spoken in Spain. In recognition of these differences, and due to its political isolation from the rest of the Astur-Leonese speaking territory, Mirandese has adopted a different written norm to the one used in Spain for Astur-Leonese.

==History==
Mirandese is a descendant of the Old Leonese language spoken in the Kingdom of León in medieval Iberia. In the early 16th century, Old Leonese began to split, alongside Galician-Portuguese, into the varieties existent today, one of them being Mirandese.

Until 1884, Mirandese was a purely spoken language, but in that year, José Leite de Vasconcelos wrote &quot;Flores Mirandézas&quot; (&quot;Froles Mirandesas&quot; in modern Mirandese, &quot;Mirandese Flowers&quot;), a book with his own proposal for a Mirandese writing system, with a large number of diacritics, which have helped to convey what Mirandese sounded like in the 19th century.

One of the texts in Flores Mirandézas, &quot;LHÊNGUA MIRANDÉZA&quot; &#x27;MIRANDESE LANGUAGE&#x27; (LHÉNGUA MIRANDESA in modern Mirandese), transcribed:

In the 19th century, Leite de Vasconcelos described Mirandese as &quot;the language of the farms, of work, home, and love between the Mirandese&quot;. Since 1986–87, it has been taught optionally to students at the primary and lower secondary level, and has thus been somewhat recovering. By Law 7/99, Mirandese was given official recognition by the Assembly of the Republic alongside Portuguese. The law provides for its promotion and allows its usage for local matters in Miranda do Douro.

In 1999, Mirandese gained its first official orthography, which was later tweaked in 2000. Today Mirandese retains speakers in most of the villages of the municipality of Miranda de l Douro and in some villages of Bumioso (such as Vilar Seco and Angueira); and some linguistic influence can be observed at other villages of the municipality of Bumioso and the municipalities of Mogadouro, Macedo de Cavaleiros and Bragança.

A 2020 survey by University of Vigo, carried out in Miranda do Douro, estimated the number of speakers of the language to be around 3,500 with 1,500 of them being regular speakers. The study observed strong decline in the usage of the language in younger people.

==Orthography==
Mirandese is written using the Latin alphabet, with a Portuguese basis for orthography due to its political situation:
== Variants ==
Three variants of the Mirandese language exist: Border Mirandese (&quot;Mirandés Raiano&quot;), Central Mirandese (&quot;Mirandés Central&quot;) and Sendinese (&quot;Sendinés&quot;). Most speakers of Mirandese also speak Portuguese.

Despite there being a singular writing system for mirandese, there is one aspect that is written differently in different dialects. In the Sendinese dialect, many words that in other dialects are said with /ʎ/ , are said with /l/ (&quot;alá&quot; for &quot;alhá&quot; &#x27;over there&#x27;, &quot;lado&quot; for &quot;lhado&quot; &#x27;side&#x27;, &quot;luç&quot; for &quot;lhuç&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;, amongst others)

The main orthographical differences between Mirandese in Portugal and the Astur-Leonese languages in Spain are caused by the dominant languages in each region. And while Mirandese has been influenced phonetically and in lexicon by Portuguese and the Astur-Leonese languages in Spain by Spanish, they retain more similarities among themselves than to the main languages of each country. Another difference is that Mirandese and Leonese remain very conservative, while Asturian has undergone a greater amount of change.

==Phonology==
Some historical developments in Mirandese are the following:
*Mirandese maintains distinct reflexes of all seven medieval Ibero-Romance sibilants:
: and indicate apico-alveolar sibilants (as in modern Catalan, northern/central peninsular Spanish and coastal northern European Portuguese), while and are dentalized laminal alveolar sibilants (as in most modern Portuguese, French and English). The unrelated Basque language also maintains a distinction between and (Basque has no voiced sibilants), which suggests that the distinction originally was an areal feature across Iberia.

:Portuguese spelling still distinguishes all seven and is identical to Mirandese spelling in this respect, but in pronunciation, Portuguese has reduced them to four except in northern hinterland European Portuguese dialects, including those of the area that Mirandese is spoken. Northern/central Peninsular Spanish has also reduced them to four but in quite a different way: . Western Andalusian Spanish and Latin American Spanish have further reduced them to three: .

*Retention of the initial from Latin, like nearly all dialects of Western Romance (the major maverick being Spanish, where &gt; &gt; ∅).
*As in Portuguese, the Latin initial consonant clusters , , evolve into .
*Proto-Romance medial clusters and became medial .
*The cluster /-mb-/ is kept.
*Proto-Romance becomes : &gt; &quot;lume&quot;.
*Falling diphthongs , preserved.
*Final &quot;-o&quot; becomes .
*Voiced sibilants are still maintained.
*Retention of intervocalic , .
*Western Romance , can diphthongize to , (as in Italian). That happens not only before palatals, as in Aragonese, but also before nasals.
* is palatalized word-initially (as in other Astur-Leonese languages and in Catalan).

=== Consonants ===
* As stated above, the laminal dental sibilants correspond to Portuguese . These are spelled &quot;c&quot;/&quot;ç&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. The corresponding alveolar sibilants are apical and are spelled &quot;s(s)&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. Furthermore, there is an additional palatal affricate &quot;ch&quot; that is distinct from the fricative , spelled &quot;x&quot;. The voiced is spelled &quot;j&quot; or &quot;g&quot;, as in Portuguese. Standard Portuguese has reduced all those sounds to just four fricatives: .
* The &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;long&quot; R is an alveolar trill , as in other varieties of Astur-Leonese and Spanish. The Portuguese uvular fricative is not found in Mirandese. The &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;short&quot; R is an ordinary alveolar tap commonly found in the Iberian Peninsula. As in other languages spoken in the region, the two contrast only in the word-internal position.
*Voiced stops can be lenited as fricatives .

=== Vowels ===
All oral and nasal vowel sounds and allophones are the same from Portuguese, with different allophones:
* has allophones of , with , and with and . And with the addition of nasal vowel sounds and for .
* Vowels can become glides when preceding or following other vowels.

===Dialectal variations===

The main differences between the three mirandese dialects are in the pronunciation of words.

==Morphology==
As in Portuguese, Mirandese still uses the following synthetic tenses:
*Synthetic pluperfect in &quot;-ra&quot;.
*Future subjunctive in &quot;-r(e)&quot;.
*Personal infinitive in &quot;-r(e)&quot;, which has the same endings as the future subjunctive but often differs as the personal infinitive always uses the infinitive stem, whereas the future subjunctive uses the past.

==Influence on Transmontano Portuguese==

Mirandese was formerly spoken in the general area of the district of Bragança &quot;(Bergáncia in Mirandese)&quot;, that speaks the Transmontano dialect of Portuguese. Although Mirandese has been lost in said region, it left some words and phonetic influences behind.

=== Words used in eastern Trás-Os-Montes of &quot;(likely)&quot; Mirandese origin ===
== Protection measures ==
The following measures have been taken to protect and develop Mirandese:

* allow primary teaching staff in the district of Miranda do Douro to teach in Mirandese, since 1986/1987, thanks to the ministerial authorisation published on 9 September 1985;
* publish books in Mirandese and about the Mirandese language, promoted by the Council of Miranda do Douro;
* facilitate annual celebrations in the city as well as a literary competition, promoted by the Council of Miranda do Douro;
* use of Mirandese in town celebrations, official commemorations and, occasionally, on social media;
* publish two volumes of the &quot;Asterix&quot; comic books;
* translate all the toponymic signs in Miranda do Douro, promoted by the Council of Miranda do Douro in 2006;
* develop studies by research centres in Portugal, such as &quot;Atlas Linguístico de Portugal&quot;, by the Centro de Linguística at University of Lisbon, and &quot;Inquérito Linguístico Boléo&quot;, by the University of Coimbra;
* create Biquipédia, a Mirandese Wikipedia;
* make sites available in Mirandese, such as Photoblog and WordPress.
* Mirandese music was recorded by Roberto Leal for his albums &quot;Canto da Terra&quot; (2007) and &quot;Raiç/Raíz&quot; (2010).

==Sample text==
The following is a sample text of the Mirandese language, written by Amadeu Ferreira, and published in the newspaper &quot;Público&quot;, on 24 July 2007.

Then a comparison of the previous text in three modern languages of the Asturo-leonese group:
===Old writing===

When Mirandese was first officially recognised and a writing system was established, it had ⟨ê⟩ and ⟨ô⟩ (like Portuguese) to represent [e] and [o] respectively in the diphthong ⟨uô⟩ and ⟨iê⟩. These have since fallen in disuse due to the fact that this rendering was only accurate in the Central and Raiano dialect, where said diphthongs were read [wo] and [je], unlike the Sendinese dialect, where they had been reduced to [u] and [i].

In 2000, the &quot;purmeira adenda&quot; &#x27;first addendum&#x27; was made to the Mirandese orthography, quickly followed by a second one two years later, but only the first was put to use officially, removing ⟨ê⟩ and ⟨ô⟩, allowing Sendinese speakers to write their unpalatalised versions of words with ⟨l⟩ instead of ⟨lh⟩, among other small tweaks.

==Comparative tables==
==Recognition==

Mirandese, given its status as a recognised language in Portugal after Portuguese, has been the subject in recent years of some publicity and attention in other parts of Portugal. A monthly chronicle in Mirandese, by researcher and writer Amadeu Ferreira, appears in the daily Portuguese national newspaper &quot;Público&quot;. The first volume of the &quot;Adventures of Asterix&quot;, named &quot;Asterix, L Goulés&quot; (&quot;Asterix the Gaul&quot;), was published in a Mirandese translation by Amadeu Ferreira in 2005, and sold throughout Portugal. Amadeu Ferreira also translated into Mirandese the epic poem by Camões, &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (&quot;Ls Lusíadas&quot;), under his pseudonym Francisco and published it in 2009. In 2011, the four Gospels of the Bible&#x27;s New Testament were translated into Mirandese, and in 2013 the entire Bible was translated into the language by Domingos Augusto Ferreira.

==Notes==
:1. Rue de la Costanielha is a commonly known street in Mirandese speaking regions, even appearing in some traditional songs like &quot;L Pandeiro&quot;.

:2. the voiced velar nasal [ŋ] only appears in the word &quot;ũa&quot; (a/one in the feminine singular), contractions including it (such as &quot;dalgũa&quot; or &quot;cũa&quot;) and all their respective plurals. Therefore, [ŋ] doesn’t have its own letter or digraph, ⟨ũ⟩ representing [ũŋ] or [ʊ̃ŋ]. One could argue that [ŋ] doesn’t even have any symbol representing it, ⟨ũ⟩ representing [ũ] or [ʊ̃] and the reader is supposed to know that the voiced velar nasal exists in said word.

<doc id="287130" wikidata="Q190021" url="?curid=287130" title="Townsville">
<text>Townsville is a city on the north-eastern coast of Queensland, Australia. With a population of 201,313 as of 2024, it is the largest settlement in North Queensland and Northern Australia (specifically, the parts of Australia north of the Sunshine Coast). It is unofficially considered the capital of North Queensland. Townsville hosts a significant number of governmental, community and major business administrative offices for the northern half of the state.

Part of the larger local government area of the City of Townsville, it is in the dry tropics region of Queensland. The city is adjacent to the central section of the Great Barrier Reef. The city is also a major industrial centre, home to one of the world&#x27;s largest zinc refineries, a nickel refinery and many other similar activities. As of December 2020, $30M operations to expand the Port of Townsville are underway, which involve channel widening and installation of a 70-tonne Liebherr Super Post Panamax Ship-to-Shore crane to allow much larger cargo and passenger ships to utilise the port. It is an increasingly important port due to its proximity to Asia and major trading partners such as China.

Dominant sectors of its diverse economy include defence, administration, health and education, manufacturing, energy, transport and logistics. The city is a national hub for renewable energy, in green hydrogen and polysilicon, as well as the centre of CopperString 2032 being Australia&#x27;s largest renewable transmission project. Townsville is Australia&#x27;s &#x27;fortress city&#x27;, home to a large part of the strategic capability of the ADF, offering essential services including maintenance and supply chains including one of the largest military bases in Australia as well as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base that can accommodate most military aircraft in service. Townsville is the industrial heart of northern Australia with a GRP of $15.1 billion in 2023. The city is served by Townsville Airport and the Port of Townsville, the largest general freight and container port in northern Australia.

Popular attractions include &quot;The Strand&quot;, a long tropical beach and garden strip; Riverway, a riverfront parkland attraction located on the banks of Ross River; Reef HQ, a large tropical aquarium holding many of the Great Barrier Reef&#x27;s native flora and fauna; the Museum of Tropical Queensland, built around a display of relics from the sunken British warship ; Castle Hill or as it was originally known Cootharinga, the most prominent landmark of the area and a popular place for exercise; The Townsville Sports Reserve; and Magnetic Island, a large neighbouring island, the vast majority of which is national park.

==History==

===Early history===
Aboriginal peoples such as the Wulgurukaba, Bindal, Girrugubba, Warakamai and Nawagi originally inhabited the Townsville area. The Wulgurukaba claim to be the traditional owners of the Townsville city area; the Bindal had a claim struck out by the Federal Court of Australia in 2005.

James Cook visited the Townsville region on his first voyage to Australia in 1770 but did not land there. Cook named nearby Cape Cleveland, Cleveland Bay and Magnetic(al) Island.

In 1819, Captain Phillip Parker King and botanist Alan Cunningham were the first Europeans to record a local landing.

In 1846, James Morrill was shipwrecked from the &quot;Peruvian&quot;, living in the Townsville area among the Bindal people for 17 years before deciding to return to British society when the frontier of colonisation came to the region.

In 1860, George Elphinstone Dalrymple led a maritime expedition to the region from Brisbane. The expedition sailed to Cleveland Bay, finding a vast Aboriginal population. They landed on the shore near where the modern city of Townsville now stands and met with a number of Aboriginal people, giving them biscuits and tobacco. The Aboriginal people started to touch and feel all the expedition members and began &quot;smacking their lips&quot;, which Dalrymple interpreted as an indication that they wanted to eat them. Another group of Aboriginal people came down, attacking them with a shower of stones and spears. Dalrymple and his men &quot;were necessitated&quot; to fire upon them, &quot;repulsing them with loss.&quot; They landed again near Cape Pallarenda to obtain surveys from the hilltops but decided to descend to their awaiting dinghies as they noticed residents of three Aboriginal camps below were moving in their direction. These people were yelling and dancing &quot;in a very hostile manner,&quot; and Dalrymple felt obliged to fire upon them. Dalrymple&#x27;s group then made an &quot;orderly retreat&quot; to the dinghies, halting at intervals to fire upon those throwing spears. The crew that had remained upon the &quot;Spitfire&quot; had seen about eight armed Aboriginal men in canoes approaching them from nearby Magnetic Island in an apparent attempt to board the ship. A discharge of a brass gun repulsed them.

===Establishment===
The Burdekin River&#x27;s seasonal flooding made the establishment of a seaport north of the river essential to the nascent inland cattle industry. John Melton Black of Woodstock Station, an employee of Sydney entrepreneur and businessman Robert Towns, dispatched Andrew Ball, Mark Watt Reid and a detachment of 8 troopers of the Native Police under the command of John Marlow to search for a suitable site. Ball&#x27;s party reached the Ross Creek in April 1864 and established a camp below the rocky spur of Melton Hill, near the present Customs House on The Strand.

Edward Kennedy, a Native Police officer accompanying the group, recalled how his &quot;boys&quot; (the Aboriginal troopers) chased four or five local tribesmen into the ocean. Kennedy then stated that he &quot;left the &quot;boys&quot; in the water, pumping lead and hurling derisive cries at them, neither of which seemed to reach their mark&quot;. A member of the expedition who was from a town in the south accidentally shot dead an elderly Aboriginal man. He said that he thought an alligator was stalking him. On the return journey to Port Denison, the group &quot;dispersed&quot; another Aboriginal camp in reprisal for the killing of a shepherd. After the fighting, the &quot;boys&quot; rounded up around 12 women, each taking turns based on their rank in selecting one. &quot;In five minutes, each had chosen their spouse and the ceremony was complete.&quot;

The next group of colonists, led by W. A. Ross, arrived at Cleveland Bay from Woodstock Station on 5 November that year. In 1866, Robert Towns visited for three days, his first and only visit. He agreed to provide ongoing financial assistance to the new settlement and Townsville was named in his honour. Townsville was declared a municipality in February 1866, with John Melton Black elected as its first Mayor. Townsville developed rapidly as the major port and service centre for the Cape River, Gilbert, Ravenswood, Etheridge and Charters Towers goldfields. Regional pastoral and sugar industries also expanded and flourished.

The Alligator Creek meatworks was established in 1879. Up to 1500 workers, many who resided in Townsville, would work at the factory. It helped to build up the economy of Townsville. Jack Flowers was a local of Townsville and started working at Alligator Creek when he was 13 years old (in 1913). He worked there for 58 years and would walk from Townsville to Alligator Creek. In 1915, the train line extended from Townsville out to Alligator Creek and in 1946 there was a dispute with workers who left work 15 minutes early to catch the 4:30 pm train back to town and the factory threatened to sack 340 workers reporting that it wasn’t 15 minutes but some had stopped working at 3:45 or 4 pm.

===Importation of South Sea Islander labour===

On 8 July 1866, Robert Towns imported the first boatload of South Sea Islanders into Townsville to labour on the cane and cotton farms. They numbered 56 and arrived on the Blue Bell, which had brought them from the Loyalty Islands and the New Hebrides. Charges were made against Henry Ross Lewin, the recruiter for Robert Towns, that some of the Islanders had been kidnapped to work on the plantations. In 1867, a magisterial enquiry was set up into the death of an Islander working on one of Towns&#x27; plantations. A pharmacist attending was of the opinion the death was caused by a lack of proper nourishment, the Islanders receiving only cornmeal for food. Other evidence was given by employees of the plantation company who claimed the labourers were treated well, and a verdict of death by natural causes was declared. Recent research has shown that the many allegations of blackbirding and slave conditions relating to the recruitment and employment of South Sea Islanders in Queensland are baseless, and without foundation in fact or reliable historical evidence.

===Turn of the century===
Townsville&#x27;s population was 4,000 people in 1882 and grew to 13,000 by 1891. In 1901 Lord Hopetoun made a goodwill tour of northern Australia and accepted an invitation to officially open Townsville&#x27;s town hall, occasioning the first ever vice-regal ceremonial unfurling of the Australian national flag. With Brisbane, in 1902 Townsville was proclaimed a City under the Local Authorities Act.
The foundation stone of the Townsville Cenotaph was laid in Strand Park on 19 July 1923. It was unveiled on 25 April 1924 (ANZAC Day) by the Queensland Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan.

===Townsville/Thuringowa===
The rural land surrounding the city was initially managed by the Thuringowa Road Board, which eventually became the Shire of Thuringowa. The shire ceded land several times to support Townsville&#x27;s expansion. In 1986 the Shire became incorporated as a city, governed by the Thuringowa City Council. The cities of Townsville and Thuringowa were amalgamated into the &quot;new&quot; Townsville City Council in March 2008, as part of the Queensland state government&#x27;s reform program.

===Japanese influence===
In 1896, Japan established its first Australian consulate in Townsville, primarily to serve some 4,000 Japanese workers who migrated to work in the sugar cane, turtle, trochus, beche de mer, and pearling industries. With the introduction of the White Australia policy, the demand for Japanese workers decreased, causing the consulate to finally close in 1908.

===Second World War===

At the beginning of 1942, Townsville had 30,000 inhabitants and between 5,000 and 7,000 of them voluntarily evacuated to other places. During the Second World War, the city was host to more than 50,000, and Townsville Naval Section Base. American and Australian troops and air crew were stationed here, and Townsville became a major staging point for battles in the South West Pacific. A large United States Armed Forces contingent supported the war effort from seven airfields and other bases around the city and in the region. Many buildings, schools and 177 private houses were commandeered for use by the military. Slit trenches were dug in many places, and 18 concrete air-raid shelters were built, six of them in Flinders Street. The first bombing raid on Rabaul, in Papua New Guinea, on 23 February 1942 was carried out by six B-17s based near Townsville.

Some of the units based in Townsville were:
*No. 3 Fighter Sector RAAF, Wulguru &amp; North Ward
*1 Wireless Unit, Pimlico &amp; Stuart &amp; Roseneath
*North Eastern Area Command HQ, Townsville, Sturt Street (now the Federation building)
*Castle Hill, Townsville tunnels &amp; bunkers
*Green St. Bunker, West End, Sidney Street West End, Project 81 (now the SES building)
*96th Engineer Battalion (which mutinied in April 1942.)

In July 1942, three small Japanese air raids were conducted against Townsville, which was by then the most important air base in Australia. On 25 July 1942 two Japanese Kawanishi Flying Boats dropped 15 bombs which landed near the mouth of the Ross River, only east of oil tanks in the harbour. On 28 July, one Japanese plane dropped eight bombs near the Garbutt airfield. On 29 July 1942, a single &quot;Emily&quot; Flying Boat dropped one bomb at the Experimental Station of Oonoonba and seven bombs landed in Cleveland Bay where bomb craters are still clearly visible. There were no deaths and structural damage was minimal, as the Japanese missed their intended targets of the railway, the harbour and the airfield and destroyed a palm tree at the Experimental Station of Oonoonba. Although the Japanese aircraft were intercepted on two of the three raids, no Japanese planes were shot down.

===1960s and 1970s===
In 1961 the University of Queensland established a campus at Pimlico, near Pimlico State High School, later developing a site at Douglas near the Army Barracks, and across the new Nathan Street Bridge. The faculties of Arts, Law, and Education, and several residential colleges, Union, St Mark&#x27;s, and John Flynn relocated from central Townsville. This was followed by the relocation of St Raphael&#x27;s college for women. A large modernist building was established. In March 1962, first year university students painted the stick figure depicting The Saint on Castle Hill as a prank. In 1971 Cyclone Althea with flooding slowed progress of infrastructural building, but by 1972 James Cook University was established, with ecru academic gowns, quite different to those of older universities. From 1961, only the first years of studies for Medicine and for Veterinary Sciences were offered in Townsville, but the establishment of a new General Hospital at Mount Louisa provided facilities necessary for the establishment of an independent Medical School.

In 1970, Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. After visiting Brisbane, Longreach and Mount Isa the Royal Family travelled to Mackay. The royal party had a leisurely cruise to Townsville, taking four days to arrive after their departure from Mackay. On the morning of April 20, they were met by The Deputy Mayor of Townsville Mr. T. Aikens, M.L.A. and Mrs Aikens and Mr W.W. Shepherd, Chairman of the Townsville Harbour Board and Mrs Shepherd. The day’s program began with a cavalcade of progress at the Townsville sports reserve. The grounds were filled with crowds and children waving their Australian flag. It was a spectacle for the royal visitors and the local community who came out on the day.

Following lunch on board Britannia, the royal family were driven to the site of Queensland’s newest university, the James Cook University, Townsville campus. In the presence of many dignitaries, HRH Queen Elizabeth II formally granted autonomy to North Queensland’s new educational institution. In 2020, James Cook University celebrated its 50th anniversary with a Treasures exhibition, showcasing 50 collection items from Special Collections, Eddie Koiku Mabo Library, James Cook University, Townsville.

The rare collection item – ‘James Cook University Development: Pimlico to the First Chancellor archival footage, 1960 – 1970’ was one of the Treasures selected for the anniversary year. The 12min film preserved on NQHeritage, the University Library’s Special Collections online repository, shows footage of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II arriving at the official ceremony and being introduced to the official party. Their Royal Highnesses first appear in the film at 6:06 minutes.

On Christmas Eve 1971, Tropical Cyclone Althea, a category 4 cyclone, battered the city and Magnetic Island, causing considerable damage.

In 1973, Indigenous activists Eddie and Bonita Mabo established the Black Community School in Townsville, where children could learn their Indigenous culture rather than white culture. Eddie Mabo worked as a gardener at James Cook University in the 1970s and 1980s. It was at the university in 1974 that he first learned of the implications of the &quot;terra nullius&quot; doctrine which held that he did not legally own the land he believed was his under the traditional land inheritance system of his people.

===1980s===
Buchanan&#x27;s Hotel in Flinders Street, regarded by architectural historians as Australia&#x27;s most significant building in the Filigree style, was lost to fire in 1982.

In 1981 a land rights conference was held at James Cook University and Eddie Mabo made a speech to the audience where he explained the land inheritance system on Murray Island. The significance of this in terms of Australian common law doctrine was taken note of by one of the attendees, a lawyer, who suggested there should be a test case to claim land rights through the court system. Mabo decided to take on the Australian Government. Perth-based solicitor Greg McIntyre was at the conference and agreed to take the case; he then recruited barristers Ron Castan and Bryan Keon-Cohen. McIntyre represented Mabo during the hearings. The James Cook University Douglas campus library is now named after Mabo.

===1990s===
On 3 June 1992, the High Court of Australia ruled in favour of Eddie Mabo in &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; recognising native title in Australia for the first time.

In 1993, the New South Wales Rugby League announced that a team from Townsville would be admitted to the expanded, nation-wide competition, and the North Queensland Cowboys made their debut in the 1995 ARL season.

===2000–present===
In October 2000, a Solomon Islands Peace Agreement was negotiated in Townsville.

In February 2019, Townsville experienced a major flood event, which caused five deaths. Floodwaters damaged approximately 3300 homes and about 1500 homes were rendered uninhabitable.

==Urban layout==

Inner-city high-density development has also created population growth and gentrification of the central business district (CBD). One significant contributor to CBD development was the construction of a new rail passenger terminal and re-siting of the railway workshops, releasing prime real estate which formerly belonged to Queensland Rail for the development of residential units, retail projects and a new performing arts centre. The skyline of Townsville&#x27;s central business district has undergone dramatic changes over the last few years, with a number of new highrise buildings, both commercial and residential, constructed.

In the short term, much of the urban expansion will continue to the west and the north, in the former City of Thuringowa. The most significant of these is North Shore Estate, a new A$1 billion 5,000-lot housing estate, located close to the Bruce Highway, just north of the Bohle River.

Medium-term city expansion will be focused on two major urban developments that have started in 2017 and 2018. Elliot Springs, a satellite city to the south of Townsville developed by national developer Lendlease Group, is expected to be home to 26,000 people by 2057. Additionally, the Queensland Government announced it will be offering of state-owned land (the former abattoir reserve), just south of the Bohle River, for urban expansion.

==Geography==

Townsville lies approximately north of Brisbane, and south of Cairns. It lies on the shores of Cleveland Bay, protected to some degree from the predominantly south-east weather. Cleveland Bay is mostly shallow inshore, with several large beaches and continually shifting sand bars. Magnetic Island lies offshore, to the north of the city centre. It, together with Castle Hill in the town centre and Mount Stuart to the south of the city, form a large quartz monzonite igneous province.The Ross River flows through the city. Three weirs, fish stocking and dredging of the river in these reaches has resulted in a deep, stable and clean waterway used for many recreational activities such as water skiing, fishing and rowing. from the mouth (at the junction of Five Head Creek) is the Ross River Dam, the major water storage for the urban areas.

The historic waterfront on Ross Creek, site of the original wharves and port facilities, has some old buildings mixed with the later modern skyline. However, the central city is dominated by the mass of red granite of Castle Hill, high. There is a lookout at the summit giving panoramic views of the city and its suburbs, including Cleveland Bay and Magnetic Island. There are a number of parks scattered throughout the city, including three botanical gardens — Anderson Park, Queens Gardens and The Palmetum.

===Climate===

Townsville has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Owing to a quirk of geographical location, Townsville&#x27;s winter rainfall in particular is not as high as elsewhere in the eastern coastal tropics of Queensland, such as Cairns. The winter months are dominated by southeast trade winds and mostly fine weather. Further north the coastline runs north–south and the trade winds are lifted to produce rainfall right through the year. Townsville, however, lies on a section of coastline that turns east/west, so the lifting effect is not present. As a result, winter months are dominated by blue skies, warm days and cool nights, although at times significant rainfall may occur.

The average annual rainfall is on an average 61 rain days, most of which falls during the six-month &quot;wet season&quot; from November to April. Because of the &quot;hit or miss&quot; nature of tropical lows and thunderstorms, and the powerful influence of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, variation from year to year is almost uniquely large for such a wet climate, being comparable only to a few cities in the Northeast of Brazil (e.g. Fortaleza). Since records at various urban locations started in 1871 twelve-month rainfalls in Townsville have ranged from a mere between December 1901 and November 1902 at the peak of the Federation Drought, to as much as between March 1990 and February 1991. On average, the driest year in ten can expect only half the mean rainfall, compared to around 64 percent in Brisbane, 68 percent in Sydney, and 72 percent in Darwin.

Rainfall also varies considerably within the metropolitan area; it typically ranges from at central Townsville City to at Woodstock, a southwestern suburb. The wettest 24 hours on record was 11 January 1998, with falling mostly in a 12-hour period after dark, which has since been dubbed the &quot;Night of Noah&quot; by Townsville residents.

December is the warmest month of the year with daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures being and respectively. July is the coolest month with daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures being and . Townsville experiences an annual mean of 8.5 hours of sunshine per day, averaging 120.8 clear days per year.

====Tropical cyclones and flooding====
Like most of Northern Australia, Townsville is susceptible to tropical cyclones. They usually occur between December and April, forming mainly out in the Coral Sea, and usually tracking west to the coast. Notable cyclones to affect the Townsville Region have been: Cyclone Kirrily (2024), Cyclone Yasi (2011), Cyclone Tessi (2000), Cyclone Sid (1998, in particular damaging The Strand and causing major flooding), Cyclone Joy (1990), Cyclone Althea (1971), Cyclone Leonta (1903), and Cyclone Sigma (1896).

==Governance==
Townsville has offices of many State and Federal Government agencies, such as Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office.

===Local===
Townsville is governed by a City Council, comprising an independently elected Mayor and 10 Councillors who each represent a separate division within the local government area. Following local government reform undertaken by the Government of Queensland prior to the March 2008 elections, the previous entities of NQ Water, The City of Townsville and the City of Thuringowa were amalgamated.

In the 2024 Townsville City Council election, Troy Thompson (Independent), was sworn in as Mayor of Townsville. The previous Mayor of Townsville was Jenny Hill, a member of the Labor Party. Hill was elected in April 2012, replacing the retiring Les Tyrell and defeating main opposing candidate Dale Last. Tyrell was the immediate past Mayor for 17 years of the former local government authority, the City of Thuringowa. The previous Mayor of Townsville for 19 years was Tony Mooney (Australian Labor Party). Hill faced a largely hostile chamber in her first term, with &#x27;Townsville First&#x27; candidates winning the majority of divisions. When local government elections were held in March 2016, Jenny Hill was re-elected as Mayor of Townsville. She was re-elected in the 2020 Queensland local government elections.

<text>Charles Collé (14 April 1709 – 3 November 1783) was a French dramatist and songwriter.

==Biography==
The son of a notary, he was born in Paris. He became interested in the rhymes of Jean Heguanier, the most famous writer of couplets in Paris. From a notary&#x27;s office, Collé was transferred to that of the receiver-general of finance, where he remained for nearly twenty years. When about seventeen, however, he made the acquaintance of Alexis Piron, and afterwards, through Gallet (1698?–1757), of Panard. The example of these three masters of the vaudeville decided his future but also made him diffident; and for some time he composed nothing but &quot;amphigouris&quot;—verses whose merit was measured by their unintelligibility. The friendship of the younger Crébillon helped broaden his horizons, and the establishment in 1729 of the famous &quot;Société du Caveau&quot;, a drinking-club known for its wit and good company, gave him a field for the display of his fine talent for popular song.

In 1739 the Society of the Caveau, which numbered among its members Helvétius, Charles Pinot Duclos, Pierre Joseph Bernard, called Gentil-Bernard, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Alexis Piron, and the two Crébillons, was dissolved, and was not reconstituted till twenty years afterwards. His first and his best comedy, &quot;La Vérité dans le vin&quot;, appeared in 1747.

Meanwhile, Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, who was an excellent comic actor, particularly in representations of low life, and had been looking out for an author to write suitable parts for him, made Collé his reader. It was for the duke and his associates that Collé composed the greater part of his &quot;Théâtre de société&quot;. In 1763 Collé produced at the Théâtre Français &quot;Dupuis et Desronais&quot;, a successful sentimental comedy, which was followed in 1771 by &quot;La Veuve&quot;, which was a complete failure. In 1774 appeared &quot;La Partie de chasse de Henri Quatre&quot; (partly taken from Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;King and the Miller of Mansfield&quot;), Collé&#x27;s last and best play.

From 1748 to 1772, besides these and a multitude of songs, Collé was writing his &quot;Journal&quot;, a curious collection of literary and personal strictures on his companions as well as on their enemies, on Piron as on Voltaire, on La Harpe as on Pierre Corneille.

Collé&#x27;s lyrics are frank and jovial, though often licentious. The subjects are love and wine; occasionally, however, as in the famous lyric (1756) &quot;On the capture of Port Mahon&quot;, for which the author received a pension of 600 &quot;livre&quot;s, the note of patriotism is struck with no unskilful hand, while in many others Collé shows considerable epigrammatic force.

== Works ==
Sainte-Beuve saw in Collé an historical and moral witness of his time.

The plays he composed for the Duke of Orleans were collected under the title &quot;Théâtre de société&quot;, 1768, 2 volumes in-8. 
Some of his parades are, but truncated and disfigured in &quot;Théâtre des Boulevards&quot;, 1756.

The collection of his songs, published in 1807, form 2 volumes in-18.

<text>Alexis Piron (9 July 1689 – 21 January 1773) was a French epigrammatist and dramatist.

==Life==
Alexis Piron was born in Dijon, where his father, Aimé Piron, was an apothecary. Piron senior wrote verse in the Burgundian language. Alexis began life as clerk and secretary to a banker, and then studied law. In 1719, when nearly thirty years old, he went to Paris, where an accident brought him money and notoriety. The jealousy of the regular actors produced an edict restricting the Théâtre de la Foire, or licensed booths at fair times, to a single character on the stage. None of the ordinary writers for this theatre would attempt a monologue-drama for the purpose, and Piron made a great success with a piece called &quot;Arlequin Deucalion&quot;, representing Deucalion immediately after the Deluge, amusing himself with recreating in succession the different types of man.

In 1728 he produced &quot;Les Fils ingrats&quot; (known later as &quot;L&#x27;Ecole des pères&quot;) at the Comédie-Française. He attempted tragedy in &quot;Callisthene&quot; (1730), &quot;Gustave Vasa&quot; (1733) and &quot;Fernand Cortes&quot; (1744), but none of these succeeded, and Piron returned to comedy with &quot;La Metromanie&quot; (1738), in which the hero, Damis, suffers from the verse mania.

His most intimate associates at this time were Mademoiselle Quinault, the actress, and her friend Marie Thérèse Quénaudon, known as Mlle de Bar. This lady was slightly older than Piron and not beautiful, but after twenty years&#x27; acquaintance he married her in 1741. He was elected in 1753 to the Académie française, but his enemies raked up a certain &quot;Ode à Priape&quot;, dating from his early days, and induced Louis XV to interpose his veto. Piron was nevertheless given a pension, and during the last fifty years of his life was never in want. His best title to remembrance lies in his epigrams. The burlesque epitaph on himself, in which he ridicules the Academy—&quot;Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien/Pas même académicien&quot; &quot;Here lies Piron, who was nothing,/Not even a member of the [French] Academy&quot;—is well-known, among many others. Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm called him a &quot;machine a saillies.&quot; He was later (1762) elected to membership in the Académie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon.

Piron published his own theatrical works in 1758, and after his death his friend and literary executor, Rigoley de Juvigny, published his &quot;Œuvres completes&quot;. M. Bonhomme produced a critical edition in 1859, completed by &quot;Poésies choisies et pièces inédites&quot; in 1879.

Piron is compared to the Elder in The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Pavlovich as a compliment of wit.

<text>The Coleco Adam is a home computer and expansion device for the ColecoVision by American toy and video game manufacturer Coleco. The Adam was an attempt to follow on the success of the company&#x27;s ColecoVision video game console. It was available as Expansion Module #3 for the ColecoVision, converting it into a home computer, and as a standalone unit. As such, it had the benefit of being entirely compatible with all ColecoVision games and peripherals. The computer came with 64 KB of memory, a tape drive for a proprietary medium called Digital Data Packs, a daisy wheel printer, and productivity applications, along with two DDPs for SmartBASIC and &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom Super Game&quot;. It was released in October 1983 with the initial price of $700.

Although its presentation and concept were positively received, the Adam was heavily criticized upon launch for numerous hardware defects in early units, with some potentially rendering the device unusable. The Adam also suffered from store availability issues, with Coleco having shipped only 95,000 units rather than the goal of 500,000 by the end of 1983. The Adam was discontinued in January 1985, with Coleco never recovering from the losses incurred. The company discontinued its ColecoVision shortly afterward and finally declared itself bankrupt in 1988.

Despite its failures, it has gained a following among enthusiasts, who continue to develop hardware and software for it.

==History==
Coleco announced the Adam at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in June 1983, and executives predicted sales of 500,000 by Christmas 1983. From the time of the computer&#x27;s introduction to the time of its shipment, the price increased, from to .

The Adam announcement received favorable press coverage. Competitors such as Commodore and Atari almost immediately announced similar computer/printer bundles. The company engaged in an extensive marketing campaign, with television commercials for &quot;boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers ... the two groups that really fuel computer purchases&quot;, and print advertisements in nontechnical publications like &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;People&quot;.

The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, observing that Adam&#x27;s $600 price was comparable to the lowest price for a letter-quality printer alone, stated &quot;a nice trick if they can do it!&quot; It was a trick; the computers were shown behind tinted glass that hid the fact that they were hand-made and had non-working tape drives. In June, Coleco promised to ship the computer by August. In August it promised to ship a half million Adams by Christmas, but missed shipping dates of 1 September, 15 September, 1 October, and 15 October. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; reported that Coleco had not shipped by early October because of various problems. Each month of delay could mean losing the opportunity to sell 100,000 units, the magazine reported, adding that missing the Christmas season would result in &quot;inestimable losses&quot;. CEO Arnold Greenberg promised in late September to ship by &quot;mid-October&quot;, but claimed that Adam was &quot;not, primarily, a Christmas item&quot;. The printer was the main cause of the delays; after it failed to function properly at demonstrations, by November &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported on &quot;growing skepticism&quot; about its reliability, speed, and noise.

Greenberg refused to say how many units he expected Coleco to ship by the end of the year. The company did not ship review units to magazines planning to publish reviews before Christmas, stating that all were going to dealers, but admitted that it would not meet the company&#x27;s goal of shipping 400,000 computers by the end of the year; Kmart and JCPenney announced in November that it would not sell the Adam during the Christmas season because of lack of availability. Despite much consumer interest for Adam and a shortage of competing home computers, Coleco shipped only 95,000 units by December, many of which were defective; &quot;Creative Computing&quot; later reported that &quot;the rumored return rate was absolutely alarming&quot;. One store manager stated that five of six sold Adams had been returned, and expected that the sixth would likely be returned after being opened on Christmas. Coleco partnered with Honeywell Information Systems to open up repair chain stores around the nation. By December 1983, the press reported that company executives at a news conference &quot;fielded questions about Coleco&#x27;s problems with its highly publicized new Adam home computer, which has been plagued by production delays and complaints of defects&quot;, with the company able to fulfill only one third of its Canadian orders for Christmas. Less than 10% of Adam units had defects, the company claimed, &quot;well below industry standards&quot;.

An analyst stated in early 1984 that the company had

By March 1984, John J. Anderson declared Adam as having caused for Coleco &quot;a trail of broken promises, unfulfilled expectations, and extremely skittish stockholders&quot;. On January 2, 1985, after continuing complaints about Adam failures and low sales, Coleco announced that it was discontinuing the Adam and would be selling off its inventory.
Coleco revealed that it lost in late 1983 (the time of the Adam&#x27;s launch), along with a loss of in the first 9 months of 1984. Coleco did not reveal which company they were selling the inventory to, but stated that they had worked with this partner before. No final sales numbers were revealed of the Adam computer and expansion, but one analyst estimated that Coleco had sold 350,000 Adams in 1983 and 1984.

==Technical details==

In its favor, the Adam had a large software library from the start. It was derived from the ColecoVision and is compatible with the ColecoVision&#x27;s software and accessories; in addition, the popular CP/M operating system was available as an option. Its price gave a complete system: a computer with 64 KB of RAM, a tape drive for a proprietary medium called Digital Data Packs, a letter-quality daisy wheel printer, a typewriter application, and a word processor called SmartWriter, along with two DDPs for SmartBASIC and the &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom Super Game&quot;. The IBM PCjr sold for $669 but included no peripherals, and although the popular Commodore 64 sold for around $200, its price was not much lower after the purchase of a printer, tape or disk drive, and software.

Like many home computers of its day, the Adam was designed to be able to use a television set for its display via an included RF port and RF modulator; it also supported higher-quality video output to a contemporary computer monitor via a built-in composite video port or a DIN connector (which also carried audio). The SmartWriter electronic typewriter loaded when the system was turned on. In this mode, the system operated just like a typewriter, printing letters as soon as the user typed them. Pressing the Escape/WP key put SmartWriter into word processor mode, which functioned similarly to a modern word processor.

==SmartBASIC==
Unlike other home computers at the time, the Adam did not have its BASIC interpreter stored in ROM. Instead, it featured a built-in electronic typewriter and word processor, SmartWriter, as well as the Elementary Operating System (EOS) OS kernel and the 8 KB OS-7 ColecoVision operating system. The SmartBASIC interpreter was delivered on a Digital Data Pack tape cassette; this version of BASIC was designed to be mostly compatible with Applesoft BASIC. The interpreter was developed by Randall Hyde of Lazer Microsystems.

Software developers who received technical information from Coleco had to agree to an extremely restrictive license. Coleco demanded the right to inspect and demand changes in their software, forced them to destroy inventories of software if Coleco revoked the license, and prohibited them from publicly criticizing Coleco in any way.

A less expensive version of the Adam plugged into a ColecoVision, which delivered on one of ColecoVision&#x27;s launch commitments that owners would one day be able to upgrade their game system to a fully featured computer system.

==Printer==
The Adam printer computer used daisy wheel printing, giving a higher quality print than most dot-matrix printers of the time. The print ribbon was a one-time ribbon, of the type also used by IBM Selectric typewriters. The one-time ribbon produced better quality print than reusable ribbons, but they needed to be replaced more often. While the print quality was high, the print speed was quite low. Daisy wheels with different fonts were available, but difficult to find. The printer had a friction feed rather than a tractor feed system, so they didn&#x27;t need continuous form paper. The printer was only capable of printing text, so it couldn&#x27;t do graphics (other than ASCII art).

==Technical issues==
Many early Adams were defective. An author of the computer&#x27;s manual reported receiving &quot;300 calls on Christmas week&quot; from owners with problems, saying that some callers were on their fourth or fifth Adam. A defective computer could at the time only be repaired by mailing it to Coleco in Connecticut. Despite improving product quality and the Honeywell repair partnership, the company could not improve the computer&#x27;s poor reputation. Problems included:

* The Adam generates a surge of electromagnetic energy on startup, which can erase the contents of any removable media left in or near the drive. Making this problem worse, some of the Coleco manuals instructed the user to put the tape in the drive before turning the computer on. A sticker on later Adams warned users to not turn the power on or off with tapes in the drive.
* Since Coleco made the unusual decision of using the printer to supply power to the entire Adam system, if the printer&#x27;s power supply failed or the printer was missing, none of the system worked. Amstrad CPC and PC designs of the era did similar with the power supply in the monitor.
* Once put into Word Processor mode, SmartWriter could not get back into the typewriter mode without the system being rebooted.
* The Adam&#x27;s Digital Data Pack drives, although faster and of higher capacity than the audio cassette drives used for competing computers, were less reliable and still not as fast as a floppy disk drive. At the time of Adam&#x27;s design, tape drives were still a popular storage medium for home users, but by the time of its release, floppy disks had dropped in cost and in some markets were the preferred medium. Coleco eventually shipped a 160 KB 5¼ inch disk drive for the Adam.

==Software==

ColecoVision software that was not built-in was mostly on ROM cartridges, with AdamCalc, Personal Checkbook, and SmartFiler programs also being on tape.

==Reception==
To showcase the machine at the 1983 Summer CES in Chicago, Coleco decided to demonstrate a port of its ColecoVision conversion of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; on the system. Nintendo was in the midst of negotiating a deal with Atari to license its Famicom (later called the Nintendo Entertainment System) for distribution outside Japan, and the final signing would have been done at CES. Atari had exclusive rights to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; for home computers (as Coleco had for game consoles), and when Atari saw that Coleco was showing &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; on a computer, its proposed deal with Nintendo was delayed. Coleco had to agree not to sell the Adam version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Ultimately, it had no bearing on the Atari/Nintendo deal, as Atari&#x27;s CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month and the proposal went nowhere, with Nintendo deciding to market its system on its own.

The September 1983 issue of &quot;Byte&quot; reported that the Adam&#x27;s introduction had &quot;dominated&quot; the June CES in Chicago. Citing its $599 price, bundled hardware, and compatibility with ColecoVision and CP/M software, the magazine compared the Adam&#x27;s potential impact on the home-computer industry to that of the Osborne 1. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; reported in January 1984 that &quot;early indications were that the Adam would be a runaway best seller&quot; but the delays, technical problems, and Coleco&#x27;s reputation as a toy company &quot;should combine to keep buyers away in droves&quot;, and predicted that &quot;there is no reason to think that the Adam will topple the C-64 from the catbird seat&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s T. R. Reid gave &quot;an &#x27;A&#x27; for ingenuity [but] would have to stretch to give Adam a gentleman&#x27;s &#x27;C&#x27; for performance&quot; in January 1984. While praising the keyboard and SmartWriter&#x27;s ease of use, and calling the data pack &quot;a reasonable compromise&quot;, he described the documentation as &quot;wholly inadequate&quot; and &quot;generally inexcusable&quot;. Reid said that &quot;a more serious flaw with Adam is in the hardware&quot;, citing defects in a data pack and both the printer and a replacement, and the computer&#x27;s unusability without a working printer. He concluded that &quot;I&#x27;d dearly like to&quot; recommend the Adam, but &quot;for the time being, though, I&#x27;d advise you to proceed with caution&quot;, including confirming that the computer worked before leaving the store. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; in February 1984 was more favorable. Calling the bundle &quot;the most revolutionary concept in how to design and sell a home computer that we have seen&quot;, it also praised the keyboard and SmartWriter. While citing flaws such as the &quot;slow and very noisy printer&quot;, the magazine concluded that &quot;Adam competes with and overpowers everything else in its class&quot;, inferior only to the IBM PC and Apple IIe.

&quot;Compute!&quot;″s March 1984 review also approved of the Adam&#x27;s prepackaged, all-in-one nature and called the keyboard &quot;impressive&quot;, but cited widespread reports of hardware failures. &quot;Byte&quot;″s April 1984 review was much harsher, stating that &quot;it is often said that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The Coleco Adam is no exception to this rule&quot;. It called the tape-drive technology &quot;impressive&quot;, and approved of the keyboard, but reported several cases of data errors and deletions when using the tape drives, a buggy word processor, and a BASIC manual that was &quot;the worst I have ever seen&quot;. The reviewer reported that he was waiting for his fifth Adam after four previous systems malfunctioned in two months; only the keyboard did not fail. Surmising that &quot;the computer was apparently rushed into production&quot;, he advised &quot;don&#x27;t buy an Adam—yet. Wait until Coleco fixes all of the Adam&#x27;s bugs and delivers on all of its promises&quot;, and concluded &quot;Coleco is [apparently] betting the whole company on the Adam and it&#x27;s not yet clear that it&#x27;s going to win that bet&quot;.

The Adam received some good reviews based on the quality of its keyboard and printer, and offered competitive sound and graphics. Its BASIC interpreter, called SmartBASIC, was largely compatible with Applesoft BASIC, which meant that many type-in programs from computer books and magazines would work with the Adam with little or no modification.

Sales were weak, especially after the technical problems became obvious. Coleco lost $35 million in the fourth quarter of 1984 as returns flooded in. Officially, Coleco blamed &quot;manuals which did not offer the first-time user adequate assistance&quot;. Coleco reintroduced Adam with a new instruction manual, lower price, and a $500 college scholarship along with each unit for use by a young child (with $125 paid for each completed year of college). Fewer than 100,000 units ultimately sold.

A New York City-based advertising firm, Ketchum Advertising, won the assignment of promoting the computer. The agency staffed up to handle the work, and the prestige, of the new business. However, when the January 3, 1985, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Coleco was abandoning the computer, agency executives, who had no prior warning, were caught off-guard.

The Adam was permanently discontinued in 1985, less than two years after its introduction. Coleco never recovered from the $258 million it had suffered in losses, which has been attributed to the launch of the Adam. Shortly after, the company discontinued sales of its ColecoVision line of consoles, and, in 1988, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Because of its numerous defects and design flaws, several computer journalists consider it to be one of the worst personal computers of all time.

==Legacy==
Despite its critical and commercial failure, the Adam has attracted a group of enthusiasts who continue to develop hardware and software for the computer with the help of early dedicated newsletters. Third-party developers contributed to the overall success of the Adam after Coleco abandoned the Adam. Developers such as Orphanware, In House Reps, Thomas Electronics, Oasis Pensive, Eve, E&amp;T, Micro Innovations, Microfox Technologies and others added multiple-density disk drives, memory expanders, speech synthesizers, serial cards, printer cards, IDE cards and other hardware so the Adam could follow other computers into a newer modern age. A group of Adam enthusiasts have also been gathering every year since 1989 for an event called AdamCon.

<text>In geometry, the snub dodecahedron, or snub icosidodecahedron, is an Archimedean solid, one of thirteen convex isogonal nonprismatic solids constructed by two or more types of regular polygon faces.

The snub dodecahedron has 92 faces (the most of the 13 Archimedean solids): 12 are pentagons and the other 80 are equilateral triangles. It also has 150 edges, and 60 vertices.

It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or &quot;enantiomorphs&quot;) of each other. The union of both forms is a compound of two snub dodecahedra, and the convex hull of both forms is a truncated icosidodecahedron.

Kepler first named it in Latin as dodecahedron simum in 1619 in his Harmonices Mundi. H. S. M. Coxeter, noting it could be derived equally from either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron, called it snub icosidodecahedron, with a vertical extended Schläfli symbol formula_1 and flat Schläfli symbol 

==Cartesian coordinates==
Let be the real zero of the cubic polynomial , where is the golden ratio. Let the point be given by
formula_2
Let the rotation matrices and be given by
formula_3
 represents the rotation around the axis through an angle of counterclockwise, while being a cyclic shift of represents the rotation around the axis through an angle of . Then the 60 vertices of the snub dodecahedron are the 60 images of point under repeated multiplication by and/or , iterated to convergence. (The matrices and generate the 60 rotation matrices corresponding to the 60 rotational symmetries of a regular icosahedron.) The coordinates of the vertices are integral linear combinations of and . The edge length equals
formula_4
Negating all coordinates gives the mirror image of this snub dodecahedron.

As a volume, the snub dodecahedron consists of 80 triangular and 12 pentagonal pyramids.
The volume of one triangular pyramid is given by:
formula_5
and the volume of one pentagonal pyramid by:
formula_6
The total volume is
formula_7

The circumradius equals
formula_8
The midradius equals . This gives an interesting geometrical interpretation of the number . The 20 &quot;icosahedral&quot; triangles of the snub dodecahedron described above are coplanar with the faces of a regular icosahedron. The midradius of this &quot;circumscribed&quot; icosahedron equals 1. This means that is the ratio between the midradii of a snub dodecahedron and the icosahedron in which it is inscribed.

The triangle–triangle dihedral angle is given by
formula_9

The triangle–pentagon dihedral angle is given by
formula_10

==Metric properties==
For a snub dodecahedron whose edge length is 1, the surface area is
formula_11
Its volume is
formula_12
Alternatively, this volume may be written as 
formula_13
where
formula_14
Its circumradius is
formula_15
Its midradius is
formula_16

There are two inscribed spheres, one touching the triangular faces, and one, slightly smaller, touching the pentagonal faces. Their radii are, respectively:
formula_17

The four positive real roots of the sextic equation in &quot;R&quot;2
formula_18
are the circumradii of the snub dodecahedron (&quot;U&quot;29), great snub icosidodecahedron (&quot;U&quot;57), great inverted snub icosidodecahedron (&quot;U&quot;69), and great retrosnub icosidodecahedron (&quot;U&quot;74).

The snub dodecahedron has the highest sphericity of all Archimedean solids. If sphericity is defined as the ratio of volume squared over surface area cubed, multiplied by a constant of 36 (where this constant makes the sphericity of a sphere equal to 1), the sphericity of the snub dodecahedron is about 0.947.

==Orthogonal projections==

The &quot;snub dodecahedron &quot; has two especially symmetric orthogonal projections as shown below, centered on two types of faces: triangles and pentagons, corresponding to the A2 and H2 Coxeter planes.
==Geometric relations==

The &quot;snub dodecahedron&quot; can be generated by taking the twelve pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron and pulling them outward so they no longer touch. At a proper distance this can create the rhombicosidodecahedron by filling in square faces between the divided edges and triangle faces between the divided vertices. But for the snub form, pull the pentagonal faces out slightly less, only add the triangle faces and leave the other gaps empty (the other gaps are rectangles at this point). Then apply an equal rotation to the centers of the pentagons and triangles, continuing the rotation until the gaps can be filled by two equilateral triangles. (The fact that the proper amount to pull the faces out is less in the case of the snub dodecahedron can be seen in either of two ways: the circumradius of the snub dodecahedron is smaller than that of the icosidodecahedron; or, the edge length of the equilateral triangles formed by the divided vertices increases when the pentagonal faces are rotated.)

The snub dodecahedron can also be derived from the truncated icosidodecahedron by the process of alternation. Sixty of the vertices of the truncated icosidodecahedron form a polyhedron topologically equivalent to one snub dodecahedron; the remaining sixty form its mirror-image. The resulting polyhedron is vertex-transitive but not uniform. 

Alternatively, combining the vertices of the snub dodecahedron given by the Cartesian coordinates (above) and its mirror will form a semiregular truncated icosidodecahedron. The comparisons between these regular and semiregular polyhedrons is shown in the figure to the right.

Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of this alternative snub dodecahedron are obtained by selecting sets of 12 (of 24 possible even permutations contained in the five sets of truncated icosidodecahedron Cartesian coordinates). The alternations are those with an odd number of minus signs in these three sets: 
formula_19
and an even number of minus signs in these two sets:
formula_20

where formula_21 is the golden ratio. The mirrors of both the regular truncated icosidodecahedron and this alternative snub dodecahedron are obtained by switching the even and odd references to both sign and position permutations.

==Related polyhedra and tilings==
This semiregular polyhedron is a member of a sequence of snubbed polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure (3.3.3.3.&quot;n&quot;) and Coxeter–Dynkin diagram . These figures and their duals have (&quot;n&quot;32) rotational symmetry, being in the Euclidean plane for &quot;n&quot; = 6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher &quot;n&quot;. The series can be considered to begin with &quot;n&quot; = 2, with one set of faces degenerated into digons.

== Snub dodecahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a snub dodecahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the snub dodecahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 60 vertices and 150 edges, and is an Archimedean graph.

<doc id="287140" wikidata="Q379022" url="?curid=287140" title="Jean-François de La Harpe">
<text>Jean-François de La Harpe (20 November 1739 – 11 February 1803) was a French playwright, writer and literary critic.

== Life ==
La Harpe was born in Paris of poor parents. His father, who signed himself Delharpe, was a descendant of a noble family originally of Vaud. Left an orphan at the age of nine, La Harpe was taken care of for six months by the Sisters of Charity, and his education was provided for by a scholarship at the Collège d&#x27;Harcourt, now known as the Lycée Saint-Louis. When nineteen he was imprisoned for some months on the charge of having written a satire against his protectors at the college. He was imprisoned at For-l&#x27;Évêque. La Harpe always denied his guilt, but this culminating misfortune of an early life spent entirely in the position of a dependent possibly had something to do with the bitterness he evinced in later life.

In 1763, his tragedy of &quot;Warwick&quot; was played before the court. This, his first play, was perhaps the best he ever wrote. The many authors whom he afterwards offended were always able to observe that the critic&#x27;s own plays did not reach the standard of excellence he set up. &quot;Timoleon&quot; (1764) and &quot;Pharamond&quot; (1765) were box-office and critical failures. &quot;Mélanie&quot; was a better play, but was never represented. The success of &quot;Warwick&quot; led to a correspondence with Voltaire, who conceived a high opinion of La Harpe, even allowing him to correct his verses.

In 1764, La Harpe married the daughter of a coffee house keeper. This marriage, which proved very unhappy and was dissolved, did not improve his position. They were very poor, and for some time were guests of Voltaire at Ferney. When, after Voltaire&#x27;s death, La Harpe in his praise of the philosopher ventured on some reasonable, but rather ill-timed, criticism of individual works, he was accused of treachery to one who had been his constant friend.

In 1768, he returned from Ferney to Paris, where he began to write for the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. He was a born fighter and had little mercy on the authors whose work he handled. But he was himself violently attacked, and suffered under many epigrams, especially those of Lebrun-Pindare. No more striking proof of the general hostility can be given than his reception in 1776 at the Académie française, which Sainte-Beuve calls his &quot;execution&quot;. Marmontel, who received him, used the occasion to eulogize La Harpe&#x27;s predecessor, Charles-Pierre Colardeau, especially for his pacific, modest and indulgent disposition. The speech was punctuated by the applause of the audience, who chose to regard it as a series of sarcasms on the new member.

Eventually La Harpe was compelled to resign from the &quot;Mercure&quot;, which he had edited from 1770. On the stage he produced &quot;Les Barmecides&quot; (1778), &quot;Philoctete&quot;, &quot;Jeanne de Naples&quot; (1781), &quot;Les Brames&quot; (1783), &quot;Coriolan&quot; (1784), &quot;Virginie&quot; (1786). In 1786, he began delivering a course of literature at the newly established Lycée. In these lectures, published as the &quot;Cours de littérature ancienne et moderne&quot;, La Harpe is considered to have been at his best, finding a standpoint more or less independent of contemporary polemics. He is said to have been inexact in dealing with the ancients and that he had only a superficial knowledge of the Middle Ages, but he was excellent in his analysis of seventeenth-century writers. Sainte-Beuve found La Harpe to be the best critic of the French school of tragedy.

La Harpe was a disciple of the &quot;philosophes&quot;, supporting their extreme party through the excesses of 1792 and 1793. In 1793, he returned to edit the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, which blindly adhered to the revolutionary leaders. Nonetheless, in April 1794, La Harpe was seized as a &quot;suspect&quot;. In prison he underwent a spiritual crisis which he described in convincing language, emerging an ardent Catholic and a political reactionary. When he resumed his chair at the Lycée, he attacked his former friends in politics and literature. He was sufficiently imprudent to begin the publication of his 1774-1791 &quot;&quot; in 1801 with the grand-duke (and later emperor) Paul of Russia. In these letters he surpassed the brutalities of the &quot;Mercure&quot;.

He contracted a second marriage, which was dissolved after a few weeks by his wife. He died on 11 February 1803 in Paris, leaving in his will an incongruous exhortation to his fellow countrymen to maintain peace and concord. Among his posthumous works was a &quot;Prophétie de Cazotte&quot;, which Sainte-Beuve pronounced his best work. It is a somber description of a dinner-party of notables long before the Revolution, in which Jacques Cazotte is made to prophesy the frightful fates awaiting the various individuals of the company.

Among his works not already mentioned are: &quot;Commentaire sur Racine&quot; (1795–1796), published in 1807; &quot;Commentaire sur le théâtre de Voltaire&quot; of earlier date (published posthumously in 1814); and an epic poem &quot;La Religion&quot; (1814). His &quot;Cours de littérature&quot; has been often reprinted; a notice by Pierre Daunou prefixes the 1825–1826 edition.

=== Works ===
La Harpe wrote numerous plays, of which almost all are completely forgotten. Only &quot;Warwick&quot; and &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, imitated from Sophocles, had some success.

A particular mention must be made of &quot;Mélanie, ou les Vœux forcés&quot;, that the author had printed in 1770 but which was not played before 7 December 1791 at the Théâtre français. It remains, according to Jacques Truchet, &quot;the most curious of his plays and the most representative of the spirit of the times.&quot; The topic - forced wishes - could suit anticlericalism that La Harpe showed when he composed this piece but much less censorship of the time, which is why it was played after the French Revolution. Although presented as a play in three acts and verse, &quot;Melanie&quot; approached the drama that would experience the fortune that we know at the end of the eighteenth.

This comparison is all the more pungent than La Harpe had always professed the greatest contempt for drama, which he violently attacked in his comedy &quot;Molière à la nouvelle salle&quot;, written in defense of the Comédie-Française against competitor theaters.

Moreover, his &quot;Correspondance littéraire&quot; addressed to Grand duke Paul I of Russia is full of theatrical anecdotes about the actors and plays of his time.

=== Critics ===
La Harpe&#x27;s main work is his &quot;Lycée ou Cours de littérature&quot; (1799), which brings in 18 volumes of lessons he had given for twelve years in high school. It is a monument of literary criticism. Even if some parts are low - that on ancient philosophers in particular - everything that is said about the drama of Corneille to Voltaire, is beautifully thought out and reasoned, even if the thinking and reasoning is that of a purist and often picky. The passages on contemporary authors, in which La Harpe attacks vigorously the philosophical party, are often very funny.

<text>Langdon Winner (born August 7, 1944) is Thomas Phelan Chair of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York.

Langdon Winner was born in San Luis Obispo, California. He received his B.A. in 1966, M.A. in 1967 and Ph.D. in 1973, all in political science at the University of California, Berkeley. His primary focus was political theory.

He has been a professor at Leiden, MIT, University of California, Los Angeles and at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Since 1985 he has been at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; he was a visiting professor at Harvey Mudd College (2000) and Colgate University (2001). In 2010 he was a Fulbright Fellow visiting the Universidad Complutense in Madrid.

Winner lives in upstate New York. He is married to Gail P. Stuart and has three children. His interests include science, technology, American popular culture, and theories of sustainability.

Winner is known for his articles and books on science, technology, and society. He also spent several years as a reporter, rock music critic, and contributing editor for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

==Technology and politics==
In 1980 Winner proposed that technologies embody social relations, i.e. power. To the question he poses &quot;Do Artifacts Have Politics?&quot;, Winner identifies two ways in which artifacts can have politics. The first, involving technical arrangements and social order, concerns how the invention, design, or arrangement of artifacts or the larger system becomes a mechanism for settling the affairs of a community. This way &quot;transcends the simple categories of &#x27;intended&#x27; and &#x27;unintended&#x27; altogether&quot;, representing &quot;instances in which the very process of technical development is so thoroughly biased in a particular direction that it regularly produces results heralded as wonderful breakthroughs by some social interests and crushing setbacks by others&quot; (Winner, p. 25-6, 1999). It implies that the process of technological development is critical in determining the politics of an artifact; hence the importance of incorporating all stakeholders in it. (Determining who the stakeholders are and how to incorporate them are other questions entirely.)

The second way in which artifacts can have politics refers to artifacts that correlate with particular kinds of political relationships, which Winner refers to as inherently political artifacts (Winner, p. 22, 1999). He distinguishes between two types of inherently political artifacts: those that require a particular sociological system and those that are strongly compatible with a particular sociological system (Winner, p. 29, 1999). A further distinction is made between conditions internal to the workings of a given technical system and those that are external to it (Winner, p. 33, 1999). This second way in which artifacts can have politics can be further articulated as consisting of four &#x27;types&#x27; of artifacts: those requiring a particular internal sociological system, those compatible with a particular internal sociological system, those requiring a particular external sociological system, and those compatible with a particular external sociological system.

Certain features of Winner&#x27;s thesis have been criticized by other scholars, including Bernward Joerges.

==Music==
Winner contributed piano and backing vocals to the hoax album The Masked Marauders created by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He also played piano on &quot;Church Key&quot; by The Revels. Winner is also notable for having written a negative review of one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 1970&#x27;s, Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;.

== Critique of educational technologies ==
Over the years one focus of Winner&#x27;s criticism has been the excessive use of technologies in the classroom, both in K-12 schools and higher education. Winner&#x27;s critique is well explained in his article &quot;Information Technology and Educational Amnesia,&quot; and expressed in his satirical lecture, &quot;The Automatic Professor Machine.&quot;

<text>Jacques Cazotte (; 17 October 1719 – 25 September 1792) was a French author and a monarchist. He predicted the Reign of Terror and was guillotined shortly after.

==Life==
Born in Dijon, he was educated by the Jesuits. Cazotte then worked for the French Ministry of
the Marine and at the age of 27 he obtained a public office at Martinique. It was not until his return to Paris in 1760 with the rank of commissioner-general that he made his public debut as an author. His first attempts, a mock romance and a coarse song, gained so much popularity, both in the Court and among the people, that he was encouraged to try something more ambitious. He accordingly produced his romance, &quot;Les Prouesses inimitables d&#x27;Ollivier, marquis d&#x27;Edesse&quot;.

Cazotte wrote a number of fantastic oriental tales, such as his children&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;La patte du chat&quot;
(&quot;The Cat&#x27;s Paw&quot;, 1741) and the humorous &quot;Mille et une fadaises, Contes a dormir debout&quot;
(&quot;The Thousand and One Follies, Tales to Sleep Upright&quot; 1742). His first success was with a &quot;poem&quot; in twelve cantos, and in prose intermixed with verse, entitled &quot;Ollivier&quot; (2 vols, 1762), followed in 1771 by another romance, the &quot;Lord Impromptu&quot;. But the most popular of his works was &quot;Le Diable amoureux&quot; (&quot;The Devil in Love&quot;, 1772), a fantastic tale in which the hero raises the Devil. The value of the story lies in the picturesque setting, and the skill with which its details are carried out.

Cazotte copy-edited, adapted, and expanded French translations of tales actually and supposedly belonging to the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; provided to him by the Syrian priest Dom Denis Chavis. These stories were published in Geneva in 1788–89, independently as &quot;Continuation des Mille et Une Nuits&quot; and, in the &quot;Cabinet des Fées&quot; anthology, as &quot;Suites des Mille et Une Nuits&quot; (1788–1789).

Cazotte possessed extreme facility that he is said to have dashed off a seventh canto of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Guerre civile de Genève&quot; in a single night. Circa 1775 Cazotte, embraced the creed of the Illuminati and declared himself possessed of the power of prophecy. It was upon this event that Jean-François de la Harpe based his famous &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot;, in which he represents Cazotte as prophesying the most minute events of the French Revolution. Near the end of his life, Cazotte became a follower of the Martinist mysticism of Martinez de Pasqually, and became a &quot;mystical monarchist&quot;. Upon the discovery of some of his counter-revolutionary letters in August 1792, Cazotte was arrested. He escaped for a time through the efforts of his daughter but was guillotined in September.

==Writings==
A complete edition of his work was published as the &quot;Œuvres badines et morales, historiques et philosophiques de Jacques Cazotte&quot; (4 vols, 1816–1817), though more than one collection appeared during his lifetime. Cazotte&#x27;s work was an influence on later fantasy writers
such as E. T. A. Hoffmann, Charles Nodier, Gérard de Nerval and Théophile Gautier.

<text>The lowland nyala or simply nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) is a spiral-horned artiodactyl antelope native to Southern Africa. The species is part of the family Bovidae and the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; (formerly placed in the genus &quot;Nyala&quot;). It was first described in 1849 by George French Angas and exhibits the highest sexual dimorphism among the spiral-horned antelopes. It is not to be confused with the endangered mountain nyala living in the Bale region of Ethiopia.

The nyala&#x27;s range encompasses much of Southern Africa. As its population is relatively stable, it has been listed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It generally browses during the day in warm weather and during the night in the rainy season. As a herbivore, the nyala feeds upon foliage, fruits and grasses, and requires sufficient fresh water. A shy animal, it prefers water holes rather than open spaces. The nyala does not show signs of territoriality, and individuals&#x27; areas can overlap. They are very cautious creatures. 

They live in single-sex or mixed family groups of up to ten individuals, but old males live alone. They inhabit thickets within dense and dry savanna woodlands. The principal threats to the species are illegal poaching and habitat loss resulting from human settlement and livestock grazing. However, the large-horned, impressive males are highly prized as game animals by sport hunters.

==Taxonomy and naming==

The nyala was first described by George French Angas, an English naturalist, in 1849. The scientific name of nyala is &quot;Tragelaphus angasii&quot;. The name &quot;angasii&quot; is attributed to Angas, who said that John Edward Gray had named this species after Angas&#x27; father, George Fife Angas of South Australia. According to Article 50.1.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, though, this is insufficient to state Gray as the author. The name &quot;nyala&quot; is the Tsonga name for this antelope, which is likely the source of the English, along with Zulu . Its first known use was in 1899. The word has a Bantu origin, similar to the Venda word (nyala buck).

The nyala is the second taxon to branch off from the tragelaphine family tree just after the lesser kudu. As the nyala line has remained separate for a considerable time (over 5 million years), some authorities have placed it in its own monotypic genus &quot;Nyala&quot;. &quot;Nyala&quot; was proposed in 1912 by American zoologist Edmund Heller, who also proposed &quot;Ammelaphus&quot; for the lesser kudu, but it was not widely recognized. It was re-erected as a valid genus in 2011 under the classification of Peter Grubb and Colin Groves, but has not been embraced by taxonomic authorities such as the Mammal Diversity Database. Among its closest extant relatives are the forest-inhabiting bongo, the bushbuck, the large common and giant elands, the greater and lesser kudus, the mountain nyala (of Ethiopia) and the swamp-dwelling sitatunga, all of which share similar characteristics, such as hornless females, vertical side-stripes and other unique white markings, and the spiraling horns and distinct &quot;beard&quot; or dewlap of males, often with a raised trail of fur extending down the back and underside.
In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) and colleagues carried out a mitochondrial DNA analysis of the nine &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; species. Mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA data were compared. The results showed the tribe Tragelaphini to be monophyletic, with the lesser kudu (&quot;T.  imberbis&quot;) basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala. On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. However, nuclear DNA data shows lesser kudu and nyala forming a clade, which collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.

===Genetics and evolution===
The nyala has 55 male chromosomes and 56 female chromosomes. The Y chromosome has been translocated onto the 14th chromosome, as in other tragelaphids, but no inversion of the Y chromosome occurs. Cranial studies have shown that the mountain nyala and nyala, though sharing a common name, are actually distant relatives.

Fossil evidence suggests that the nyala has been a separate species since the end of the Miocene (5.8 million years ago). Genetic evidence suggests that the proto-nyala had some early hybridization with the proto-lesser kudu, but the two have remained separate long after this crossing.

==Physical description==

The nyala is a spiral-horned and middle-sized antelope, between a bushbuck and a kudu. It is considered the most sexually dimorphic antelope. The nyala is typically between in head-and-body length. The male stands up to , the female is up to tall. Males weigh , while females weigh . Life expectancy of the nyala is about 19 years.

The coat is rusty or rufous brown in females and juveniles. It grows a dark brown or slate grey in adult males, often with a bluish tinge. Females and young males have ten or more white vertical stripes on their sides. Other markings are visible on the face, throat, flanks and thighs. Stripes are very reduced or absent in older males. Both males and females have a white chevron between their eyes, and a long bushy tail white underside. Both sexes have a dorsal crest of hair running right from the back of the head to the end of the tail. Males have another line of hair along the midline of their chest and belly.

Only the males have horns. Horns are long and yellow-tipped. There are one or two twists. The spoor is similar to that of the bushbuck, but larger. It is long. The feces resemble round to spherical pellets. The nyala has hairy glands on its feet, which leave their scent wherever it walks.

The condition of the nyala often varies between the sexes. According to a study, this can be attributed to the differences in their body sizes. It was noted that during nutritional stress, old adults died in more numbers, of which most were males. During an attempt of blood sampling in the nyala, it was found that Vitamin E levels varied during stress.

==Parasites==
A study of the helminths from 77 nyalas from four game reserves in Natal revealed the presence of ten nematode species and four nematode genera, a trematode species and paramphistomes (members of superfamily &quot;Paramphistomoidea&quot;), and two cestode genera. The research discovered new parasites that the nyala was host of - namely a &quot;Cooperia rotundispiculum&quot; race, &quot;Gaigeria pachyscelis&quot;, a &quot;Gongylonema&quot; species, &quot;Haemonchus vegliai&quot;, &quot;Impalaia tuberculata&quot;, an &quot;Oesophagostomum&quot; species, a &quot;Setaria&quot; species, &quot;Trichostrongylus deflexus&quot;, &quot;Trichostrongylus falculatus&quot;, the larval stage of a &quot;Taenia&quot; species, a &quot;Thysaniezia&quot; species and &quot;Schistosoma mattheei&quot;. &quot;Ostertagia harrisi&quot; and &quot;C. rotundispiculum&quot; were the most dominant nematodes in the antelope.

Another study of 97 blood samples of South African nyalas revealed the presence of tick-borne hemoparasites (blood parasites). The methods used were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization. The dominant parasites were &quot;Theileria&quot; species, &quot;T. buffeli&quot;, &quot;T. bicornis&quot;, &quot;Ehrlichia&quot; species, &quot;Anaplasma marginale&quot; and &quot;A. bovis&quot;. Ten tick species, two louse species and a louse fly species were recovered in a study of 73 nyalas at Umfolozi, Mkuzi and Ndumu Game Reserves in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal in 1983 and 1984 and an additional six individuals in 1994. It was found that nyalas were hosts to all stages of development in &quot;Boophilus decoloratus&quot;, &quot;Rhipicephalus appendiculatus&quot; and &quot;R. muehlensi&quot; and the immature stages of &quot;Amblyomma hebraeum&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus maculatus&quot;. Adult males served hosts to more ticks and lice than adult females did. Also, a trypanosome was isolated from a nyala, wild-caught in Mozambique, which was diagnosed and found as akin to &quot;Trypanosoma vivax&quot;, based on biological, morphological and molecular data.

==Diseases==

The nyala can also suffer from myopathy. In between January 1973 and June 1981, 21 nyalas succumbed to the disease. The main symptoms were stiffness, inability to rise, and failure to suckle in newborns. Necrosis (that is, the premature death of cells in a living tissue) and mineralization were found in the skeletal muscle after a histological analysis. In the juveniles there was acute necrosis of the cardiac muscle. In adults, there was interstitial fibrosis of the cardiac muscle, along with arteriosclerosis.

In a report published in 1994 entitled &quot;Epidemiological observations on spongiform encephalopathies in captive wild animals in the British Isles&quot;, it was noted that spongiform encephalopathy had been diagnosed in one nyala captive in a zoo. The nyala was formerly affected by the disease rinderpest, although the viral disease is considered eradicated now.

==Ecology and behavior==

The nyala is active mainly in the early morning and late afternoon. It browses during the day if temperatures are and during the night in rainy season. These antelopes rest in thick bushes during the hot hours of the day. The nyala is very shy and cautious in nature, and often remains hidden rather than coming out in the open. Most sightings of the nyala in the wild are at water holes. But in protected areas they become less shy and often come out in view of tourists.

Nyala groups are according to sex or mixed. Herds usually browse and drink water together. Each group consists of two to ten individuals. A study in Zinave National Park at Mozambique showed that 67% of the observations were of groups of one to three nyalas, and the rest of the herds consisted of up to 30 nyalas. Herds often broke up and re-formed. Generally adult males remain alone. Females often remain near their mothers when they have their offspring, so the relationships in female herds may be closer than those of males.

Alert and wary in nature, the nyala use a sharp, high, dog-like bark to warn others in a group of danger. This feature is mainly used by females. They also react to the alarm calls of impala, baboon and kudu. The impala has been found to react to the calls of the nyala as well. The main predators of nyala are lion, leopard, cheetah, spotted hyena, African wild dog and nile crocodile while baboons and raptorial birds are predators of juveniles.

===Diet===

As a herbivore, the nyala&#x27;s diet consists of foliage, fruits, flowers and twigs. During the rainy season they feed upon the fresh grass. They need a regular intake of water, and thus choose places with a water source nearby. However, they are adapted to live in areas with only a seasonal availability of water. A study in Zululand showed that the nyala fed mainly in the early morning and the late afternoon. They feed at night during the rainy season.

A study in Mkhuze Game Reserve and Ndumu Game Reserve in Natal focused on the dietary habits of the impala and the nyala showed that the amount of dicotyledons in their diets varied seasonally. In the dry season, the nyala&#x27;s dicotyledon diet content was 83.2% and the impala&#x27;s 52%. In this season, the diet grew richer in fiber and dietary proteins were less. The reverse occurred in the rainy season. As the rainy season arrived, both species took to a diet of mainly monocotyledons, and the impala consumed more of them. The diet contained more proteins than fiber.

Another study was done to find whether the sexual dimorphism in the nyala influenced its foraging habits. Vegetation surveys were conducted with the end of each feeding bout. It was found that females spent equal periods of time foraging in all the three habitats, but males preferred sand forest more. More differences were noted, as males ate woody species at a greater average height whereas females fed from the low herbaceous layer. It was concluded that the differences resulted from varying nutritional and energetic demands according to their diverse body sizes and differing reproductive strategies.

===Reproduction===

The nyala breeds throughout the year, but mating peaks in spring and autumn. The reason for this is still unknown, but attributed to the photoperiod and the feeding habits of the animal. Females reach sexual maturity at 11 to 12 months of age and males at 18 months (though they are socially immature until five years old), though they begin to show active spermatogenesis at 14 months.

Before ovulation, the Graafian follicles reach a length of at least . A female&#x27;s estrous cycle is about 19 days long. Males will attempt to mate with the female for two days of the cycle, but she allows it for only six hours per cycle. When the male enters a females&#x27; herd during mating, he makes a display by raising his white dorsal crest, lowering his horns and moving stiffly. As in many other animals, the males fight over dominance during mating.

The kidney fat indices (KFIs) of impalas and nyalas have been studied to understand the influence of social class and reproduction on them. To determine the KFI, the kidney is removed and weighed with the fat and once again excluding the fat. The resultant difference is the amount of fat on the kidney. The more the fat, the healthier the animal. In rut, male nyalas had lower KFIs, which did not vary much with the season. Pregnant females of both nyala and impala had higher KFIs than non-pregnant ones.

There is a significant increase in corpus luteum in the last third of gestation. Gestation is of seven months. A single calf is born, weighing . Birth takes place generally away from the sight of predators, in places such as a thicket. The calf remains hidden for up to 18 days, and the mother nurses it at regular intervals. The calf remains with its mother until the birth of the next calf, during which males in rut drive it away from the mother.

==Habitat and distribution==

The nyala inhabits dense lowland woodlands and thickets, mainly in southern Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and eastern South Africa. It chooses places with good quality grasslands as well as provision of fresh water. It also inhabits lush green river country. The nyala&#x27;s natural range stretches across southeast Africa from the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi through Mozambique and Zimbabwe to eastern South Africa and Eswatini.

The geographic distribution of the nyala may be based on the genetic variation. According to a study of nyala in South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, there was a marked difference in the gene frequencies at three microsatellite loci. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed the presence of a unique haplotype in individuals from each location. Thus, the geographic variation in the nyala may be due to a distribution pattern based on habitat specificity.

Today nyala are found in South African protected areas in the Ndumo Game Reserve, uMkuze Game Reserve and Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve, all in KwaZulu-Natal, as well as in Kruger National Park. As of 1999, 10–15% of nyala occurred on private land. Efforts are being made to retain the populations of nyala in Gorongosa National Park and Banhine National Park in Mozambique. Nyala also thrive in Lengwe National Park in Malawi.

Nyala have never been observed showing territoriality. Territories of either sex overlap extensively. The home ranges of males are approximately equal to that of females, about in area.

==Threats and conservation==
The major threats to the population of the nyala are poaching, habitat loss, agriculture and cattle grazing. Rinderpest outbreaks have also contributed in population loss. This species is currently of Least Concern, and the population is considered stable by both the IUCN and CITES. As of 1999, the total population of the nyala was around 32,000 individuals. More recent estimates show that South Africa has at least 30,000 nyalas, with 25,000 in KwaZulu-Natal. There are now more than 1,000 on protected areas and ranches in Eswatini. In Mozambique there are not more than 3,000, in Zimbabwe over 1,000, and numbers in Malawi have fallen from 3,000 to about 1,500. Namibia has the smallest population, at about 250.

Today over 80% of the total population is protected in national parks and sanctuaries, mostly in South African protected areas. In South Africa there is a high demand for adult males as game trophies.

<text>The gray (symbol: Gy) is the unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units (SI), defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of matter.

It is used as a unit of the radiation quantity absorbed dose that measures the energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a unit mass of absorbing material, and is used for measuring the delivered dose in radiotherapy, food irradiation and radiation sterilization. It is important in predicting likely acute health effects, such as acute radiation syndrome and is used to calculate equivalent dose using the sievert, which is a measure of the stochastic health effect on the human body.

The gray is also used in radiation metrology as a unit of the radiation quantity kerma; defined as the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged ionizing radiation in a sample of matter per unit mass. The unit was named after British physicist Louis Harold Gray, a pioneer in the measurement of X-ray and radium radiation and their effects on living tissue. 

The gray was adopted as part of the International System of Units in 1975. The corresponding cgs unit to the gray is the rad (equivalent to 0.01 Gy), which remains common largely in the United States, though &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; in the style guide for U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

==Applications==
The gray has a number of fields of application in measuring dose:

===Radiobiology===
The measurement of absorbed dose in tissue is of fundamental importance in radiobiology and radiation therapy as it is the measure of the amount of energy the incident radiation deposits in the target tissue. The measurement of absorbed dose is a complex problem due to scattering and absorption, and many specialist dosimeters are available for these measurements, and can cover applications in 1-D, 2-D and 3-D.

In radiation therapy, the amount of radiation applied varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80 Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40 Gy. Preventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45–60 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers).

The average radiation dose from an abdominal X-ray is 0.7 millisieverts (0.0007 Sv), that from an abdominal CT scan is 8 mSv, that from a pelvic CT scan is 6 mGy, and that from a selective CT scan of the abdomen and the pelvis is 14 mGy.

===Radiation protection===

The absorbed dose also plays an important role in radiation protection, as it is the starting point for calculating the stochastic health risk of low levels of radiation, which is defined as the &quot;probability&quot; of cancer induction and genetic damage. The gray measures the total absorbed energy of radiation, but the probability of stochastic damage also depends on the type and energy of the radiation and the types of tissues involved. This probability is related to the equivalent dose in sieverts (Sv), which has the same dimensions as the gray. It is related to the gray by weighting factors described in the articles on equivalent dose and effective dose.

The International Committee for Weights and Measures states: &quot;In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose &quot;D&quot; and the dose equivalent &quot;H&quot;, the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose &quot;D&quot; and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent &quot;H&quot;.&quot;
:formula_1

The accompanying diagrams show how absorbed dose (in grays) is first obtained by computational techniques, and from this value the equivalent doses are derived. For X-rays and gamma rays the gray is numerically the same value when expressed in sieverts, but for alpha particles one gray is equivalent to 20 sieverts, and a radiation weighting factor is applied accordingly.

===Radiation poisoning===

The gray is conventionally used to express the severity of what are known as &quot;tissue effects&quot; from doses received in acute exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. These are effects that are &quot;certain&quot; to happen, as opposed to the uncertain effects of low levels of radiation that have a &quot;probability&quot; of causing damage. A whole-body acute exposure to 5 grays or more of high-energy radiation usually leads to death within 14 days. LD1 is 2.5 Gy, LD50 is 5 Gy and LD99 is 8 Gy. The LD50 dose represents 375 joules for a 75 kg adult.

===Absorbed dose in matter===
The gray is used to measure absorbed dose rates in non-tissue materials for processes such as radiation hardening, food irradiation and electron irradiation. Measuring and controlling the value of absorbed dose is vital to ensuring correct operation of these processes.

===Kerma===
Kerma (&quot;kinetic energy released per unit mass&quot;) is used in radiation metrology as a measure of the liberated energy of ionisation due to irradiation, and is expressed in grays. Importantly, kerma dose is different from absorbed dose, depending on the radiation energies involved, partially because ionization energy is not accounted for. Whilst roughly equal at low energies, kerma is much higher than absorbed dose at higher energies, because some energy escapes from the absorbing volume in the form of bremsstrahlung (X-rays) or fast-moving electrons. 

Kerma, when applied to air, is equivalent to the legacy roentgen unit of radiation exposure, but there is a difference in the definition of these two units. The gray is defined independently of any target material, however, the roentgen was defined specifically by the ionisation effect in dry air, which did not necessarily represent the effect on other media.

==Development of the absorbed dose concept and the gray==

Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays on November 8, 1895, and their use spread very quickly for medical diagnostics, particularly broken bones and embedded foreign objects where they were a revolutionary improvement over previous techniques.

Due to the wide use of X-rays and the growing realisation of the dangers of ionizing radiation, measurement standards became necessary for radiation intensity and various countries developed their own, but using differing definitions and methods. Eventually, in order to promote international standardisation, the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) meeting in London in 1925, proposed a separate body to consider units of measure. This was called the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, or ICRU, and came into being at the Second ICR in Stockholm in 1928, under the chairmanship of Manne Siegbahn.

One of the earliest techniques of measuring the intensity of X-rays was to measure their ionising effect in air by means of an air-filled ion chamber. At the first ICRU meeting it was proposed that one unit of X-ray dose should be defined as the quantity of X-rays that would produce one esu of charge in one cubic centimetre of dry air at 0 °C and 1 standard atmosphere of pressure. This unit of radiation exposure was named the roentgen in honour of Wilhelm Röntgen, who had died five years previously. At the 1937 meeting of the ICRU, this definition was extended to apply to gamma radiation. This approach, although a great step forward in standardisation, had the disadvantage of not being a direct measure of the absorption of radiation, and thereby the ionisation effect, in various types of matter including human tissue, and was a measurement only of the effect of the X-rays in a specific circumstance; the ionisation effect in dry air.

In 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with William Valentine Mayneord and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a new unit of measure, dubbed the &quot;gram roentgen&quot; (symbol: gr) was proposed, and defined as &quot;that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation&quot;. This unit was found to be equivalent to 88 ergs in air, and made the absorbed dose, as it subsequently became known, dependent on the interaction of the radiation with the irradiated material, not just an expression of radiation exposure or intensity, which the roentgen represented. In 1953 the ICRU recommended the rad, equal to 100 erg/g, as the new unit of measure of absorbed radiation. The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units. 

In the late 1950s, the CGPM invited the ICRU to join other scientific bodies to work on the development of the International System of Units, or SI. The CCU decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation as energy deposited by reabsorbed charged particles per unit mass of absorbent material, which is how the rad had been defined, but in MKS units it would be equivalent to the joule per kilogram. This was confirmed in 1975 by the 15th CGPM, and the unit was named the &quot;gray&quot; in honour of Louis Harold Gray, who had died in 1965. The gray was thus equal to 100 rad. Notably, the centigray (numerically equivalent to the rad) is still widely used to describe absolute absorbed doses in radiotherapy.

The adoption of the gray by the 15th General Conference on Weights and Measures as the unit of measure of the absorption of ionizing radiation, specific energy absorption, and of kerma in 1975 was the culmination of over half a century of work, both in the understanding of the nature of ionizing radiation and in the creation of coherent radiation quantities and units.

<text>Charles Pinot (or Pineau) Duclos (12 February 1704 – 26 March 1772) was a French author and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot;.

==Biography==
Duclos was born at Dinan in Brittany and studied at Paris. After some time spent in dissipation he began to cultivate the society of wits and joined a club of young men who published their literary efforts under such titles as &quot;Recueil de ces messieurs&quot;, &quot;Étrennes de la saint Jean&quot;, &quot;Œufs de Pâques&quot; etc. His romance &quot;Acajou et Zirphile&quot; was the result of a wager among the club&#x27;s members: Duclos composed it for a series of engraved plates intended for another work. He wrote two other romances which were favorably received: &quot;The Baroness de Luz&quot; (1741) and &quot;Confessions of Count de ***&quot; (1747).

==Académie française==
Duclos became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions in 1739 and of the Académie Française in 1747, being appointed perpetual secretary. In 1747, both academies were indebted to him not only for many valuable contributions, but also for several useful regulations and improvements. As a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, he composed several memoirs on trial by combat, on the origin and revolutions of the Celtic and French languages, and on scenic representations and the ancient drama. As a member of the Académie française, he assisted in compiling the new edition of the &quot;Dictionary&quot;, which was published in 1762; and he made some just and philosophical remarks on the &quot;Port Royal Grammar&quot;. On several occasions he distinguished himself by vindicating the honour and prerogatives of the societies to which he belonged, and the dignity of the literary character in general. He used to say of himself, &quot;I shall leave behind me a name dear to literary men.&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1764.

==Mayor==
The citizens of Dinan, whose interests he always supported with zeal, appointed him mayor of their town in 1744, though he was resident at Paris, and in this capacity he took part in the assembly of the estates of Brittany. Upon the requisition of this body the king granted him letters of nobility. In 1763 he was advised to retire from France for some time, having rendered himself obnoxious to the government by the opinions he had expressed on the dispute between the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, and M. de La Chalotais, the friend and countryman of Duclos. Accordingly, he set out first for England (1763), then for Italy (1766); and on his return he wrote his &quot;Considerations on Italy&quot;. He died in Paris.

==Legacy==
As a character, Duclos was considered a mixture of impulsiveness and prudence. Jean-Jacques Rousseau described him laconically as a man &quot;droit et adroit&quot;. In his manners he displayed a bluntness that frequently rendered him disagreeable; and his caustic wit made him enemies. To those who knew him, however, he was a pleasant companion. A considerable number of his bons mots have been preserved by his biographers.

==Works==
His first serious publication was the &quot;History of Louis XI&quot;, which is dry and epigrammatical in style but displays considerable powers of research and impartiality. The reputation of Duclos as an author was confirmed by the publication of his &quot;Considérations sur les mœurs de ce siècle&quot; (1751), a work justly praised by La Harpe as containing a great deal of sound and ingenious reflection. It was translated into English and German. The &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire du dix-huitième siècle&quot;, intended by the author as a sort of sequel to the preceding work, are much inferior in style and matter, and are, in reality, little better than a kind of romance. In consequence of his &quot;History of Louis XI&quot;, he was appointed historiographer of France, when that place became vacant on Voltaire&#x27;s retirement to Prussia. His &quot;Secret Memoirs of the Reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV&quot; (for which he was able to utilize the &quot;Mémoires&quot; of Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, suppressed in 1755), were not published until after the French Revolution.

A complete edition of the works of Duclos, including an unfinished autobiography, was published by Auger (1821). See also Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, t. ix.; René Kerviler, &quot;La Bretagne et l&#x27;Académie française du XVIIIe siècle&quot; (1889); L. Mandon, &quot;De la valeur historique des mémoires secrets de Duclos&quot; (1872).

<doc id="287155" wikidata="Q303304" url="?curid=287155" title="Charlie McCreevy">
<text>Charles McCreevy (born 30 September 1949) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services from 2004 to 2010, Minister for Finance from 1997 to 2004, Minister for Tourism and Trade from 1993 to 1994 and Minister for Social Welfare from 1992 to 1993. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kildare constituency (and later the Kildare North constituency) from 1977 to 2004.

==Early life and career==
Born in Sallins, County Kildare, McCreevy was educated locally at Naas by the Congregation of Christian Brothers at Naas C.B.S., and later at Gormanston College. He studied commerce at University College Dublin and went on to become a chartered accountant. His family background was modest, his father and ancestors since the late 18th century was a lock-keeper on the Grand Canal, a job carried on by his mother, after the death of his father, when McCreevy was four years old.

Thus, his post-compulsory education was attained by winning scholarships. His political career began with when he won a seat in the Kildare constituency at the 1977 general election, which was a landslide for Charles Haughey&#x27;s supporters in Fianna Fáil and he was re-elected at every subsequent election until he joined the European Commission. Between 1979 and 1985, he served as an elected member of the Kildare County Council.

==Relationship with Charles Haughey==

In the December 1979, Fianna Fáil leadership contest, McCreevy strongly supported the controversial Charles Haughey, who narrowly won the post. However, in a time of severe budgetary difficulties for Ireland, McCreevy soon became disillusioned with the new Taoiseach and his fiscal policies. In October 1982, McCreevy launched a motion of no-confidence in the party leader, which evolved into a leadership challenge by Desmond O&#x27;Malley. In an open ballot and supported by only 21 of his 79 colleagues (known as the &quot;Gang of 22&quot;), the motion failed and McCreevy was temporarily expelled from the parliamentary party.

In later years O&#x27;Malley was expelled from Fianna Fáil itself and formed the Progressive Democrats (PDs), espousing conservative fiscal policies. Although considered ideologically close to the PDs, and a personal friend of its erstwhile leader, Mary Harney, McCreevy chose to remain a member of Fianna Fáil, where he would eventually serve in joint FF-PD Governments.

==Early ministerial career==

For his first 15 years as TD, while Haughey remained leader, McCreevy remained a backbencher. In 1992, Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach and McCreevy was appointed Minister for Social Welfare. In this role, he is principally remembered for a set of 12 cost-cutting measures, collectively termed the &quot;dirty dozen&quot;, which were arguably minor in their direct impact but provided a major political headache for his party in the 1992 general election.

In 1993, he became Minister for Tourism and Trade, which he held until the government fell in December 1994. In opposition under new Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern, McCreevy was appointed Opposition Spokesperson for Finance. In this role he was viewed as actively pro-enterprise, anti-spending and a key advocate for tax cuts.

==Minister for Finance==

In 1997, Fianna Fáil returned to power and McCreevy became Minister for Finance. His period coincided with the era of the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;, which saw the rapid growth of the Irish economy due to social partnership between employers, government and unions; increased female participation in the labour force, decades of tuition-free secondary education; targeting of foreign (primarily U.S.) direct investment; a low corporation tax rate; an English-speaking workforce only five time-zones from New York, and membership of the European Union – which provided payments for infrastructural development, export access to the Single Market and a Eurozone country.

McCreevy was a consistent advocate of cutting taxes and spending. As Minister for Finance, he had an opportunity to implement these policies. During his term in Finance, he made many changes to simplify the tax system and presided over Ireland&#x27;s entry to Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and later, the changeover to the Euro. He maintained a significant surplus during his seven years in Finance by forecasting tax takes which were lower than average. He simultaneously implemented a tax-cutting programme, major increases in health, education and pension spending as well as increasing investment in infrastructural development to 5% of GDP.

Unemployment fell from 10% to 4.4%. Real GDP growth fell steadily, however, from a peak of over 11% in 1997 when McCreevy took office to just over 4% in 2004. Real GDP growth across the full period of the Celtic Tiger represented by far the highest average of any western European country. Inflation was increased from 1.5% in 1997, to 5.5% in 2000, before falling steadily to just over 2% in 2004.

From 1997 to 2000, McCreevy cut Capital Gains Tax from 40% to 20%, and extended Section 23 Tax allowances to the Upper Shannon Area (against the advice of the Finance Department) in the Finance Acts of 1998 and 1999. These included special tax incentives targeted at the area covered by the pilot Rural Renewal Scheme, which was later criticised by the Heritage Council for being introduced without a &quot;Baseline Audit&quot; to inform the level and scale of development to be supported through the scheme, not identifying priority areas suitable for development, not providing any strategic protection for designated areas including the corridor of the River Shannon nor promoting the use of sustainable design and building materials in any new build or refurbishment project supported by the scheme.

These two measures of cutting Capital Gains Tax and providing tax incentives for property development in thinly populated rural areas have been partly responsible for the explosion in housing and commercial property speculation, which led ultimately to the collapse of the Irish banking system.

Frequently outspoken, McCreevy sometimes made comments which attracted controversy. For example, McCreevy once referred to the Irish health system as a &quot;black hole&quot; and reacted to the initial Irish rejection of the Nice Treaty as &quot;a sign of a healthy democracy&quot;. He later explained this as reflecting a wake-up call to politicians and others who, like him, had expected an almost automatic Yes vote. McCreevy also prompted warnings from the European Commission, who claimed that his £2 billion tax giveaway in 2000 would be inflationary, and harmful to the Irish economy.

One of McCreevy&#x27;s initiatives as Minister for Finance was decentralisation, involving moving government departments and state agencies to other parts of the country and moving 10,000 public servants with them. This target was never reached, with only 3,159 jobs having moved outside of Dublin and a wide range of state agencies having remained in Dublin. The project was abandoned in 2011, with the government having spent close to €100 million on offices that mostly remained unused.

In 2008, as Ireland entered recession, McCreevy&#x27;s stewardship has been cited as one of the reasons why the global financial crisis hit Ireland especially hard, due to his &quot;light touch&quot; regulation of the financial system. Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald attributed Ireland&#x27;s dire economic state in 2009, on a series of &quot;calamitous&quot; government policy errors by the then Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, who between the years of 2000 and 2003, boosted public spending by 48pc while cutting income tax.

In 2015, McCreevy gave evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee of Inquiry into the country&#x27;s banking crisis and denied his policies as minister had contributed to the crisis. A legal warning was given to McCreevy at the Banking Inquiry after he refused to answer, when asked, if he believed there had been a property bubble, but then accepted that from 2003 there had been a property bubble.

==European Commissioner==
In 2004, McCreevy was selected by the Government of Ireland to replace David Byrne as Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner. He was appointed to the Internal Market and Services portfolio, by President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso. At his confirmation hearings in the European Parliament MEPs described him as &quot;fluent and relaxed&quot;. He also informed them that he had campaigned for the ratification of every European Treaty since 1972.&quot;You will find me ready to meet, discuss, listen and argue on how best to deliver to our citizens the real benefits of an Internal Market. There are enormous challenges facing the EU in the coming period on which we all must find common ground. I want our policies to show that EU means something real and positive to the people in Europe.&quot;

When McCreevy resigned his Dáil seat on his appointment to the European Commission, his son, Charlie Jnr, declined the opportunity to be the Fianna Fáil candidate in the resulting by-election. The seat was won by the independent candidate, Catherine Murphy.

McCreevy sided with the major record labels who are trying to extend a fifty-year copyright exemption to ninety five years. In 2008, McCreevy was a supporter of attempts to introduce software patents in the European Union.

Following his departure from the commission, McCreevy was forced to resign from the board of a new banking firm, NBNK Investments, after an EU ethics committee found a conflict of interest with his work as a European Commissioner in charge of financial regulation. This is first time that a former member of the EU executive had to resign a directorship the 2003 system for overseeing the work of retired commissioners.

==Northern Rock Crisis==
In October 2007, McCreevy, commenting on the Northern Rock Bank&#x27;s loss of investor confidence, claimed that banking regulations in the UK which forces banks to be open to scrutiny from outside investors, caused the panic. He said if access to the banks dealings &quot;had been restricted&quot;, then the trouble could have been avoided.

==Lisbon Treaty ratification 2008==
Irish constitutional law requires a referendum to alter the constitution for such a major change as the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty. Interviewed beforehand, McCreevy said that he had not read the Treaty in full himself, though he understood and endorsed it:
:&quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody in this room who has read it cover to cover. I don&#x27;t expect ordinary decent Irish people will be sitting down spending hours reading sections about sub-sections referring to other articles and sub-articles, but there is sufficient analysis done and people have put together a consolidated text which is quite easy to read ...Anyone who thinks that, as the reality and inevitability of EU enlargement has taken hold, that we can continue to tackle urgent problems without streamlining of the decision-making process is failing to face up to reality.&quot;

In the event, the referendum was held on 12 June and the Irish electorate did not approve the Treaty. McCreevy was heavily criticised in the European Parliament, by the leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, who demanded on 17 June 2008, that McCreevy be removed as a European Commissioner. Schulz slightly misquoted McCreevy, whom he stated had contributed to Ireland&#x27;s rejection of the Lisbon Treaty with remarks during the referendum campaign that no &quot;sane person&quot; would read the document.&quot;This man goes to Ireland and says he has not read the treaty and tells people there is no need to read it,&quot; Mr Schultz said during a heated debate on the referendum at the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.&quot;

==Other interests==
McCreevy is a member of the Bilderberg Group.

McCreevy joined the board of Sports Direct International plc on 31 March 2011 and is also a director of Ryanair. He receives annual pension payments of €119,177.

<doc id="287156" wikidata="Q1111220" url="?curid=287156" title="David Andrews (politician)">
<text>David Andrews (born 15 March 1935) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 1993 and 1997 to 2000, Minister for Defence from 1993 to 1994 and June 1997 to October 1997, Minister for the Marine from 1993 to 1994, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1977 to 1979 and Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence from 1970 to 1973. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 2002.

Andrews was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1965 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown constituency. In May 1970, in a reshuffle following the Arms Crisis, he was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, with special responsibility as Chief Whip, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. He served until Fianna Fáil left office in 1973.

Following the 1977 general election, Fianna Fáil was back in office and Jack Lynch appointed Andrews as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election Andrews supported George Colley, the favoured candidate of the existing leadership. However, Charles Haughey, in a very close vote, was elected party leader and Taoiseach.

Andrews was confined to the backbenches during Haughey&#x27;s thirteen-year period as leader. During this period he maintained his legal practice and campaigned for the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, and Brian Keenan. He remained a vocal critic of Haughey during this period. After the Progressive Democrats were founded in 1985 Andrews considered joining the new party. In February 1992, Albert Reynolds succeeded Haughey as Taoiseach, and Andrews was appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs. In January 1993, following the formation of a coalition with the Labour Party, Andrews was appointed as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine. He served until this government fell in December 1994.

After the 1997 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to office in coalition with the Progressive Democrats, with Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach. Andrews was first appointed Minister for Defence; later that year, after the resignation of Ray Burke, he was appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs. His period as Foreign Minister was successful regarding the Northern Ireland peace talks. In April 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was signed and was later approved in referendums in Ireland and Northern Ireland. In 1999, Ireland joined the Partnership for Peace project. Andrews stepped down as Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 2000.

He retired from politics at the 2002 general election, and his son Barry was elected for the Dún Laoghaire constituency. His other son David Andrews, Jnr is a comedian who works under the stage name of David McSavage. His brother Niall Andrews was a TD and MEP.

In May 2000, he was appointed to the non-executive position as Chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society, serving in that position until 2009.

<text>Christopher Stephen &quot;Todd&quot; Andrews (6 October 1901 – 11 October 1985) was an Irish republican and later a public servant. He participated in the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War but never stood for election or held public office.

== Early life and education ==
Andrews was born at 42 Summerhill in Dublin in 1901. He acquired the nickname &quot;Todd&quot; because of his perceived resemblance to English comic strip hero Alonzo Todd, who appeared in &quot;The Magnet&quot;. Andrews briefly attended St. Enda&#x27;s School and completed his secondary education at Synge Street CBS. He went on to study Commerce at University College Dublin, and although his studies were interrupted by his participation in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, he returned to the university where he obtained a degree in Commerce.

==Nationalist revolutionary==
Andrews was politicised by the 1916 Rising. He joined the Irish Volunteers at the age of fifteen and had an active role in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, fighting with the Rathfarnham company of the 4th Dublin Brigade. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1920 but released after ten days on hunger strike. He was interned at the Curragh in 1921 but tunnelled his way to freedom with two comrades. Andrews opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and, after the creation of the IRA&#x27;s Four Courts Executive in April 1922, became assistant to Director of Operations Ernie O&#x27;Malley. He took the republican side during the Irish Civil War and was wounded in the fighting in O&#x27;Connell Street, Dublin. Andrews was appointed the IRA&#x27;s General Headquarters and travelled the country supervising the training of volunteers. Andrews was interned by the government of the Irish Free State until early 1924.

==Public servant==
After graduation, Andrews found employment as an accountant with the then-fledgling Irish Tourist Association where he structured their accounts office, as well as editing several of their publications. In the summer of 1930 he was offered a position as an accountant with the Electricity Supply Board at a time when they were expanding the National Grid and constructing significant Hydro-Electric projects such as Ardnacrusha.

In 1933, Andrews was appointed to the Department of Industry and Commerce, where he dealt with the industrialisation of Irish turf development. Andrews initially set up a network of co-ops that locally harvested and sold turf but quickly saw that this arrangement was insufficient to successfully modernise turf production in Ireland on a commercial scale; it also drew the ire of coal merchants who worried about the effect of a State-led competition to their markets. However such worries were overcome by Andrews through shrewd and active man management, culminating with the establishment of the Turf Development Board in 1934. The new semi-state company helped overcome future issues in managing peat harvesting on a grand scale and schemes set up to help fuel Ireland during The Emergency, and ultimately led to the formation of Bord Na Mona in 1946, a body that he ultimately became Chief Executive of.

==CIE==
In 1958, Andrew was offered and accepted the chairmanship of the Irish transport company Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), which was in a perilous fiscal state. Following on from the findings of the Beddy Report, he drew from his business experience and oversaw a large restructuring of the Irish rail system. This included the purchase of diesel electric engines from General Motors, the introduction of modern coaching stock, the phased closure of uneconomic services and elimination of slow stopping services, the introduction of new braked good wagons as well as a revamp of ticketing arrangements. He also oversaw the closures of several lines that were perennially uneconomic and loss-making. This included:
*The Bray to Harcourt Street railway line. The closure of the Harcourt Street line is undoubtedly the most infamous railway closure in Ireland. The line had not been profitable for decades, in spite of it seeing many cost-cutting measures to try and improve business. Electric signalling, AEC railcars and summer special trains to Wicklow and Wexford had been introduced on the line to try and increase its footfall and to lower costs to no avail. On foot of a recommendation of the Beddy Report, the line ceased services on 31 December 1958 and formally abandoned in January 1959. As the city expanded outwards in the mid and late 1970s the route was kept clear and partially reopened as part of the LUAS Green Line.
*The substantial railway network west of Cork city. This included lines to Bandon, Bantry and Macroom, and branch lines to Clonakility, Skibbereen and Kinsale. Again, the lines struggled for business and saw diminishing business as cars, buses and lorries became more affordable and able to address passenger needs more practically.
*The Hill of Howth Tramway, which was inherited from the Great Northern Railway. This anomalous line was built around Howth Head to exploit an expected tourism boom in the seaside village that never came to be. While the line served its sparse locality quite well it never turned a profit and escaped closure several times while under the auspices of the Great Northern Railway Board. However, its infrastructure and rolling stock had not been replaced during its lifetime and, with this weighed against a need for essential cost-cutting, its closure was inevitable giving CIE&#x27;s poor fiscal state and statutory requirements to become profitable.
*The West Clare Railway. Again, this line&#x27;s came against a backdrop of cost-cutting but unlike other narrow gauge lines it saw the introduction of a fleet of modern diesel locomotives and railcars. While the new stock improved service levels and economics of the lines considerably they weren&#x27;t enough to save the line.
*The Cahersiveen, Kenmare and Kanturk lines. As was common with many rural railways the traffic levels on these three lines were sparse. The branches to Kanturk and Kenmare has diesel engines allocated to them too, but to no avail.

Andrews also oversaw the resurgence and modernisation of CIE road transport, provincial and city bus services in Ireland. Steam traction was eliminated under his chairmanship, a cost benefit that undoubtedly saved CIE from certain collapse, while modern vans and lorries took on the delivery of freights in place of horse and carriage. Despite such economies, CIE still struggled under a state expectation that it run without subvention; an impossible task given the sparse traffic and passenger numbers in a land cropped by emigration. Issues of Partition often affected the company&#x27;s operation; CIE was forced to introduce additional bus services in border areas upon the withdrawal of the Ulster Transport Authority from cross-border services, notably with the GNRB in 1958 and the County Donegal Railway Joint Committee in 1959.

==RTÉ==

He retired from CIE upon his 65th birthday but before he stood down he became chairman of the RTÉ Authority at the request of Seán Lemass. During his time as chairman he oversaw significant changes as the broadcaster expanded RTÉ Radio and Television, as well as the introduction of FM radio and colour television, the opening of a Belfast news desk, the beginning of the move from the GPO to a new complex at Montrose, Donnybrook. Andrews frequently rebutted Government interference in the organisation, even rebutting advances from then Minister Erskine Childers to suppress some employees who were suspected of being subversives. Todd resigned from RTÉ in 1970 after his son David Andrews was appointed Chief Whip to the Taoiseach.

==Political views==
Todd Andrews was a firm advocate of state-sponsored enterprise and economic intervention, drawing inspiration from the statist approaches he observed in Germany and the Soviet Union, particularly regarding the use of peat bogs for fuel. Identifying as a radical and aligning with the leftist tendencies of early Fianna Fáil, Andrews viewed reunification of Ireland as essential to resolving the country&#x27;s challenges. In his 1970s column, &quot;Gallimaufry&quot;, for de Valera&#x27;s &quot;Irish Press&quot;, Andrews consistently argued for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland and the end of their governance claims over any part of the island. 

Progressive for his time, he held liberal views on issues like divorce and contraception and harboured a deep-seated antipathy toward the Catholic Church&#x27;s political influence, rooted in his republicanism and his excommunication during the Civil War. Known for his uncompromising opinions, his bluntness often led to workplace tensions, with Bord na Móna employees joking about the necessity of appointing someone to mitigate the strikes his outspokenness provoked.

Andrews&#x27; son Niall would inherit much of his political views. 

==Later life and family==
He was the recipient of several honorary doctorates and degrees from various universities. He published his autobiography in two volumes in 1979 and 1982, under the titles of &quot;Dublin Made Me&quot; and &quot;Man of No Property&quot;.

Andrews died in Dublin at the age of 84.

Two of his sons, Niall Andrews and David Andrews, became TDs; David Andrews became Minister for Foreign Affairs.

His brother, Paddy Andrews was a football player, most notably with Bohemians who was also capped by the Irish Free State. Todd Andrews&#x27; grandson Ryan Tubridy was a radio presenter and television chatshow host on RTÉ, while grandsons Barry Andrews and Chris Andrews were also TDs. Another grandson is comedian David McSavage.

Gay Byrne, one of Tubridy&#x27;s predecessors on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, in his 1989 memoir &quot;The Time of My Life&quot; and subsequently in an RTÉ documentary in 2005, related how Andrews, when chairman of the RTÉ Authority, phoned Tim McCourt on his first day as Director General of RTÉ and ordered him to fire &quot;that fucker Byrne&quot;. When asked which &quot;fucker Byrne&quot;, he meant, Andrews responder: &quot;The little fucker who presents the &quot;Late Late Show&quot;.&quot; McCourt refused to dismiss Byrne.

<doc id="287159" wikidata="Q9241" url="?curid=287159" title="IAU designated constellations">
<text>In contemporary astronomy, 88 constellations are recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Each constellation is a region of the sky bordered by arcs of right ascension and declination, together covering the entire celestial sphere. Their boundaries were officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1928 and published in 1930.

The ancient Mesopotamians and later the Greeks established most of the northern constellations in international use today, listed by the Roman-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy. The constellations along the ecliptic are called the zodiac. When explorers mapped the stars of the southern skies, European astronomers proposed new constellations for that region, as well as ones to fill gaps between the traditional constellations. Because of their Roman and European origins, every constellation has a Latin name. In 1922, the International Astronomical Union adopted three-letter abbreviations for 89 constellations, the modern list of 88 plus Argo. After this, Eugène Joseph Delporte drew up boundaries for each of the 88 constellations so that every point in the sky belonged to one constellation. When astronomers say that an object lies in a particular constellation, they mean that it is positioned within these specified boundaries.

== History ==

Some constellations are no longer recognized by the IAU, but may appear in older star charts and other references. Most notable is Argo Navis, which was one of Ptolemy&#x27;s original 48 constellations. In the 1750s the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided this into three separate constellations: Carina, Puppis, and Vela.

== Modern constellations ==
The 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects, and 17 humans or mythological characters.

=== Abbreviations ===
Each IAU constellation has an official three-letter abbreviation based on the genitive form of the constellation name. As the genitive is similar to the base name, the majority of the abbreviations are just the first three letters of the constellation name: &quot;Ori&quot; for &quot;Orion/Orionis&quot;, &quot;Ara&quot; for &quot;Ara/Arae&quot;, and &quot;Com&quot; for &quot;Coma Berenices/Comae Berenices&quot;. In some cases, the abbreviation contains letters from the genitive not appearing in the base name (as in &quot;Hyi&quot; for &quot;Hydrus/Hydri&quot;, to avoid confusion with &quot;Hydra&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Hya&quot;; and &quot;Sge&quot; for &quot;Sagitta/Sagittae&quot;, to avoid confusion with &quot;Sagittarius&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Sgr&quot;). Some abbreviations use letters beyond the initial three to unambiguously identify the constellation (for example when the name and its genitive differ in the first three letters): &quot;Aps&quot; for &quot;Apus/Apodis&quot;, &quot;CrA&quot; for &quot;Corona Australis&quot;, &quot;CrB&quot; for &quot;Corona Borealis&quot;, &quot;Crv&quot; for &quot;Corvus&quot;. (&quot;Crater&quot; is abbreviated &quot;Crt&quot; to prevent confusion with &quot;CrA&quot;.) When letters are taken from the second word of a two-word name, the first letter from the second word is capitalised: &quot;CMa&quot; for &quot;Canis Major&quot;, &quot;CMi&quot; for &quot;Canis Minor&quot;. Two cases are ambiguous: &quot;Leo&quot; for the constellation &quot;Leo&quot; could be mistaken for &quot;Leo Minor&quot; (abbreviated &quot;LMi&quot;), and &quot;Tri&quot; for &quot;Triangulum&quot; could be mistaken for &quot;Triangulum Australe&quot; (abbreviated &quot;TrA&quot;).

In addition to the three-letter abbreviations used today, the IAU also introduced four-letter abbreviations in 1932. The four-letter abbreviations were repealed in 1955 and are now obsolete, but were included in the NASA Dictionary of Technical Terms for Aerospace Use (NASA SP-7) published in 1965. These are labeled &quot;NASA&quot; in the table below and are included here for reference only.

== Asterisms ==
Various other unofficial patterns exist alongside the constellations. These are known as &quot;asterisms&quot;. Examples include the Big Dipper/Plough and the Northern Cross.
Some ancient asterisms, for example Coma Berenices, Serpens, and portions of Argo Navis, are now officially constellations.

<doc id="287161" wikidata="Q185272" url="?curid=287161" title="Brian Cowen">
<text>Brian Bernard Cowen (born 10 January 1960) is an Irish former politician who served as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil from 2008 to 2011. Cowen served as a TD for the constituency of Laois–Offaly from 1984 to 2011 and served in several ministerial roles between 1992 and 2011, including as Minister for Finance from 2004 to 2008 and Tánaiste from 2007 to 2008.

Cowen was elected leader of Fianna Fáil in May 2008, upon the resignation of Bertie Ahern, and was nominated by Dáil Éireann to replace him as Taoiseach. Weeks after taking office, his administration faced the Irish financial and banking crises. He received substantial criticism for his failure to stem the tide of either crisis, ultimately culminating in the Irish Government&#x27;s formal request for financial aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was widely regarded in Ireland as a national humiliation.

His leadership subsequently saw public support for Fianna Fáil plunge to record lows, and Cowen set a record for the lowest approval rating in the history of Irish opinion polling, at one point reaching an approval rating of 8 per cent. In January 2011, following a failed attempt at a cabinet reshuffle, and facing growing political pressure, Cowen resigned as Leader of Fianna Fáil, but remained as Taoiseach until after the general election held the following month where Cowen left politics and officially resigned as Taoiseach and left office a fortnight later.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described Cowen&#x27;s tenure as Taoiseach as &quot;a dismal failure&quot;. In 2011, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; called Cowen the &quot;worst Taoiseach in the history of the State&quot;.

==Early and private life==
Brian Cowen was born to a Catholic family, in Tullamore, County Offaly, on 10 January 1960. He was raised in Clara by his parents, May and Bernard Cowen, a Fianna Fáil TD and Senator. The family owned a public house, butcher shop and undertaking business in Clara, beside the family home. His father also worked as an auctioneer. Cowen often worked as a barman in his father&#x27;s pub when he was growing up. He has two brothers, Christopher and Barry. Barry Cowen became a TD for Laois–Offaly in 2011.

Cowen was educated at Clara National School, Árd Scoil Naomh Chiaráin, in Clara and the Cistercian College of Mount St. Joseph in Roscrea, County Tipperary. He was twelve years old when he entered Mount St. Joseph College, as a boarder. After secondary school, he attended University College Dublin where he studied law. He subsequently qualified as a solicitor from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, Dublin.

He is a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association and continues to serve as president of Clara GAA club, for whom he played in the early 1980s. He also played with the Offaly Gaelic football team at this time, having previously played with their minor and under-21 teams. Cowen likes to socialise with his constituents in some of the local pubs in his native Offaly. In May 2003, he took part in a charity CD project organised by &quot;The Brewery Tap&quot; pub in Tullamore. The CD featured 28 songs, including Cowen singing the Phil Coulter song, &quot;The Town I Loved So Well&quot;.

In May 2007, Cowen told Jason O&#x27;Toole of &quot;Hot Press&quot; that, as a student: &quot;I would say there were a couple of occasions when marijuana was passed around – and, unlike President Clinton, I did inhale. There wasn&#x27;t a whole lot in it really.&quot;

Cowen is married to Mary Molloy and they have two daughters. In 2017, Cowen was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the National University of Ireland.

==Early political career==
Cowen was elected to Dáil Éireann in the 1984 Laois–Offaly by-election, caused by the death of his father Bernard Cowen. At the time Cowen, at the age of 24, became the youngest member of the 24th Dáil. He was also elected to Offaly County Council in the same year, taking over the seat vacated by his late father. He served on that authority until 1992.

Cowen remained on the backbenches of Fianna Fáil for the next seven years. Following the 1989 general election when Fianna Fáil formed a coalition government, with the Progressive Democrats, for the first time, Cowen was one of several TDs who were vehemently opposed to the move. Two years later in November 1991, the then Minister for Finance, Albert Reynolds, challenged Charles Haughey, for the leadership of the party. Cowen firmly aligned himself behind Reynolds and quickly became associated with the party&#x27;s so-called &quot;Country and Western&quot; wing (Reynolds&#x27;s supporters earned this nickname because the vast majority were rural TDs and Reynolds had made a lot of money in the dance hall business in the 1960s). Reynolds became leader on his second attempt when Haughey was forced to retire as Taoiseach in 1992.

Reynolds appointed Cowen, aged 32, to his first cabinet position as Minister for Labour. Despite being a member of the cabinet, Cowen was openly hostile toward the PDs. This was evident at the Fianna Fáil party&#x27;s Ardfheis in March 1992. In the warm-up speech before the leader&#x27;s address, Cowen remarked, &quot;What about the PDs? When in doubt, leave them out.&quot; He fought with the PDs, being furious at their interference with Fianna Fáil&#x27;s view that, as majority partners, they should have wielded the power.

The 1992 general election produced a hung Dáil and resulted in negotiations between all the main parties. Cowen, along with Noel Dempsey and Bertie Ahern, negotiated on behalf of Fianna Fáil in an attempt to form a government with the Labour Party. A deal was reached between the two parties, and Cowen was again appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. In that role, he implemented the controversial decision to relax the so-called &quot;stopover&quot; at Shannon Airport, which allowed limited direct trans-Atlantic flights from Dublin Airport. The decision proved divisive and saw one Fianna Fáil TD, Síle de Valera, resign from the party in protest.

In October 1994, it was revealed that Cowen had 1,000 shares in Arcon, a company to which he was in the process of awarding a mining licence. He quickly sold the shares and apologised in the Dáil for causing himself and his colleagues &quot;some embarrassment&quot;.

Later in 1994, Albert Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. Bertie Ahern became the new leader, and initially appeared set to replace Reynolds as Taoiseach. However, Labour chose to end the coalition with Fianna Fáil and took part in a new coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left, consigning Fianna Fáil to the opposition. Cowen was appointed to the front bench, first as Spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Forestry (1994), and later as Spokesperson on Health (1997).

==Cabinet career (1997–2008)==
===Minister for Health and Children===
When Fianna Fáil returned to the government following the 1997 general election, Cowen was appointed as Minister for Health and Children. He described his period there as like being in Angola because administrative &quot;landmines&quot; could detonate without warning. During his tenure, he had to deal with problems of bed shortages and overcrowding in hospitals, as well as a prolonged nurses&#x27; strike in 1999.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs===
In a cabinet reshuffle following the retirement of David Andrews in January 2000, Cowen was appointed as Minister for Foreign Affairs. His tenure saw extensive negotiations continue regarding the Northern Ireland peace process and other international activities, particularly when Ireland gained a place on the United Nations Security Council. In 2003, he was the subject of a personal attack by the leader of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Democratic Unionist Party, Ian Paisley. In front of a crowd of party supporters and the presence of television cameras and radio reporters, Paisley uttered a diatribe about Cowen&#x27;s appearance and also insulted his mother. In 2004, Cowen played a key role during Ireland&#x27;s Presidency of the European Council, during which and the European Union expanded from 15 to 25 member states.

===Minister for Finance===
Following the departure of Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, upon his nomination as Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner in September 2004, Cowen was appointed as Minister for Finance. On 1 December 2004, he announced his first budget, one that was viewed as a give-away budget in which spending was increased by 9%.

Cowen&#x27;s second budget in 2005 was dominated by a new childcare package, and measures to take &#x27;tax-free millionaires&#x27; back into the tax net from 2007 by restricting tax breaks. A readjustment of income-tax measures was designed to take 52,000 low earners out of the tax net and remove 90,000 middle earners from the higher tax band.

Cowen&#x27;s third budget in 2007, in anticipation of the 2007 general election, was regarded as one of the biggest spending sprees in the history of the state. The €3.7 billion package included increases in pension and social welfare allowances, a marked green agenda, as well as a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 42% to 41%. Cowen has been criticised for alleged complacency during the economic turmoil in January 2008.

==Leader of Fianna Fáil==
During his ministerial career, Cowen was often identified in the media as the front-runner to succeed Ahern as leader of Fianna Fáil. Cowen&#x27;s position was strengthened when he succeeded Mary O&#x27;Rourke as deputy leader of the party in 2002. In 2004, he was appointed Minister for Finance. Following the 2007 general election, Cowen became Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) in a coalition between Fianna Fáil, the PDs, and the Green Party.

On 4 April 2008, two days after Ahern announced his intention to resign as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil, Cowen was nominated by Brian Lenihan and Mary Coughlan to be his successor. The following day he was confirmed as the sole nominee for the position. He was acclaimed as the seventh leader of Fianna Fáil on 9 April 2008, and assumed office upon Ahern&#x27;s resignation becoming effective on 6 May 2008.

On 7 May 2008, Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann as Taoiseach, by 88 votes to 76, and was appointed by President of Ireland Mary McAleese.

On 22 January 2011, despite winning a secret confidence motion the week before, Cowen announced he was stepping down as leader, in advance of the 2011 election, to put the party in &quot;the best possible position&quot;.

==Taoiseach (2008–2011)==
Upon appointment, Cowen formed the 28th government of Ireland, a coalition between Fianna Fáil, the Greens and the PDs, which initially had the support of three independent TDs. His choices of Mary Coughlan for Tánaiste and Brian Lenihan Jnr as Minister for Finance were criticised as inappropriate by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; for their &quot;distressing&quot; lack of experience.

===Treaty of Lisbon===

The Irish electorate&#x27;s rejection of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon on 12 June 2008, was viewed by some media and political observers as a protest against Cowen and his government. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; called the failed referendum&#x27;s aftermath the government&#x27;s &quot;biggest political crisis in decades&quot;. Columnist Brendan O&#x27;Connor called the outcome &quot;a humiliating failure for Cowen and the people who put him there&quot;. The Taoiseach himself arguably dealt a damaging blow to his own side when, on 12 May 2008, he admitted in a radio interview that he had not read the Treaty of Lisbon in its entirety. The treaty was eventually approved by Irish voters when the successful Twenty-eighth Amendment of the constitution was approved in the second Lisbon referendum, held in October 2009.

===2009 Budget===
Cowen delivered the Irish government budget for 2009 on 14 October 2008, brought forward from its usual December date due to the global financial crisis. The budget, labelled &quot;the toughest in many years&quot;, included several controversial measures, such as a proposed income levy and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of several military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland.

A public outcry arose over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the reinstatement of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on government buildings at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin and outside the Department of the Taoiseach in Merrion Street. Some of the pensioners were even seen to cheer on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin. Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops over what was viewed as a disproportionate level of cuts to be suffered by Protestant Secondary schools. Separately representatives of the Roman Catholic Church were assured by O&#x27;Keeffe that it would continue to be able to provide religious instruction to pupils in primary schools not under the patronage of the Church.

Rebellion within the ranks of the government led to several defections of disenchanted coalition members. County Wicklow TD Joe Behan, resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes. He, alongside two other government deputies, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government&#x27;s majority of twelve by one quarter. Finian McGrath, an Independent TD, who agreed to support the government after the 2007 election, also withdrew his support from the government. A senior political source said: &quot;The Budget was an accident waiting to happen.&quot;

Under the European Union stability and growth pact, EU states are required to keep their budget deficit-to-GDP ratio below a three per cent limit and maintain a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 per cent. On 31 October 2008, the European Commission opened an excessive deficit procedure against the Government of Ireland, for allowing its budget deficit to exceed the required EU deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 per cent. The Irish deficit was expected to be 5.5 percent in 2008, and 6.5 percent in 2009. This response forced reversals of proposed changes in several areas, contributing to a perceived weakness in his Government.

===2008 Pork crisis===
On 6 December 2008, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ordered the recall, withdrawal and destruction of all Irish pork products dating back to 1 September, due to the discovery of toxic levels of dioxin in a small percentage of the pig stock. Cowen additionally approved a five-day withdrawal of Irish pork from the market. Within days thousands of jobs were either lost or under threat at pig processing plants across the country, as processors refused to resume slaughter of pigs until they received financial compensation; the crisis ultimately cost taxpayers approximately €180 million. Cowen&#x27;s government received heavy criticism for overreaction in its handling of the incident, with Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny calling the government&#x27;s response as &quot;an unmitigated disaster&quot;.

===Anglo Irish Bank===
The heavy exposure of Anglo Irish Bank to property lending, with most of its loan book being to builders and property developers, meant that it was badly affected by the downturn in the Irish property market in 2008. On 15 January 2009, after attempting to salvage the Bank by injecting €1.5bn into its coffers, the Government announced that it would take steps that would enable the Bank to be taken into State ownership. The Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act, of 2009 provided for the transfer of all the shares of the Bank to the Minister for Finance and was enacted under Irish law on 21 January 2009. On the same date, the Bank was re-registered as a private limited company.
Observers at the time commented that the government had been slow to respond to the collapse of the Bank, with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; stating that &quot;Nationalisation was good enough for other European governments, but Brian Cowen&#x27;s administration avoided the inevitable until its back was to the wall. Too frequently, it is seen to be reacting to events, not controlling them.&quot;

===2009 Emergency budget===
In a second emergency budget, delivered in April 2009, a fiscal deficit of 10.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) was addressed. The budget&#x27;s initiatives included a doubling of the previous year&#x27;s income levy to 2%, 4% and 6%; increases on the excise duties on a regular packet of cigarettes (25 cents) and a litre of diesel (5 cents); a new &quot;asset management agency&quot; established to remove bad loans from Irish banks; the gradual elimination of early childcare supplement by 2010, to be replaced by a subsidy towards pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds; and no further increases in social welfare for at least two years. Cowen defended the emergency measures as necessary.

===First no confidence vote===
National and international press reactions to the budget were largely favourable, with the economics editor of the BBC reporting that there were lessons for the United Kingdom to learn from this emergency procedure and the European Commission hailing the budget as a form of &quot;decisive action&quot;. However, it did little to revive the political fortunes of Cowen&#x27;s government. After Fianna Fáil performed badly in the elections of 5 June 2009, losing half its European Parliament seats, Fine Gael tabled a motion of no confidence against Cowen on 9 June. He survived the vote by a margin of 85–79. Support for the government continued to fall: on 3 September 2009, an &quot;Irish Times&quot;/TNS mrbi poll, opinion poll reported that Cowen&#x27;s satisfaction rating had dropped six points to 15 per cent, with 77 per cent of voters saying they were dissatisfied with the way he was doing his job.

===2010 Budget and NAMA controversy===

Cowen&#x27;s government&#x27;s third budget within 14 months, delivered on 9 December 2009, saw the government facing the reality of the country nearly becoming insolvent.
 The 2010 Budget was described by commentators in Ireland and around the world in unusually harsh terms as €4 billion was removed from the country&#x27;s national deficit; &quot;The Irish Times&quot; labelled it &quot;the most austere Budget in the history of the State&quot;. It was characterised by pay cuts for public sector workers and cuts in social welfare. According to the BBC, social welfare cuts had not been implemented by the country since 1924. The cuts prompted at least one angry outburst in Dáil Éireann.

In February 2010, Cowen defended his claim that the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) would increase the supply of credit into the economy despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying it would not lead to any significant increase. &quot;People should contemplate what level of credit accessibility we&#x27;d have in this economy without NAMA,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&#x27;s not just sufficient in itself obviously for credit flow, it&#x27;s certainly an important and necessary part of restructuring our banking system, of that there&#x27;s no doubt, in terms of improving as a location for funding of banking operations,&quot; said Cowen. He previously said that the Government&#x27;s objective in restructuring the banks through NAMA was to &quot;generate more access to credit for Irish business at this critical time&quot;. In September 2009, the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, expressed a similar view, saying it would lead to more lending for businesses and households. Cowen was responding to reports published on 8 February, that the IMF had told Brian Lenihan in April 2009, that the NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the banks.

The comments, which appear in internal Department of Finance documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, were made by senior IMF official, Steven Seelig, who was to join the board of NAMA in May 2010. Minutes of a private meeting at the department between Brian Lenihan and IMF officials on 29 April 2009, state that the &quot;IMF (Mr. Seelig) do not believe that Nama will result in significant increase in bank lending in Ireland&quot;. The Government has maintained that NAMA&#x27;s purchase of bad loans from the banks with State bonds would increase the flow of credit in the economy since the plan was unveiled in April 2009. Speaking at the publication of the NAMA legislation in September 2009, Mr Lenihan said it would &quot;strengthen and improve&quot; the funding positions of the banks &quot;so that they can lend to viable businesses and households&quot;. The IMF estimated in their published report that domestic banks would face losses of up to €35 billion, though the department pointed out this would be partly funded from operating profits and provisions already taken against some loan losses.

===Second no confidence vote===

Speaking on RTÉ on 15 May 2010, Cowen said that, in hindsight, he should have introduced a property tax to cool the property boom. Responding to the Taoiseach&#x27;s defence of his actions as minister for finance, the Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny accused him of &quot;washing his hands&quot; of his role in Ireland&#x27;s economic crisis. Speaking during a front bench meeting in Cork, Kenny also claimed Fianna Fáil was spreading fear by considering cuts to the old age pension. &quot;Sorry is a word that Fianna Fáil does not recognise, they don&#x27;t understand,&quot; Kenny told party colleagues. Kenny said Taoiseach Cowen, in defending his handling of events, was refusing to acknowledge that he drove the economy &quot;up on the rocks&quot; for four years when he was Minister for Finance. &quot;He expects everybody else to accept responsibility for it but not him. It&#x27;s another example of hands being washed by those in charge, a refusal to accept responsibility for their part in destroying the Irish economy and heaping economic woes . . . upon so many people.&quot; The Fine Gael leader said the best thing the Taoiseach could do was to hold the three pending by-elections or a general election, so the people could have their say.

On 15 June 2010, Cowen faced his second no-confidence motion in just over a year, tabled by Fine Gael after the publication of two reports that criticised government policies in the run-up to Ireland&#x27;s banking crisis. He again survived the motion, 82–77.

===EU and IMF rescue===
On the evening of 21 November 2010, Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union&#x27;s European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after long resisting pressure from other eurozone nations, particularly France and Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTÉ 21/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 2010, the European Commission agreed to an €85 billion rescue deal of which €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), €22.5 billion from the IMF, €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. The remaining €17.5 billion will come from a state contribution from the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and other domestic cash resources.

The bailout was widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation, and by some as a betrayal of the long-fought struggle for Irish independence whose legacy forms a major part of the Irish identity. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; editorialized:

On 24 November 2010, Cowen unveiled a four-year plan to stabilise the economy by 2014. The plan was met with great protest as it included deeply unpopular elements, including drastic cuts in social welfare, the lowering of the minimum wage, and an increase in the value added tax while maintaining the state&#x27;s low corporate tax rate. In recognition of the political disaster this would inflict on his government, Cowen indicated that the election would take place in early 2011 after the 2011 budgetary process has been completed, though at the time he would not set a specific date.

==Fall from power==
===Meeting with Seán FitzPatrick===
It was revealed following the publication of the book, &quot;The Fitzpatrick Tapes&quot; by Tom Lyons and Brian Carey, that two previously undisclosed meetings had occurred between Seán FitzPatrick, the Chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, and Brian Cowen.

The first was a telephone call in March 2008, while Cowen was overseas in Vietnam and when Cowen was then Minister of Finance. The second meeting took place on 28 July 2008, at Druids Glen, County Wicklow.

At that time Anglo Irish Bank was badly affected by the downturn in the property market. On 28 September 2008, the Irish government decided to introduce a bank guarantee to cover Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Seán FitzPatrick was forced to resign in January 2009, over the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy. The meeting, over seven hours, took place over a round of golf and a subsequent dinner with Fitzpatrick and two other directors of Anglo Irish Bank.

During a heated Leader&#x27;s Question session in Dáil Éireann, which ran over the allotted time considerably, Cowen denied that Anglo Irish Bank had been discussed. However, when questioned by the Sinn Féin Dáil leader Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin (who had been attending a wedding at the hotel and by chance had encountered Cowen and Fitzpatrick), Cowen was forced to admit that there were two other people at the meeting, Gary McGann, a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Alan Gray, a director of the Central Bank and currently managing director of a consultancy company Indecon. Brian Cowen has claimed that the meeting was a social event, while Gray has stated that he was invited to provide economic advice on stimulating the economy. Tánaiste Mary Coughlan, described the purpose of the meeting as a fundraiser for Fianna Fáil.

Cowen subsequently threatened to sue Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, if he repeated the accusation outside the Dáil. Ó Caoláin responded by repeating the accusation in public and inviting Cowen to take him to court.

===January cabinet reshuffle===
In the stir created by the revelations of Cowen&#x27;s meetings with Fitzpatrick, Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore, announced his plan to table a third motion of no confidence in Cowen&#x27;s government. At the time, however, Cowen&#x27;s more immediate concern was pressure from within his party to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil. Cowen announced on 16 January 2011, that he would not resign as party leader of his own accord; however, he would put down a motion of confidence in his leadership at Fianna Fáil&#x27;s parliamentary party meeting on 18 January 2011, to be decided by secret ballot. Foreign Minister Micheál Martin, publicly announced that he would vote against the motion, effectively presenting himself as a challenger to Cowen&#x27;s leadership. On the evening of 18 January 2011, Government Chief Whip John Curran, announced that Cowen had prevailed in the confidence vote, although the exact counts were to remain secret and the ballots had been shredded. Cowen also announced that he had &quot;reluctantly&quot; accepted Martin&#x27;s resignation from his government.

The following day, however, Cowen forced the resignations of four more Ministers, Noel Dempsey, Dermot Ahern, Tony Killeen and Mary Harney; the day after that, another Minister, Batt O&#x27;Keefe, resigned. The Ministers who resigned had already declined to contest the 2011 general election. The resignations were engineered to allow Cowen to appoint new Ministers, who might strengthen his party&#x27;s position for the election. However, the junior coalition partner, the Green Party, expressed outrage that they had not been consulted about the reshuffle. The Greens accordingly refused to endorse Cowen&#x27;s intended replacements, forcing Cowen to reassign the vacant portfolios to incumbent Ministers. The Green Party also threatened to pull out of the government unless Cowen set a firm date for the general election; Cowen subsequently announced it would take place on 11 March 2011. When Cowen addressed the Dáil to announce the reshuffle, the Green Party were absent and had not taken their seats in the Dáil that day. The &quot;Independent&quot; later concluded that the failed reshuffle left Cowen &quot;an isolated, hugely damaged figure&quot;.

Moreover, Green Party leader John Gormley publicly stated that trust between the coalition parties had been greatly eroded, perhaps irreparably. At that point, members of Fianna Fáil, including many of those who had previously announced support for Cowen in the party&#x27;s confidence motion, began questioning his leadership and pressing for his resignation from the leadership of the party before the election. The press, meanwhile, compared the attempted reshuffle and its fallout to the GUBU political disaster of the early 1980s Charles Haughey government, up to that point the most sensational political scandal in the history of Ireland. Fianna Fáil, already at a record low 14% approval rating, slid in the wake of the botched reshuffle to 8%.

===Resignation as leader===
Faced with a fractured coalition, rebellion within his party, and an acknowledged public relations disaster, Cowen announced his resignation as leader of Fianna Fáil on 22 January 2011. He insisted, however, that he would continue as Taoiseach under a caretaking government, until the election, to complete legislation for the 2011 budget.

The resignation did not quell the consequences of Cowen&#x27;s actions. Labour leader Eamon Gilmore announced that he would go forward with his no-confidence motion on Wednesday, 26 January 2011. Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny also announced that if Cowen did not ask President Mary McAleese for an immediate dissolution of the Dáil, his party would table a no-confidence motion in the Taoiseach on Tuesday, ahead of Labour&#x27;s motion. Then, on Sunday the 23rd, less than 24 hours after Cowen announced his resignation, the Greens tore up the coalition agreement and pulled its two ministers, Gormley and Eamon Ryan, from the government. Cowen accepted their resignations. This left Cowen at the head of a minority government, with seven Ministers (the absolute minimum mandated by the constitution of Ireland), and facing two consecutive no-confidence votes in the Dáil.

===Finance Bill, dissolution and retirement===
On 24 January 2011, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan met with delegations from Fine Gael, Labour, and the Greens, striking a final deal. Labour and Fine Gael agreed to drop their no-confidence motions in exchange for an agreement that the finance bill would be finalised in the Dáil by Friday the 28th (with the Seanad to finalise on Saturday), upon which Cowen would immediately request that President McAleese dissolve the Dáil.

The Dáil passed the finance bill on 27 January 2011, with the Seanad following on 29 January. Accordingly, Cowen asked McAleese to dissolve the Dáil on 1 February 2011. Following Irish constitutional practice, McAleese duly granted the dissolution. Cowen subsequently confirmed that the general election would be brought forward to 25 February 2011. Cowen also announced that he would not contest his Dáil seat. He said he would retire from politics, after 27 years.

The pent-up resentment at Cowen&#x27;s government resulted in a debacle for Fianna Fáil at the general election. The party suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state, falling to only 20 seats for third place—the first time since 1927 that it was not the largest party in the chamber. Cowen was succeeded by Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny as Taoiseach, leading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which took office on 9 March 2011. As Cowen was no longer a TD when the new Dáil convened, he was unable to preside over the opening, and Fianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin and outgoing Finance Minister Brian Lenihan appeared on the government front bench in his place.

==Public image==

Cowen was often referred to in Irish satirical and tabloid media as &quot;BIFFO&quot;, a nickname applied to people from Offaly. BIFFO is an acronym for &quot;Big Ignorant Fecker/Fucker From Offaly&quot;. Cowen has said that BIFFO stands for &quot;Beautiful Intelligent Fellow From Offaly&#x27;. An unnamed journalist described Cowen &quot;as subtle as a JCB&quot;.

WikiLeaks cables from Ireland to the US revealed, that US diplomats in Ireland reported that the nickname BIFFO applied &quot;especially well&quot; to former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, as described in leaked US embassy dispatches.

In a candid profile from WikiLeaks, of Cowen as the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader, then US Ambassador Thomas Foley described Cowen as &quot;burly and brusque&quot; saying that he had &quot;a reputation of not being much concerned with his public image.&quot;

The Ambassador also described Mr Cowen&#x27;s fondness for frequenting pubs and singing, saying he would likely be more approachable than his predecessor Bertie Ahern.

Cowen was accused of &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot;, over comments he made in the Dáil when, at the end of a heated exchange, he sat down and spoke to Tánaiste Mary Coughlan; Dáil microphones picked up the Taoiseach using the word &quot;fuckers&quot;, though he was not referring to any opposition politician. He later apologised for his remark.

Cowen has been openly criticised by his parliamentary party colleagues including one who said in an interview that Cowen has suffered from &quot;poor communications and consultation&quot; and expressed concern about the emergence of a perceived &quot;triumvirate&quot; (comprising the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance) within the Cabinet.

In a novel criticism, artist and teacher Conor Casby placed unflattering nude portraits of Cowen in the National Gallery of Ireland and the gallery of the Royal Hibernian Academy. The pictures were reported in a television news bulletin and caused considerable debate in the media.

Cowen was criticised as being inept during the approach to the third budget, in December 2009. He said, &quot;Our priority is to stabilise the public finances&quot;, a year after the Irish public was told that this was the priority for 2008.

===&quot;Morning Ireland&quot; interview===
On 14 September 2010, after an interview on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Morning Ireland,&quot; Cowen was described by Deputy Simon Coveney of Fine Gael as sounding as if he was intoxicated or hungover. The interview was on the morning of day two of his party&#x27;s annual pre-Dáil meeting held at the Ardilaun Hotel in Galway. Cowen rejected the allegations, describing them as &quot;pathetic&quot;. However, this incident has been unfavourably commented upon by the international press, and dubbed &quot;Gargle gate&quot; by the domestic media. A brief sketch about Cowen that appeared on a subsequent episode of the American talk show &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno&quot;, in which host Jay Leno described Cowen as a &quot;drunken moron&quot; and acted with incredulity towards his status as Taoiseach, received coverage in the Irish media and further damaged Cowen&#x27;s public image.

He apologised for his interview performance the following day saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my best performance and I would like to apologise for that. I would hate to think the reputation of the country or the office of Taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say.&quot; He claimed that there was a hoarseness in his voice and denied that he had been hungover. His version of this event was substantiated in 2017, by his interviewer who stated that Cowen was weary and not drunk or hungover.

===Approval ratings===

When Cowen took office, his approval rating was at 52%. At the time, he was considered a local and national hero. After his first 100 days however, Cowen&#x27;s approval rating slipped to 27%, marking the first time a Taoiseach&#x27;s popularity declined significantly since the creation of the post in 1937. By the beginning of 2009, his approval rating hovered at 24%, but then later fell to 18%, and later that year, was at 15%. 

However, at the end of 2009, Cowen&#x27;s approval rating recovered to 22%, before rising to 26% when 2010 began. However, his approval rating fell back down to 18% later that year. By the end of 2010, Cowen&#x27;s approval rating was at 14% with nine out of ten Irish people wanting him out. After a failed cabinet shuffle in January 2011, Cowen&#x27;s approval rating reached it&#x27;s lowest point of just 8%, before leaving office with a 10% approval rating.

As of August 2010, despite being very unpopular at home, Cowen was listed as one of the top ten leaders in the world by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, which praised his handling of the Irish economy. While &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that &quot;Cowen has presided over the worst economic crisis in modern times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked him fifth in the world after David Cameron, Mohamed Nasheed, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Wen Jiabao.

According to &quot;TheJournal.ie&quot;, Cowen was &quot;the least popular incumbent in the history of [Irish] opinion polling,&quot; with approval between 8 and 10 per cent of the electorate. As of January 2011, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s popularity had fallen to a record low and was tied with Sinn Féin on 14% in joint third place.

==Legacy and later life==
Cowen became leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach without ever facing an election in either capacity; he is the only Fianna Fáil leader to have left the post without ever taking the party into an election. Under his stewardship of the country, his party Fianna Fáil, saw its electoral support base diminished by 75% in the general election of February 2011, as a reaction to the intervention, in the running of the Irish economy, of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in November 2010.

Cowen was criticised for being a poor communicator and for his perceived failure to connect with the electorate. Historian Diarmaid Ferriter described Cowen&#x27;s &quot;appalling communication skills and self-destructive stubbornness&quot; as inflicting most damage to Fianna Fáil.

As the scale of the party&#x27;s electoral defeat became evident, Cowen accepted responsibility for decisions taken in government.
&quot;From my point of view as Taoiseach and as a Minister in the past I take full responsibility. I&#x27;ve never quibbled or suggested otherwise.&quot; 

In November 2011, a review of Cowen&#x27;s governance was broadcast on RTÉ television over two episodes entitled &quot;Crisis: Inside the Cowen Government&quot;. Cowen did not contribute to the series, but many of his former ministerial colleagues critiqued his performance as Taoiseach.
On 21 March 2012, Cowen delivered a speech at the BMW Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., entitled &quot;The Euro: From Crisis to Resolution? Some Reflections from Ireland on the Road Thus Far&quot;. In his first public comments since leaving office, he defended his government&#x27;s blanket bank guarantee in 2008, but admitted that his government should have increased taxes and cut spending. He also admitted that his government should accept some blame for Ireland&#x27;s economic downfall. He compared the start of the 2008 economic crisis to a series of plane crashes, all taking place at the same time and each for different reasons. He receives annual pension payments of over €150,000.

In May 2014, Cowen became part of the board of Topaz Energy. He was appointed to the board of Beacon Hospital in February 2015.

In April 2015, Cowen was attacked by protesters in Dublin, in which he was called a &quot;scumbag&quot; and a &quot;traitor&quot;.

In July 2017, Cowen was conferred with an honorary doctorate from the National University of Ireland, an honour bestowed on all but two former Taoisigh. During his 50-minute acceptance speech he criticised the EU for its behaviour towards Ireland during the financial crisis and expressed regret that so many jobs were lost during the recession. Following the conferring ceremony, the NUI faced considerable public criticism for deciding to make the award to Cowen. Former (and founding) President of the University of Limerick, Ed Walsh, announced that he would hand back his honorary doctorate in protest, and did so on 14 November 2018.

On 5 July 2019, Cowen was admitted to Beacon Hospital after suffering a major brain haemorrhage. He was then transferred to St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital where he spent five months before transferring to a physical rehabilitation facility. As of late 2020, while Cowen was still in hospital following a stroke the previous year, he had been making steady progress. Cowen returned home in 2021 and has made a recent public appearance in a wheelchair.

<doc id="287164" wikidata="Q463728" url="?curid=287164" title="Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon">
<text>Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, GE (; 16 January 16752 March 1755), was a French soldier, diplomat, and memoirist. He was born in Paris at the Hôtel Selvois, 6 rue Taranne (demolished in 1876 to make way for the Boulevard Saint-Germain). The family&#x27;s ducal peerage (&quot;duché-pairie&quot;), granted in 1635 to his father Claude de Rouvroy (1608–1693), served as both perspective and theme in Saint-Simon&#x27;s life and writings. He was the second and last Duke of Saint-Simon.

His enormous memoirs are a classic of French literature, giving the fullest and most lively account of the court at Versailles of Louis XIV and the &quot;Régence&quot; at the start of Louis XV&#x27;s reign.

== Peerage of France ==
Men of the noblest blood (in Saint-Simon&#x27;s view) might not be, and in most cases were not, peers in France. Derived at least traditionally and imaginatively from the &quot;douze pairs&quot; (twelve peers) of Charlemagne, the peerage of France was supposed to be, literally, the chosen of the &quot;noblesse&quot;, deemed thereafter to incarnate the French nobility &quot;par excellence&quot;. Their legal pre-eminence derived from hereditary membership in the Parlement of Paris, the highest of France&#x27;s judicial and quasi-legislative assemblies. Strictly speaking, a French peerage (usually attached to a dukedom) was granted in favour of a designated fief rather than upon the titleholder &quot;per se&quot;. His lifelong ambition was the conversion of France&#x27;s peers into a &quot;Great Council of the Nation&quot;.
The family&#x27;s principal seat, where Saint-Simon&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; was written, was at La Ferté-Vidame, bought by his father shortly after his elevation to the dukedom. The castle brought with it the ancient, entailed title, &quot;Vidame de Chartres&quot;, borne as a courtesy style by the Duke&#x27;s only son until he was eighteen. As it had been attributed to an elderly character in the well-known court novel &quot;La Princesse de Clèves&quot;, published in 1678, just three years after Saint-Simon&#x27;s birth, his arrival at court as a young man may have been less inconspicuous than otherwise.

== Life ==

His father, Claude, the first duke, was a tall and taciturn man who was keen on hunting. Louis de Saint-Simon was the opposite; garrulous, much shorter, and preferring life indoors. His father had been a favourite hunting companion of Louis XIII. King Louis had appointed his father as Master of Wolfhounds before granting him a dukedom in 1635 at a relatively young age; he was 68 when Louis was born. Saint-Simon ranked thirteenth in the order of precedence among France&#x27;s eighteen dukes. His mother, Charlotte de L&#x27;Aubespine, daughter of François, Marquis de Hauterive by his wife, Eléonore de Volvire, marquise de Ruffec, descended from a distinguished family, noble since at least the time of Francis I. 

She was a formidable woman whose word was law in the family, and became more so in extreme old age. Her son Louis, of whom Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Thérèse were godparents, was well-educated, largely by her. After further tuition from the Jesuits, he joined the &quot;Mousquetaires gris&quot; in 1692, serving at the Siege of Namur and at the Battle of Neerwinden. Then he embarked upon his life&#x27;s mission by pronouncing upon the precedence among French peers, much against the orders and interests of François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg, his victorious general.

In 1695, he married Marie-Gabrielle de Durfort, daughter of Guy Aldonce Durfort, Duke of Lorges, a marshal of France, later serving under the Duke&#x27;s command. He seems to have regarded her with a respect and affection unusual between husband and wife in that era; and she sometimes succeeded in suppressing his pompous ideals. As he did not receive further promotion in the army, he resigned his commission in 1702, thereby incurring Louis XIV&#x27;s displeasure. He kept his position at court but only with difficulty, and then immersed himself in court intrigue at Versailles, tapping a collection of informants, the likes of dukes as well as servants, which later yielded him the benefit of an extraordinary amount of privileged information.
Saint-Simon, for his own part, appears to have played only an intermediate role in court life. He was nominated as ambassador to Rome in 1705, but the appointment was cancelled before he departed. At last, he attached himself to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, Louis XIV&#x27;s nephew and the future regent. Though this was hardly likely to ingratiate him with Louis, it at least gave him the status of belonging to a definite party and it eventually placed him in the position of a friend to the acting chief of state. He also allied himself with Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Dauphin&#x27;s son and next heir to the French throne.
Saint-Simon loathed &quot;the bastards&quot;, Louis XIV&#x27;s illegitimate children, and not, apparently, entirely because they were accorded ceremonial precedence above France&#x27;s peers. The Saint-Simon that is revealed through the &quot;Mémoires&quot; had many enemies, and a hatred reciprocated by many courtiers. However, it should be remembered that these reminiscences were written 30 years after the facts, by a disappointed man, and that Saint-Simon had maintained congenial or at least courteous relations with the majority of his fellow courtiers.

The death of Louis XIV seemed to have given Saint-Simon a chance of realizing his hopes. The Duke of Orleans became regent and Saint-Simon was appointed to his Regency Council. But no steps were taken to carry out his &quot;preferred vision&quot; of a France ruled by the noble élite, exposing how little real influence he had with the Regent. He was somewhat gratified by the degradation of &quot;the bastards&quot; in 1718 and, in 1721, he was appointed ambassador extraordinary to Spain so as to facilitate the marriage of Louis XV and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain (which, however, never took place). Whilst in Spain he did, however, secure a grandeeship, which later devolved upon his second son. Despite having caught smallpox, he was quite satisfied with his efforts there: two ducal titles (grandees were recognised in France as dukes). Saint-Simon was not eager, unlike most other nobility, to acquire profitable functions, and he did not use his influence to repair his finances, which were even further diminished by the extravagance of his embassy.
After his return to France, he had little to do with public affairs. His own account of the cessation of his intimacy with Orléans and Guillaume Dubois, the latter having never been his friend, is, like his account of some other events of his own life, rather vague and dubious. But there can be little doubt that he was eclipsed, and even expelled from the Château de Meudon by Cardinal Dubois. He survived for more than thirty years, but little is known of the rest of his life. His wife died in 1743, his eldest son a little later. He had other family troubles, and he was loaded with debt. The dukedom in which he took such pride ended with him, and his only granddaughter was childless.

He died in Paris on 2 March 1755, having almost entirely outlived his own generation and exhausted his family&#x27;s wealth, though not its notoriety. A distant relative, Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon, born five years after the Duke&#x27;s death, is remembered as an intellectual forerunner of socialism.
All his possessions, including his writings, were seized by the Crown on his death. His &quot;Mémoires&quot; were kept under sequestration and only circulated through private copies and excerpts until the restitution of the manuscript to his heirs in 1828. While its appendices and supporting documents were dispersed, this sequestration was ultimately credited for the preservation of his memoirs.

== Fame as a writer ==
Posthumously, he acquired great literary fame. He was an indefatigable writer, and he began very early to record all the gossip he collected, all his interminable legal disputes over precedence, and a vast mass of unclassified material. Most of his manuscripts were retrieved by the Crown and it was long before their contents were fully published: partly in the form of notes in the marquis de Dangeau&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;, partly in both original and independent memoirs, partly in scattered and multifarious extracts; he had committed to paper an immense amount of material. 

Saint-Simon believed he could improve upon Dangeau&#x27;s dry chronicling of events with his own vivid narrative style. According to Charles Henry Conrad Wright, &quot;taking Dangeau as foundation, he goes over the same ground, sometimes copying, more often developing or inserting additional information, the result of more acute observation.&quot;

Saint-Simon&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; strike a most realistic note. On the one hand, he is petty, and unjust to private enemies and to those who espoused public views contrary to his as well as being an incessant gossip. Yet he shows a great skill for narrative and for character-drawing. He has been compared to the historians Livy and Tacitus. He is not a writer who can be sampled easily, inasmuch as his most characteristic passages sometimes occur in the midst of long stretches of quite uninteresting diatribe. His vocabulary was extreme and inventive. He is deemed to have first used the word &quot;intellectual&quot; as a noun. &quot;Patriot&quot; and &quot;publicity&quot; are also accredited as being introduced by him in their current usage.

A few critical studies of him, especially those of Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, are the basis of much that has been written about him. His most famous passages, such as the account of the death of the Dauphin, or of the Bed of Justice where his enemy, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine, was degraded, do not give a fair idea of his talent. These are his celebrated pieces, his great &quot;engines&quot;, as French art slang calls them. Much more noteworthy as well as more frequent are the sudden touches which he gives. 

The bishops are &quot;cuistres violets&quot; (purple pedants). &quot;(M. de Caumartin) &quot;porte sous son manteau toute la faculté que M. de Villeroy étale sur son baudrier&quot; (Caumartin holds under his cloak all the power that Villeroy displays on his scabbard). Another politician has a &quot;mine de chat fâché&quot;&quot; (appearance of a disgruntled cat). In short, the interest of his &quot;Mémoires&quot; is in the novel and adroit use of words and phrases.

In &quot;A Short History of French Literature&quot;, the &quot;Mémoires&quot; are described as &quot;vast and rambling...one of the least-read masterpieces of the age&quot; which &quot;provide us not only with a picture of the squalor and pettiness which often lay behind the glittering façade of the court, but also with the precise angle of perception of a senior courtier. This is prose narrative on a monumental scale; how much of it is fiction is hard to tell, but in this area the distinction is not paramount, since what matters is the imaginative reconstruction of a lost world (Proust owes not a little to Saint-Simon)&quot;.

He had a profound influence on writers including Tolstoy, Barbey d&#x27; Aurevilly, Flaubert, Valle-Inclán, Proust, Mujica Láinez and many others.

==Family==
Saint-Simon married Marie-Gabrielle de Durfort (daughter of Guy Aldonce de Durfort, duc de Lorges), on 8 April 1695, at the Hôtel de Lorges in Paris.

They had three children:
#Charlotte de Rouvroy (8 September 169629 September 1763) married Charles-Louis de Henin-Liétard d&#x27;Alsace, &quot;Prince of Chimay&quot;; they had no children. He was the brother of Cardinal d&#x27;Alsace.
#Jacques Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Ruffec (29 July 169815 July 1746) married, in 1727, Cathérine Charlotte Thérèse de Gramont (died 1755), daughter of the Duke of Gramont (widow of Philippe Alexandre, Duke of Bournonville), leaving no children;
#Armand-Jean de Rouvroy (12 April 169920 May 1754) married Marie Jeanne Louise, daughter of Nicolas Prosper Bauyn d&#x27;Angervilliers; they had one daughter.

His granddaughter Marie Christine de Rouvroy, &quot;Mademoiselle de Ruffec&quot; (daughter of Jacques Louis) married a son of the Princess Louise Hippolyte of Monaco in 1749, becoming the &quot;Countess of Valentinois&quot;.

<text>&quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; (; ) is the current royal anthem of Thailand. It was a de facto national anthem of Siam before 1932.

== History ==

The first song to be used as royal anthem and de facto national anthem of Thailand appeared in the reign of King Mongkut of Rattanakosin Kingdom. In 1851, two former British military officers named Captain Impey and Lieutenant Thomas George Knox served with the Siamese Army. They trained the troops of King Mongkut and the Second King Pinklao with British military tradition. So, they adopted the anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; as honor music for the king of Siam. Phraya Srisunthonwohan (Noi Āchāryānkura) wrote Thai lyrics for this anthem later and named it as &quot;Chom Rat Chong Charoen&quot;, which means &quot;long live the great king&quot;.

In 1871, King Chulalongkorn visited Singapore and Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies; it appeared that Siam used the same anthem with Great Britain, who ruled over Singapore at that time. It was necessary that Siam must have a new unique tune for using as the royal anthem and de facto national anthem. A group of Siamese traditional musicians had selected a Thai song named &quot;Bulan Loi Luean&quot; which was the royal composition of King Rama II for use as the new anthem. King Chulalongkorn later ordered Christopher Hewetson, a Dutch bandmaster who served in the Royal Siamese Army, to arrange the song in western style for performing by the military band. According to a research of Sugree Charoensuk, an associate professor from Mahidol University, the melody of this anthem may be the same tune with another anthem named &quot;Sansoen Sua Pa&quot; which had been used as the anthem of the Wild Tiger Corps since 1911.

History about the royal anthem of Siam after 1871 are ambiguous, and evidence is rare to find. An evidence of music composition of the royal anthem of Siam appeared again in 1888 when a sheet music of the Siamese national anthem, arranged by the Ukrainian composer Pyotr Schurovsky, was printed in Russia. The main melody of the song in that sheet music is the same tune of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; in present time. According to a research of Sugree Charoensook, Pyotr Shchurovsky was the composer of the music of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot;, to serve as Siam&#x27;s national anthem. Prince Narisara Nuvadtivong later composed various lyrics of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; for using in the Royal Siamese Army, in all Siamese schools and in Siamese traditional music bands. Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse also composed a version of lyrics for used in the Royal Siamese Navy. In 1913, King Vajiravudh decided to relinquish all lyrics of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; that mentioned before and revised it to current version only.

&quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; was the de facto national anthem of Siam from 1888 until 1932, when it was replaced by &quot;Phleng Chat Siam&quot;&quot;.&quot; It is still used as the royal anthem of Thailand today.

In 1940, the Thai government under the administration of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram issued the 8th Thai cultural mandate, concerning the lyrics of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot;, which were shortened and the word &quot;Siam&quot; replaced with &quot;Thai&quot; (see below). After the end of World War II, these lyrics were quietly abandoned due its unpopularity, and reverted to the version that revised by King Vajiravudh in 1913.

The sound recording of &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; was recorded for the first time ever on the Edison wax cylinder by Carl Stumpf, an ethnomusicologist from the University of Berlin. In that recording, the anthem was performed by Boosra Mahin Theater Group, a Siamese theater group visiting Berlin in 1900.

== Usage of the anthem ==
The royal anthem is performed during state occasions, as well as when a high-ranking member of the royal family is present for a function. In addition, the royal anthem is still played before the beginning of each film in movie theatres, as well as before the commencement of the first act in plays, musicals, concerts, and most other live performances of music or theatre in Thailand. The anthem is also played at the sign-on and closedown of television and radio programming; for example, in 2008, 7HD aired a with pictures of King Bhumibol Adulyadej from his birth to his 80th birthday in 2007. Radio Thailand (or NBT) also broadcast the sign-off with the anthem at 24:00 every night.

In 2019, the Royal Thai Government Gazette has published the Royal Office Regulation on Performing Honors Music of B.E. 2562. This regulation is detailed about using the royal anthem and other honors music for the king and members of the Thai royal family in several occasions. According to this regulation, The royal anthem &quot;Sansoen Phra Barami&quot; should be performed for the following:

* The King of Thailand
* Queen Sirikit the Queen Mother
* The Queen of Thailand
* Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal

<text>Claude de Rouvroy, 1st [[Duke of Saint-Simon]] (; August 1607 – 3 May 1693), was a French soldier and courtier, and favourite of Louis XIII of France, who created his dukedom for him. His only son Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Saint-Simon (1675–1755) was the famous memoirist of the court of Louis XIV.

He was the second son of Louis de Rouvroy, &quot;Seigneur&quot; du Plessis (died 1643), who had been a warm supporter of Henri, Duke of Guise and the Catholic League.

==Life and career==
With his elder brother Charles (who later became the marquis de Saint-Simon), Claude de Rouvroy entered the service of Louis XIII as a page and found instant favour with the king. Named first equerry in March 1627, he became in less than three years the captain of the châteaux of St-Germain and Versailles, master of the hounds, first gentleman of the bed-chamber, royal councillor and governor of Meulan and of Blaye.

On the fall of La Rochelle in 1628, he received lands in the vicinity valued at 80,000 livres. In 1635, his &quot;seigneurie&quot; of Saint-Simon in Vermandois was erected into a duchy, and he was created a peer of France. Despite the estrangement of later years, he had a true regard for the king, and he brought his son up to revere him as the model of kingship.

He was at first on good terms with Richelieu and was of service on the Day of Dupes (11 November 1630). Having suffered disgrace for taking the part of his uncle, the baron of Saint Léger, after the capture of Catelet (15 August 1636), he retired to Blaye.

He fought in the campaigns of 1638 and 1639, and after the death of Richelieu returned to court, where he was coldly received by the king (18 February 1643). Thenceforth, with the exception of siding with Condé during the Fronde, he took small part in politics.

By his first wife, Diane de Budos de Portes, a relative of Condé, whom he married in 1644 and who died in 1670, he had three daughters. By his second wife, Charlotte de l&#x27;Aubespine, whom he married in 1672, he had a son Louis, the &quot;author of the memoirs&quot;.

<text>In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations (actions) of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports.

== History ==
The term &quot;C.R.U.D&quot; was likely first popularized in 1983 by James Martin in his book &quot;Managing the data-base environment&quot;.

== Conceptual ==
Data can be put in a &quot;location/area&quot; of a storage mechanism.

* The fundamental feature of a storage location is that its &quot;content&quot; is both &quot;readable&quot; and &quot;updatable&quot;.
* Before a storage location can be read or updated it needs to be &quot;created&quot;; that is allocated and initialized with content. 
* At some later point, the storage location may need to be &quot;destructed&quot;; that is finalized and deallocated.

Together these four operations make up the basic operations of storage management known as CRUD: &quot;Create&quot;, &quot;Read&quot;, &quot;Update&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot;.

== Use cases ==
=== Databases ===
The acronym CRUD refers to the major operations which are implemented by databases. Each letter in the acronym can be mapped to a standard Structured Query Language (SQL) statement.

Although relational databases are a common persistence layer in software applications, numerous other persistence layers exist. CRUD functionality can for example be implemented with document databases, object databases, XML databases, text files, or binary files.

Some big data systems do not implement UPDATE, but have only a timestamped INSERT (journaling), storing a completely new version of the object each time.

=== RESTful APIs ===

The acronym CRUD also appears in the discussion of RESTful APIs. Each letter in the acronym may be mapped to a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method:

In HTTP, the GET (read), PUT (create and update), POST (create - if we don&#x27;t have `id` or `uuid`), and DELETE (delete) methods are CRUD operations as they have storage management semantics, meaning that they let user agents directly manipulate the states of target resources. The POST method, on the other hand, is a process operation that has target-resource-specific semantics which typically exceed the scope of CRUD operations.

=== User interface ===
CRUD is also relevant at the user interface level of most applications. For example, in address book software, the basic storage unit is an individual &quot;contact entry&quot;. As a bare minimum, the software must allow the user to:
* &quot;Create&quot;, or add new entries
* &quot;Read&quot;, retrieve, search, or view existing entries
* &quot;Update&quot;, or edit existing entries
* &quot;Delete&quot;, deactivate, or remove existing entries

Because these operations are so fundamental, they are often documented and described under one comprehensive heading such as &quot;contact management&quot; or &quot;document management&quot; in general.

== Other variations ==
Other variations of CRUD include:
* ABCD (add, browse, change, delete)
* CRUDL (create, read, update, delete, list)
*BREAD (browse, read, edit, add, delete)
* DAVE (delete, add, view, edit)
* CRAP (create, replicate, append, process)

== See also ==
* Representational state transfer (REST)
* Active record pattern
* Data manipulation language
* Input/output
* ACID
* Query by Example
* Command–query separation
* Scaffold (programming)

<text>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is the international airport serving Mumbai, the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the second busiest airport in India in terms of total and international passenger traffic after Delhi, and was the ninth busiest airport in Asia and 25th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in fiscal year 2023–24.

The airport is operated by Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a joint venture between Adani Enterprises, a subsidiary of the Adani Group and Airports Authority of India.

The airport is named after Shivaji (1630–1680), 17th-century Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire. It was renamed in 1999 from the previous &quot;Sahar Airport&quot; to &quot;Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport&quot; (the title &quot;Maharaj&quot; was inserted on 30 August 2018). It is situated across the suburbs of Santacruz and Sahar Village in Vile Parle East.
==History==
RAF Santa Cruz was constructed in the 1930s. It was a bigger airfield than nearby Juhu Aerodrome and was home to several RAF squadrons during World War II from 1942 to 1947. The Airport covered an area of about and initially had three runways. The apron existed on the south side of runway 09/27, and the area, referred to today as the &quot;Old Airport&quot;, houses, among others, maintenance hangars of Air India, Air Works India, Indamer Aviation Pvt Ltd, and MIAL&#x27;s General Aviation Terminal.

By 1946, when the RAF began the process of handing over the airfield to the Director General of Civil Aviation for Civil operations, two old abandoned hangars of the Royal Air Force had been converted into a terminal for passenger traffic. One hangar was used as a domestic terminal and the other for international traffic. It had counters for customs and immigration checks on either side and a lounge in the center. Air India handled its passengers in its own terminal adjoining the two hangars. In its first year, it handled six civilian services a day.

Traffic at the airport increased after Karachi was partitioned to Pakistan and as many as 40 daily domestic and foreign services were operated by 1949, prompting the Indian Government to develop the airport, equipping the airport with a night landing system comprising a Radio range and a modernised flare path lighting system. Construction of a new passenger terminal and apron began in 1950 and was commissioned in 1958. Named after the neighbourhood in which it stood and initially under the aegis of the Public Works Department, the new airport was subsequently run by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

With the dawning of the jumbo jet era in the 1970s, Santacruz, despite several extensions, began suffering from insufficient operational capacity.
The Santacruz terminal was designed to accommodate 600 passengers at any given time, but by the late 1970s, it was handling 1,200. In 1979–80, 5 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Santa Cruz compared with 3 million at Delhi&#x27;s Palam Airport. The airlines were constantly expanding their services but there was no corresponding increase in space at the terminal, making it the most congested airport in the country. In one of its issues, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, referring to the chaos, called the terminal building a &quot;black hole&quot;.
A major fire gutted the International section of the terminal building on 21 September 1979, killing three passengers and shutting down the airport. A temporary departure extension or &quot;Gulf Terminal&quot; was made functional in October of that year until the terminal was repaired.

The Tata committee, set up in 1967 to examine the issues concerning the airport, had recommended the construction of a new international terminal to meet the requirements of traffic in the seventies. The Santa Cruz terminal was to be used for domestic traffic alone. The International Airport Authority of India (IAAI), which was set up in 1972, started planning the construction of a new terminal building for handling international passenger traffic, to be completed by 1981. Accordingly, construction of the new international terminal at Sahar to the northeast of Santacruz in Vile Parle was taken up at an estimated cost of 110 million.
Construction of the new international terminal at Sahar began in November 1977, and the first phase took three years to build. Sahar Terminal 2A, the first phase of the two-part terminal, was opened on 5 December 1980.

AAI had been considering the modernisation of Bombay Airport in 1996 although the AAI board approved a modernisation proposal only in 2003. By then, Bombay and Delhi Airports were handling 38% of the country&#x27;s aircraft movement and generating one-third of all revenues earned by AAI. At that time, the Bombay airport handled 13.3 million passengers, 60% of which were domestic travellers. The airport faced severe congestion for both aircraft and passengers as it was handling twice as many aircraft movements per day than it was originally designed for. The bidding process for its modernisation eventually began in May 2004 with the decision by the Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) was announced in January 2006. In November 2006, Delta Air Lines inaugurated a direct flight from Mumbai to New York.

== Passenger and air traffic ==
Its passenger traffic was about 49.8 million in year 2018. It is also the second busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic. In March 2017, the airport surpassed London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport as the world&#x27;s busiest to operate a single runway at a time. This was later surpassed again by Gatwick Airport at the end of 2019 due to passenger numbers falling at Mumbai.

It handled a record of 1,007 aircraft movements on 9 December 2018, higher than its earlier record of 1,003 flight movements in a day in June 2018. It handled a record of 51 movements in one hour on 16 September 2014. In financial year 2020, the Mumbai Airport handled 45.87 million passengers, only second to IGI&#x27;s 67.3 million in India. In financial year 2023–24, the airport handled the highest ever passengers in its history of 52.8 million passengers, surpassing its maximum capacity of 50 million passengers per year, and second only to IGI&#x27;s 73.6 million in India.

==Ownership==
A consortium of GVK Industries, Airports Company South Africa, and Bidvest, won the bid to run the Mumbai Airport. To accomplish this task, Mumbai International Airport Private Limited (MIAL), a joint venture between the consortium (74%) and the Airports Authority of India (26%) was formed. Since then, MIAL has made several improvements in the aesthetics, design and passenger conveniences at CSMIA including the refurbishment of domestic terminals 1A &amp; 1B, international terminals 2B &amp; 2C, and the opening of a brand new domestic terminal 1C and new Terminal T2. MIAL also undertook airside improvement projects such as the commissioning of new taxiways, and aprons and the reconstruction of the two runways. In February 2008, MIAL entered into an agreement with Air Transport IT specialist SITA that led to CSIA becoming the first airport in India to Implement Common-use self-service Kiosks and CUTE (&quot;Common Use Terminal Equipment&quot;) check-in systems.

In February 2021, the Adani Group, through its subsidiary, Adani Enterprises acquired both GVK and Bidvest&#x27;s stakes in MIAL, giving it a controlling interest of 74% in the venture.

==Structure==
===Runways===
The airport has two intersecting runways and handles an average of 980 flights per day. The runways were upgraded to Code F, which means they can accommodate larger aircraft like the Airbus A380. Following a presentation in March 2011 by UK&#x27;s air traffic service provider NATS on how the capacity of the airport can be increased, MIAL set a target of 48 aircraft movements an hour in an effort to reduce congestion at the airport. Both runways were operated simultaneously especially during peak hours to try and attain this target. MIAL scrapped simultaneous Cross-runway flight operations in mid-2013 after it found that single runway operations were more effective for increasing aircraft movements per hour. Runway 14/32 was henceforth to be used only when the main runway was unavailable due to maintenance or other reasons. The construction of new rapid exit taxiways helped in increasing flight handling capacity from 32 movements per hour to 44 in 2012. NATS delivered and helped MIAL implement a &#x27;change roadmap&#x27; to help CSMIA achieve more than 50 movements per hour in 2015.
The increased air-side efficiencies resulted in CSMIA overtaking Gatwick Airport in March 2017 to become the world&#x27;s busiest airport with only one operational runway at a time.

Runway notes

Once the longest commercial runway in India, Runway 09/27 is the airport&#x27;s main runway. 13 taxiways, including four rapid exit taxiways, connect it to a full-length parallel taxiway to its north. It intersects the secondary runway south of the terminal buildings. The reconstruction of the runway started in September 2010 and was completed in May 2011. The runway width was increased from to with a runway shoulder width of 7.5 m added on each side. The ILS on 27 starts at and is long with a glide slope path of 3°.

Runway 14/32 has ten taxiways including three rapid exit taxiways that connect to a parallel taxiway running along its eastern flank. It runs between Terminals 1 and 2 and was reconstructed in 2010. The runway shoulders were widened from . The associated taxiways of the secondary runway were upgraded in 2019. A new rapid exit taxiway and the conversion of taxiways to Code-F effectively increased the capacity of the runway. In 2020, the secondary runway set a record of 47 movements per hour during peak hour traffic as compared to 36 movements per hour.

Issues with utilising 14/32 are:
* Trombay Hill, lies away from the 32 end, an approach that was temporarily made a No-Fly zone because the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) nuclear complex at Trombay (Anushakti Nagar) lies within its flight path.

MIAL was considering constructing a second parallel runway as part of its master plan. However, the construction of this runway would necessitate a large-scale relocation of either Air India&#x27;s hangars and maintenance facilities or the airport&#x27;s flight kitchens and the Sahar police station, among others, depending on its alignment. The parallel runway remains an active part of the expansion plan but in the meantime the cross runway is being upgraded as much as possible.

===Air traffic control tower===

India&#x27;s second tallest air traffic control tower with a height of after Delhi Airport (101.9 m) stands in a section of the parking area opposite terminal 1B. The triangular three-dimensional structure with soft vertices that won the Hong Kong Building Information Modelling (BIM) Award for the year 2009, has six storeys commencing from . The tower was inaugurated on 18 October 2013 and took over operations on 1 January 2014.

From the new tower, air traffic controllers are able to see beyond the thresholds of both runways. The tower and its associated technical block and mechanical plant building cover a total of . The cost of the fully equipped tower is estimated at 4 billion.

The previous ATC tower, built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at an overall project cost of about ₹2.80 billion, was functional from 1999 to 2013. During that period, many airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Saudia, Qantas and United avoided landing at Mumbai airport when the secondary runway was in use as the ATC tower was too close to the runway and not in compliance with ICAO standards. The tower penetrated runway 14/32&#x27;s transitional obstacle limitation surfaces by over 50 metres (for ILS approaches). The tower also obstructed the path of a parallel taxiway under construction for the secondary runway. MIAL demolished the tower in 2014.

==Terminals==
The airport has two terminals for scheduled commercial passenger services: Terminal 1 at Santacruz for domestic flights and Terminal 2 at Sahar for both international and domestic flights. While both terminals use the same airside facilities, they are physically separated on the city side, requiring a 15–20-minute (landside) drive between them. A dedicated General Aviation Terminal caters to passengers using private and non-scheduled flight operations.

===Currently operational terminals===
====Terminal 1====

Terminal 1, locally known as &quot;Santacruz Airport&quot;, is used for domestic flights primarily operated by low-cost carriers. This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai&#x27;s first passenger terminal which was once integrated, however was renamed Terminal 1 after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal. It was refurbished several times over the decades, the most recent being during the 2000s. It was further divided into Terminal 1A, Terminal 1B, and Terminal 1C after their permanent closure during the course of the late 1990s and early 2000s. It was used by SpiceJet, Go First, and IndiGo, but after Jet Airways dissolved on 17 April 2019, select flights from all the Terminal 1 airlines moved into the newer Terminal 2 building. The terminal has 11 passenger boarding bridges. MIAL renamed Terminal 1B to Terminal 1 in January 2017 to help fliers identify it easily. Citing safety and structural challenges, in March 2024, the Adani Group announced plans to demolish and re-build Terminal 1, a few months after the airport in Navi Mumbai starts operations. The rebuilding project will begin in 2025 and take three years to complete.
The New Terminal 1 will be connected to Terminal 2 through a three-lane underground tunnel to facilitate airside passenger movement between terminals. The tunnel will cost 500 - 600 Crores and will be completed in two phases.

====Terminal 2====


Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) was awarded the contract to construct the new Terminal 2, in order to differentiate it from the Old Terminal 2 Building. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) was the architectural designer of the project. SOM also provided the schematic design of structure and MEP and the detailed structural design of the roof. Detailed design of the foundations and the rest of the structure and civil works, the MEP, IT, and airport systems, including the full construction documentation of the project was carried out by L&amp;T&#x27;s in-house design team, EDRC (Engineering Design and Research Center). The terminal covers a land area of 210,000 square metres and has replaced the Previous International Terminal (which has already been demolished). The entire project was estimated to cost and employ over 12,000 workers.
The X-shaped terminal has a total floor area of 450,000 square metres across four floors and handles both domestic and international passengers. It includes new taxiways and apron areas for aircraft parking designed to cater to 40 million passengers annually. The structure has boarding gates on two piers extending southwards from a central processing building featuring a 42-metre high roof employing over 20,000 metric tonnes of fabricated steel covering 30 acres. However, the eastern pier of Terminal 2 remains truncated due to non-clearance of slums in the adjoining plot, giving an asymmetrical look when seen from above. The new Terminal 2 building operates Multiple Aircraft Ramp System (MARS) stands and swing gates, so that a single stand can accommodate either one wide-body aircraft or two narrow-body aircraft, in either domestic or international configuration. The new terminal is connected by the six-lane Sahar Elevated Access Road to the Western Express Highway. A metro rail link to the terminal is under construction.

The New Terminal has around 21,000 square metres of retail space, lounges and travel services, over 5,000 square metres of landscaping and a multi level car park for 5,000 cars. The parking Management System and Revenue control system for the entire MLCP has been designed and supplied by SKIDATA. It has 192 check-in counters and 60 immigration counters for departing passengers, and 14 baggage carousels and 76 immigration counters for arriving passengers. To transfer passengers across its four levels, the building has 48 escalators and 75 elevators. The terminal also features 42 travelators.
In the initial phase of development, the apron adjoining Terminal 2 provides a total of 48 stands including 3 Code F stands (for the A380). In the final phase of development, a total of 38 Code E/F contact stands, 14 Code E/F remote stands and 20 Code C remote stands are provided (total 72 stands).

The GVK Lounge, the first common luxury lounge at an airport in India, opened in November 2014. The lounge is open to First class and Business class travellers and can accommodate 440 guests at a time. It is spread over 30,000 square feet across two levels of the terminal and has a library, a business centre and fine-dining options, apart from the usual facilities like concierge services, a smoking zone, food and beverage, a bar, a luxury spa, a shower area and a relaxation area. The luxury lounge has won the &#x27;World&#x27;s Leading Airport Lounge – First Class 2015&#x27; award at the World Travel Awards 2015 held in Morocco.

The terminal also houses the Niranta Airport Transit Hotel and the 32-room hotel is the first of its kind in the country. It is located on Level 1 of the terminal and rooms may be booked by passengers who have checked into the airport. IWG plc, operating under the brand &quot;Regus&quot; operates a shared workspace out of the terminal.

The Old International Terminal was closed permanently at 13:00 on 12 February 2014, and international operations from the New Terminal 2 commenced on the same day. The first arrival was Air India flight 343 (an Airbus A330-200) from Singapore via Chennai, and the first departure was Jet Airways flight 118 (a Boeing 777-300ER) to London. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh. The domestic operations at Terminal 2 were launched on 9 January 2015, with the inaugural flight of Vistara arriving from New Delhi. Vistara initially operated from Level 4 of the Terminal, which is being used only by international passengers, but in July 2015, they shifted to Level 3, which will be used only for domestic operations. Air India shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal 1A to Terminal 2 on 1 October 2015 making it the second airline to operate domestic flights from the Terminal 2, to ease their International and Domestic passenger transfers, and Jet Airways shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 on 15 March 2016, facilitating a seamless transfer experience for its passengers, whereas all other domestic airlines, namely Indigo, Go First, and SpiceJet, took place, both Departure and Arrival, at Terminal 1.

After the demise of Jet Airways on 17 April 2019, other carriers launched additional domestic flights using slots vacated by Jet Airways. These flights were operated from Terminal 2. This arrangement resulted in some of the larger carriers having to operate domestic flights from both terminals. Hence, MIAL moved to streamline operations at both terminals in September 2019, shifting all of its domestic operations of Indigo, AirAsia India and Go First back to Terminal 1, while SpiceJet shifted all of its domestic operations from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2.

Until 2000-01, the security of the airport was under Maharashtra Police/Mumbai Police. However, following the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 on 24 December 1999 and September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, airport security was handed to the Airport Sector division of the Central Industrial Security Force in July 2002.

The airport has free Wi-Fi connectivity provided by Tata Docomo across both Terminal 1 and 2. However, the service has been criticized for being ineffective and complicated access for international passengers, as the passengers need to get an OTP through an Indian phone number only, while the free service lasts for just 45 minutes, following which passengers have to buy data packs. The phone number requirement has been attributed to the requirements of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for safety considerations. Following frequent criticism, Wi-Fi kiosks were installed for passengers who do not have a local phone number, which can scan boarding passes.

;Car parking and passenger arrivals
All vehicles arriving at Terminal 2 to pick up arriving passengers are routed via the multi-level car park and are charged a fee to counter traffic congestion at the airport. Four-wheelers are charged a minimum fee of for 30 minutes in general parking and two-wheelers for 240 minutes.

====General Aviation Terminal====
The airport&#x27;s General Aviation (GA) Terminal for private and non-scheduled flight operators (NSOPs) is located at Kalina on the southwest side of the airfield. The terminal was approved for international operations in April 2011, making CSMIA the first airport in India to have a self-contained terminal for handling round the clock domestic and international flight operations for private and NSOPs. The terminal offers facilities for passengers departing and arriving on private aircraft and business jets. The terminal has two exclusive lounges, two conference halls, two crew restrooms and a café bar.
It has parking for 24 general aviation aircraft. Once the new airport at Navi Mumbai is opened, most of the business jets, turboprops and charter aircraft parked at CSMIA will be moved to the general aviation bays and hangars of NMIA by the end of 2025. CSMIA will continue to be accessible to charter and private aircraft flyers as general aviation movement is not being banned. However, visiting GA aircraft will take off for some other airport after dropping off its passengers.

===Previous terminals===
====Terminal 1 (divided into 1A, 1B, and 1C)====
When the Sahar terminal was opened in the 1980s, the terminal at Santacruz reverted to being a domestic terminal. The terminal consisted of three structures, Terminals 1A, 1B, and 1C.

* Terminal 1A - It was opened in April 1992, and was used solely by Indian Airlines (now Air India). In 2005, Kingfisher Airlines also began operating from 1A, after it entered into an agreement to source all ground handling and terminal space from Indian Airlines. In June 2013, shortly after Kingfisher ceased operations, MIAL allocated the vacant space to GoAir. From 1 October 2015, Air India moved all of its Terminal 1A operations to the new Terminal 2. GoAir moved its departure operations to Terminal 1B on that same date, resulting in the closure of the Terminal 1A departures level. GoAir, however, continued to use Terminal 1A&#x27;s arrivals level until 15 March 2016 when its arrivals were also shifted to Terminal 1B and Terminal 1A was shut.
* Terminal 1B - It was opened in 1942, and This was the original Santacruz building that was Mumbai&#x27;s first passenger terminal which was once integrated, however was renamed Terminal 1 after the opening of the Sahar building for international operations and became a domestic operations terminal.
* Terminal 1C - It was built at a cost of 3 billion and opened in April 2010. Architectural design was provided by Hafeez Contractor. EDRC, the in-house design unit of the EPC contractor Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) performed the Structural, MEP and IT/Airport systems design. The terminal had six passenger boarding bridges and allowed connectivity between Terminals 1A and 1B. It was spread over 297,194 sq ft across three levels and had a seating capacity of about 900 passengers. Level 1 housed the offices of MIAL and some airlines, Level 2 comprised the security-hold area for passengers after checking in at either Terminal 1A or 1B. Level 3 accommodated a food court. The building served as a boarding-only facility for all airlines. Passengers entered this facility via Terminal 1B.

In January 2017, MIAL renamed the Terminal 1B as T1.

====Terminal 2 (divided into 2A, 2B, and 2C)====

Terminal 2 of the airport is located at Sahar Village, in Vile Parle East. Designed by &quot;Aéroports de Paris&quot; and opened in January 1981, Terminal 2 was built in three modular phases as Terminals 2A, 2B, and 2C. Each module had a capacity of 2.5 million annual passengers. This terminal had an area of .
The terminal structure was laid out in a space-saving vertical arrangement with separate levels for arrivals and departures. An overpass on the city-side took passengers to the upper-level departure forecourt.

The original terminal was a convex shaped single concourse building with 14 Code E contact stands. The greater T2 apron also provided a further 15 Code D/E and 6 Code C remote stands. This gave a total of 35 stands on the existing apron.
The departures section of 2A had 42 check-in counters, 18 more than in the international section at the Santacruz terminal. After completing customs and immigration formalities, the departing travellers were led down to a mezzanine floor where five elongated nodules connect the terminal with the aircraft via aerobridges.

* Terminal 2A - This first phase of the terminal complex was completed at a cost of and it served most international carriers. Its boarding gates 3 to 8 were the first aerobridges installed in the subcontinent. It was decommissioned and demolished in January 2009 to make way for the new T2 structure.
* Terminal 2B - It cost and was completed in 1984. It served Air India and carriers handled by Air India between September 1986 and October 1999 and was decommissioned when Terminal 2C opened. It was extensively refurbished and made operational once again following the demolition of Terminal 2A.
* Terminal 2C - Inaugurated in October 1999, it was originally and exclusively for Air India, Air India Express and those carriers whose ground operations were handled by Air India.

Terminals 2B and 2C were decommissioned in February 2014 when the new T2 took over operations. They were demolished later that year so that the remainder of the new T2 could be completed.

===Cargo Complex===
The Air Cargo Complex, located west of the International Passenger Terminal 2, has been in operation since 1977. The cargo apron is capable of handling five wide-bodied aircraft. In 2009–10, the airport handled 385,937 metric tonnes of International Cargo and 165,252 metric tonnes of Domestic Cargo. Air India (AI) and Mumbai International Airport Pvt Ltd (MIAL) have been appointed as custodians of cargo by the Central Board of Excise and Customs at Mumbai. The Cargo Terminal has a Centre for Perishable Cargo (CPC) with an area of 1844 m2 for perishable and temperature-sensitive international export shipments, strong rooms of 115 m2 for storage of valuable cargo and storage areas for dangerous goods in both import and export warehouses, dedicated &quot;Unaccompanied Baggage&quot; handling and clearance areas and 9 coloured X-ray cargo screening machines for export cargo.

Apart from handling 65% of the international volumes at CSIA, MIAL also operates a Common User Domestic Cargo Facility. After taking over the redevelopment work of the airport in 2006, MIAL commissioned an offshore Common User Terminal (CUT) near the Marol pipeline as a temporary arrangement. In June 2016, MIAL opened a new domestic cargo CUT near the Western Express Highway in Vile Parle.

The CUT has been outsourced to Concor Air Ltd. on a Build-operate-transfer basis. The terminal has the capacity to handle 300,000 metric tonnes of cargo annually and is built on an area of 60,000 square feet. The Cargo Terminal is an &quot;elevated terminal structure&quot; where all arriving domestic cargo is managed from the basement level while departing cargo is handled at the upper level. Air India and Blue Dart handle their own domestic cargo operations at their own terminals.
Blue Dart opened its dedicated cargo facility at Mumbai Airport near Terminal 1 on 7 February 2019. The facility measures 4,300 square meters and has air-side and city-side access, allowing for faster transfer of shipments.

==Statistics==
==Connectivity==
 Vile Parle is a railway station on the Western line and Harbour line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network closest to both T1 and T2 of the airport.
 Line 3 (Mumbai Metro) has stations at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.
 Airport Road and Marol Naka are the stations on Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro system closest to Terminal T2.
 Western Express Highway (WEH) is the station on Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro system closest to Terminal T1.

The Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) operates air-conditioned buses to the Airport from Thane, Navi Mumbai, Borivali, South Mumbai and Andheri railway station which can be booked on the Chalo App. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) runs bus services to the Airport from various nodes of Navi Mumbai.

=== Airport metro stations===

Line 3 of the Mumbai Metro serves CSMIA via three stations – one each at the Santacruz and Sahar terminals and one in the GVK SkyCity.
The stations, part of the 12.5 kilometre Phase 1 route that runs between Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Aarey JVLR, were opened to the public on 7 October 2024.
When both phases are completed, the line will run underground from Cuffe Parade to SEEPZ and will reduce the commute time between Colaba and the airport to 40 minutes.

In early 2012, the MMRDA held talks with MIAL to either construct or finance the construction of three of the line&#x27;s stations. MIAL agreed to bear the cost of constructing the three stations, expected to total 777 crore, because of the potential increase in passenger convenience. However, CSIA placed conditions before MMRDA for the corridor;

* The metro line should operate twenty-four hours a day in order to serve passengers of international flights scheduled at odd hours.
* A provision be made for a check-in facility at all metro stations.

MIAL specified that the commercial rights of the three stations it constructs will fully rest with the authority, and that revenue earned from any commercial activity on the premises would go to MIAL. It would undertake the design and civil construction of the stations, costing 600 crore, on its own, and would pay the estimated cost of electromechanical equipment (around 177 crore) to MMRDA in three equal instalments over three years.
MIAL inserted a &#x27;metro component&#x27; in the User Development Fee charged at Mumbai Airport from 2016 to February 2023 to raise Rs 518 crore for metro connectivity. The charges of Rs 20 and Rs 120 per domestic and international departure respectively were levied until the target sum was raised.

===Upcoming airport metro stations===
Line 7A is an extension of the long &#x27;Red Line&#x27; that will connect to T2.
The line will have an underground station at CSMIA.
Civil work on this line began in early 2020. Tunnelling work is expected to be completed by December 2024.

The MMRDA has also planned Line 8 between CSMIA and the under-construction Navi Mumbai International Airport.

==Awards==
Along with Delhi Airport, the airport was adjudged the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Airport&quot; at Airport Service Quality Awards 2017 in the highest category of airports handling more than 40 million passengers annually by Airports Council International. It has also won the &quot;Best Airport in India and Central Asia&quot; award at the Skytrax 2016 World Airport Awards. It is one of the three airports in India to have implemented Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) to ensure timely takeoffs and landings. The airport was awarded as the &quot;Best Airport In the Asia-Pacific&quot; in 2020 (over 40 million passengers per annum) by Airports Council International. In March 2023, the airport was named again as the &quot;Best Airport in the Asia-Pacific&quot; in the category of over 40 million passengers per annum by Airports Council International. In July 2023, the airport was ranked fourth on the list of top 10 favourite airports in the world by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;.

==Accidents and incidents==
===1940s===
* On 12 July 1949, &quot; Franeker&quot;, a Lockheed L-749-79-33 Constellation (registered PH-TDF) crashed into hills between Ghatkopar and Powai killing 33 passengers and 11 crew members. The victims included a large number of American journalists including Pulitzer Prize winner Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker. The crash was a result of a pilot error.

===1950s===
* On 19 July 1959, &quot;Rani of Aera&quot;, a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation (registered VT-DIN) carrying 46 people (39 passengers and seven crew) approached Santacruz Airport in conditions of poor visibility due to rain. The captain was using an altimeter with the barometric pressure set at 29.92&quot;. The aircraft crashed and suffered damage beyond repair. There were no fatalities.

===1960s===
* On 16 March 1963, a ČSA Tupolev Tu-104A (registration OK-LDB) caught fire and burned out while being refuelled at Santa Cruz Airport, India; no casualties except for a flight attendant who was injured after jumping from the plane.
* On 28 July 1963, United Arab Airlines Flight 869 bound from Tokyo to Cairo, with a partial stop in Bombay, crashed into the Arabian Sea before approaching Santacruz Airport. All 63 people on board (55 passengers and eight crew members) died, including 24 passengers from the Philippines who were due to travel to Greece to attend the 11th World Scout Jamboree.
* On 28 May 1968, Garuda Indonesian Airways Flight 892, a Convair 990A bound for Amsterdam but was on its next flight segment from Bombay to Karachi, crashed minutes after takeoff from Santacruz Airport.

===1970s===
* On 12 June 1975, Air France Flight 193, a Boeing 747-128 (N28888) operating the sector between Bombay (now Mumbai), and Tel Aviv to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport was destroyed by fire on the ground at Bombay&#x27;s Santa Cruz Airport, following an aborted takeoff. The aircraft&#x27;s tire on its right-hand main undercarriage had failed while the flight deck crew was executing a 180 degree turn at the beginning of Santa Cruz Airport&#x27;s runway 27. When the flight deck crew began its takeoff run, another tire failed. At that point the plane&#x27;s wheels and braking assembly came into contact with the runway, starting a fire. The crew aborted takeoff. The ensuing delay in shutting down the engines, as well as the improper deployment of the airport&#x27;s fire service, caused the fire to spread, leading to the plane&#x27;s total destruction. There were no fatalities among the 394 occupants (18 crew and 376 passengers).
* On 12 October 1976, Indian Airlines Flight 171, a Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle had its right engine catch fire shortly after takeoff. The crew attempted to return, but the plane crashed approximately 1000 feet short of Runway 09. All six crew members and their 89 passengers were killed.
* On 1 January 1978, Air India Flight 855 a Boeing 747-237B crashed into the Arabian Sea after takeoff from Bombay, killing all on board (213 occupants; 190 passengers, 23 crew). The cause of the crash was crew disorientation while dealing with a malfunctioning AI in the dark as the flight took off during the night time.
* On 4 August 1979, an Indian Airlines Hawker Siddeley HS 748 aircraft was approaching Sahar International Airport (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport) at night and in poor weather when it flew into high terrain approximately from the airport, killing the four crew and their 41 passengers.
* On 21 September 1979, a big fire erupted at the International Terminal; three passengers died in the aftermath. Authorities battled the blaze for many hours.

===1980s===
* On 21 June 1982, Air India Flight 403, a Boeing 707–420 (Reg: VT-DJJ) carrying 99 passengers and 12 crew from Kuala Lumpur to Bombay via Madras crashed while landing at Sahar International Airport during a rainstorm. The fuselage broke apart and 17 people including two crew members were killed. The cause of the crash was flight crew error, as the plane undershot the runway while landing. 

===1990s===
* On 12 March 1993, during a series of bombings in Bombay, grenades were thrown at the terminal of the airport. There were no deaths. In addition, explosions went off in the Airport Hotel next to the airport.

=== 2000s ===
* On 26 July 2005, the airport operations were shut down for more than 30 hours due to heavy flooding of the runways, submerged Instrument Landing System equipment and extremely poor visibility. Over 700 flights were cancelled or delayed. The airports reopened on the morning of 28 July 2005. Within 24 hours of the airports becoming operational, there were 185 departures and 184 arrivals, including international flights. Again from the early morning of 31 July, with an increase in waterlogging of the runways and different parts of Mumbai, most of the flights were indefinitely cancelled.
* On 30 July 2005, at 6:55 AM local time, Air India Flight 127, a Boeing 747-400 (registered VT-EVJ), flying on the route Bangalore-Mumbai-Frankfurt-Chicago, skidded on landing at Mumbai on runway 14/32 due to hydroplaning, and damaged the nose wheel landing gear after hitting a few runway lights. While there were no injuries among the 335 passengers and crew, the immobilized plane sustained serious damage and was taken out of service to be repaired in a hangar. An alternative Boeing 747-400 was made available to continue the flight, which took off after a delay of four hours. The incident took place four days after the airport was closed due to flooding in the city, and two days after reopening.
* On 16 May 2008, a Boeing 777-200 (registered as VT-AIK) operating as Air India flight 717 to Dubai collapsed at Mumbai, after the nose landing gear failed. The incident took place before the passengers were about to board. There were no fatalities or injuries, however, the plane suffered serious damage and was off service for repairs, while an alternative aircraft was arranged for the flight.
* Between 26 and 29 November 2008, several airlines, including Delta, Continental (now United), Lufthansa, and many others temporarily cancelled their flights due to passenger and crew safety caused by the terrorist attacks in Mumbai led by 10 Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists. The airlines resumed operations once the attacks ended after the last terrorist was neutralised by security forces.
* On 4 September 2009, Air India Flight 829 a Boeing 747–437 (registered VT-ESM), flying from Mumbai to Riyadh caught fire at the Airport. The fire started in the number one engine while the aircraft was taxiing to Runway 27 for take-off. An emergency evacuation was carried out with no injuries among the 229 people (213 passengers and 16 crew) on board. While the fire damage was substantial, the Boeing 747-400 was declared a total loss and thus written off. The plane was scrapped in May 2011 for parts.

=== 2010s ===
* On 28 May 2012, Air India Flight 112, a Boeing 777-200LR (registered VT-ALH), suffered damage to the nose radar dome and left engine cowling on landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai following a flight from London Heathrow. The cause of the damage could not be determined, but the aircraft was withdrawn from service to be repaired. The Boeing 777 returned to service in January 2015 after repairs and test flights were completed.
* On 30 January 2014, Air India Flight 116, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner(registered VT-ANE) flying from Mumbai to Delhi with 236 occupants, had a near-miss on take-off with a Sesa Goa Partenavia P68C aircraft (registered VT-TLE) that took from runway 26 of Juhu Aerodrome. The incident was caused by an ATC instruction error. 
* On 2 February 2014, Air India Flight 191, a Boeing 777-300ER (registered VT-ALQ), flying from Newark, blew three tires after touching down on runway 27. There were no injuries among the 260 passengers and crew, and the place was able to taxi to the gate with assistance.
* On 20 February 2014, United Airlines Flight 48, a Boeing 777-200ER, flying from Newark, was grounded upon landing after engineers discovered that the right engine cover was badly damaged.
* On 17 December 2015, an Air India technician was killed in a freak accident after being sucked into the engine of an Airbus A320 during pushback. The aircraft, Air India Flight 619 was bound for Hyderabad. Although there were no casualties aboard the aircraft, The technician died after the co-pilot mistook a signal and started the engine.

=== 2020s ===
* On 6 May 2021, a Jet Serve Aviation (registration VT-JIL) air ambulance flight carrying two crew, a doctor, a COVID-19 patient, and one of the patient&#x27;s relatives performed a belly landing after losing a wheel earlier in the flight while departing from a refuelling stop in Nagpur. Airport firefighters sprayed foam onto the runway to prevent fire, and there were no injuries.
* On 14 September 2023, a VSR Aviation (Reg: VT-DBL) Learjet 45 carrying two crew and eight passengers, arriving from Visakhapatnam, crash-landed at the airport due to heavy rain and thunderstorm. This impacted the airport&#x27;s busy flight schedule delaying and diverting more than 40 flights to and from the city.
* On 20 May 2024, Emirates Flight 508, a Boeing 777-300ER (registered as A6-ENT), suffered a bird strike before landing at Mumbai. While there were no injuries among passengers and crew, the plane suffered substantial damage and at least 36 flamingos were killed in the strike while the plane was flying over Ghatkopar suburban region of Mumbai. An alternative aircraft was arranged for the return flight, while the damaged plane was later repaired and put back into service.

<text>A number line is a graphical representation of a straight line that serves as spatial representation of numbers, usually graduated like a ruler with a particular origin point representing the number zero and evenly spaced marks in either direction representing integers, imagined to extend infinitely. The association between numbers and points on the line links arithmetical operations on numbers to geometric relations between points, and provides a conceptual framework for learning mathematics.

In elementary mathematics, the number line is initially used to teach addition and subtraction of integers, especially involving negative numbers. As students progress, more kinds of numbers can be placed on the line, including fractions, decimal fractions, square roots, and transcendental numbers such as the circle constant: Every point of the number line corresponds to a unique real number, and every real number to a unique point.

Using a number line, numerical concepts can be interpreted geometrically and geometric concepts interpreted numerically. An inequality between numbers corresponds to a left-or-right order relation between points. Numerical intervals are associated to geometrical segments of the line. Operations and functions on numbers correspond to geometric transformations of the line. Wrapping the line into a circle relates modular arithmetic to the geometric composition of angles. Marking the line with logarithmically spaced graduations associates multiplication and division with geometric translations, the principle underlying the slide rule. In analytic geometry, coordinate axes are number lines which associate points in a geometric space with tuples of numbers, so geometric shapes can be described using numerical equations and numerical functions can be graphed.

In advanced mathematics, the number line is usually called the real line or real number line, and is a geometric line isomorphic to the set of real numbers, with which it is often conflated; both the real numbers and the real line are commonly denoted or . The real line is a one-dimensional real coordinate space, so is sometimes denoted when comparing it to higher-dimensional spaces. The real line is a one-dimensional Euclidean space using the difference between numbers to define the distance between points on the line. It can also be thought of as a vector space, a metric space, a topological space, a measure space, or a linear continuum. The real line can be embedded in the complex plane, used as a two-dimensional geometric representation of the complex numbers.

==History==
The first mention of the number line used for operation purposes is found in John Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of Algebra&quot; (1685). In his treatise, Wallis describes addition and subtraction on a number line in terms of moving forward and backward, under the metaphor of a person walking.

An earlier depiction without mention to operations, though, is found in John Napier&#x27;s &quot;A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes&quot; (1616), which shows values 1 through 12 lined up from left to right.

Contrary to popular belief, René Descartes&#x27;s original does not feature a number line, defined as we use it today, though it does use a coordinate system. In particular, Descartes&#x27;s work does not contain specific numbers mapped onto lines, only abstract quantities.

==Drawing the number line==
A number line is usually represented as being horizontal, but in a Cartesian coordinate plane the vertical axis (y-axis) is also a number line. The arrow on the line indicates the positive direction in which numbers increase. Some textbooks attach an arrow to both sides, suggesting that the arrow indicates continuation. This is unnecessary, since according to the rules of geometry a line without endpoints continues indefinitely in the positive and negative directions. A line with one endpoint as a &quot;ray&quot;, and a line with two endpoints as a &quot;line segment&quot;.

==Comparing numbers==
If a particular number is farther to the right on the number line than is another number, then the first number is greater than the second (equivalently, the second is less than the first). The distance between them is the magnitude of their difference—that is, it measures the first number minus the second one, or equivalently the absolute value of the second number minus the first one. Taking this difference is the process of subtraction.

Thus, for example, the length of a line segment between 0 and some other number represents the magnitude of the latter number.

Two numbers can be added by &quot;picking up&quot; the length from 0 to one of the numbers, and putting it down again with the end that was 0 placed on top of the other number.

Two numbers can be multiplied as in this example: To multiply 5 × 3, note that this is the same as 5 + 5 + 5, so pick up the length from 0 to 5 and place it to the right of 5, and then pick up that length again and place it to the right of the previous result. This gives a result that is 3 combined lengths of 5 each; since the process ends at 15, we find that 5 × 3 = 15.

Division can be performed as in the following example: To divide 6 by 2—that is, to find out how many times 2 goes into 6—note that the length from 0 to 2 lies at the beginning of the length from 0 to 6; pick up the former length and put it down again to the right of its original position, with the end formerly at 0 now placed at 2, and then move the length to the right of its latest position again. This puts the right end of the length 2 at the right end of the length from 0 to 6. Since three lengths of 2 filled the length 6, 2 goes into 6 three times (that is, 6 ÷ 2 = 3).

==Portions of the number line==

The section of the number line between two numbers is called an interval. If the section includes both numbers it is said to be a closed interval, while if it excludes both numbers it is called an open interval. If it includes one of the numbers but not the other one, it is called a half-open interval.

All the points extending forever in one direction from a particular point are together known as a ray. If the ray includes the particular point, it is a closed ray; otherwise it is an open ray.

==Extensions of the concept==
===Logarithmic scale===

On the number line, the distance between two points is the unit length if and only if the difference of the represented numbers equals 1. Other choices are possible. 

One of the most common choices is the &quot;logarithmic scale&quot;, which is a representation of the &quot;positive&quot; numbers on a line, such that the distance of two points is the unit length, if the ratio of the represented numbers has a fixed value, typically 10. In such a logarithmic scale, the origin represents 1; one inch to the right, one has 10, one inch to the right of 10 one has , then , then , etc. Similarly, one inch to the left of 1, one has , then , etc.

This approach is useful, when one wants to represent, on the same figure, values with very different order of magnitude. For example, one requires a logarithmic scale for representing simultaneously the size of the different bodies that exist in the Universe, typically, a photon, an electron, an atom, a molecule, a human, the Earth, the Solar System, a galaxy, and the visible Universe.

Logarithmic scales are used in slide rules for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on logarithmic scales.
===Combining number lines===
A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the imaginary numbers. This line, called imaginary line, extends the number line to a complex number plane, with points representing complex numbers.

Alternatively, one real number line can be drawn horizontally to denote possible values of one real number, commonly called &quot;x&quot;, and another real number line can be drawn vertically to denote possible values of another real number, commonly called &quot;y&quot;. Together these lines form what is known as a Cartesian coordinate system, and any point in the plane represents the value of a pair of real numbers. Further, the Cartesian coordinate system can itself be extended by visualizing a third number line &quot;coming out of the screen (or page)&quot;, measuring a third variable called &quot;z&quot;. Positive numbers are closer to the viewer&#x27;s eyes than the screen is, while negative numbers are &quot;behind the screen&quot;; larger numbers are farther from the screen. Then any point in the three-dimensional space that we live in represents the values of a trio of real numbers.

==Advanced concepts==

===As a linear continuum===

The real line is a linear continuum under the standard ordering. Specifically, the real line is linearly ordered by , and this ordering is dense and has the least-upper-bound property.

In addition to the above properties, the real line has no maximum or minimum element. It also has a countable dense subset, namely the set of rational numbers. It is a theorem that any linear continuum with a countable dense subset and no maximum or minimum element is order-isomorphic to the real line.

The real line also satisfies the countable chain condition: every collection of mutually disjoint, nonempty open intervals in is countable. In order theory, the famous Suslin problem asks whether every linear continuum satisfying the countable chain condition that has no maximum or minimum element is necessarily order-isomorphic to . This statement has been shown to be independent of the standard axiomatic system of set theory known as ZFC.

===As a metric space===

The real line forms a metric space, with the distance function given by absolute difference:
: formula_1
The metric tensor is clearly the 1-dimensional Euclidean metric. Since the -dimensional Euclidean metric can be represented in matrix form as the -by- identity matrix, the metric on the real line is simply the 1-by-1 identity matrix, i.e. 1.

If and , then the -ball in centered at is simply the open interval .

This real line has several important properties as a metric space:
* The real line is a complete metric space, in the sense that any Cauchy sequence of points converges.
* The real line is path-connected and is one of the simplest examples of a geodesic metric space.
* The Hausdorff dimension of the real line is equal to one.

===As a topological space===
The real line carries a standard topology, which can be introduced in two different, equivalent ways. First, since the real numbers are totally ordered, they carry an order topology. Second, the real numbers inherit a metric topology from the metric defined above. The order topology and metric topology on are the same. As a topological space, the real line is homeomorphic to the open interval .

The real line is trivially a topological manifold of dimension . Up to homeomorphism, it is one of only two different connected 1-manifolds without boundary, the other being the circle. It also has a standard differentiable structure on it, making it a differentiable manifold. (Up to diffeomorphism, there is only one differentiable structure that the topological space supports.)

The real line is a locally compact space and a paracompact space, as well as second-countable and normal. It is also path-connected, and is therefore connected as well, though it can be disconnected by removing any one point. The real line is also contractible, and as such all of its homotopy groups and reduced homology groups are zero.

As a locally compact space, the real line can be compactified in several different ways. The one-point compactification of is a circle (namely, the real projective line), and the extra point can be thought of as an unsigned infinity. Alternatively, the real line has two ends, and the resulting end compactification is the extended real line . There is also the Stone–Čech compactification of the real line, which involves adding an infinite number of additional points.

In some contexts, it is helpful to place other topologies on the set of real numbers, such as the lower limit topology or the Zariski topology. For the real numbers, the latter is the same as the finite complement topology.

===As a vector space===
The real line is a vector space over the field of real numbers (that is, over itself) of dimension . It has the usual multiplication as an inner product, making it a Euclidean vector space. The norm defined by this inner product is simply the absolute value.

===As a measure space===
The real line carries a canonical measure, namely the Lebesgue measure. This measure can be defined as the completion of a Borel measure defined on , where the measure of any interval is the length of the interval.

Lebesgue measure on the real line is one of the simplest examples of a Haar measure on a locally compact group.

===In real algebras===
When &quot;A&quot; is a unital real algebra, the products of real numbers with 1 is a real line within the algebra. For example, in the complex plane &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + i&quot;y&quot;, the subspace {&quot;z&quot; : &quot;y&quot; = 0} is a real line. Similarly, the algebra of quaternions
:&quot;q&quot; = &quot;w&quot; + &quot;x&quot; i + &quot;y&quot; j + &quot;z&quot; k 
has a real line in the subspace {&quot;q&quot; : &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; = 0 }.

When the real algebra is a direct sum formula_2 then a conjugation on &quot;A&quot; is introduced by the mapping formula_3 of subspace &quot;V&quot;. In this way the real line consists of the fixed points of the conjugation.

For a dimension &quot;n&quot;, the square matrices form a ring that has a real line in the form of real products with the identity matrix in the ring.

<text>Guillaume Dubois (; 6 September 1656 – 10 August 1723) was a French cardinal and statesman.

==Life and government==

===Early years===
Dubois, the third of the four great Cardinal-Ministers (Richelieu, Mazarin, Dubois, and Fleury), was born in Brive-la-Gaillarde, in Limousin. He was, according to his enemies, the son of an apothecary, his father being in fact a doctor of medicine of a respectable family, who kept a small drug store as part of the necessary outfit of a country practitioner. He was educated at the school of the Brothers of the Christian Doctrine at Brive, where he received the tonsure at the age of thirteen. In 1672, having finished his philosophy course, he was given a scholarship at the college of St. Michel in Paris by the lieutenant-general of the Limousin. The head of the college, the abbé Antoine Faure, who was from the same part of the country as himself, befriended the lad, and continued to do so for many years after he had finished his course, finding him pupils and ultimately obtaining for him the post of tutor to the young duke of Chartres, afterwards the regent Duke of Orléans.

===Career===
Dubois gained the favour of Louis XIV by bringing about the marriage of his pupil with Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, Mlle de Blois, a natural but legitimized daughter of the king and Mme de Montespan; and for this service he was rewarded with the gift of the abbey of St. Just in Picardy. He was present with his pupil at the Battle of Steenkerque, and &quot;faced fire,&quot; says Marshal Luxembourg, &quot;like a grenadier.&quot; Sent to join the French embassy in London, he made himself so active that he was recalled by the request of the ambassador, who feared his intrigues. This, however, tended to raise his credit with the king. When the Duc D&#x27;Orléans became regent (1715) Dubois, who had for some years acted as his secretary, was made councillor of state, and the chief power passed gradually into his hands.

Dubois&#x27; policy was steadily directed towards maintaining the peace of Utrecht, and this made him the main opponent of the schemes of Cardinal Alberoni for the aggrandizement of Spain. To counteract Alberoni&#x27;s intrigues, he suggested an alliance with Britain and in the face of great difficulties succeeded in negotiating the Triple Alliance (1717). In 1719 he sent armies into Spain as part of the Quadruple Alliance which forced Philip V to dismiss Alberoni. Otherwise, his policy remained that of peace. Dubois&#x27; success strengthened him against the bitter opposition of a large section of the court. Dubois was instrumental during the Cellamare conspiracy of 1718.

He prayed the regent to give him the archbishopric of Cambrai, the richest in France. This demand was supported by George I and the regent yielded. Dubois aimed for the Cardinal&#x27;s hat because such an ecclesiastical title would give him the utmost prominence and precedence in the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en haut&quot;, giving him the ability to remove his political adversaries with impunity. The regent was initially reluctant: though not himself a religious man, he could hardly regard Dubois as a suitable archbishop, at a time when the ambitious Claudine Guérin de Tencin was universally believed to be his mistress. The regent called Dubois &quot;the most rascally, atheistic, and worst priest there has ever been.&quot; He was so irreligious that it was reputed he could barely recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer when he took holy orders to assume the archbishopric of Cambrai.

In one day all the usual orders were conferred upon him, and even the great preacher Massillon consented to take part in the ceremonies. His next aim was the cardinalate, and, after long and most profitable negotiations on the part of Pope Clement XI, the red hat was given to him by Innocent XIII (1721), whose election was largely due to the bribes of Dubois. It is estimated that this cardinalate cost France about eight million francs. In the following year he was named first minister of France (August). He was soon after received at the , and he was named President of the Assembly of Clergy.

When Louis XV attained his majority in 1723 Dubois remained chief minister. He had accumulated an immense private fortune (though nothing compared to the avaricious acquisition of wealth of Concini, Richelieu, Mazarin, Fouquet, and Colbert) possessing in addition to his see the revenues of seven abbeys. He was, however, a prey to the most terrible pains of body and agony of mind. His health was ruined by his debaucheries, and a surgical operation became necessary. This was almost immediately followed by his death, at Versailles, on 10 August 1723.

Dubois&#x27; portrait was thus drawn by his long-time rival, the Duc de St Simon (who kept a painting of him in his lavatory),

He was a little, pitiful, wizened, herringgutted man, in a flaxen wig, with a weasel&#x27;s face, brightened by some intellect. All the vices - perfidy, avarice, debauchery, ambition, flattery - fought within him for the mastery. He was so consummate a liar that, when taken in the fact, he could brazenly deny it. Even his wit and knowledge of the world were spoiled, and his affected gaiety was touched with sadness, by the odour of falsehood which escaped through every pore of his body.

This famous picture is certainly biased. Dubois was unscrupulous, but so were his contemporaries, and whatever vices he had, he forged a European peace that, with the exception of small, restrained military expeditions against the Austrian Habsburgs, would last for a quarter of a century.

In 1789 appeared &quot;Vie privée du Cardinal Dubois&quot;, attributed to one of his secretaries, Mongez; and in 1815 his &quot;&quot;, edited by L de Sevelinges. See also A Chéruel, &quot;Saint-Simon et l&#x27;abbé Dubois&quot;; L Wiesener, &quot;Le Régent, l&#x27;abbé Dubois et les Anglais&quot; (1891); and memoirs of the time.

He is played by Jean Rochefort in the movie by Bertrand Tavernier, &quot;Que la fête commence...&quot;

<text>A helipad is the landing area of a heliport, in use by helicopters, powered lift, and vertical lift aircraft to land on surface. 

While helicopters and powered lift aircraft are able to operate on a variety of relatively flat surfaces, a fabricated helipad provides a clearly marked hard surface away from obstacles where such aircraft can land safely. 

Larger helipads, intended for use by helicopters and other vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, may be called &quot;vertiports.&quot; An example is Vertiport Chicago, which opened in 2015.

==Usage==

Helipads may be located at a heliport or airport where fuel, air traffic control and service facilities for aircraft are available. 

Most helipads are located away from populated areas due to sounds, winds, space and cost constraints. Some skyscrapers have one on their roofs to accommodate air taxi services. Some basic helipads are built on top of highrise buildings for evacuation in case of a major fire outbreak. Major police departments may use a dedicated helipad at heliports as a base for police helicopters. 

Large ships and oil platforms usually have a helipad on board for emergency use. In such a case, the terms &quot;helicopter deck&quot;, &quot;helideck&quot;, or &quot;helodeck&quot; are used.

Helipads are common features at hospitals where they serve to facilitate medical evacuation or air ambulance transfers of patients to trauma centers or to accept patients from remote areas without local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency medicine required. In urban environments, these heliports are sometimes located on the roof of the hospital.

Rooftop helipads sometimes display a large two-digit number, representing the weight limit (in thousands of pounds) of the pad. A second number may be present, representing the maximum rotor diameter in feet.

Location identifiers are often, but not always, issued for helipads. They may be issued by the appropriate aviation authority. Authorized agencies include the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, Transport Canada in Canada, the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the International Air Transport Association. Some helipads may have location identifiers from multiple sources, and these identifiers may be of different format and name.

==Construction==
Helipads are usually constructed out of concrete and are marked with a circle and/or a letter &quot;H&quot;, so as to be visible from the air. Sometimes wildfire fighters will construct a temporary one from timber to receive supplies in remote areas. Rig mats may be used to build helipads. Landing pads may also be constructed in extreme conditions such as on ice.

The world&#x27;s highest helipad, built by India, is located on the Siachen Glacier at a height of 21,000 feet (6400 m) above sea level.

==Portability==
A portable helipad is a helipad structure with a rugged frame that can be used to land helicopters in any areas with slopes of up to 30 degrees, such as hillsides, riverbeds and boggy areas. Portable helipads can be transported by helicopter or powered-lift to place them where a VTOL needs to land, as long as there are no insurmountable obstructions nearby.

<text>Jacksonville International Airport is a civil-military public airport 13 miles (21 km) north of Downtown Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida. It is owned and operated by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority.

==History==

Construction started in 1965 on a new airport to handle travel to nearby naval bases. The new airport was dedicated on September 1, 1968, replacing Imeson Field which carried the same IATA code of JAX. Terrain precluded lengthening the runways at Imeson, a necessity with the inception of commercial jet airliners. A new idea at JIA was separating departing and arriving passengers on different sides of the terminal. This is no longer the case, and the airport now uses the more typical layout with departing passengers on an upper level with an elevated roadway, and arriving passengers on the lower level.

The new airport was slow to expand, only serving two million passengers a year by 1982, but it served over five million annually by 1999 and an expansion plan was approved in 2000. The first phase, which included rebuilding the landside terminal, the central square and main concessions area, as well as consolidating the security checkpoints at one location, and more parking capacity was completed in 2004–2005. In 2007, 6,319,016 passengers were processed.
The second phase of the expansion program was carried out over three years, commencing in mid-2006 and projected to cost about $170 million. Concourses A and C were completely rebuilt; the former concourses have been demolished. Work on Concourse B was given a low priority because the capacities of the rebuilt Concourses A and C were more than adequate for existing demand. The expansion was designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills (RS&amp;H).

The economic downturn of 2009 caused a decrease in passengers and flights. This led the JAA to commence the demolition of Concourse B in June 2009 because it was safer and easier for the contractor. After the debris was removed, asphalt was laid to provide space for ground equipment parking. The concourse will be rebuilt when passenger traffic increases, which the JAA had originally projected would occur in 2013 but did not materialize. A section of the old concourse eventually became part of an airline club lounge which opened in 2019.

==Expansion==
In 2018, the airport handled 6,460,253 passengers, breaking the previous record set in 2007. 7,186,639 passengers were handled in 2019. This increase in traffic prompted the JAA to revive the plan to rebuild concourse B. On May 10, 2024, ground was broken on a new Concourse B. The concourse will have six additional gates, with the ability to expand to up to 10 additional gates. The design of concourses A and C also allow them to be extended to accommodate additional gates. In 2019, RS&amp;H and Jacobs Engineering were chosen to perform the design, while Balfour Beatty was selected as the construction manager for the concourse B project. By 2022 traffic recovered to over 6.5 million passengers annually and the expansion project was restarted. Concourse B is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026. 

==Operations==

===Facilities===
The airport covers and has two concrete runways: 08/26, 10,000 x 150 ft (3,048 x 46 m) and 14/32, 7,701 x 150 ft (2,347 x 46 m). The terminal at JAX is composed of a baggage claim area, on the first floor and a ticketing area on the second floor, at the front of the structure. Past baggage claim and ticketing is the mezzanine, where shops, restaurants and the security checkpoint are located. Beyond the mezzanine are the airport&#x27;s Concourses A and C, which include 10 gates each (for a total of 20), along with other shops and restaurants.

The airport also has a Delta Sky Club on Concourse A and a multi-airline passenger club located behind the airside food court.

There are three galleries located off of the main courtyard before the security checkpoint. One features an art exhibit, the second houses a revolving exhibit about a Jacksonville-area landmark or institution, and the third houses a permanent exhibit highlighting the history of aviation in the region.

The airport&#x27;s two runways form a &quot;V&quot; pattern (with the tip of the &quot;V&quot; pointing west). A plan exists to build two more runways, each paralleling one existing runway. The one alongside the existing southern runway will be built first. No date has been set.

In the year ending February 28, 2023, the airport had 99,616 aircraft operations, an average of 273 per day: 63% scheduled commercial, 19% general aviation, 14% air taxi and 4% military. In February 2023, there were 72 aircraft based at this airport: 3 single-engine, 3 multi-engine, 46 jet and 20 military.

===Military facilities===

Concurrent with the closure of Imeson Airport, the 125th Fighter-Interceptor Group (125 FIG) of the Florida Air National Guard (FANG) relocated to Jacksonville International Airport. Military Construction (MILCON) funds provided for the establishment of Jacksonville Air National Guard Base in the southwest quadrant of the airport and placement of USAF-style emergency arresting gear on the JAX runways. Upgraded from group to wing status and redesignated as the 125th Fighter Wing (125 FW) in the early 1990s, the wing is the host unit for Jacksonville ANGB and operates F-15C and F-15D Eagle aircraft. The 125 FW is operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC).

Jacksonville ANGB is basically a small air force base, albeit without the military housing, military hospital or other infrastructure of major U.S. Air Force installations. The Air National Guard provides a fully equipped USAF Crash Fire Rescue station to augment the airport&#x27;s own fire department for both on-airport structural fires and aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) purposes. The base employs approximately 300 full-time military personnel (ART and AGR) and 1,000 part-time military personnel who are traditional air national guardsmen.

<doc id="287194" wikidata="Q1188435" url="?curid=287194" title="AmericanConnection">
<text>AmericanConnection was an American flight connection service brand name for the spoke-hub of U.S. mainline carrier American Airlines, under which regional airline operator Chautauqua Airlines operated feeder flights for American Airlines at its Chicago hub. American Airlines also uses affiliated companies (corporations under common ownership) operating under the American Eagle brand to provide regional service to its other hubs in addition to the AmericanConnection service that was operated by Chautauqua Airlines.

On April 6, 2010, American moved all existing AmericanConnection operations to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare as part of its restructuring plan, eliminating service by AmericanConnection at St. Louis.

At one time AmericanConnection operated over 180 flights a day to 21 destinations.

==History==
Most of the AmericanConnection carriers previously operated under a marketing agreement with Trans World Airlines (TWA) as Trans World Express carriers and later as Trans World Connection during the merger transition between TWA and American.

RegionsAir operated as AmericanConnection until March 2007 and Trans States Airlines operated as AmericanConnection until May 2009.

Though not associated with TWA as many of former AmericanConnection airlines were, Business Express Airlines was yet another air carrier which flew under the AmericanConnection marketing banner. Prior to its acquisition by AMR Corporation and its integration into the American Eagle destinations route network, Business Express linked many smaller localities directly to American Airlines&#x27;s expansive national and worldwide route network.

===Discontinuation of the marketing brand===
On September 12, 2012 AMR Corporation, announced it was discontinuing the AmericanConnection marketing brand and reverting to using the sole marketing brand of American Eagle for its feeder services to small cities it contracts regional airlines to perform. However, in 2014 an announcement was made that Chautauqua, the last airline operating under the brand, would not seek renewal of its AmericanConnection contract and all flying would end by August 19, 2014.

AmericanConnection Flight 5329 from White Plains to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare was the final flight.

==Accidents and incidents==
*Corporate Airlines Flight 5966 crashed on October 19, 2004, near Kirksville, Missouri, killing 13 people, with two survivors.

<doc id="287196" wikidata="Q7184176" url="?curid=287196" title="Philip Owen">
<text>Philip Walter Owen was a Canadian politician and drug reform advocate who served as the 36th mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia from 1993 to 2002.

==Political career==
Owen served in various elected roles in Vancouver from 1978 to 2002. He entered civic politics in 1978 after being elected to the Vancouver Parks Board. In 1986 he became a member of Vancouver City Council, and served there for seven years.

Owen was elected as Mayor of Vancouver in November 1993, shortly after the city had hosted the first meeting between US President, Bill Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on April 3-4 1993 whom he met as part of the cities welcoming party. In his first term, the city opened Library Square, a new downtown headquarters for the Vancouver Public Library. Owen was re-elected in 1996 and 1999. Owen oversaw Vancouver&#x27;s bid for the 2010 Olympic winter games, which it won in 2003, the Woodwards redevelopment, the public dispute over &quot;harm reduction&quot;, the downtown residential population doubling from 40,000 to 80,000, and numerous changes to housing policy. The city was rated the number one city in the world for quality of life by the William Mercer Study.

Owen did not seek re-election in 2002, after being told he would have to compete for the mayoral nomination of his own party, the Non-Partisan Association, a traditionally conservative civic party he had been part of for 25 years. This was following in-fighting among members of Owen&#x27;s own party who opposed &#x27;supporting addicts&#x27; and being &#x27;too weak on crime&#x27;. Following Owen&#x27;s departure the NPA lost the 2002 municipal election, returned to power in 2005, but has not won an election since 2005. In 2022, a mass-exodus of party members to ABC Vancouver left the NPA with 0 seats for the first time in over 80 years. Years later, Philip also spoke about how close and long-time friends stopped associating with him as well as his wife, Brita, following his public advocacy for harm reduction programs. 

Mike Harcourt originally a municipal political opponent of Owen&#x27;s who went on to be 30th Premier of British Columbia once said of Owen&#x27;s political fortunes: “He grew dramatically, I think, particularly around the issue of addiction and poverty in the Downtown Eastside, He became a crusader, a very courageous crusader, and it (eventually) cost him getting the nomination for his own party, when he took up the Four Pillars approach on drug addiction. He really was fearless promoting it.”

==Drug reform==
A public health emergency was declared in the Downtown Eastside in September 1997. Injection drug use had reached crisis levels with epidemics of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C soon following. 

Owen initially opposed drug reform. Further criminalization and the AIDS epidemic were seen as potential ends to the cities drug user problem. But following a change of heart while Mayor, Owen became noted for his championing of drug policy reform in his later years. According to Insite co-founder Liz Evans, “He started to watch people dying like flies from heroin overdoses, and at the time no-one was interested in having that conversation (about safely injecting drugs).&quot; she continued, &quot;He was a very decent man, a very kind man, and also a man who was not afraid to learn new things,” 

Owen started the conversation on the &quot;Four Pillars Approach&quot;, a novel strategy pioneered in Switzerland that represented a huge shift in public perception from treating substance use as a criminal justice issue towards a public health approach. The approach places an equal focus on harm reduction, prevention, treatment, and enforcement. After four years of research, Owen led a local and national debate to fight drug addiction problems in Canadian cities. An 85-page action plan was passed unanimously by Vancouver City Council in May 2001. This new policy had the support of over 80 per cent of Vancouver&#x27;s residents, as well as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities&#x27; Big City Mayor&#x27;s Caucus.

As a result, Vancouver opened Insite in 2003, the first legal safe injection site for intravenous drug users in North America. Owen used his position in the media to attempt to change the narrative on drug addiction away from crime and towards health policy, however, public opposition to Insite&#x27;s opening was immediate and loud. Upon opening, it drew criticism from the Bush administration with John Walters, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, calling it &quot;state-sponsored suicide.&quot; The Harper Government called Insite &quot;a failure of public policy and ethical judgement&quot; In 2008, Minister of Health Tony Clement failed to renew Insite&#x27;s exemption under the &quot;Controlled Drugs and Substances Act&quot; (&quot;CDSA&quot;) and publicly cast doubt on Insite&#x27;s ability to operate any further. 

The stark differences in defining addiction as either: a crime, or as a health condition needing treatment, lay at the heart of the public perception differences attempting to be changed within the Four Pillars approach. Under the Canadian Constitution, matters of criminal law are under both the jurisdiction of Federal and Provincial governments, but matters of Public Health are considered within the Exclusive Powers of Provincial Legislatures. This division of powers, and the conflicting definitions launched Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services Society a Canadian Supreme court case that began in 2011, seeing Insite defend it&#x27;s right to existence in court against the powers of the Federal government intent on closing and barring further safe consumption sites from opening in Canada.

The case lasted 141 days before the supreme court, with 3 prior cases referenced, 5 Respondents including: Dean E. Wilson, Shelly Tomic, the PHS, and the BCAG. 15 Interveners including the: Canadian Nurses Association, British Columbia Nurses Union, QCAG, VCHA, CCLA, IHRA, RNAO, ARNoBC, CPHA, CMA, BCCLA, and REALWoC.

The courts ruling was a 9-0 unanimously dismissal of the Harper Government&#x27;s appeal and cross-appeal stating: &quot;The Minister of Health is ordered to grant an exemption to Insite under s. 56 of the &quot;CDSA&quot; forthwith&quot; and following: 

&quot;&quot;The Minister’s decision thus engages the claimants’ s. 7 interests and constitutes a limit on their s. 7 rights.  Based on the information available to the Minister, this limit is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  It is arbitrary, undermining the very purposes of the CDSA, which include public health and safety.  It is also grossly disproportionate: the potential denial of health services and the correlative increase in the risk of death and disease to injection drug users outweigh any benefit that might be derived from maintaining an absolute prohibition on possession of illegal drugs on Insite’s premises.&quot; [...] &quot;The evidence indicates that a supervised injection site will decrease the risk of death and disease, and there is little or no evidence that it will have a negative impact on public safety, the Minister should generally grant an exemption.&quot;&quot;

In Insite&#x27;s first 20 years of operation, facility&#x27;s staff administered 11,856 overdose reversals, made 71,103 referrals to off-site services (such as rehab), and never saw one overdose death.

==Criticism==
During Owen&#x27;s mayoral tenure he was also the head of the Vancouver Police Board. During much of the Pickton investigation, after some 20 sex workers went missing from Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Eastside, Owen was criticized for commenting, that there was &quot;no evidence that a serial killer is at work.&quot;

&quot;No bodies have been found. They [the police] have a procedure for homicides and missing people, and they are following it. I don&#x27;t think it is appropriate for a big award for a location service.&quot; Owen stated in 1999. Police said the number of disappearances in 1998 was unusually high, but public sentiment at the time was towards disparaging women in sex work as &#x27;prostitutes&#x27; and &#x27;vagrants&#x27; and public perception was that their disappearance and estrangement from their families was to be expected, or even original conditions for their line of work.

On February 15, 2011, Owen published letters in several major Canadian newspapers apologizing for comments that he made blaming former Vancouver Police Department Inspector Kim Rossmo for delays in the investigation of serial killer Robert Pickton, following a defamation case that was settled out of court. 

==Awards==

In the spring of 2008, Owen was admitted as a Member of the Order of Canada, the countries second highest honour of merit, in a ceremony at Rideu Hall. In 2014, Owen was awarded the Order of the Diocese of New Westminster during his lifelong membership to St. John&#x27;s Shaughnessy. 

Owen was honoured posthumously when the St. Paul’s Foundation, with the support of Philip Owen’s friends and colleagues, established the Philip Owen Professorship in Addiction Medicine at UBC.

==Personal Life==
Owen was born and raised in Vancouver. His father was Walter S. Owen, was Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia from 1973 to 1978. He completed his education at Prince of Wales Secondary School and later New York University. Owen started a textile business in his late 20&#x27;s that later expanded to both Toronto and New York City. Owen managed the Eaton’s store at Park Royal in the early 1960s, eventually resigning his position after refusing to fire an older employee for fear they would not receive their pension. In the 1970s he operated a boutique in the Hotel Vancouver lobby called Nonesuch. He became a director of the Vancouver Art Gallery, president of the Downtown Vancouver Association, chair of St. George’s School. He served on the boards of Ovarian Cancer Canada, Opportunity International, the Salvation Army and Vancouver International Airport and was involved with many other local organizations. In later years, he and his wife Brita travelled to drug policy reform conferences in Canada, Europe, the United States and Afghanistan. Before his death, Owen received recognition for his work from many organizations including: B.C. Health Officers, Simon Fraser University, Lions International, Rotary International, the Brotherhood Inter-Faith Society, the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, the Richard J. Dennis Drug peace Award (New York) and the Canadian Criminal Justice Association. Owen died of complications related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease on September 30, 2021 at the age of 88.

<doc id="287197" wikidata="Q332586" url="?curid=287197" title="Pierre Adolphe Chéruel">
<text>Pierre Adolphe Chéruel (January 17, 1809 – May 1, 1891) was a French historian.

Chéruel was born at Rouen and educated at the École Normale Supérieure, becoming a fellow (&quot;agregé&quot;) in 1830. His early studies were concerned with local history. His &quot;Histoire de Rouen sous la domination anglaise au XVe siècle&quot; (1840) and &quot;Histoire de Rouen pendant l&#x27;époque communale, 1550–1382&quot; (Rouen, 1843–1844), are major productions for a time when the archives were neither catalogued nor classified, and contain useful documents previously unpublished. His theses for the degree of doctor, &quot;De l&#x27;administration de Louis XIV d&#x27;après les Mémoires inédits d&#x27;Olivier d&#x27;Ormesson&quot; and &quot;De Maria Stuarta et Henrico III&quot; (1849), led him to the study of general history. The former was expanded afterwards under the title &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;administration monarchique en France depuis l&#x27;avènement de Philippe-Auguste jusqu&#x27;à la mort de Louis XIV&quot; (1855), and in 1855 he also published his &quot;Dictionnaire historique des institutions, mœurs et coutumes de la France&quot;, of which many editions have appeared.

These works may still be consulted for the 17th century, the period upon which Chéruel concentrated all his scientific activity. He edited successively the &quot;Journal d&#x27;Olivier Lefèvre d&#x27;Ormesson&quot; (1860–1862), interesting for the history of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris during the minority of King Louis XIV; &quot;Lettres du cardinal Mazarin pendant son ministère&quot; (9 vols, 1870–1891), continued by the vicomte Georges d&#x27;Avenel; and &quot;Mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon&quot;, published for the first time according to the original manuscripts (2 editions, 1856–1858 and 1878–1881).

To Saint-Simon he devoted two critical studies, which are acute but not definitive: &quot;Saint-Simon considéré comme historien de Louis XIV&quot; (1865) and &quot;Notice sur la vie et sur les mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon&quot; (1876). The latter may be considered as an introduction to the famous &quot;Mémoires&quot;. Among his later writings were the &quot;Histoire de la France pendant la minorité de Louis XIV&quot; (4 volumes, 1880) and &quot;Histoire de la France sous le ministère de Mazarin&quot; (1882–1883). These two works are valuable for abundance of facts, precision of details, and clear and intelligent arrangement, but are characterized by a slightly frigid style. In their compilation Chéruel used a fair number of unpublished documents. To the student of the second half of the 17th century in France, the works of Chéruel are a mine of information.

<text>Key West International Airport is an international airport located in the City of Key West in Monroe County, Florida, United States, east of the main commercial center of Key West.

The relatively short runway limits the maximum size of aircraft that can serve the airport, along with restricting the weight of flights departing.

==History==

Key West&#x27;s aviation history began in 1913 with a flight to Cuba by Augustin Parla. In 1928, Pan American Airways began scheduled flights from Key West. The main runway at Meacham Field was pressed into U.S. Army use after the Pearl Harbor attack, as well as into U.S. Navy use later in World War II as an alternative to the Trumbo Point seaplane base and the main Naval Air Station for fixed-wing and lighter-than-air (blimp) aircraft on Boca Chica Key. After the war, the city took over what became Key West Municipal Airport. In January 1953, the city gave Monroe County the title to Meacham Field, allowing the county to apply for Federal Aviation Administration grants. Around the same time, the airport became Key West International Airport.

National Airlines began flights to Miami in 1944 with Lockheed Lodestar twin prop aircraft, although the airport did not have a paved runway until around 1956. National served Key West for nearly 25 years and later operated Convair 340 and Convair 440 prop aircraft, as well as Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops, into the airport. In 1968, National began the first jet flights into Key West with Boeing 727-100s, providing nonstop service to Miami. By 1969, National was operating daily 727 jet service direct to Washington National Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport via intermediate stops in Miami, West Palm Beach, and Orlando.

Several other airlines also began operating jet service into Key West. In 1979, Air Florida was operating five nonstop flights a day to Miami with Boeing 737 jetliners. In 1987, Eastern Airlines was operating daily mainline Boeing 727-100 jet service nonstop to Miami. By 1989, Piedmont Airlines was operating six nonstop flights a day to Miami with Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jets. This F28 jet service was then continued by USAir following its acquisition of and merger with Piedmont.
A number of commuter and regional airlines also served Key West with turboprop and prop aircraft during the 1970s and 1980s primarily with nonstop flights to Miami but also with nonstop service to Fort Lauderdale, Naples, and Tampa. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), these air carriers included Air Florida Commuter, Dolphin Airlines, Gull Air, Jetstream International Airlines, Pro Air Services, Provincetown-Boston Airlines (and its successor Bar Harbor Airlines), Southeast Airlines, and Southern Express. Turboprop aircraft operated into the airport included the British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31, Beechcraft 1900C, Beechcraft 1900D, Beechcraft C99, CASA 212 Aviocar, Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia, Nord 262 and Saab 340. Piston engine twin prop aircraft flown by commuter air carriers serving Key West included the Douglas DC-3, Martin 4-0-4, and Piper Navajo.

Delta Connection carrier Comair began service to Delta Air Lines&#x27; hub in Orlando in 1988 and also briefly had service to Tampa and Fort Lauderdale as well. American Eagle Airlines began service from Key West to American Airlines&#x27; hub in Miami in 1989. American Eagle operated Saab 340 and ATR-72 propjets into the airport before introducing regional jet service in the 2010s.

By the early 1990s, both USAir and Eastern Air Lines ended jet service to Key West, and all commercial service to Key West would be operated by propeller aircraft for the rest of the decade. In 1993, Cape Air began service to Key West with flights to Naples using Cessna 402s. Service expanded in 1996 with flights to Fort Lauderdale and Fort Myers (the latter of which continued operating until 2013). Other airlines operating at Key West in the early 1990s included Airways International (with flights to Fort Lauderdale and Miami), Pan Am Express (with flights to Miami), Paradise Island Airlines (operating code sharing service for Carnival Air Lines to Fort Lauderdale), and USAir Express (later known as US Airways Express with flights to Miami and Tampa).

Gulfstream International Airlines also began service to Key West in the early 1990s with flights to Miami and Tampa. Gulfstream would later operate as Continental Connection, the regional brand of the now-defunct Continental Airlines. Gulfstream has since been rebranded as Silver Airways, who still serves Key West today.

In 2002, Delta Connection carrier Atlantic Southeast Airlines began regional jet service to Delta&#x27;s hub in Atlanta. This brought jet service back to Key West as well as Key West&#x27;s first non-stop flight to a destination outside of Florida since 1961. Delta Connection&#x27;s service to Orlando was also upgraded to regional jets at the same time, though Orlando service was discontinued by 2008.

Main line jet service returned to Key West in 2009 when AirTran Airways, Key West&#x27;s first low-cost carrier, started flights to Orlando International Airport on Boeing 737-700s. Around the same time, Delta Air Lines upgraded some of their Atlanta flights to main line service on Boeing 737s. The airport&#x27;s runway, which was at the time, was the shortest runway to be regularly used by 737s in North America.

AirTran later added flights to Tampa in 2011. By the end of 2012, Southwest Airlines took over AirTran&#x27;s flights to Orlando and Tampa as part of the merger of the two airlines. Southwest also added service to New Orleans in March 2013. However, in 2014, Southwest discontinued all service to the airport.

On July 15, 2017, Key West International Airport was awarded a grant of $6.5 million by the FAA to assist in a $10 million runway project. The project added to the runway for takeoffs and landings as well as added -wide shoulders paved on each side of the runway. Construction work began in January 2018 and all construction was done at night.

==Facilities==

Key West International Airport covers 334 acres (135 ha) at an elevation of 3 feet (1 m). Its one runway, 09/27, is 5,076 feet long and 100 feet wide (1,547 x 30 m) and has an asphalt surface.

The length of the runway limits the size of aircraft that can serve the airport. Currently the largest aircraft that serve the airport are the Airbus A319 and the similarly sized Boeing 737-700, both shortened variants of the popular narrow-body mainline aircraft. Additionally, flights departing from EYW often have weight restrictions.

The airport has two terminals designed by Mark Mosko and Dwane Stark of URS; Mosko also worked on Baltimore–Washington International Airport. The older ground-level terminal building opened in 1957 and now serves arriving passengers. The terminal was expanded with the addition of a second building elevated over the parking lot in February 2009. With an area of about , it more than doubled the airport&#x27;s terminal space. The newer building includes an elevated roadway and houses ticketing, check-in, and the airport&#x27;s security checkpoint. The older building was then renovated with the former ticketing area becoming an expanded departure gate lounge, and the baggage claim area was then expanded into the former departure lounge. The two buildings are connected by an enclosed walkway.

Parking for 300 vehicles is at ground level beneath the newer terminal—150 spaces for rental cars and 150 for the public.

In the year ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 66,550 aircraft operations, averaging 182 per day: 55% general aviation, 34% airline, 10% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. At the time, 59 aircraft were based at the airport: 39 single-engine, 13 multi-engine, 3 jet, 3 helicopter and 1 ultralight.

==Expansion==

In November 2022, the airport broke ground on the construction of a new $98.8 million passenger concourse. This concourse will be nearly in size and feature a new departures area, an upgraded security checkpoint, additional baggage areas, and new gates featuring seven jet bridges. The project is expected to be completed in early 2025.

==Airlines and destinations==

Allegiant, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines operate mainline jets into Key West, primarily the Airbus A319. JetBlue operates the Airbus A220. United Airlines operates the Boeing 737-700. American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express operate regional jets, including the CRJ700 and Embraer E-Jets. Silver Airways operates ATR 42 and ATR 72 turboprop aircraft.

==Statistics==
===Annual traffic===
Key West&#x27;s traffic was generally fairly stagnant to start the new millennium but gradually began increasing at the end of the 2000s with the addition of the new terminal and the introduction of low-cost jet service operated by AirTran, as well as mainline jet service by Delta.

When Southwest acquired AirTran in 2011, it continued to operate flights from the airport, first under the AirTran brand and then under the Southwest brand with Boeing 737-700 jetliners. Southwest Airlines ended service to Key West Airport in 2014.

<text>The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic is a maritime museum located in downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

The museum is a member institution of the Nova Scotia Museum and is the oldest and largest maritime museum in Canada with a collection of over 30,000 artifacts including 70 small craft and a steamship: the CSS &quot;Acadia&quot;, a 180-foot steam-powered hydrographic survey ship launched in 1913.

==History==

The museum was founded in 1948. It was first known as the Maritime Museum of Canada and located at HMC Dockyard, the naval base on Halifax Harbour. Several naval officers served as volunteer chairs of the museum until 1959 when Niels Jannasch was hired as the museum&#x27;s founding director, serving until 1985. The museum moved through several locations over the next three decades before its current building was constructed in 1981 as part of a waterfront redevelopment program. The museum received the CSS &quot;Acadia&quot; in 1982. Today the museum is part of the Nova Scotia Museum system.

==Location==
The museum was one of the first attractions to open on the redeveloped Halifax Waterfront. Its location provides the museum with several piers and boatsheds, as well as a strategic view of the Halifax Harbour, which looks seaward towards the Harbourmaster office and Georges Island and across to Dartmouth. Among its facilities is the restored 1880s Robertson Store ship chandler building, as well as modern exhibit galleries in the Devonian Wing (the modern museum building). HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot;, a World War II Flower-class corvette is docked adjacent to the museum in the summer months but is not owned or administered by the museum.

==Collection==

In addition to the over 30,000 artifacts, the museum also has a collection of 30,000 photographs as well as a large collection of charts and rare books. A reference library, open to the public, is named after the museum&#x27;s founding director, The Niels Jannasch Library. The museum has Canada&#x27;s largest collection of ship portraits including the oldest ship portrait in Canada as well as a large collection of ship models including the original production models of the television show Theodore Tugboat. Ongoing restoration of &quot;Whim&quot;, a 1937 C-class sloop can be found in one of the boatsheds on the wharf behind the museum. In addition to this current restoration project, the boatsheds house some of the museum&#x27;s small craft collection. During the summer months three boats in the working small craft collection can be found moored next to the CSS &quot;Acadia&quot;. In July 2017 the museum also completed restoration of the small schooner &quot;Hebridee II&quot;.

==Exhibits==
Public galleries include the Days of Sail, the Age of Steam, Small Craft, the Canadian Navy, the Halifax Explosion, and Shipwrecks. A special permanent exhibit explores the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; with an emphasis on Nova Scotia&#x27;s connection to recovering the bodies of &quot;Titanic&quot; victims. The museum has the world&#x27;s foremost collection of wooden artifacts from &quot;Titanic&quot;, including one of the few surviving deck chairs. The &quot;Titanic&quot; exhibit also includes a child&#x27;s pair of shoes, which helped identify &quot;Titanic&quot;″s &quot;unknown child&quot; as Sidney Leslie Goodwin.
The adjacent exhibit &quot;Shipwreck Treasures of Nova Scotia&quot; explores the many other shipwrecks off the coast of Nova Scotia including archaeological discoveries on naval shipwrecks in Louisbourg Harbour and an unknown 1750s schooner at Lower Prospect, Nova Scotia. The results of treasure hunting are also featured in a section on Cape Breton treasure wrecks which has displays of weapons, instruments, gold and silver from wrecks such as the 1711 HMS &quot;Feversham&quot;, the 1725 wreck of &quot;Chameau&quot; and the 1761 wreck of the ship &quot;Auguste&quot;.
The Age of Steam gallery includes a special display on Samuel Cunard, the Nova Scotian who created the Cunard Line. The restored 1880s Robertson building includes the fully restored Robertson ship chandlerly which features hands on foghorns, ropes and ship fittings.

The Navy gallery includes the &quot;Convoy Exhibit&quot; about the Battle of the Atlantic which includes the Canadian Merchant Navy Book of Remembrance. Monuments to the Canadian and Norwegian Merchant Navy are located just outside the museum along with a unique children&#x27;s playground in the shape of a submarine.
The museum also has a changing exhibits gallery. A 2009 exhibit &quot;Ship of Fate: The Tragic Voyage of the St. Louis&quot; was the first Canadian exhibit to explore the 1939 voyage of the Jewish refugee ship . The museum became the first museum in North America to present an exhibit about the lives of gay seafarers in 2011 when it presented &quot;Hello Sailor: Gay Life on the Ocean Waves&quot;, adapted from an exhibit developed at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, England. The 2012 exhibit explores the experiences of the cable ships based in Halifax who recovered most of the victims of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking.

==Vessels==
* CSS &quot;Acadia&quot;, served as research from 1913 to 1968 and as a WWI and WWII patrol ship
* 70 small craft displayed in a Small Craft Gallery and boat sheds
* Working collection vessels which sail from the museum wharves include the ketch &quot;Elson Perry&quot;, the sloop &quot;Windekilda&quot;; and S-Class sloop &quot;Valkyrie&quot;
* Schooner &quot;Hebridee II&quot;

The corvette HMCS &quot;Sackville&quot; (K181) is not part of the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic but is located adjacent to the museum in the summer and works with the museum to interpret the Royal Canadian Navy.

==Event location==
The museum&#x27;s location on the Halifax waterfront has made the museum the site of several significant public events. In addition to being a stop on most Canadian federal election campaigns, the museum hosted meetings from the 1995 G7 Summit, as well a September 11 commemorative event in 2006 attended by Canada&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Peter MacKay and United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. The museum hosts an annual commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic on the first Sunday of every May and Canadian Merchant Navy day every September 3.

<doc id="287206" wikidata="Q124955" url="?curid=287206" title="Antonin Nompar de Caumont, 1st Duke of Lauzun">
<text>Antonin Nompar de Caumont, 1st [[Duke of Lauzun]] (, 163219 November 1723) was a French courtier and soldier. He was the only love interest of the &quot;greatest heiress in Europe&quot;, Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier, cousin of Louis XIV.

He is often noted for his command of a French expeditionary Brigade which served alongside the Jacobite Irish Army during the Williamite War. After defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 his brigade retreated to Galway where it was evacuated to France. Nonetheless, he remained an influential figure at the Jacobite court in exile, particularly with Mary of Modena.

==Biography==
He was the son of Gabriel de Caumont, Count of Lauzun (1590-1660), and his wife, Charlotte de Caumont de La Force (1606-1689), daughter of Henri Nompar de Caumont, Duke of La Force, both members of an old French nobility. He was brought up with the children of his relative, the &quot;maréchal-duc&quot; Antoine III de Gramont. One daughter, Catherine Charlotte, afterwards princess of Monaco by marriage to Prince Louis I of Monaco, was the object of the one passion of Lauzun&#x27;s life.

He entered the army, and served under Turenne, also his kinsman, and in 1655 succeeded his father as commander of the &quot;cent gentilshommes de la maison de roi&quot;. Then known as the comte de Puyguilhem (or Péguilin, as contemporaries simplified his name), he rose rapidly in Louis XIV&#x27;s favour, became colonel of the royal regiment of dragoons, and was gazetted &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;. He and Madame de Monaco belonged to the &quot;côterie&quot; of the young Duchess of Orléans. His rough wit and skill in practical jokes pleased Louis XIV, but his jealousy and violence were the causes of his undoing. He prevented a meeting between Louis XIV and Madame de Monaco, and jealousy in that matter, rather than hostility to Louise de La Vallière, led him to promote Madame de Montespan&#x27;s intrigues with the king. He asked that lady to secure for him the post of grand-master of the artillery, and on Louis&#x27;s refusal to give him the appointment, he turned his back on the king, broke his sword and swore that never again would he serve a monarch who had broken his word. The result was a short sojourn in the Bastille, but he soon returned to his function as court buffoon.

Meanwhile, Anne, Duchess of Montpensier (&quot;La Grande Mademoiselle&quot;) had fallen in love with the little man, whose ugliness seems to have exercised a certain fascination over many women. He naturally encouraged one of the greatest heiresses in Europe, and the wedding was fixed for 21 December 1670. Then, on the 18th, Louis sent for his cousin and forbade the marriage. Madame de Montespan had never forgiven Lauzun&#x27;s fury when she failed to procure the grand-mastership of the artillery, and now, with Louvois, secured his arrest to the Bastille on 25 November 1671. Two days later, he was removed to Pignerol, where excessive precautions were taken to ensure that he was firmly held. He was eventually allowed to meet another prisoner, Fouquet, but before that time he managed to find a way through the chimney into Fouquet&#x27;s room, and on another occasion succeeded in reaching the courtyard in safety. Another fellow-prisoner, from communication with whom he was supposed to be rigorously excluded, was Eustache Dauger (see Man in the Iron Mask), who occasionally served as valet to Fouquet.

In his reports to his superiors in Paris, the prison governor, Bénigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, tells how Lauzun displayed evidence of deranged behaviour at this time: his cell was in constant disarray and he grew his beard to the point that it gave him a wild appearance. An attempted escape was foiled when, on emerging from his tunnel, he came across a maid who raised the alarm.

It was now intimated to Mademoiselle that Lauzun&#x27;s restoration to liberty depended on her immediate settlement of the principality of Dombes, the county of Eu and the duchy of Aumale – three properties assigned by her to Lauzun – on Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine, eldest legitimised son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. She gave way, but Lauzun, even after ten years of imprisonment, refused to sign the documents, when he was brought to Bourbon for the purpose. A short term of imprisonment at Chalon-sur-Saône made him change his mind, but when he was set free Louis XIV was still set against the marriage, which is supposed to have taken place secretly.

Married or not, Lauzun was openly courting Nicolas Fouquet&#x27;s daughter, whom he had seen at Pignerol. He was to be restored to his place at court, and to marry Mademoiselle Fouquet, who, however, became Duchess d&#x27;Uzès in 1683.

In 1685 Lauzun went to England to seek his fortune under James II, whom he had served as Duke of York in Flanders. He rapidly gained great influence at the English court. In 1688 he was again in England, and arranged the journey into exile of Mary of Modena and the infant prince, whom he accompanied to Calais, where he received strict instructions from Louis to bring them &quot;on any pretext&quot; to Vincennes.

In the late autumn of 1689 he was put in command of the expedition fitted out at Brest for service in Ireland, and he sailed in the following year. Lauzun was honest, a quality not too common in James II&#x27;s officials in Ireland, but had no experience of the field, and he blindly followed Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel. After the battle of the Boyne they fled to Limerick, and thence to the west, leaving Patrick Sarsfield to show a brave front. In September they sailed for France, and on their arrival at Versailles Lauzun found that his failure had destroyed any prospect of a return of Louis XIV&#x27;s favour. In 1692, under the influence of Queen Mary of Modena he was created Duke of Lauzun.

Mademoiselle died in 1693, and two years later Lauzun married Geneviève Marie de Durfort (1680-1729), a child of fourteen, daughter of the Guy Aldonce de Durfort, Duke de Lorges. Queen Mary, through whose interest Lauzun secured his dukedom, retained her faith in him, and it was he who in 1715, more than a quarter of a century after the flight from Whitehall, brought her the news of the Battle of Sheriffmuir. After his death, the dukedom of Lauzun fell to his niece&#x27;s husband, Charles Armand de Gontaut.

See the letters of Madame de Sévigné and the memoirs of Saint-Simon, who was Lauzun&#x27;s wife&#x27;s brother-in-law.

<text>Plasmodium is a genus of unicellular eukaryotes that are obligate parasites of vertebrates and insects. The life cycles of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species involve development in a blood-feeding insect host which then injects parasites into a vertebrate host during a blood meal. Parasites grow within a vertebrate body tissue (often the liver) before entering the bloodstream to infect red blood cells. The ensuing destruction of host red blood cells can result in malaria. During this infection, some parasites are picked up by a blood-feeding insect (mosquitoes in majority cases), continuing the life cycle.

&quot;Plasmodium&quot; is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, a large group of parasitic eukaryotes. Within Apicomplexa, &quot;Plasmodium&quot; is in the order Haemosporida and family Plasmodiidae. Over 200 species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; have been described, many of which have been subdivided into 14 subgenera based on parasite morphology and host range. Evolutionary relationships among different &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species do not always follow taxonomic boundaries; some species that are morphologically similar or infect the same host turn out to be distantly related.

Species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; are distributed globally wherever suitable hosts are found. Insect hosts are most frequently mosquitoes of the genera &quot;Culex&quot; and &quot;Anopheles&quot;. Vertebrate hosts include reptiles, birds, and mammals. &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites were first identified in the late 19th century by Charles Laveran. Over the course of the 20th century, many other species were discovered in various hosts and classified, including five species that regularly infect humans: &quot;P. vivax&quot;, &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, &quot;P. malariae&quot;, &quot;P. ovale&quot;, and &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;. &quot;P. falciparum&quot; is by far the most lethal in humans, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths per year. A number of drugs have been developed to treat &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infection; however, the parasites have evolved resistance to each drug developed.

Although the parasite can also infect people via blood transfusion, this is very rare, and &quot;Plasmodium&quot; cannot be spread from person to person. Some of subspecies of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; are obligate intracellular parasites.

== Description ==
The genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot; consists of all eukaryotes in the phylum Apicomplexa that both undergo the asexual replication process of merogony inside host red blood cells and produce the crystalline pigment hemozoin as a byproduct of digesting host hemoglobin. &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species contain many features that are common to other eukaryotes, and some that are unique to their phylum or genus. The &quot;Plasmodium&quot; genome is separated into 14 chromosomes contained in the nucleus. &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites maintain a single copy of their genome through much of the life cycle, doubling the genome only for a brief sexual exchange within the midgut of the insect host. Attached to the nucleus is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which functions similarly to the ER in other eukaryotes. Proteins are trafficked from the ER to the Golgi apparatus which generally consists of a single membrane-bound compartment in Apicomplexans. From here, proteins are trafficked to various cellular compartments or to the cell surface.

Like other apicomplexans, &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species have several cellular structures at the apical end of the parasite that serve as specialized organelles for secreting effectors into the host. The most prominent are the bulbous rhoptries which contain parasite proteins involved in invading the host cell and modifying the host once inside. Adjacent to the rhoptries are smaller structures termed micronemes that contain parasite proteins required for motility as well as recognizing and attaching to host cells. Spread throughout the parasite are secretory vesicles called dense granules that contain parasite proteins involved in modifying the membrane that separates the parasite from the host, termed the parasitophorous vacuole.

Species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; also contain two large membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, the mitochondrion and the apicoplast, both of which play key roles in the parasite&#x27;s metabolism. Unlike mammalian cells which contain many mitochondria, &quot;Plasmodium&quot; cells contain a single large mitochondrion that coordinates its division with that of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; cell. Like in other eukaryotes, the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; mitochondrion is capable of generating energy in the form of ATP via the citric acid cycle; however, this function is only required for parasite survival in the insect host, and is not needed for growth in red blood cells. A second organelle, the apicoplast, is derived from a secondary endosymbiosis event, in this case the acquisition of a red alga by the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; ancestor. The apicoplast is involved in the synthesis of various metabolic precursors, including fatty acids, isoprenoids, iron-sulphur clusters, and components of the heme biosynthesis pathway.

==Life cycle==

The life cycle of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; involves several distinct stages in the insect and vertebrate hosts. Parasites are generally introduced into a vertebrate host by the bite of an insect host (generally a mosquito, with the exception of some &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species of reptiles). Parasites first infect the liver or other tissue, where they undergo a single large round of replication before exiting the host cell to infect erythrocytes. At this point, some species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; of primates can form a long-lived dormant stage called a hypnozoite, which can remain in the liver for more than a year. However, for most &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species, the parasites in infected liver cells are only what are called merozoites. After emerging from the liver, they enter red blood cells, as explained above. They then go through continuous cycles of erythrocyte infection, while a small percentage of parasites differentiate into a sexual stage called a gametocyte which is picked up by an insect host taking a blood meal. In some hosts, invasion of erythrocytes by &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species can result in disease, called malaria. This can sometimes be severe, rapidly followed by death of the host (e.g. &quot;P. falciparum&quot; in humans). In other hosts, &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infection can apparently be asymptomatic.

Even when humans have such subclinical plasmodial infections, there can nevertheless be very large numbers of multiplying parasites concealed in, particularly, the spleen and bone marrow. Certainly, this applies in the case of &quot;P. vivax&quot;. These hidden parasites (in addition to hypnozoites) are thought to be the origin of instances of recurrent &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria.

Within the red blood cells, the merozoites grow first to a ring-shaped form and then to a larger form called a trophozoite. Trophozoites then mature to schizonts which divide several times to produce new merozoites. The infected red blood cell eventually bursts, allowing the new merozoites to travel within the bloodstream to infect new red blood cells. Most merozoites continue this replicative cycle, however some merozoites upon infecting red blood cells differentiate into male or female sexual forms called gametocytes. These gametocytes circulate in the blood until they are taken up when a mosquito feeds on the infected vertebrate host, taking up blood which includes the gametocytes.

In the mosquito, the gametocytes move along with the blood meal to the mosquito&#x27;s midgut. Here the gametocytes develop into male and female gametes which fertilize each other, forming a zygote. Zygotes then develop into a motile form called an ookinete, which penetrates the wall of the midgut. Upon traversing the midgut wall, the ookinete embeds into the gut&#x27;s exterior membrane and develops into an oocyst. Oocysts divide many times to produce large numbers of small elongated sporozoites. These sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito where they can be injected into the blood of the next host the mosquito bites, repeating the cycle.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
=== Taxonomy ===
&quot;Plasmodium&quot; belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa, a taxonomic group of single-celled parasites with characteristic secretory organelles at one end of the cell. Within Apicomplexa, &quot;Plasmodium&quot; is within the order Haemosporida, a group that includes all apicomplexans that live within blood cells. Based on the presence of the pigment hemozoin and the method of asexual reproduction, the order is further split into four families, of which &quot;Plasmodium&quot; is in the family Plasmodiidae.

The genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot; consists of over 200 species, generally described on the basis of their appearance in blood smears of infected vertebrates. These species have been categorized on the basis of their morphology and host range into 14 subgenera:

* Subgenus &quot;Asiamoeba&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Bennettinia&quot; – birds
* Subgenus &quot;Carinamoeba&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Giovannolaia&quot; – birds
* Subgenus &quot;Haemamoeba&quot; – birds
* Subgenus &quot;Huffia&quot; – birds
* Subgenus &quot;Lacertamoeba&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Laverania&quot; – great apes, humans 
* Subgenus &quot;Novyella&quot; – birds
* Subgenus &quot;Ophidiella&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Paraplasmodium&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Plasmodium&quot; – monkeys and apes
* Subgenus &quot;Sauramoeba&quot; – reptiles
* Subgenus &quot;Vinckeia&quot; – mammals inc. primates

Species infecting monkeys and apes with the exceptions of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; and &quot;P. reichenowi&quot; (which together make up the subgenus &quot;Laverania&quot;) are classified in the subgenus &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. Parasites infecting other mammals including some primates (lemurs and others) are classified in the subgenus &quot;Vinckeia&quot;. The five subgenera &quot;Bennettinia&quot;, &quot;Giovannolaia&quot;, &quot;Haemamoeba&quot;, &quot;Huffia&quot;, and &quot;Novyella&quot; contain the known avian malarial species. The remaining subgenera: &quot;Asiamoeba&quot;, &quot;Carinamoeba&quot;, &quot;Lacertamoeba&quot;, &quot;Ophidiella&quot;, &quot;Paraplasmodium&quot;, and &quot;Sauramoeba&quot; contain the diverse groups of parasites found to infect reptiles.

===Phylogeny===

More recent studies of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species using molecular methods have implied that the group&#x27;s evolution has not perfectly followed taxonomy. Many &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species that are morphologically similar or infect the same hosts turn out to be only distantly related. In the 1990s, several studies sought to evaluate evolutionary relationships of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species by comparing ribosomal RNA and a surface protein gene from various species, finding the human parasite &quot;P. falciparum&quot; to be more closely related to avian parasites than to other parasites of primates. However, later studies sampling more &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species found the parasites of mammals to form a clade along with the genus &quot;Hepatocystis&quot;, while the parasites of birds or lizards appear to form a separate clade with evolutionary relationships not following the subgenera:

Estimates for when different &quot;Plasmodium&quot; lineages diverged have differed broadly. Estimates for the diversification of the order Haemosporida range from around 16.2 million to 100 million years ago. There has been particular interest in dating the divergence of the human parasite &quot;P. falciparum&quot; from other &quot;Plasmodium&quot; lineages due to its medical importance. For this, estimated dates range from 110,000 to 2.5 million years ago.

==Distribution==
&quot;Plasmodium&quot; species are distributed globally. All &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species are parasitic and must pass between a vertebrate host and an insect host to complete their life cycles. Different species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; display different host ranges, with some species restricted to a single vertebrate and insect host, while other species can infect several species of vertebrates and/or insects.

=== Vertebrates ===
&quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites have been described in a broad array of vertebrate hosts including reptiles, birds, and mammals. While many species can infect more than one vertebrate host, they are generally specific to one of these classes (such as birds).

Humans are primarily infected by five species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, with the overwhelming majority of severe disease and death caused by &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. Some species that infect humans can also infect other primates, and zoonoses of certain species (e.g. &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;) from other primates to humans are common. Non-human primates also contain a variety of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species that do not generally infect humans. Some of these can cause severe disease in primates, while others can remain in the host for prolonged periods without causing disease. Many other mammals also carry &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species, such as a variety of rodents, ungulates, and bats. Again, some species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; can cause severe disease in some of these hosts, while many appear not to.

Over 150 species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infect a broad variety of birds. In general each species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infects one to a few species of birds. &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites that infect birds tend to persist in a given host for years or for the life time of the host, although in some cases &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infections can result in severe illness and rapid death. Unlike with &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species infecting mammals, those infecting birds are distributed across the globe.

Species from several subgenera of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infect diverse reptiles. &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites have been described in most lizard families and, like avian parasites, are spread worldwide. Again, parasites can result either in severe disease or be apparently asymptomatic depending on the parasite and the host.

A number of drugs have been developed over the years to control &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infection in vertebrate hosts, particularly in humans. Quinine was used as a frontline antimalarial from the 17th century until widespread resistance emerged in the early 20th century. Resistance to quinine spurred the development of a broad array of antimalarial medications through the 20th century including chloroquine, proguanil, atovaquone, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and artemisinin. In all cases, parasites resistant to a given drug have emerged within a few decades of the drugs deployment. To combat this, antimalarial drugs are frequently used in combination, with artemisinin combination therapies currently the gold standard for treatment. In general, antimalarial drugs target the life stages of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites that reside within vertebrate red blood cells, as these are the stages that tend to cause disease. However, drugs targeting other stages of the parasite life cycle are under development in order to prevent infection in travelers and to prevent transmission of sexual stages to insect hosts.

=== Insects ===
In addition to a vertebrate host, all &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species also infect a bloodsucking insect host, generally a mosquito (although some reptile-infecting parasites are transmitted by sandflies). Mosquitoes of the genera &quot;Culex&quot;, &quot;Anopheles&quot;, &quot;Culiseta&quot;, &quot;Mansonia&quot; and &quot;Aedes&quot; act as insect hosts for various &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species. The best studied of these are the &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes which host the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites of human malaria, as well as &quot;Culex&quot; mosquitoes which host the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species that cause malaria in birds. Only female mosquitoes are infected with &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, since only they feed on the blood of vertebrate hosts. Different species affect their insect hosts differently. Sometimes, insects infected with &quot;Plasmodium&quot; have reduced lifespan and reduced ability to produce offspring. Further, some species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; appear to cause insects to prefer to bite infected vertebrate hosts over non-infected hosts.

== History ==
Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran first described parasites in the blood of malaria patients in 1880. He named the parasite &quot;Oscillaria malariae&quot;. In 1885, zoologists Ettore Marchiafava and Angelo Celli reexamined the parasite and termed it a member of a new genus, &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, named for the resemblance to the multinucleate cells of slime molds of the same name. The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886. Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium malariae&quot;. In 1897, William Welch identified and named &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; which infect humans: &quot;Plasmodium ovale&quot; (1922) and &quot;Plasmodium knowlesi&quot; (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965). The contribution of insect hosts to the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.

In 1966, Cyril Garnham proposed separating &quot;Plasmodium&quot; into nine subgenera based on host specificity and parasite morphology. This included four subgenera that had previously been proposed for bird-infecting &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species by A. Corradetti in 1963. This scheme was expanded upon by Sam R. Telford in 1988 when he reclassified &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites that infect reptiles, adding five subgenera. In 1997, G. Valkiunas reclassified the bird-infecting &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species adding a fifth subgenus: &quot;Bennettinia&quot;.

<text>Andrew McCulloch (born 19 November 1945, Bournemouth) is an English drummer who worked with Fields, Greenslade, Manfred Mann Chapter Three, Anthony Phillips, Peter Banks, the Crazy World of Arthur Brown and King Crimson in the 1970s before becoming a yachtmaster.

==Biography==
He spent his childhood in Hiroshima and elsewhere outside the UK. He began playing the drums at the age of 18 after returning to England. Joined Bournemouth&#x27;s band Shy Limbs. He recorded for the first time in autumn 1968, and 9 May 1969 was his record debut.

After drumming for Manfred Mann in early 1970, he became Michael Giles&#x27; replacement in King Crimson. He appeared on just one King Crimson album, the jazz-influenced &quot;Lizard&quot;, released in 1970.

He joined Greenslade at its inception in 1972, remaining with them until their dissolution in 1976. He then guested on several releases, including &quot;Opus One&quot; with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, before leaving the music business. Despite at the time being referred to in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being one of the most skillful and inventive drummers working anywhere in the jazz or rock spectrum, he left to become more involved with his other love, sailing.

As an RYA Yachtmaster instructor he skippered and taught on several yachts around Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, France, Spain, Lebanon and Antigua.

He now charters his own yachts around the Greek Islands in the summer season, as well as teaching, skippering and examining.
