<text>Medieval literature is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in Europe and beyond during the Middle Ages (that is, the one thousand years from the fall of the Western Roman Empire ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Renaissance in the 14th, 15th or 16th century, depending on country). The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as secular works. Like modern literature, it is a broad field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in between. Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.

==Languages==
Outside of Europe, medieval literature was written in Ethiopic, Syriac, Coptic, Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic, among many other languages.

In Western Europe, Latin was the common language for medieval writing, since Latin was the language of the Roman Catholic Church, which dominated Western and Central Europe, and since the Church was virtually the only source of education. This was the case even in some parts of Europe that were never Romanized.

In Eastern Europe, the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church made Greek and Old Church Slavonic the dominant written languages.

In Europe the common people used their respective vernaculars. A few examples, such as the Old English &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the Middle High German , the Medieval Greek &quot;Digenis Acritas&quot;, the Old East Slavic &quot;Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, and the Old French &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, are well known to this day. Although the extant versions of these epics are generally considered the works of individual (but anonymous) poets, there is no doubt that they are based on their peoples&#x27; older oral traditions. Celtic traditions have survived in the lais of Marie de France, the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; and the Arthurian cycles. Another host of vernacular literature has survived in the Old Norse literature and more specifically in the saga literature of Iceland.

==Anonymity==
A notable amount of medieval literature is anonymous. This is not only due to the lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author&#x27;s role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an &quot;auctor&quot; instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.

==Types of writing==

===Religious===
Theological works were the dominant form of literature typically found in libraries during the Middle Ages. Catholic clerics were the intellectual center of society in the Middle Ages, and it is their literature that was produced in the greatest quantity.

Countless hymns survive from this time period (both liturgical and paraliturgical). The liturgy itself was not in fixed form, and numerous competing missals set out individual conceptions of the order of the mass. Religious scholars such as Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, and Pierre Abélard wrote lengthy theological and philosophical treatises, often attempting to reconcile the teachings of the Greek and Roman pagan authors with the doctrines of the Church. Hagiographies, or &quot;lives of the saints&quot;, were also frequently written, as an encouragement to the devout and a warning to others.

The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine reached such popularity that, in its time, it was reportedly read more often than the Bible. Francis of Assisi was a prolific poet, and his Franciscan followers frequently wrote poetry themselves as an expression of their piety. &quot;Dies Irae&quot; and &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; are two of the most powerful Latin poems on religious subjects. Goliardic poetry (four-line stanzas of satiric verse) was an art form used by some clerics to express dissent. The only widespread religious writing that was not produced by clerics were the mystery plays: growing out of simple tableaux re-enactments of a single Biblical scene, each mystery play became its village&#x27;s expression of the key events in the Bible. The text of these plays was often controlled by local guilds, and mystery plays would be performed regularly on set feast-days, often lasting all day long and into the night.

During the Middle Ages, the Jewish population of Europe also produced a number of outstanding writers. Maimonides, born in Cordoba, Spain, and Rashi, born in Troyes, France, are two of the best-known and most influential of these Jewish authors.

===Secular===
Secular literature in this period was not produced in equal quantity as religious literature. The earliest tales are based on oral traditions: the British &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; and &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot;, along with the Germanic &quot;Beowulf&quot; and . They relate to myths or certain 6th-century events, but the surviving manuscripts date from centuries later—&quot;Y Gododdin&quot; from the late 13th century, &quot;Preiddu Annwfn&quot; from the early 14th century, &quot;Beowulf&quot; from , and the from the 13th century. The makers and performers were &quot;bards&quot; (British/Welsh) and &quot;scops&quot; (Germanic), elite professionals attached to royal or noble courts to praise the heroes of legendary history.

Prose tales first emerged in Britain: the intricate Four Branches of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; about princely families, notably anti-war in theme, and the romantic adventure &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. (The &quot;Mabinogi&quot; is not the same as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, a collection of disconnected prose tales, which does, however, include both the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; and &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;.) These works were compiled from earlier oral tradition .

At about the same time a new poetry of &quot;courtly love&quot; became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers—troubadours and trouvères—made a living from their love songs in French, Spanish, Galician-Portuguese, Catalan, Provençal, and Greek. Germanic culture had its Minnesänger tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited longing for an ideal woman, but there are also aubades (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties.

Following the earliest epic poems, prose tales, and romances, more long poems were crafted—the &quot;chansons de geste&quot; of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These extolled conquests, as in &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; (part of the Matter of France) and &quot;Digenis Acritas&quot; (one of the Acritic songs). The rather different chivalric romance tradition concerns adventures about marvels, love, and chivalry. They tell of the Matter of Britain and the Matter of Rome.

Political poetry threads throughout the period from the very early &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; (10th-century Britain) to the goliard rebels of 12th and 13th centuries, who were church trained clerics unable or unwilling to be employed in the church.

Travel literature was highly popular in the Middle Ages, as fantastic accounts of far-off lands (frequently embellished or entirely false) entertained a society that supported sea voyages and trading along coasts and rivers, as well as pilgrimages to such destinations as Jerusalem; Canterbury and Glastonbury in England; St. David&#x27;s in Wales; and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; became popular at the end of the 14th century.

The most prominent authors of Jewish secular poetry in the Middle Ages were Solomon ibn Gabirol and Yehuda Halevi, both of whom were also renowned religious poets.

===Women&#x27;s literature===
While it is true that women in the medieval period were never accorded full equality with men, some women were able to use their skill with the written word to gain renown. Religious writing was the easiest avenue—women who would later be canonized as saints frequently published their reflections, revelations, and prayers. Much of what is known about women in the Middle Ages is known from the works of nuns such as Clare of Assisi, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena.

Frequently, however, the religious perspectives of women were held to be unorthodox by those in power, and the mystical visions of such authors as Julian of Norwich, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Hildegard of Bingen provide insight into a part of the medieval experience less comfortable for the institutions that ruled Europe at the time. Women wrote influential texts in the secular realm as well—reflections on courtly love and society by Marie de France and Christine de Pizan continue to be studied for their glimpses of medieval society.

Some women were patrons of books and owners of significant book collections. Female book collectors in the fifteenth century included Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk; Cecily Neville, Duchess of York; and Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby. Lady Margaret Beaufort may also have completed translations as a testament to her piety, as Bishop Father John Fisher noted in a sermon dedicated to her after her death.

For modern historical reflection, D.H. Green&#x27;s (2007) historical work entitled, &quot;Women Readers of the Middle Ages&quot; explores literacy and literature in terms of women in medieval society. The book has been reviewed as &quot;a radical reassessment of women&#x27;s contribution to medieval literary culture.&quot;

===Allegory===
While medieval literature makes use of many literary devices, allegory is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention. Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing—representations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in much of the literature of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the &quot;Psychomachia&quot; (&quot;Battle of Souls&quot;) by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius. Other important examples include the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot;, &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;, and the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

== Preservation ==
A recent study has concluded that only about 68 percent of all medieval works have survived to the present day, including fewer than 40 percent of English works, around 50 percent of Dutch and French works, and more than three quarters of German, Icelandic, and Irish works.

<doc id="290765" wikidata="Q7749466" url="?curid=290765" title="The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks">
<text>The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks is the first book in &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; classic series books. Written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by Bruce Degen, it is a picture book and introduces most of the main characters of the series, including Ms. Frizzle, Arnold, Dorothy Ann, Ralphie (called &quot;Ralph&quot; in the book), Tim, Wanda and Liz as well as several students who did not appear in the TV series or any other multimedia outside of the original series books. Carlos, Keesha and Phoebe do not appear in this book, though a student called &quot;John&quot; in the book bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Carlos.

The book depicts the class&#x27;s first field trip with Ms. Frizzle. Despite the title, the bus is not depicted as directly causing the strange events of the field trip as it would be in later books and the television series. In this book, strange events just seem to happen with no explanation and continue to happen after the kids leave the bus in a cloud.

==Synopsis==
The book begins by introducing the character of Ms. Frizzle and describing her unusual teaching methods. Soon, she decides to take the class on a field trip to the waterworks, which the kids are sure will be boring, especially compared to the trips the kids in other classes go on. However, after driving through a tunnel, the bus becomes plastered with images of octopuses and everyone inside finds themselves wearing swimming outfits.

Once this occurs, the bus rises up into a cloud along with evaporating water. Ms. Frizzle makes all the kids get out of the bus. The kids did not want to leave, but she threatened to give them extra homework if they didn&#x27;t. However, the kids begin shrinking once they&#x27;re outside and, once they&#x27;re each the size of a raindrop, they rain down into a river, which carries them into the town&#x27;s water purification system. After going through the waterworks, the pipes take the class back to the school. They travel through the pipes into the girls&#x27; bathroom, and when a seventh grader girl turned on one of the faucets, the class came out of it. Once out of the faucet, they are instantly restored to their regular size and the clothes they were in before the tunnel (except for Ms. Frizzle, wearing a bizarre dress covered with octopus pictures).

Ms. Frizzle, however, appears to have no memory of the strange trip and the class later sees the bus outside. They wonder how it returned from the cloud and even consider that they may have imagined their whole adventure. The book ends with Ms. Frizzle informing them that they will be studying volcanoes next. The main story is then followed by two pages listing things that happened in the story that &quot;cannot&quot; happen in real life, as well as some trivia such as that the water purification system may completely differ from the one in the story.

==Notes==
* Notably, the book does not portray the kids in the class as having very distinct personalities, although there are some hints that Arnold is more timid than the other students. However, in this book and the earlier books in the series, he appears to be more shy than anything.
* This book features the first instance of Arnold&#x27;s infamous catchphrase from the television series, &quot;I knew I should&#x27;ve stayed home today.&quot; In the book, however, he thinks it rather than saying it aloud.
* All of the books in the series feature &quot;reports&quot; supposedly written by students in the class and this book begins that with ten &quot;water facts&quot; each being presented by a different student. This book and the ones that follow also contain reports written specifically by Dorothy Ann that define new vocabulary words as they crop up in the story. This presumably led to her &quot;know-it-all&quot; personality in the television series.
* In this book, Liz appears to be a normal lizard and she only appears in the scenes taking place in the classroom. In the television series, she became considerably more anthropomorphic and joined the class on most of their field trips.
* The illustration of the waterworks on the book&#x27;s cover does not match the illustrations of the waterworks that appear inside the book, despite both being drawn by Degen. However, in the television adaptation discussed below, the waterworks appear as seen on the book&#x27;s cover.

==Television adaptation==
In the second season of the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; television series, the book was loosely adapted into the episode &quot;Wet All Over,&quot; which featured a far greater amount of plot. In the episode, Arnold and Wanda collect water in the girls&#x27; bathroom and Arnold accidentally leaves Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s key in there and forgets to turn off the water. While the class is on the field trip, Liz comically struggles to try and stop the bathroom from flooding.

Unlike in the book, the class is actually turned into water and the bus journeys with them on their trip through the water cycle. Being and behaving like water, they find themselves trapped in the water cycle and realize the only way they can escape is to get Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s key back. This is when Arnold remembers he left the key in the bathroom and that he forgot to turn off the water. The bus manages to redirect them to the waterworks and they then travel through the pipes to get to the bathroom, where they get the key and are restored to their human forms.

When Arnold and the others get into a pickle jar in the following episode, referencing this episode, he will say &quot;I hope we&#x27;re not back in the water cycle&quot;.

<doc id="290769" wikidata="Q890016" url="?curid=290769" title="List of presidents of India">
<text>The president of India is the head of state of the Republic of India and the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces. The president is referred to as the first citizen of India. Although vested with these powers by the Constitution of India, the position is largely a ceremonial one and executive powers are &quot;de facto&quot; exercised by the prime minister.

The president is elected by the Electoral College composed of elected members of the parliament houses, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and also members of the Saasana Sabha or Vidhan Sabha, the state legislative assemblies. Presidents may remain in office for a tenure of five years, as stated by article 56, part V, of the Constitution of India. In the case where a president&#x27;s term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the vice president assumes office. By article 70 of part V, the parliament may decide how to discharge the functions of the president where this is not possible, or in any other unexpected contingency.

There have been 15 presidents of India since the post was established when India was declared as a republic with the adoption of the Indian constitution in 1950. Apart from these fifteen, three acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. V. V. Giri became the acting president in 1969 after Zakir Husain died in office. Giri was elected president a few months later. He remains the only person to have held office both as a president and acting president. Rajendra Prasad, the first president of India, is the only person to have held office for two terms.

Seven presidents have been members of a political party before being elected. Six of these were active party members of the Indian National Congress. The Janata Party has had one member, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, who later became president. Two presidents, Zakir Husain and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, have died in office. Their vice presidents served as acting presidents until a new president was elected. Following Zakir Husain&#x27;s death, two acting presidents held office until the new president, V. V. Giri, was elected. When Giri resigned to take part in the presidential elections, he was succeeded by Mohammad Hidayatullah as acting president. Pratibha Patil is the first woman to hold the office, elected in 2007.

On 25 July 2022, Droupadi Murmu took office as the president of India, becoming the second woman and the first tribal person to hold the office.

==List==
This list is numbered based on presidents elected after winning an Indian presidential election. The terms of V. V. Giri, Mohammad Hidayatullah and B. D. Jatti, who served as acting president are therefore not numbered or counted as actual terms in office. The president of India does not represent any political party. The colors used in the table indicate the following:

<doc id="290781" wikidata="Q1045344" url="?curid=290781" title="The Learning Company">
<text>The Learning Company (TLC) was an American educational software company founded in 1980 in Palo Alto, California and headquartered in Fremont, California. The company produced a grade-based line of learning software, edutainment games, and productivity tools. Its titles included the flagship series &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot;, for preschoolers through second graders, and &quot;The ClueFinders&quot;, for more advanced students. The company was also known for publishing licensed educational titles featuring characters such as Arthur, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants or Sesame Street.

In December 1995, the company was acquired by SoftKey in a hostile takeover bid, at which point SoftKey assumed the Learning Company name and brand.

== History ==
The Learning Company was founded on May 8, 1980 by Ann McCormick; Leslie Grimm; Teri Perl; and Warren Robinett, a former Atari, Inc. employee who had programmed the game &quot;Adventure&quot;. They saw the Apple II as an opportunity to teach young children concepts of math, reading, science, problem-solving, and thinking skills. Part of the original funding for the company came from a National Science Foundation grant.

TLC produced launch titles for the PCjr, announced in late 1983. From 1980 through 1984, it created a line of 15 widely acclaimed children&#x27;s educational software products, which were sold through the U.S. retail and school computer software channels.

In the first half of 1985, the board hired as CEO Bill Dinsmore. Shortly thereafter, Reece Duca, a founding Partner of the Investment Group of Santa Barbara (IGSB), became a member of the board of directors and purchased shares from several founders and original venture firms. In late 1986, Duca was elected chairman of the board. At that time, IGSB became The Learning Company&#x27;s largest shareholder.

Between March 1985 and September 1995, TLC&#x27;s revenues grew at a 36% compounded rate from $2.4M to $53.2M and profitability increased from breakeven in 1985 to a 20% pre-tax margin. The leading families of products were the &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; series for ages 2–8, the &quot;Treasure Mountain&quot; Reading-Math-Science series for ages 5–9, the &quot;Super Solver&quot; series for ages 7–12, the &quot;Student Writing &amp; Publishing Center&quot; for ages 7-adult, and the &quot;Foreign Language Learning&quot; series for ages 15-adult.

TLC went public on April 28, 1992, in an IPO led by Morgan Stanley and Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co. From 1992 to 1995, TLC achieved 16 consecutive quarters of revenues and profits growth, never experiencing a down quarter or year. TLC&#x27;s early struggles, followed by 10 consecutive years of outstanding performance, were the subject of case studies at both Harvard and Stanford universities.

=== SoftKey acquisition ===

In December 1995, TLC was acquired by SoftKey for $606M in a hostile takeover bid, and a large percentage of the staff was fired. After the acquisition was complete, SoftKey changed its name to The Learning Company and continued to use its brand. The Learning Company née SoftKey was subsequently acquired by Mattel in August 1999.

== Software ==

<text>Educational software is a term used for any computer software that is made for an educational purpose. It encompasses different ranges from language learning software to classroom management software to reference software. The purpose of all this software is to make some part of education more effective and efficient.

==History==

===1946s–1970s===
The use of computer hardware and software in education and training dates to the early 1940s, when American researchers developed flight simulators which used analog computers to generate simulated onboard instrument data. One such system was the type19 synthetic radar trainer, built in 1943. From these early attempts in the WWII era through the mid-1970s, educational software was directly tied to the hardware, on which it ran. Pioneering educational computer systems in this era included the PLATO system (1960), developed at the University of Illinois, and TICCIT (1969). In 1963, IBM had established a partnership with Stanford University&#x27;s Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences (IMSSS), directed by Patrick Suppes, to develop the first comprehensive CAI elementary school curriculum which was implemented on a large scale in schools in both California and Mississippi. In 1967 Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC, now Pearson Education Technologies) was formed to market to schools the materials developed through the IBM partnership. Early terminals that ran educational systems cost over $10,000, putting them out of reach of most institutions. Some programming languages from this period, p3), and LOGO (1967) can also be considered educational, as they were specifically targeted to students and novice computer users. The PLATO IV system, released in 1972, supported many features which later became standard in educational software running on home computers. Its features included bitmap graphics, primitive sound generation, and support for non-keyboard input devices, including the touchscreen.

===1970s–1980s===
The arrival of the personal computer, with the Altair 8800 in 1975, changed the field of software in general, with specific implications for educational software. Whereas users prior to 1975 were dependent upon university or government owned mainframe computers with timesharing, users after this shift could create and use software for computers in homes and schools, computers available for less than $2000. By the early 1980s, the availability of personal computers including the Apple II (1977), Commodore PET (1977), VIC-20 (1980), and Commodore 64 (1982) allowed for the creation of companies and nonprofits which specialized in educational software. Broderbund and The Learning Company are key companies from this period, and MECC, the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium, a key non-profit software developer. These and other companies designed a range of titles for personal computers, with the bulk of the software initially developed for the Apple II.

==Categories of educational software==

===Courseware===
&quot;Courseware&quot; is a term that combines the words &#x27;course&#x27; with &#x27;software&#x27;. It was originally used to describe additional educational material intended as kits for teachers or trainers or as tutorials for students, usually packaged for use with a computer. The term&#x27;s meaning and usage has expanded and can refer to the entire course and any additional material when used in reference an online or &#x27;computer formatted&#x27; classroom. Many companies are using the term to describe the entire &quot;package&quot; consisting of one &#x27;class&#x27; or &#x27;course&#x27; bundled together with the various lessons, tests, and other material needed. The courseware itself can be in different formats: some are only available online, such as Web pages, while others can be downloaded as PDF files or other types of document. Many forms of educational technology are now covered by the term &quot;courseware&quot;. Most leading educational companies solicit or include courseware with their training packages.

===Classroom aids===

Some educational software is designed for use in school classrooms. Typically such software may be projected onto a large whiteboard at the front of the class and/or run simultaneously on a network of desktop computers in a classroom. The most notable are SMART Boards that use SMART Notebook to interact with the board which allows the use of pens to digitally draw on the board. This type of software is often called classroom management software. While teachers often choose to use educational software from other categories in their IT suites (e.g. reference works, children&#x27;s software), a whole category of educational software has grown up specifically intended to assist classroom teaching. &#x27;Wordshark&#x27;, for example, was first released in the mid nineties with multi-sensory games to support students learning to read and spell. Branding has been less strong in this category than in those oriented towards home users. Software titles are often very specialized and produced by various manufacturers, including many established educational book publishers.

===Assessment software===

With the impact of environmental damage and the need for institutions to become &quot;paperless&quot;, more educational institutions are seeking alternative ways of assessment and testing, which has always traditionally been known to use up vasts amount of paper. &quot;Assessment software&quot; refers to software with a primary purpose of assessing and testing students in a virtual environment. Assessment software allows students to complete tests and examinations using a computer, usually networked. The software then scores each test transcript and outputs results for each student. Assessment software is available in various delivery methods, the most popular being self-hosted software, online software and hand-held voting systems. Proprietary software and open-source software systems are available. While technically falling into the &quot;Courseware&quot; category (see above), Skill evaluation lab is an example for Computer-based assessment software with PPA-2 (Plan, Prove, Assess) methodology to create and conduct computer based online examination. Moodle is an example of open-source software with an assessment component that is gaining popularity. QST Online a dedicated complete open source exam/assessment solution is also growing in adoption. Other popular international assessment systems include Google Classroom, Blackboard Learn, EvaluNet and &quot;XT&quot;.

===Reference software===

Many publishers of print dictionaries and encyclopedias have been involved in the production of educational reference software since the mid-1990s. They were joined in the reference software market by both startup companies and established software publishers, most notably Microsoft.

The first commercial reference software products were reformulations of existing content into CD-ROM editions, often supplemented with new multimedia content, including compressed video and sound. More recent products made use of internet technologies, to supplement CD-ROM products, then, more recently, to replace them entirely.

Wikipedia and its offspins (such as Wiktionary) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previously, encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists.

===Custom platforms===
Some manufacturers regarded normal personal computers as an inappropriate platform for learning software for younger children and produced custom child-friendly pieces of hardware instead. The hardware and software is generally combined into a single product, such as a child laptop-lookalike. The laptop keyboard for younger children follows an alphabetic order and the QWERTY order for the older ones. The most well-known example are LeapFrog products. These include imaginatively designed hand-held consoles with a variety of pluggable educational game cartridges and book-like electronic devices into which a variety of electronic books can be loaded. These products are more portable than laptop computers, but have a much more limited range of purposes, concentrating on literacy.

While mainstream operating systems are designed for general usages, and are more or less customized for education only by the application sets added to them, a variety of software manufacturers, especially Linux distributions, have sought to provide integrated platforms for specifically education.

===Corporate training and tertiary education===
Earlier educational software for the important corporate and tertiary education markets was designed to run on a single desktop computer (or an equivalent user device). In the years immediately following 2000, planners decided to switch to server-based applications with a high degree of standardization. This means that educational software runs primarily on servers which may be hundreds or thousands of miles from the actual user. The user only receives tiny pieces of a learning module or test, fed over the internet one by one. The server software decides on what learning material to distribute, collects results and displays progress to teaching staff. Another way of expressing this change is to say that educational software morphed into an online educational service. US Governmental endorsements and approval systems ensured the rapid switch to the new way of managing and distributing learning material. McDonald&#x27;s also experimented with this via the Nintendo DS software &quot;eCrew Development Program&quot;.

===Specific educational purposes===
There are highly specific niche markets for educational software, including:
* teacher tools and classroom management software
(remote control and monitoring software, filetransfer software, document camera and presenter, free tools...)
* Driving test software
* Interactive geometry software
* Language learning software
* Mind Mapping Software which provides a focal point for discussion, helps make classes more interactive, and assists students with studying, essays and projects.
* Designing and printing of card models for use in education - e.g. Designer Castles for BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes platforms
* Note-taking (Comparison of note-taking software)
* Software for enabling simulated dissection of human and animal bodies (used in medical and veterinary college courses)
* Spelling tutor software
* Typing tutors
* Reading Instruction
* Medical and healthcare educational software

=== Video games and gamification ===
Video games can be used to teach a user technology literacy or more about a subject. Some operating systems and mobile phones have these features. A notable example is Microsoft Solitaire, which was developed to familiarize users with the use of graphical user interfaces, especially the mouse and the drag-and-drop technique. &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot; is a largely known program with built in mini-games to keep the user entertained while improving their typing skills.

Gamification is the use of game design elements in nongame contexts and has been shown to be effective in motivating behavior change. By seeing game elements as &quot;motivational affordances,&quot; and formalizing the relationship between these elements and motivational affordances. Classcraft is a software tool used by teachers that has gaming elements alongside an educational goal. Tovertafel is a games console designed for remedial education and counter-acting the effects of dementia.

== Effects and use of educational software ==

=== Tutor-based software ===
Tutor-based education software is defined as software that mimics the teacher student one on one dynamic of tutoring with software in place of a teacher. Research was conducted to see if this type of software would be effective in improving students understanding of material. It concluded that there was a positive impact which decreased the amount of time students need to study for and relative gain of understanding.

=== Helping those with disabilities ===
A study was conducted to see the effects of education software on children with mild disabilities. The results were that the software was a positive impact assisting teaching these children social skills though team based learning and discussion, videos and games.

=== Education software evaluation ===
There is a large market of educational software in use today. A team decided that they were to develop a system in which educational software should be evaluated as there is no current standard. It is called the Construction of the Comprehensive Evaluation of Electronic Learning Tools and Educational Software (CEELTES). The software to be evaluated is graded on a point scale in four categories: the area of technical, technological and user attributes; area of criteria evaluating the information, content and operation of the software; the area of criteria evaluating the information in terms of educational use, learning and recognition; the area of criteria evaluating the psychological and pedagogical use of the software.

=== Use in higher education ===
In university level computer science course, learning logic is an essential part of the curriculum. There is a proposal on using two logistical education tool and LogicChess to understand First Order Logic for university students to better understand the course material and the essentials of logistical design.

<text>The legal system of Canada is pluralist: its foundations lie in the English common law system (inherited from its period as a colony of the British Empire), the French civil law system (inherited from its French Empire past), and Indigenous law systems developed by the various Indigenous Nations.

The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (known as the British North America Act prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy, and the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The &quot;Charter&quot; guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the &quot;Charter&quot; for a period of five years.

Canada&#x27;s judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since December 18, 2017, by Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of Canada. Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where civil law predominates. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. However, in most rural areas and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada. Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council with the duty to consult and accommodate. Indigenous law in Canada refers to the legal traditions, customs, and practices of Indigenous Nations and communities.

==Constitution of Canada==
Pursuant to section 52 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Canada&#x27;s constitution is its supreme law, and any law passed by any federal, provincial, or territorial government that is inconsistent with the constitution is invalid.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; stipulates that Canada&#x27;s constitution includes that act, a series of thirty Acts and orders referred to in a schedule to that Act (the most notable of which is the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), and any amendment to any of those Acts. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has found that this list is not intended to be exhaustive, and in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Reference re Secession of Quebec&quot; identified four &quot;supporting principles and rules&quot; that are included as unwritten elements of the constitution: federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect for minorities. While these principles are an enforceable part of Canada&#x27;s constitution, Canadian courts have not used them to override the written text of the constitution, instead confining their role to &quot;filling gaps&quot;.

Because the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; provides that Canada&#x27;s constitution is &quot;similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom&quot;, which is considered to be an uncodified constitution, the Supreme Court has also recognized the existence of constitutional conventions. In 1981&#x27;s &quot;Reference re a Resolution to amend the Constitution&quot;, the Court provided three factors necessary for the existence of a constitutional convention: a practice or agreement developed by political actors, a recognition that they are bound to follow that practice or agreement, and a purpose for that practice or agreement. It also found that, while these conventions are not law and are therefore unenforceable by the courts, courts may recognize conventions in their rulings.
The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; assigns powers to the provincial and federal governments. Matters under federal jurisdiction include criminal law, trade and commerce, banking, and immigration. The federal government also has the residual power to make laws necessary for Canada&#x27;s &quot;peace, order and good government&quot;. One of the major areas of provincial jurisdiction is property and civil rights, which includes broad power to enact laws of a civil nature, such as property law, contract law and family law. Provincial jurisdiction includes other matters, such as natural resources, hospitals, municipalities, education (except education on First Nation reserves).

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; also provides that, while provinces establish their own superior courts, the federal government appoints their judges. It also gives the federal Parliament the right to establish a court system responsible for federal law and a general court of appeal to hear appeals of decisions of both federal and provincial courts. This last power resulted in the federal Parliament&#x27;s creation of the Supreme Court of Canada.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; created a mechanism by which Canada&#x27;s constitution could be amended by joint action of federal and provincial legislatures; prior to 1982, most of it could be amended only by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It also contains the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which grants individual rights that may not be contravened by any provincial or federal law.

==Legislation==
Acts passed by the Parliament of Canada and by provincial legislatures are the primary sources of law in Canada. Sections 91 and 94A of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; set out the subject matters for exclusive federal jurisdiction. Sections 92, 92A, and 94 set out the areas of exclusive provincial legislation. Section 95 sets out areas of concurrent federal and provincial jurisdiction.

Laws passed by the federal Parliament are initially published in the Canada Gazette, a federal government newspaper published regularly and which includes new statutes and regulations. Federal statutes are subsequently published in the annual Statutes of Canada. From time to time, the federal government will prepare a consolidation of federal statutes, known as the Revised Statutes of Canada. The most recent federal consolidation was in 1985.

Laws passed by the provinces follow a similar practice. The Acts are pronounced in a provincial gazette, published annually and consolidated from time to time.

The Revised Statutes of Canada is the federal statutory consolidation of statutes enacted by the Parliament of Canada. In each Canadian province, there is a similar consolidation of the statute law of the province. The Revised Statutes of British Columbia, Revised Statutes of Alberta, Statutes of Manitoba, Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1978, Revised Statutes of New Brunswick, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, Statutes of Prince Edward Island, Consolidated Statutes of Newfoundland and Labrador, Revised Statutes of Ontario, and Revised Statutes of Quebec are the statutory consolidations of each Canadian province. They contain all of the major topic areas and most of the statutes enacted by the governments in each province. These statutes in these provinces do not include criminal law, as the criminal law in Canada is an exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Parliament, which has enacted the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which is included in the Revised Statutes of Canada.

==Legal traditions==

===Common law===
Nine of the provinces, other than Quebec, and the federal territories, follow the common law legal tradition. While the federal territories use common law, Indigenous nations and their associated territories do not (see below). Equally, courts have power under the provincial &quot;Judicature Acts&quot; to apply equity.

As with all common law countries, Canadian law adheres to the doctrine of . Lower courts must follow the decisions of higher courts by which they are bound. For instance, all Ontario lower courts are bound by the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal and all British Columbia lower courts are bound by the decisions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. However, no Ontario court is bound by decisions of any British Columbia court and no British Columbia court is bound by decisions of any Ontario court. Nonetheless, decisions made by a province&#x27;s highest court (provincial Courts of Appeal) are often considered as &quot;persuasive&quot; even though they are not binding on other provinces.

Only the Supreme Court of Canada has authority to bind all lower courts in the country with a single ruling, but the Supreme Court cannot bind itself. The busier courts, such as the Court of Appeal for Ontario, for example, are often looked to for guidance on many local matters of law outside the province, especially in matters such as evidence and criminal law.

When there is little or no existing Canadian decision on a particular legal issue and it becomes necessary to look to a non-Canadian legal authority for reference, decisions of English courts and American courts are often utilized. In light of the long-standing history between English law and Canadian law, the English Court of Appeal and the House of Lords are often cited as and considered persuasive authority, and are often followed. 

Decisions from Commonwealth nations, aside from England, are also often treated as persuasive sources of law in Canada.

Due to Canada&#x27;s historical connection with the United Kingdom, decisions of the House of Lords before 1867 are technically still binding on Canada unless they have been overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada, and Canada is still bound by the decisions of the Privy Council before the abolishment of appeals to that entity in 1949. In practice, however, no court in Canada has declared itself bound by any English court decision for decades, and it is highly unlikely that any Canadian court would do so in the future.

Criminal offences are found only within the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and other federal statutes; an exception is that contempt of court is the only remaining common law offence in Canada.

===Civil law===
For historical reasons, Quebec has a hybrid legal system. Private law follows the civil law tradition, originally expressed in the &quot;Coutume de Paris&quot; as it applied in what was then New France. Today, the of Quebec is codified in the Civil Code of Quebec. As for public law, it was made that of the conquering British nation after the fall of New France in 1760, that is, the common law. It is important to note that the distinction between civil law and common law is not based on the division of powers set out in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Therefore, legislation enacted by the provincial legislature in matters of public law, such as the Code of Penal Procedure, should be interpreted following the common law tradition. Likewise, legislation enacted by the federal Parliament in matters of private law, such as the &quot;Divorce Act&quot;, is to be interpreted following the civil law tradition and in harmony with the Civil Code of Quebec.

===Indigenous legal traditions===

Canada was founded on the original territories of over 900 different Indigenous groups, each using different Indigenous legal traditions. Cree, Blackfoot, Mi&#x27;kmaq and numerous other First Nations; Inuit; and Métis will apply their own legal traditions in daily life, creating contracts, working with governmental and corporate entities, ecological management and criminal proceedings and family law. Most maintain their laws through traditional governance alongside the elected officials and federal laws. The legal precedents set millennia ago are known through stories and derived from the actions and past responses as well as through continuous interpretation by elders and law-keepers—the same process by which nearly all legal traditions, from common laws and civil codes, are formed.

While the many legal traditions appear similar in that none were codified, each has quite different sets of laws. Many laws stem from stories which in turn may stem from writings or markings, such as geographic features, petroglyphs, pictographs, wiigwaasabakoon and more. Inuit Nunangat&#x27;s governance differs quite markedly from its many-nationed neighbour Denendeh, as Denendeh&#x27;s diverse Dene Laws differ quite markedly from laws governing Lingít Aaní, Gitx̱san Lax̱yip or Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en Yin&#x27;tah; and, as those differ from Haudenosaunee&#x27;s, Eeyou-Istchee&#x27;s or Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki&#x27;s. One thing most Indigenous legal and governance traditions have in common is their use of clans such as Anishinaabek&#x27;s doodeman (though most are matrilineal like Gitx̱san&#x27;s Wilps).

==Areas of law==

===Aboriginal law===

Aboriginal law is the area of law related to the Canadian Government&#x27;s relationship with its Indigenous peoples (First Nations, Métis and Inuit). Section 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to Aboriginals, which includes groups governed by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, different Numbered Treaties and outside of those Acts.

===Administrative law===

Canadian administrative law is the body of law that addresses the actions and operations of governments and governmental agencies.

===Contract law===

Individual provinces have codified some principles of contract law in a &quot;Sale of Goods Act&quot;, which was modeled on early English versions. Outside of Quebec, most contract law is still common law, based on the rulings of judges in contract litigation over the years. Quebec, being a civil law jurisdiction, does not have contract law, but rather has its own law of obligations.

===Constitutional law===

Constitutional law is the area of Canadian law relating to the interpretation and application of the Constitution of Canada by the Courts. This is represented in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; and &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

===Copyright law===

Copyright law of Canada governs the legally enforceable rights to creative and artistic works under the laws of Canada.

===Criminal law===
Criminal law in Canada falls under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. The power to enact criminal law is derived from section 91(27) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Most criminal laws have been codified in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, as well as the &quot;Controlled Drugs and Substances Act&quot;, &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;, and several other peripheral Acts.

The provinces are responsible for the administration of justice, including criminal trials within their respective provinces, despite their inability to enact criminal laws. Provinces do have the power to promulgate quasi-criminal or regulatory offences in a variety of administrative and other areas, and every province has done so with myriad rules and regulations across a broad spectrum.

===Evidence law===

The &quot;Canada Evidence Act&quot; is an Act of the Parliament of Canada, first passed in 1893, that regulates the rules of evidence in court proceedings under federal law. Each province also has its own evidence statute, governing the law of evidence in civil proceedings in the province.

===Family law===

Family law in Canada concerns the body of Canadian law dealing with family relationship, marriage, and divorce. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the substance of marriage and divorce. Provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the procedures surrounding marriage. Provinces also have laws dealing with marital property and with family maintenance (including spousal support).

===Human rights law===

Human rights are constitutionally protected by the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which applies to the federal and provincial governments and protects the rights of individuals in relation to government action. The Charter protects fundamental freedoms such as freedom of religion, freedom of association, and freedom of expression, as well as prohibiting discrimination on personal characteristics.

Human rights are also protected by federal and provincial statutes, which apply to governments as well as to the private sector. Human rights laws generally prohibit discrimination on personal characteristics in housing, employment, and services to the public. The &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot; applies to the federal government and to industries under federal jurisdiction, such as aviation and banking. Provincial human rights laws apply to the provincial governments and to industries and businesses under provincial jurisdiction.

===Immigration and refugee law===

Canadian immigration and refugee law concerns the area of law related to the admission of foreign nationals into Canada, their rights and responsibilities once admitted, and the conditions of their removal. The primary law on these matters is in the &quot;Immigration and Refugee Protection Act&quot;.

===Inheritance law===

Inheritance law in Canada is constitutionally a provincial matter. Therefore, the laws governing inheritance in Canada are legislated by each individual province.

===Insolvency law===

The Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate matters relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, by virtue of s.91 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. It has passed some statutes as a result, i.e., The &quot;Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act&quot; (&quot;BIA&quot;) and the &quot;Winding-Up and Restructuring Act&quot; (which essentially applies only to financial institutions under federal jurisdiction).
In applying these statutes, provincial law has important consequences. Section 67(1)(b) of the BIA provides that &quot;any property that as against the bankrupt is exempt from execution or seizure under any laws applicable in the province within which the property is situated and within which the bankrupt resides&quot; is not divisible among their creditors. Provincial legislation under the property and civil rights power of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; regulates the resolution of financial difficulties that occur before the onset of insolvency.

===Labour and employment law===

Canadian labour law is that body of law which regulates the rights, restrictions obligations of trade unions, workers and employers in Canada. Canadian employment law is that body of law which regulates the rights, restrictions obligations of non-unionised workers and employers in Canada. Most labour regulation in Canada is conducted at the provincial level by government agencies and boards. However, certain industries under federal regulation are subject solely to federal labour legislation and standards.

===Patent law===

Canadian patent law is the legal system regulating the granting of patents for inventions within Canada, and the enforcement of these rights in Canada.

===Procedural law===
The functioning of the Courts is regulated by the laws of civil procedure which are codified in each province&#x27;s civil procedures rules.

===Property law===

Property law in Canada is the body of law concerning the rights of individuals over land, objects, and expression within Canada. It encompasses personal property, real property, and intellectual property.

===Tort law===

Tort law in Canada concerns the treatment of the law of torts within the Canadian jurisdiction excluding Quebec, which is covered by the law of obligations.
===Trademark law===

Canada&#x27;s trademark law provides protection for distinctive marks, certification marks, distinguishing guises, and proposed marks against those who appropriate the goodwill of the mark or create confusion between different vendors&#x27; goods or services.

==Judicial system==
Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, the federal Parliament and the provincial legislatures both have the constitutional authority to create courts: Parliament under s. 101, and the Provinces under s. 92(14). However, the federal power to create courts is much more limited than the provincial power. The provincial courts have a much more extensive jurisdiction, including the constitutionally entrenched power to determine constitutional issues.

Through Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, Indigenous nations retain significant rights and title. It, however, remains unclear the degree to which Indigenous nations have authority over judicial matters. Especially since 1995, the Government of Canada has maintained a policy of recognizing the inherent right of self-governance under section 35. The evolution through cases such as &quot;Delgamuukw-Gisday&#x27;wa&quot; and the &quot;Tsilhqot&#x27;in Nation v British Columbia&quot; has affirmed the Euro-Canadian courts&#x27; needs to meaningfully engage with Indigenous legal systems, including through Indigenous structures of dispute resolution.

The Supreme Court of Canada () is the highest court of Canada and is the final court of appeal in the Canadian justice system. Parliament created it by Act of Parliament in 1875, as a &quot;general court of appeal for Canada&quot;. Prior to 1949, cases could be appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom, and some cases bypassed the Supreme Court of Canada entirely.

Other than the Supreme Court, the Canadian court system is divided into two classes of courts: superior courts of general jurisdiction, and courts of limited jurisdiction, sometimes referred to as inferior courts. The superior courts, created and maintained by the provinces, are divided into superior courts of original jurisdiction and superior courts of appeal. These courts are sometimes also referred to as &quot;Section 96&quot; courts, in reference to s. 96 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which grants the federal government the power to appoint the judges of these courts. As courts of general jurisdiction, the provincial superior courts of original jurisdiction have jurisdiction over all matters, under both federal and provincial law, unless the matter has been assigned to some other court or administrative agency by a statute passed by the appropriate legislative body. The superior courts of original jurisdiction have an extensive civil jurisdiction, under both federal and provincial laws. Under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, a federal statute, they have jurisdiction over the most serious criminal offences, such as murder. They also hear appeals from the Provincial Courts in criminal matters and some civil matters. A further appeal normally lies to superior court of appeal, the highest court in each province.

The provinces also can establish courts of limited jurisdiction, whose jurisdiction is limited solely to what is included in the statutory grant of jurisdiction. These courts are often called &quot;Provincial Courts&quot;, even though the superior courts established by the provinces are also provincial courts. The Provincial Courts have an extensive criminal jurisdiction under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, a federal statute, and also typically have a limited civil jurisdiction in matters under provincial jurisdiction, such as small claims and some family matters. The judges of the Provincial Courts are appointed by the provincial governments.

There are also additional federal courts established by Parliament, which have a specialised jurisdiction in certain areas of federal law. These courts are the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Tax Court of Canada, and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada.

<text>A nephelometer or aerosol photometer is an instrument for measuring the concentration of suspended particulates in a liquid or gas colloid. A nephelometer measures suspended particulates by employing a light beam (source beam) and a light detector set to one side (often 90°) of the source beam. Particle density is then a function of the light reflected into the detector from the particles. To some extent, how much light reflects for a given density of particles is dependent upon properties of the particles such as their shape, color, and reflectivity. Nephelometers are calibrated to a known particulate, then use environmental factors (k-factors) to compensate lighter or darker colored dusts accordingly. K-factor is determined by the user by running the nephelometer next to an air sampling pump and comparing results. There are a wide variety of research-grade nephelometers on the market as well as open source varieties.

==Nephelometer uses==


The main uses of nephelometers relate to air quality measurement for pollution monitoring, climate monitoring, and visibility. Airborne particles are commonly either biological contaminants, particulate contaminants, gaseous contaminants, or dust.

The accompanying chart shows the types and sizes of various particulate contaminants. This information helps understand the character of particulate pollution inside a building or in the ambient air, as well as the cleanliness level in a controlled environment.

Biological contaminants include mold, fungus, bacteria, viruses, animal dander, dust mites, pollen, human skin cells, cockroach parts, or anything alive or living at one time. They are the biggest enemy of indoor air quality specialists because they are contaminants that cause health problems. Levels of biological contamination depend on humidity and temperature that supports the livelihood of micro-organisms. The presence of pets, plants, rodents, and insects will raise the level of biological contamination.

=== Sheath air ===
Sheath air is clean filtered air that surrounds the aerosol stream to prevent particulates from circulating or depositing within the optic chamber. Sheath air prevents contamination caused by build-up and deposits, improves response time by containing the sample, and improves maintenance by keeping the optic chamber clean. The nephelometer creates the sheath air by passing air through a zero filter before beginning the sample.

=== Global radiation balance ===

Nephelometers are also used in global warming studies, specifically measuring the global radiation balance. Three wavelength nephelometers fitted with a backscatter shutter can determine the amount of solar radiation that is reflected back into space by dust and particulate matter. This reflected light influences the amount of radiation reaching the earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere and warming the planet.

=== Visibility ===
Nephelometers are also used for measurement of visibility with simple one-wavelength nephelometers used throughout the world by many EPAs. Nephelometers, through the measurement of light scattering, can determine visibility in distance through the application of a conversion factor called Koschmieder&#x27;s formula.

===Medicine===

In medicine, nephelometry is used to measure immune function. It is also used in clinical microbiology, for preparation of a standardized inoculum (McFarland suspension) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

===Fire detection===

Gas-phase nephelometers are also used in the detection of smoke and other particles of combustion. In such use, the apparatus is referred to as an aspirated smoke detector. These have the capability to detect extremely low particle concentrations (to 0.005%) and are therefore highly suitable to protecting sensitive or valuable electronic equipment, such as mainframe computers and telephone switches.

==Turbidity units==

*Because optical properties depend on suspended particle size, a stable synthetic material called &quot;Formazin&quot; with uniform particle size is often used as a standard for calibration and reproducibility. The unit is called Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU).
*Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) specified by United States Environmental Protection Agency is a special case of FTU, where a white light source and certain geometrical properties of the measurement apparatus are specified. (Sometimes the alternate form &quot;nephelos turbidity units&quot; is used)
*Formazin Nephelometric Units (FNU), prescribed for 9 measurements of turbidity in water treatment by ISO 7027, another special case of FTU with near infrared light (NIR) and 90° scatter.
*Formazin Attenuation Units (FAU) specified by ISO 7027 for water treatment standards for turbidity measurements at 0°, also a special case of FTU.
*Formazin Backscatter Units (FBU), not part of a standard, is the unit of optical backscatter detectors (OBS), measured at c. 180°, also a special case of FTU.
*European Brewery Convention (EBC) turbidity units
*Concentration Units (C.U.)
*Optical Density (O.D.)
*Jackson &quot;Candle&quot; Turbidity Units (JTU; an early measure)
*Helms Units
*American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC-FTU) turbidity units
*Brantner Haze Scale (BHS) and Brantner Haze Units (BHU) for purposefully hazy beer
*Parts Per Million of standard substance, such as PPM/DE (Kieselguhr)
*&quot;Trübungseinheit/Formazin&quot; (TE/F) a German standard, now replaced by the FNU unit.
*diatomaceous earth (&quot;ppm SiO2&quot;) an older standard, now obsolete

A more popular term for this instrument in water quality testing is a turbidimeter. However, there can be differences between models of turbidimeters, depending upon the arrangement (geometry) of the source beam and the detector. A nephelometric turbidimeter always monitors light reflected off the particles and not attenuation due to cloudiness. In the United States environmental monitoring the turbidity standard unit is called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU), while the international standard unit is called Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU). The most generally applicable unit is Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU), although different measurement methods can give quite different values as reported in FTU (see below).

Gas-phase nephelometers are also used to study the atmosphere. These can provide information on visibility and atmospheric albedo.

<doc id="290803" wikidata="Q238594" url="?curid=290803" title="Jill Kelly (actress)">
<text>Jill Kelly (born February 1, 1971) is an American pornographic actress, director and producer. Kelly is an AVN Hall of Fame inductee.

== Career ==
Kelly&#x27;s stage name was derived from the names of the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; characters portrayed by Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith. She started out as a stripper at the Babydolls adult entertainment theater in her hometown, first performing at the age of 15 with false identification. After she broke up with her then-boyfriend, he informed the club of her true age, which caused them to fire her. When Kelly turned 18 she returned to the club, commenting that &quot;they didn&#x27;t even recognize me.&quot;

She later did live sex shows with Tiffany Million at the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre in San Francisco.

===Mainstream appearances===
Kelly has appeared in over 50 B movies, including &quot;The Legend of the Roller Blade Seven&quot;, &quot;Toad Warriors&quot;, and &quot;Big Sister 2000&quot;. In the spring of 1998, she appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;He Got Game&quot;.

===Other ventures===
Kelly started her own company, Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), in October 1998. In April 2005, following the company&#x27;s bankruptcy filing, &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine paid $1.765 million to acquire its assets, which included the entire JKP back catalogue and nearly 60 unreleased features.

==Personal life==
A native of Southern California, Kelly was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Pomona. She &quot;married&quot; porn actor Cal Jammer, whom she met at a CES convention in Las Vegas in 1993. They were married a month later. Jammer introduced her to the world of adult movies and her career was launched. However, she separated from him due to his infidelities off-camera, which she called &quot;the deal breaker&quot;. Jammer died by suicide, shooting himself.

On May 6, 2000, she married adult star Julian Andretti, but the couple were divorced by the end of 2001. She then was married for a third time, to porn actor/producer/director Corey Jordan on September 20, 2003. This marriage would not last, either, and the couple parted ways a year later only to finalize their divorce in October 2004.

Kelly also had an off-screen relationship with her fellow female colleague P.J. Sparxx in the mid-&#x27;90s. The pair would tour together and dance on stage as part of a dance duo act called &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot;. They also released a porn feature film of the dance act called &quot;Fire &amp; Ice: Caught In The Act&quot;. Kelly and Sparxx elucidated on their relationship in the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; documentary series &quot;Sex Under Hot Lights&quot;. Sparxx posited that she and Kelly had similar sexual personalities. Kelly stated that Sparxx had supported her following her husband&#x27;s suicide in January 1995. Sparxx and Kelly claimed to be exclusively involved in terms of women, but were in an open relationship in regards to other men, with Kelly claiming she was also involved with a boyfriend at the time.

Kelly identifies as bisexual.

<text>The low-frequency effects (LFE) channel is a band-limited audio track that is used for reproducing deep and intense low-frequency sounds in the 3–120 Hz frequency range. 

This track is normally sent to a subwoofer—a loudspeaker designed to reproduce very low frequencies. LFE channels originated in Dolby Stereo 70 mm film, but in the 1990s and 2000s they became common in home theater systems in order to reproduce film soundtracks found on DVDs and Blu-ray discs.

== Types ==

=== Low-pitched musical arts ===
LFEs include both low-pitched musical notes and low-pitched sound effects. The musical soundtrack for many films includes bass instruments that produce very low notes. Until the 1970s, most of the low-pitched instruments were natural, acoustic instruments, such as the double bass or the pipe organ&#x27;s pedal keyboard. After the 1980s, film scores increasingly used synthesized instruments, including synth bass keyboards, which incorporated very low-pitched notes.

=== Sound effects ===
The most challenging sounds to reproduce from a sound engineering standpoint are usually the extremely low-pitched sound effects in the 20 Hz range, such as those used to simulate the sound of an explosion, earthquake, a rocket launch, or submarine depth charges. The human ear is not very sensitive to sounds at these low frequencies, so it takes a tremendous amount of amplification for the human ear to hear them. Further, sounds at these frequencies are more felt in the body, rather than heard. As well, since they are sound effects, they may have a longer duration or sustain than many low-pitched musical notes, which makes them harder to reproduce accurately.

It is a formidable challenge for an amplifier, subwoofer speakers, and cabinet to reproduce these sound effects at a high volume without encountering problems such as power amplifier clipping (distortion), unwanted rattle or resonance in the wooden cabinet, or excessive &quot;chuffing&quot; sounds from the bass reflex vent (if a vent or port is used in the cabinet). Sound recording magazines sometimes use the loud, rumbling sound effects simulating the sound of the submarine depth charges which were used in the World War II film &quot;U-571&quot; (2000) to test the accuracy of subwoofer systems.

== Development ==

The LFE channel originated in Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track film prints, as a way of providing louder bass and sub-bass effects, without detracting from the quality of the standard audio channels. The LFE channel is conventionally played back 10 dB louder than the main channels, giving significantly more recording headroom. Also, the separate recording allowed a straightforward installation of extra dedicated subwoofers, and removed the need to upgrade the main speakers.

Later formats such as Dolby Digital retained the LFE channel, although this is more through convention and backwards compatibility than necessity, as digital formats have greater dynamic range than the magnetic analogue recordings on 70 mm prints, and modern sound processors have a bass management system to redirect bass from all channels to a subwoofer.

== Home theater systems ==

In the 1990s surround sound home theater systems became available to enhance the experience of viewing DVD and Blu-ray films. Prior to the advent of home theater systems, when VCRs were used, the enhanced sound option was stereo high-fidelity sound or Dolby Pro Logic for Dolby Surround-encoded tapes. With home theater systems, a multichannel audio system was used to deliver different sounds to six or more different speakers. The widely used 5.1-channel audio system consists of five full-range main (Left, Center, Right, Left rear Surround, and Right rear Surround) plus a Low-Frequency Effects (LFE) channel. Many typical home theater systems, especially home theater in a box systems, are incapable of accurately reproducing LFE in the 20 Hz range.

The LFE channel delivers bass-only information to supplement the overall bass content. The LFE channel content is not the same as the content of a subwoofer-out jack. The LFE channel is used to carry additional bass information in the surround sound programming, while the subwoofer output is bass information from up to all six channels that has been selected to be reproduced by the subwoofer via a bass management system.

The bass management in surround sound replay systems is that bass content in the incoming signal, irrespective of channel, should be directed only to loudspeakers capable of handling it. The bass management system may direct bass to one or more subwoofers (if present) from any channel, not simply the content of the LFE channel.

== Bass Shaker ==

The LFE channel can be output to one or more tactile transducers, also known as &quot;bass shakers&quot;. When connected to the subwoofer output, the bass shaker will vibrate at the frequency of the bass, usually between 20 and 200 Hz, without producing much audible sound. Tactile transducers are frequently mounted directly to the frame of a chair or sofa. A listener&#x27;s body can feel the vibrations from the LFE, enhancing the overall sensation of the bass.

<text>Hermes Davide Fastino Croatto Martinis (2 March 1940 – 3 April 2005), better known as Tony Croatto, was an Italian singer and composer best known for his interpretations of Spanish folkloric songs and music from Puerto Rico. His musical career began as part of the sibling musical group, Los TNT, with his siblings Nelly and Tim. He was also a television presenter.

== Early life and career ==
Hermes Davide Fastino Croatto Martinis was born on 2 March 1940 in Attimis, a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Udine, Italy. His family moved to the border town of La Paz, Uruguay, when he was nine years old. While being raised as a carpenter, lumberjack and farmer, music was very much a part of his household. In 1959, at 19, he and his siblings Edelweiss (&quot;Tim&quot;) and Argentina (&quot;Nelly&quot;) formed the pop group Los TNT. The group came about at Nelly&#x27;s insistence, who adamantly wanted to become a singer. Their mother, who frowned upon the idea of Nelly touring solo at the age of 15, would only allow her to sing in public with her brothers in a group, as a back-up plan. The group eventually developed a very strong following, first in Uruguay, then Argentina and Spain, where Los TNT moved as their popularity soared.

=== The TNT Years ===

Los TNT were renowned for their vocal harmonies, their onstage chemistry and Nelly&#x27;s voice and magnetic personality. At the time, Tony stated once, he was happy with just singing background and playing guitar, claiming he was rather shy. Eventually, he developed a strong stage presence, which allowed him to occasionally take over vocal duties.

In 1960, Los TNT recorded the song &quot;Eso, eso, eso&quot;, written by tango composers Virgilio and Homero Expósito, for RCA Records, which sold more than 100,000 copies in Argentina alone. They were part of the first broadcast of the country&#x27;s television station, Canal 9; their personal appearances were solidly attended, and their popularity ensured the success of a media campaign they did for the Argentinian brewer, Cerveza Quilmes. The group was also popular in Venezuela, Colombia, Perú, Chile and Mexico, where they eventually toured. Their LP records for RCA-Victor were fast-sellers all over Latin America. They even appeared in the 1962 film, &quot;Fiebre de Juventud&quot;, along Mexican pop idol, Enrique Guzmán.

After attaining some success in Spain, Los TNT moved there in 1963. They went as far as representing the country in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 in Copenhagen, billed as &quot;Nelly, Tim and Tony&quot;. Tony stated once that the group was handpicked by the powers behind the Spanish state television TVE to substitute that year&#x27;s winners in the Spanish classification round, Michel and Teresa María, who were popular Spanish singers of the time. TVE toned down their normally dynamic act for the contest, in which they sang what was originally a slow ballad, &quot;Caracola&quot; (written by Spanish songwriter Fina de Calderón). Tony and his siblings suspected that this was a disaster waiting to happen. Disappointed by their twelfth-place finish in the competition, and the subsequent reaction in Spain, their willingness to tour and record there diminished with time. They moved back to Argentina in 1965, only for Tim to eventually leave the group the following year; he returned to his native Italy to become a concert promoter.

== Move to Puerto Rico ==
After Tim&#x27;s departure from Los TNT, Nelly and Tony became a duo. In 1968, after travelling across South America and spending two years in Venezuela, Tony moved to what would eventually become his adoptive homeland, Puerto Rico, when &quot;Nelly y Tony&quot; were hired by Puerto Rican promoter Alfred D. Herger to appear on his popular youth television shows. &quot;Nelly y Tony&quot; would perform together until 1974, when Nelly married a Puerto Rican surgeon. She retired from pop music and eventually moved to the United States.

While performing with his sister Nelly in New York City&#x27;s Teatro Puerto Rico in 1973, Tony was introduced to New York-bred and Puerto Rico-born vocalist Roberto Tirado who suggested that he compose a hit song for the latter&#x27;s idol Lucecita Benítez, who was going through hard times in her career. Tony obliged, and with poet David Ortiz, wrote her number one career-refreshing hit, &quot;Soy De Una Raza Pura&quot; which would be the only song that Lucecita Benítez would claim as her opening song for many years later on.

While he was almost as successful in Puerto Rico singing pop tunes with his sister as he was in other countries, Tony Croatto was very much impressed by Puerto Rican jíbaro singers, who could improvise décimas on the spot, something that reminded him of the payadores of Uruguay and Argentina he used to listen to when he was growing up. He also found a richness in musical traditions in Puerto Rico that, he claimed, was extremely rare elsewhere in Latin America. He started singing Puerto Rican folk songs with Nelly, and noticed that their pop treatment of these songs was far more in demand that the pop material they would normally sing together. He was also well impressed by the Puerto Rican people, who — he claimed — treated him better on his first night on the island than what he had experienced touring extensively in a country or two. That, and various personal reasons, persuaded him to stay in Puerto Rico for good; he even went as far as saying he was a &quot;born-again Puerto Rican.&quot;

=== Haciendo Punto en Otro Son ===
Croatto formed the nueva trova musical group, Haciendo Punto en Otro Son, particularly famous for its protest songs. He recruited Puerto Rican singers Silverio Pérez, Josy Latorre, Irvin García, and Nano Cabrera. Pérez&#x27;s strength was in jíbaro music, Latorre was a classically trained singer, Cabrera was a rocker and García was also a strong salsa percussionist and singer, but Croatto&#x27;s vast experience with pop music made all the difference in the group&#x27;s success. Croatto was instrumental in both the musical and technical aspects of the group, not only as singer, guitarist and keyboardist, but also as arranger, producer and studio technician. He founded a record label at the time, named &quot;Artomax&quot;, which was financed by Chucho Avellanet and producer Tomás Figueroa.

=== &quot;Desde Mi Pueblo&quot; ===
Parallel to his singing career, Croatto also became a television presenter on &quot;Desde Mi Pueblo&quot;, a weekly documentary/variety show that aired weekly on WIPR-TV. His co-hosts were comedian Luis Antonio Rivera &quot;Yoyo Boing&quot;, Miss Universe 1985 Deborah Carthy Deu and María Falcón. The program&#x27;s concept involved traveling to a different municipality of Puerto Rico every week and highlighting all cultural aspects found in each town. Given the fact that Puerto Rico has 78 municipalities, there was enough material to showcase and research over the program&#x27;s six-year run. Carthy has stated that Croatto was genuinely interested in researching each program carefully, and became far more knowledgeable about Puerto Rican culture than most of the program&#x27;s producers, co-hosts and film crew.

Because of his background as a farmer, Croatto was very much interested in local agricultural issues; he jumped at trying local folklore, particularly jíbaro music, bomba and plena variations that were unique to each town or region, &quot;sometimes fearlessly&quot;, said Rivera once. In 1983, Croatto had also a similar show on Telemundo called &quot;Tony Croatto y Tu Pueblo&quot;.

== Solo career ==
His first solo record, featuring both synthesizers and Puerto Rican folk instruments, was well received by the public at large. Since then, he was well regarded for his interpretations of Puerto Rican folk music, which spanned over thirty albums.

Croatto worked in Puerto Rico by remaking old Puerto Rican standards such as the plena standard &quot;La Máquina&quot; and a medley of plenas by César Concepción, both rearranged as pop songs. He made also an adaptation of &quot;El Cocuy Que Alumbra&quot; from the Venezuelan parranda band Un Solo Pueblo, which was renamed &quot;A Correr Sabana&quot; once set to new lyrics written by salsa composer Tite Curet Alonso. Curet and Croatto wrote an original song named &quot;Cucubano&quot;, which was covered by the Puerto Rican boy band, Menudo.

In 1985, Croatto recorded &quot;El Niñito Jesús&quot; (also known as &quot;Se Llama Jesús&quot;), released during the Christmas season, which told about a poor and hungry child, named Jesús (a thinly-veiled reference to the Christ child), with wornout pants and no shoes, who walked into a house of well-doers begging for attention, while the people in the household rejected him, first euphemistically, then rather openly.

Croatto recorded musical versions of poems and lullabies written by Georgina Lázaro, a Puerto Rican poet whose works were mostly intended for children.

== Personal life ==
Tony Croatto was married three times. His first marriage was to Argentine-born telenovela actress Raquel Montero; he had two children with her, telenovela actress Mara and musician Alejandro Croatto, both born in Venezuela; the four moved to Puerto Rico when Croatto&#x27;s career took off. After Croatto divorced Montero, his second marriage was to married former singer and actress Gloria Esther Viera Pantojas (&quot;Glorivee&quot;) in 1979; the couple had a son, musician and singer, Hermes Gabriel Croatto Viera. Croatto eventually divorced Glorivee and his third marriage was to Lillian Arroyo; they both moved to Carolina, Puerto Rico where they spent his later years.

Croatto identified himself as a Roman Catholic, although he could not fully participate in church given his status as a divorced man. In part, as a way to compensate for this and contribute to his faith, he wrote a jíbaro mass, which gave him one of his latter hits, &quot;Creo en Dios&quot;.

In 2000, then-San Juan Mayor Sila María Calderón proclaimed him as San Juan&#x27;s adoptive son.

== Illness and death ==
Tony Croatto, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer in March 2005. He initially refused medical treatment, opting for natural treatments instead, expecting his health to eventually improve. Croatto dictated a letter that was published in local papers to publicly notify his illness and expressing gratitude to the people of Puerto Rico who adopted him as son and patriot.

After requesting to be released from the hospital to spend his last days with his family, Croatto died on 3 April 2005, three weeks after his public letter. His fellow former Haciendo Punto bandmates had staged a benefit concert for him the night prior, which was filmed for home video release. As a gift from the band to Croatto, the concert&#x27;s production provided Croatto a live audio feed to what would become his deathbed; it&#x27;s been stated that Croatto smiled when the band requested a standing ovation from the audience for him, just before losing consciousness for the last time. He was given a state funeral, held at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, where thousands paid their respects and later accompanied the funeral procession to his final resting place in the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in the Old San Juan.

== Legacy ==
A biographical documentary of the life of Tony Croatto titled &quot;Croatto: La Huella de un Emigrante&quot; was released on 10 November 2016, written by Silverio Pérez and directed by Mariem Pérez Riera. It features archival footage of Croatto and interviews with his children, Hermes, Mara and Alejandro, Chucho Avellanet, Alfred D. Herger and Silverio Pérez.

<text>A professional is a member of a profession or any person who works in a specified professional activity. The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession. In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations. Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, such as the IEEE. Some definitions of &quot;professional&quot; limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society.

In some cultures, the term is used as shorthand to describe a particular social stratum of well-educated workers who enjoy considerable work autonomy and who are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work.

==Trades==
In narrow usage, not all expertise is considered a profession. Occupations such as skilled construction and maintenance work are more generally thought of as trades or crafts. The completion of an apprenticeship is generally associated with skilled labour, or trades such as carpenter, electrician, mason, painter, plumber and other similar occupations.

==Etymology==
The etymology and historical meaning of the term professional is from Middle English, from &quot;profes&quot;, adjective, having professed one&#x27;s vows, from Anglo-French, from Late Latin &quot;professus&quot;, from Latin, past participle of &quot;profitēri&quot; to profess, confess, from pro- before + &quot;fatēri&quot; to acknowledge; in other senses, from Latin &quot;professus&quot;, past participle. Thus, as people became more and more specialized in their trade, they began to &#x27;profess&#x27; their skill to others, and &#x27;vow&#x27; to perform their trade to the highest known standard. With a reputation to uphold, trusted workers of a society who have a specific trade are considered professionals. Ironically, the usage of the word &#x27;profess&#x27; declined from the late 1800s to the 1950s, just as the term &#x27;professional&#x27; was gaining popularity from 1900 to 2010. Notably, in American English the rise in popularity of the term &#x27;professional&#x27; started at the beginning of the 20th century whereas in British English it started in the 1930s and grew fastest in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Guilds and licensing practices ==
The notion of a professional can be traced to medieval European guilds, most of which died off by the middle of the nineteenth century, except the scholars guild or university.

With most guilds formally abolished outside of the realm of academia, establishing exclusivity and standards in a trade (i.e. the successful professionalization of a trade) had to be achieved via other means such as licensing practices, of which might begin as an informal process established by voluntary professional associations, but then eventually become law due to lobbying efforts. Paralleling or soon after the fall of guilds, professional associations began to form in Britain and the US. In the US, several interested parties sought to emulate the model of apprenticeship that European guilds of the Middle Ages had honed to achieve their ends of establishing exclusivity in trades as well as the English concept of a gentleman which had come to be associated with higher income and craftsmanship. Examples are the Lazzaroni who lobbied to create the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and professional associations who lobbied to create the American Medical Association (AMA). According to Miller et al., &quot;Lazzaroni opposed reforms for no apparent reason other than that scientists outside of their tight-knit group proposed them.&quot;. In his seminal work &quot;The Transformation of American Medicine&quot; (1982) Paul Starr argues that a significant motivation in the development of the AMA was to gain authority over unlicensed practitioners to minimize competition among medical practitioners, thereby enhancing the earning power and prestige of medical professionals. The licensing process Starr argues, was unnecessarily prolonged and the costs were artificially enhanced with the specific aim of deterring potential practitioners from entering the field. In his book, &quot;The Early Development of Medical Licensing Laws in the United States, 1875–1900&quot;, Ronald Hamowy wrote:&quot;The American Medical Association (AMA) was established as a permanent national organization at Philadelphia in 1847 at a convention attended by some 230 delegates representing more than forty medical societies and twenty-eight schools. From its inception, one of its primary aims was upgrading medical education and a concomitant reduction in the number of physicians. Its committee on raising medical standards reported at its first meeting that &quot;the large number of Medical Colleges throughout the country, and the facility with which the degree is obtained, have exerted a most pernicious influence&quot; on the profession. With the object of alleviating this situation, recommendations were carried out calling for a specified minimum preliminary education as a prerequisite for admission to a medical college, a lengthening of the period of study for graduation from a medical school, including compulsory clinical instruction at a hospital before the issuance of a diploma, and professional participation in some licensing scheme for physicians. Indeed, the issue of education was considered so important by the AMA that one of its first acts was the establishment of a Committee on Medical Education...&quot;

 As technology progressed throughout the twentieth century, the successful professionalization of a given field was increasingly made possible through the idea of specialization.

As was the case with guilds who claimed to establish exclusivity in a trade in the name of serving the public good, there are often subtle dichotomies present in the idea of professionalizing a field, whether in the name of serving some notion of the public good or as a result of specialization. For example, while defenders of guilds have argued that they allowed markets to function by ensuring quality standards, Sheilagh Ogilvie had instead argued that markets of the Middle Ages flourished when guilds were abolished and that there is much evidence to support the notion that individuals prefer a wide variety of products of varying quality and price to be granted protections which they did not ask for, and which artificially constrain consumer options. Concerning modern forms of professional specialization, does specialization that accompanies technological advances naturally result in exclusivity, or have our licensing systems and laws been artificially engineered to limit the number of individuals who reach the point of specialization?

In certain cases, the want to specialize can adversely and negatively affect an industry. In his seminal work &quot;From Poor Law to Welfare State: A History of Social Welfare in America&quot; (1994) Walter Trattner argues that social workers began to emphasize individualized casework at the expense of alternative methods which utilize holistic approaches to address social issues.

In many cases, granting degrees through universities serves as one major component of licensing practices. Still, numerous legal stipulations and, in some cases, even informal social norms act in this capacity. Nevertheless, the university system constitutes one of the last remaining widely spread guild (or quasi-guild) and continues to serve as an indispensable means for the professionalization of fields of work. While it is true that most guilds disappeared by the middle of the nineteenth century, the scholars guild persisted due to its peripheral standing in an industrialized economy. In the words of Elliot Krause, &quot;The university and scholars&#x27; guilds held onto their power over membership, training, and workplace because early capitalism was not interested in it...&quot;.

<text>Washington-Liberty High School, formerly known as Washington-Lee High School, is a public high school in the Arlington Public Schools district in Arlington, Virginia, covering grades 9–12. Its attendance area serves the central third of Arlington, and it also offers the International Baccalaureate program countywide.

==History==

The former name of Washington-Liberty High School, Washington-Lee High School was taken from the Washington and Lee University, but the &quot;and&quot; was omitted and replaced with a hyphen to distinguish its name from the university&#x27;s.

Construction on Washington-Lee began in 1924, with the school opening in 1925 and graduating its first class in 1927. The architectural firm Upman &amp; Adams designed the building in a simplified version of the Colonial Revival style. The school fronted on 13th St. N, which separated the school from its athletic field, eventually dedicated as Arlington County&#x27;s War Memorial Stadium. In 1932, 41 classrooms, new offices, and another gym were added to the original building. A new wing and a large library with Palladian windows and two reading rooms were built in 1942 with WPA funds. The rifle range was also constructed in the shop area. In 1951, noted architect Rhees Burkett designed an addition that fronted on N. Quincy Street in the International Style. Along with the new Stratford Junior High School, it helped usher in a wave of contemporary commercial and school architecture that defined much of Arlington until the 1980s.

In 1960, some sophomores and juniors were sent to form the core of the then new Yorktown High School, to relieve overcrowding resulting from the baby boomer generation reaching high school age.

In 1975, the school board made the controversial decision to demolish the original sections of the school and construct a new facility with an open space instructional environment. The new school opened in 1977, and a new auditorium was constructed a few years later. In 1984, with the introduction of a new &quot;closed campus&quot; policy for underclassmen, a cafeteria was constructed in the school&#x27;s commons.

Beginning in 2006, the school underwent a complete reconstruction; none of the older buildings remain. The theater and nearby classrooms were demolished to allow for the construction of the new classroom building, which opened in January 2008. An axial orientation to War Memorial Stadium and the primary parking areas is the defining characteristic of the new school. A ten-lane regulation NCAA short course swimming pool (with optional 25 meter lanes), gym and other indoor athletic facilities, and an 800-seat auditorium opened to the public in July 2009. The demolition of the 1951 building and the construction of auxiliary athletic fields and additional landscaping was completed in December 2009. The renovation cost Arlington County nearly $100 million and making it one of the most expensive high school construction projects in the United States.

In the wake of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Arlington County School Board voted unanimously in June 2018 to rename Washington-Lee High School to remove Lee&#x27;s name, sparking a community discussion on whether this was wanted. This included debates on the process in which the school board took to change the name of the school. In the months prior to the name change, an appointed committee considered several options before narrowing them to &quot;Washington-Loving High School&quot;, in honor of the &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; court case, and &quot;Washington-Liberty High School&quot;. On January 10, 2019, the school board voted unanimously for the latter name. The name change took effect with the 2019–2020 school year.

In 2018 the Arlington School Board voted to integrate the former Arlington Education Center building into the Washington-Liberty campus. The building was completely renovated at the cost of $38 million and opened for the 2022–2023 school year. The building was renamed the Washington-Liberty Annex building and functions as a regular part of the school, containing classrooms, administrative and counseling offices, student lounging areas and a weight room.

==Campus==
The new four-story building frames the northern end of War Memorial Stadium, referencing the orientation of the original three story 1924 building. A stepped terrace leads to the field from the school&#x27;s student commons and outdoor eating areas. The school&#x27;s primary corridor on the ground floor is the focal point for the more public spaces, which include the performing arts center, student commons, alumni conference room, cyber cafe, and journalism suite. It spans the distance between the commons and a primary entrance with access to a multistory parking structure and bus lanes. A public entrance is located on N Stafford St, and a separate public entrance serves the pool.

The compact massing of the new building allowed for the construction of additional athletic fields on land previously occupied by the former school. The orientation of the new school within the surrounding open space and the abundant pedestrian connections across the site that connect neighborhoods adhere to Arlington County&#x27;s urban design guidelines, which follow smart growth planning principles. The new building was certified LEED gold by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) rating system, the second high school in Virginia to achieve that benchmark.

On the east side of the building near the indoor pool but not directly attached to the main building is the so-called annex which became a part of Washington-Liberties campus in 2022 after three years of renovations.

==Academics==

In 1985, Washington-Liberty was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the US Department of Education. In 2007, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ranked Washington-Liberty 33rd among the nation&#x27;s top high schools.

As of 2024, Washington-Liberty is the only school in Arlington that offers both the Advanced Placement program and the International Baccalaureate program. The vast majority of its students take advantage of these advanced courses or diploma programs.

==Fine arts==
The school offers fine arts courses and electives. Within the music department, electives include the marching and symphonic bands, madrigals, women&#x27;s chorale, choir, orchestra, music theory, and guitar. In 2007, the music department received the Blue Ribbon Award, the highest award given by the Virginia Music Educators Association. The school was also a blue ribbon school for 2010–11.

The Washington Liberty Theatre Department participated in the 2024 Brandon Victor Dixon Awards. Their production of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; was nominated for best musical, with actor Jack Potter, in the role of Adolpho Pirelli being nominated for Best Actor, Celeste Collins in the role of Ms. Lovett being a finalist for Best Actress, and Erika Sjetnan-Day being nominated in props for the technical theatre award.

WL Theatre teacher and director Danny Issa was featured on NPR talking about WL&#x27;s 2023 production of &quot;Almost, Maine&quot; by John Cariani.

<doc id="290832" wikidata="Q7749464" url="?curid=290832" title="The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System">
<text>The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System is the fourth book in Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen&#x27;s &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; classic series books. Published in 1990, the book depicts arguably the most well-known adventure of the series and introduces the character of Janet.

==Synopsis==
Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s class is learning about the Solar System and Arnold&#x27;s unpleasant cousin Janet, who constantly raves about herself, has joined them. The Friz decides to take the kids on a field trip to the planetarium. But once they get there, they find the planetarium is closed for repairs. However, on the way back to school, Ms. Frizzle pushes a button that makes the bus transform into a rocket and blast off into outer space.

Once in outer space, the bus flies to Earth&#x27;s Moon, where the kids make the most of the lesser gravity. Ms. Frizzle then takes them to the Sun and then Mercury, Venus and Mars before flying into the asteroid belt. However, while in the belt, one of the bus&#x27;s tail lights is damaged by an asteroid and the Friz flies out to fix the tail light with a tether line connecting her to the bus. However, the bus&#x27;s autopilot malfunctions, causing the bus to fly off, breaking Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s tether line and leaving her stranded in the asteroid belt.

Janet looks through the Friz&#x27;s things and finds Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s lesson book, which documents the information she is supposed to tell the kids during the field trip (complete with &quot;Arnold, are you listening?&quot; written into it.) Janet reads through the book as they pass the outer planets and until they pass Pluto, leaving the solar system. When the class got to Pluto, the Sun (because Pluto is far away from the Sun) didn&#x27;t look big anymore but it was a small yellow star. Janet then flips through the book and finds the instructions for the autopilot, so they can fly back to the asteroid belt and rescue Ms. Frizzle.

After they rescue the Friz, they return to Earth. The children tell various adults about their trips, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t believe them, thinking that instead it was all their imagination - perhaps some kind of game they played with their friends. The last couple pages of the book lists very important reasons not to attempt this field trip in real life.

==Reception==
Michele Landsberg of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a very positive review of the book, saying that, &quot;The fun is irresistible and the information substantial [...]&quot;.

==Television adaptation==
The book was adapted into the first episode of the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; television series to be broadcast. It is likely not the first episode produced (i.e. the pilot episode) since Arnold at one point mentions that the class went on a field trip inside a rotten log, probably referring to the events of the episode &quot;The Magic School Bus Meets The Rot Squad&quot;. (He also mentions that they&#x27;ve gone to the bottom of the ocean, but they never did that until the 4th episode of the first season &quot;The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten&quot; and the second-season episode &quot;The Magic School Bus Blows Its Top&quot;.) The episode is infamous for its third act in which it unintentionally teaches that one could survive without a helmet in the vacuum of space if brought back into an oxygen-filled environment quickly enough.

For the most part, the episode remains faithful to the book. Most notably, in the episode, Janet&#x27;s bragging about herself does not appear to be empty bragging and she constantly raves about how &quot;proof&quot; is needed for all extraordinary claims, prompting her to force Arnold to collect &quot;proof&quot; from every planet in the solar system, so she can prove to the students in her class that she actually traveled to all the planets. Also in this one Arnold surprisingly suggests going to outer space himself to prove to Janet the truth.

Also, instead of remaining in the asteroid belt, Ms. Frizzle uses her jet pack to fly off to another planet and provides the kids with clues as to her location via the radio on the bus. She, of course, turns out to be on Pluto. The ending is changed too, with all of Janet&#x27;s possessions (&quot;proof&quot;) falling out of the bus on Pluto and her refusing to leave without it. Janet refuses to go home without her possessions, while Arnold refuses to go home without her. Arnold (in protest against her desire for proof) demonstrates to Janet what would happen to her if she remains on Pluto by removing his space helmet. When he removes his helmet, it freezes him (despite Janet&#x27;s pleads of Arnold not to do it) and forces Janet to leave Pluto immediately. As the kids get back on the bus, Janet (as she and the class are holding Arnold) says, &quot;BACK TO EARTH!&quot;, and to Ms. Frizzle, she says, &quot;AND STEP ON IT!&quot;. This ending, of course, makes Arnold the hero instead of Janet. Among arriving back to Earth, all Arnold got from the freeze-over was a cold, and then the alien-obsessed Ralphie fakes a news announcement about aliens (Plutonian aliens) discovered on Pluto, complaining about the big pile of litter that was dumped on their planet.

In the &quot;Producer Says&quot; segment, after the male producer and the Plutonian alien (from the phone call) talk about the field trip to outer space, the Plutonian alien reveals that she is &quot;waiting for someone to get the pile of litter off of her planet&quot;. 

Despite the producer segment indicating otherwise, it is not implausible that Arnold could survive exposure to the thin atmosphere of Pluto after removing his helmet for long enough to be rescued. The show does, however, repeat the urban legend that one could catch a cold from the cold. The common cold is a viral infectious disease and one particularly could not catch it in the virtually airless atmosphere of Pluto as Arnold does in the episode.

This episode also marks the introduction of Janet in the TV series, and it is also the first time the bus is driven by the kids or someone other than Ms. Frizzle (the bus does not appear to have autopilot in the episode).

==Software adaptation==
 
The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System is the first software game developed based on the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; series (&quot;The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body&quot; was released the same year.) In the game, Ms. Frizzle is lost as soon as the bus flies off into space and got hit by a meteor in a meteor shower and the goal of the game is to locate her using the clues she provides. The Friz&#x27;s hiding place varies throughout the game.
As would become the standard for the remainder of the games in the original software series, the main screen consists of the bus&#x27;s dashboard, where the user can &quot;drive&quot; the bus to any of the nine planets or Earth&#x27;s moon. Since Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune lack solid surfaces, the Bus (unlike in the book and TV adaptations) in this version instead lands on one of their moons (Io for Jupiter, Mimas for Saturn, Miranda for Uranus and Triton for Neptune). 

Once on a planet, the user can exit the bus, where a strange satellite called the &quot;whatsit&quot; must be clicked on to bring up an arcade-styled game in which the user, controlling one of the students, must collect one of Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s tokens (giant coins with Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s face on them) which provide the user with a clue as to the Friz&#x27;s whereabouts and activate the &quot;Friz-finder.&quot; There are only three clues available, but tokens will still need to be collected to activate the &quot;Friz-finder&quot; after all the clues have been exhausted. Clicking on the &quot;Friz-finder&quot; will determine whether Ms. Frizzle is anywhere on the current planet. If she is, then the game is completed, but if she is not then the user will have to collect another token to activate the &quot;Friz-finder&quot; to try again.

===Notes===
* In three of the Magic School Bus games, Liz has the ability to speak (only the player can hear her).
* Most of the voices in the software sound similar to those in the TV series, except for Ms. Frizzle. Lily Tomlin did not reprise the role in the game, being replaced by Tina Marie Goff.
* When Keesha says &quot;It&#x27;s really cloudy down here&quot;, her voice is that of Phoebe&#x27;s. Similar goofs happened in other software; Phoebe speaks in Keesha&#x27;s voice showing her report about the Small Intestines, Dorothy Ann has Keesha and Phoebe&#x27;s voices and not her own while exploring the Large Intestines, and Ralphie speaks in Tim&#x27;s voice saying how ugly garbage is on the beach.

<doc id="290835" wikidata="Q4893317" url="?curid=290835" title="Bernard Kerik">
<text>Bernard Bailey Kerik (born September 4, 1955) is an American consultant and former police officer who was the 40th Commissioner of the New York Police Department from 2000 to 2001.

Kerik joined the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in 1986. He served from 1998 to 2000 as commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction and 2000–2001 as New York City Police Commissioner, during which he oversaw the police response to the September 11 attacks. Kerik conducted two extramarital affairs simultaneously, using a Battery Park City apartment that had been set aside for first responders at Ground Zero.

After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, President George W. Bush appointed Kerik as the interior minister of the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority. In 2004, Bush nominated Kerik to lead the Department of Homeland Security. However, Kerik soon withdrew his candidacy, explaining that he had employed an undocumented (illegal) immigrant as a nanny. His admission sparked state and federal investigations. In 2006, Kerik pleaded guilty in the Bronx Supreme Court to two unrelated misdemeanor ethics violations and was ordered to pay $221,000 in fines.

In 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty in the Southern District of New York to eight federal felony charges for tax fraud and making false statements. In February 2010, he was sentenced to four years in federal prison, of which he served three years. In 2020, he obtained a presidential pardon from President Donald Trump for his federal convictions for tax fraud, ethics violations, and criminal false statements. After the 2020 United States presidential election, Kerik supported Trump&#x27;s claims of voter fraud and attempted to help overturn the election results.

==Early life and education==
Kerik was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Patricia Joann (Bailey) and Donald Raymond Kerik Sr. His mother was Irish American. His paternal grandfather was an ethnic Slovakian who emigrated from Western Ukraine (then the Russian Empire) to a coal-mining town in Pennsylvania and changed his surname from Kapurik to Kerik.

Kerik was raised Catholic and grew up in Paterson, New Jersey. He attended Eastside High School in Paterson, and dropped out in 1972.

In July 1974, he enlisted in the United States Army and received a General Educational Development (GED) certificate from the State of North Carolina while assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After leaving the New York City Police Department, he received a B.S. in social theory, social structure and change, from Empire State College of the State University of New York in 2002.

==Career==
===Military===
After dropping out of high school, Kerik enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Military Police, stationed in Korea.

===Private sector===
After leaving the Army, Kerik worked as a security expert in the Middle East; for a time, his clients included the Saudi royal family.

===Law enforcement===
From December 1981 to October 1982 and then July 1984 to July 1986, Kerik worked at the Passaic County sheriff&#x27;s office, in New Jersey. He served as the department&#x27;s training officer and commander of special weapons and operations, and ultimately chief and warden of the Passaic County jail.

Kerik worked from 1982 to 1984 as chief of investigations for the security division of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Six members of the hospital security staff, including Kerik, were fired and deported after an investigation in 1984 by the Saudi secret police. In his autobiography, Kerik wrote that he was expelled after a physical altercation with a Saudi secret police interrogator.

However, in 2004, after his nomination as Secretary of Homeland Security, nine former employees of the hospital told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Kerik worked with a hospital administrator (Nizar Feteih) to surveil people&#x27;s private affairs, leading to a scandal partly based on Feteih&#x27;s use of &quot;the institution&#x27;s security staff to track the private lives of several women with whom he was romantically involved, and men who came in contact with them.&quot; Kerik and Feteih (among others) were fired and Kerik deported.

Kerik joined the New York City Police Department in 1986. He first met Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1990, and during the 1993 New York City mayoral election campaign, served as Giuliani&#x27;s bodyguard and driver. He joined the New York City Department of Corrections in 1994, and enjoyed a series of promotions with Giuliani&#x27;s backing.

He was credited with reducing violence among the city&#x27;s jail inmates. Giuliani appointed Kerik commissioner of the city Department of Corrections, a post he served in from 1998 to 2000.

Giuliani appointed Kerik the 40th Police Commissioner of New York City on August 21, 2000. Giuliani made the appointment against the advice of the outgoing police commissioner and many members of his own cabinet. Kerik&#x27;s critics noted that he did not have a college degree, which at the time was a requirement for police officers to advance to the rank of captain and above.

As police commissioner, Kerik had a tense relationship with the FBI, in part because he criticized federal agencies for not sharing enough intelligence with local police. Although crime in New York dropped during Kerik&#x27;s tenure, he was sometimes criticized for abuse of power. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that: &quot;Behind the scenes Mr. Kerik ruled like a feudal lord, many former employees have said. He had taken up with a woman who was a correction officer; he was accused of directing officers to staff his wedding. He befriended the agency&#x27;s inspector general, whose watchdog responsibilities require keeping an arms-length relationship, and the investigator attended his wedding.&quot;

On one occasion, Kerik sent homicide investigators to interview and fingerprint a number of Fox News employees whom Kerik&#x27;s publisher, Judith Regan, suspected of stealing a necklace and mobile phone. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem.

Kerik was serving as police commissioner during the September 11 attacks. He was in his office when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower. He arrived at the base of the North Tower three minutes before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, showering him and his staff with debris as Giuliani, Kerik, and their top aides were trapped inside a building at 75 Barclay Street. The September 11 attacks gave Kerik a national profile. Kerik served 16 months as commissioner, leaving office on December 31, 2001, at the end of Giuliani&#x27;s term.

During a televised Fox News joint interview of himself and Giuliani with Jeanine Pirro on June 6, 2020, Kerik stated that &quot;over the eight-year period that Giuliani was in office, we dropped the violent crime by 63 percent, dropped the murder (sic) by 70 (sic) overall in the city.&quot;

===Return to private sector===
Following his departure from the New York City Police Department, he was employed by Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm formed by Giuliani. He was the senior vice president at Giuliani Partners and as chief executive officer of Giuliani–Kerik LLC, an affiliate of Giuliani Partners. Kerik resigned from these positions in December 2004. In March 2005 he created The Kerik Group LLC, where he served as chairman until June 2009, consulting in crisis management and risk mitigation, counterterrorism and law enforcement, and jail/prison management strategies.

He has served as an adviser and consultant to King Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to President Bharrat Jagdeo of the Republic of Guyana. He has overseen threat and vulnerability assessments for a ruling family in the United Arab Emirates and has also worked on crime reduction and national security strategies in Trinidad and Tobago.

===Interim Minister of Interior of Iraq===
In May 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Kerik was appointed by the George W. Bush administration as interim Interior Minister of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the governing body of occupied Iraq, and senior policy adviser to U.S. presidential envoy to Iraq, Paul Bremer. When Kerik arrived in Iraq, the Ministry of Interior did not exist, having collapsed and dissolved during the U.S.–led coalition&#x27;s invasion of Iraq. Kerik was responsible for restructuring and rebuilding the ministry and all its constituent parts: the national police, intelligence service, and border and customs police, as well as choosing the officials who would take control of these institutions when he left.

Prior to Kerik&#x27;s departure from Iraq on September 2, 2003, more than 35,000 Iraqi police were reinstated, 35 police stations were placed in Baghdad, with several more around the country, senior deputy interior ministers were appointed, and the newly established governing council appointed the first Iraqi minister of interior, post–Saddam Hussein, Nuri Badran. A United Nations UNODC fact-finding mission report dated May 18, 2003 at the beginning of his term, noted that Kerik&#x27;s team made &quot;positive interventions in a number of areas.&quot;

During his tenure as Interior Minister of Iraq, Kerik secretly accepted and failed to report a $250,000 interest-free &quot;loan&quot; from Israeli billionaire , for which he was later indicted by the US government and sentenced to prison.

===Nomination as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security===

On December 3, 2004, Kerik was nominated by President Bush to succeed Tom Ridge as United States Secretary of Homeland Security. Incoming Attorney General Alberto Gonzales vetted Kerik during that nomination period. On December 10, after a week of press scrutiny, Kerik withdrew acceptance of the nomination. Kerik stated that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper. Similar violations of immigration law had previously caused the withdrawal of the nominations of Linda Chavez as secretary of labor by George W. Bush and of Zoë Baird and Kimba Wood for attorney general by President Bill Clinton.

Shortly after withdrawing his name from consideration, Kerik became the target of a New York State grand jury investigation by the Bronx District Attorney&#x27;s Office, and later, the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office.

==Criminal investigation and convictions==

On November 8, 2007, Kerik was indicted by a federal grand jury in White Plains, New York on charges of tax fraud, and making false statements to the federal government about the $250,000 he received from Wertheimer. Prosecutors further accused Kerik of receiving about $236,000 from New York real estate mogul Steven C. Witkoff between 2001 and 2003. Some of the New York charges were dropped in December 2008, but Kerik was then re-indicted on the same charges in Washington, D.C.

On November 5, 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges, specifically two counts of tax fraud, one count of making a false statement on a loan application, and five counts of making false statements. He was sentenced to 48 months in federal prison and three years&#x27; supervised release (probation). Kerik was represented by criminal defense attorney Michael F. Bachner. He surrendered to the U.S. minimum security prison camp in Cumberland, Maryland, on May 17, 2010. He was discharged from federal custody on October 15, 2013, and after serving five months&#x27; home confinement, his supervised release concluded in October 2016.

Kerik was granted a presidential pardon for his federal convictions by President Donald Trump on February 18, 2020.

==2020 presidential election==
On November 7, 2020, following the 2020 United States presidential election, Kerik stood behind Giuliani, then Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer, during the
Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Shortly after Joe Biden&#x27;s victory over Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election, Kerik claimed to have evidence of widespread voter fraud, falsely claiming that Trump had actually won the election.

On December 31, 2021, Kerik forwarded a letter to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack holding hearings regarding the 2021 Capitol riot indicating his conditional willingness to testify as to his knowledge of that event. He provided documents that included the outline of a strategy to overturn the election, and his involvement in securing space at the Willard Hotel, nearby the Capitol, for the Trump team&#x27;s &quot;war room&quot; and the Kerrick firm&#x27;s billing of over $55,000 for rooms there for legal personnel, plus $10,000 in travel expenses.

Among the documents was a &quot;strategic communications plan&quot; proposed for the &quot;GIULIANI PRESIDENTIAL LEGAL DEFENSE TEAM&quot;, 22 pages long, envisioning a 10-day blitz, outlining a campaign intended to persuade Republican Congressional members, in particular swing-state senators and representatives, to vote against certification of the 2020 election results. It recommended promoting negative characterizations of the conduct of the election employing such terminology as, &quot;Fraudulent Ballots&quot;, &quot;Dead people voted&quot;, and &quot;Underage people voted&quot;. The senators specifically targeted included Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, and representatives from their states plus Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and, from Nevada, Mark Amodei.

Among the documents Kerik provided was one sent by Giuliani associate Maria Ryan. She had received a proposed plan from QAnon conspiracy circulator Ron Watkins on November 11, 2020, which was meant to facilitate the overturning of the election. She forwarded it the next day to her team member Kerik. Watkins stated he had discovered &quot;weak points&quot; in voting machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems.

Ryan forwarded to Ron Watkins the Kerik offer to help overturn the election. The Watkins plan for Trump to remain in office incorporated what was termed an &quot;astroturfing cult&quot;. The instruments for effectuating the plan were to utilize an army of social media MAGA posters and gathering protests outside the homes of lawmakers as a means of intimidation.

Kerik&#x27;s attorney Tim Parlatore confirmed in August 2023 that his client was one of thirty unindicted co-conspirators referenced in the Fulton County, Georgia, indictment of former president Donald Trump and eighteen other named co-conspirators. Kerik was alleged to have spoken with politicians in Pennsylvania and Arizona regarding the fake electors scheme following the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost.

==Awards and honors==

Kerik earned 30 NYPD medals for excellent, meritorious, and heroic service, including the New York City Police Department Medal for Valor for his involvement in a gun battle in which his partner was shot and wounded and he and his team members returned fire. As a result of his work on and in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, he was honored by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II with an honorary appointment as Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Kerik has received honorary doctorates from Michigan State University, New York Institute of Technology, Manhattanville College, College of New Rochelle, and Iona College, and he received the President&#x27;s Medal from Hunter College.

==Personal life==
Kerik&#x27;s first child, a girl, was born in October 1975 when he was 20 and serving in South Korea as a military policeman. In February 1976, Kerik completed his tour of duty in South Korea and abandoned his daughter and her mother. Her mother emigrated to the U.S. and married an American. She learned of Kerik&#x27;s life decades later when she saw him on television and notified their daughter of his location. Kerik wrote in his autobiography that the episode was &quot;a mistake I will always regret, and I pray to God that one day I can make it right.&quot;

Kerik has been married three times. His first marriage was in August 1978; he and his wife were divorced in 1983. Kerik&#x27;s second marriage lasted from September 1983 to July 1992; the marriage produced a son. Kerik&#x27;s third marriage took place in 1998, and the couple had two daughters.

In 2001 Kerik published a memoir, &quot;The Lost Son: A Life in Pursuit of Justice&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

In March 2014, Kerik published his second book, &quot;From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey from Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate 84888-054&quot;, documenting the 13 prior years of his life including his incarceration and personal observations of the U.S. criminal justice system.

Kerik was close friends starting in 1995 with Larry Ray, who was later accused of running a sex cult at Sarah Lawrence College. Ray donated $7,000 to help pay for Kerik&#x27;s November 1998 wedding and reception, and was the best man at Kerik&#x27;s wedding. Shortly after, Kerik helped Ray obtain a job as security director with a construction company run by Frank DiTommaso and his brother known as Interstate Industrial Corporation, where a portion of Ray’s responsibility was to assist the business in obtaining a license from city regulators, as the business faced allegations that it was tied to organized crime. In 2000, Ray and Kerik had a falling out, around the time that Ray was indicted for racketeering, and Ray began to cooperate as a cooperating witness with prosecutors who were investigating Kerik, and whose investigation ultimately led to Kerik being convicted and imprisoned. In 2019 Kerik said: “Larry Ray is a psychotic con man who has victimized every friend he’s ever had. It’s been close to 20 years since I last heard from him, yet his reign of terror continues.” In 2022, Ray was convicted of extortion, forced prostitution, and forced labor, and sentenced to 60 years in prison.

<doc id="290839" wikidata="Q6961869" url="?curid=290839" title="Naming convention">
<text>A naming convention is a convention (generally agreed scheme) for naming things. Conventions differ in their intents, which may include to:
* Allow useful information to be deduced from the names based on regularities. For instance, in Manhattan, streets are consecutively numbered; with east–west streets called &quot;Streets&quot; and north–south streets called &quot;Avenues&quot;.
* Show relationships, and in most personal naming conventions
* Ensure that each name is unique for same scope

==Use cases==
Well-chosen naming conventions aid the casual user in navigating and searching larger structures. Several areas where naming conventions are commonly used include:
* In astronomy, planetary nomenclature
* In classics, Roman naming conventions
* In computer programming, identifier naming conventions
* In computer networking, naming scheme
* In humans, naming offspring
* In industry, product naming conventions
* In the sciences, systematic names for a variety of things
* In religion, temple naming conventions

==Examples==
Examples of naming conventions may include:
* Children&#x27;s names may be alphabetical by birth order. In some Asian cultures, siblings commonly share part of their given names. In many cultures the first son is usually named after the father or grandfather. In other cultures, the name may include the place of residence. Roman naming convention denotes social rank.
* Developers of database schemas, program-name terminology and ontologies may apply a common set of labeling conventions for naming representational entities in their representational artefacts, i.e. conventions outlined or endorsed by terminology-regulatory bodies or by policy providers such as ISO or the OBO Foundry.
* The names of universities can commemorate founders, patrons or relevant monarchs: note for example Lomonosov Moscow State University, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Victoria University of Wellington, or Johns Hopkins University. A Latinate version confers extra class – note &quot;Alma Mater Rudolphina&quot; for the University of Vienna or &quot;Universitas Complutensis&quot; for the Complutense University of Madrid.
* Large corporate, university, or government campuses may name rooms within their buildings to help orient tenants and visitors.
* Products. Automobiles typically have a binomial name, a &quot;make&quot; (manufacturer) and a &quot;model&quot;, in addition to a model year. Computers, and computer programs, often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the successive generations.
* School courses: an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty.
* Shipping lines often use a distinct naming convention to make their ships more recognisable and their names easier to remember.
* Virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers follow some convention in generating these identifiers (e.g. phone numbers, bank accounts, government IDs, credit cards, etc.).

<text>Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a cluster C personality disorder marked by a spectrum of obsessions with rules, lists, schedules, and order, among other things. Symptoms are usually present by the time a person reaches adulthood, and are visible in a variety of situations. The cause of OCPD is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors, namely problems with attachment.

Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder is distinct from &quot;obsessive–compulsive disorder&quot; (OCD), and the relation between the two is contentious. Some studies have found high comorbidity rates between the two disorders but others have shown little comorbidity. Both disorders may share outside similarities, such as rigid and ritual-like behaviors. OCPD is highly comorbid with other personality disorders, autism spectrum, eating disorders, anxiety, mood disorders, and substance use disorders.

The disorder is the most common personality disorder in the United States, and is diagnosed twice as often in males than in females; however, there is evidence to suggest the prevalence between men and women is equal.
==Signs and symptoms==
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is marked by an excessive obsession with rules, lists, schedules, and order; a need for perfection that interferes with efficiency and the ability to complete tasks; a devotion to productivity that hinders interpersonal relationships and leisure time; rigidity and zealousness on matters of morality and ethics; an inability to delegate responsibilities or work to others; restricted functioning in interpersonal relationships; restricted expression of emotion and affect; and a need for control over one&#x27;s environment and self.

Some of OCPD&#x27;s symptoms are persistent and stable, whilst others are unstable. The obsession with perfectionism, reluctance to delegate tasks to others, and rigidity and stubbornness are stable symptoms. On the other hand, the symptoms that were most likely to change over time were the miserly spending style and the excessive devotion to productivity. This discrepancy in the stability of symptoms may lead to mixed results in terms of the course of the disorder, with some studies showing a remission rate of 58% after a 12-month period, whilst others suggest that the symptoms are stable and may worsen with age.

===Attention to order and perfection===
People with OCPD tend to be obsessed with controlling their environments; to satisfy this need for control, they become preoccupied with trivial details, lists, procedures, rules, and schedules.

This preoccupation with details and rules makes the person unable to delegate tasks and responsibilities to other people unless they submit to their exact way of completing a task because they believe that there is only one correct way of doing something. They stubbornly insist that a task or job must be completed their way, and only their way, and may micromanage people when they are assigned a group task. They are frustrated when other people suggest alternative methods. A person with this disorder may reject help even when they desperately need it as they believe that only they can do something correctly.

People with OCPD are obsessed with maintaining perfection. The perfectionism and the extremely high standards that they establish are to their detriment and may cause delays and failures to complete objectives and tasks. Mistakes are generally exaggerated. For example, a person may write an essay and, believing that it fell short of perfection, continues rewriting it, missing the deadline or even failing to complete the task. The subject may remain unaware that others become frustrated and annoyed by repeated delay and inconvenience so caused. Work relationships may then become a source of tension.

===Devotion to productivity===
Individuals with OCPD devote themselves to work and productivity at the expense of interpersonal relationships and recreation. Economic necessity, such as poverty, cannot account for this behavior. They may believe that they do not have sufficient time to relax because they have to prioritize their work above all. They may refuse to spend time with friends and family because of that. They may find it difficult to go on a vacation, and even if they book a vacation, they may keep postponing it so that it never happens. They may feel uncomfortable when they do go on a vacation and will take something along with them so they can work. They choose hobbies that are organized and structured, and they approach them as a serious task requiring work to perfect. The devotion to productivity in OCPD, however, is distinct from work addiction. OCPD is controlled and egosyntonic, whereas work addiction is uncontrolled and egodystonic, and the affected person may display signs of withdrawal.

===Rigidity===
Individuals with OCPD are overconscientious, scrupulous and rigid, and inflexible on matters of morality, ethics and other areas of life. They may force themselves and others to follow rigid moral principles and strict standards of performance. They are self-critical and harsh about their mistakes. These symptoms should not be accounted for or caused by a person&#x27;s culture or religion. Their view of the world is polarised and dichotomous; there is no grey area between what is right and what is wrong. Whenever this dichotomous view of the world cannot be applied to a situation, this causes internal conflict as the person&#x27;s perfectionist tendencies are challenged.

People with this disorder are so obsessed with doing everything the &quot;right and correct&quot; way that they have a hard time understanding and appreciating the ideas, beliefs, and values of other people, and are reluctant to change their views, especially on matters of morality and politics.

===Restricted emotions and interpersonal functioning===
Individuals with this disorder may display little affection and warmth; their relationships and speech tend to have a formal and professional approach, and not much affection is expressed even to loved ones, such as greeting or hugging a significant other at an airport or train station.

They are extremely careful in their interpersonal interactions. They have little spontaneity when interacting with others, and ensure that their speech follows rigid and austere standards by excessively scrutinising it. They filter their speech for embarrassing or imperfect articulation, while they maintain a high bar for what they consider to be acceptable. They raise their bar even higher when they are communicating with their superiors or with a person of high status. Communication becomes a time-consuming and exhausting effort, and they start avoiding it altogether. Others regard them as cold and detached as a result.

Their need for restricting affection is a defense mechanism used to control their emotions. They may expunge emotions from their memories and organize them as a library of facts and data; the memories are intellectualized and rationalized, not experiences that they can feel. This helps them avoid unexpected emotions and feelings and allows them to remain in control. They can view self-exploration as a waste of time and have a patronising attitude towards emotional people.

===Interpersonal control===
Individuals with OCPD are at one extreme of the conscientiousness continuum. While conscientiousness is a desirable trait generally, its extreme presentation for those with OCPD leads to interpersonal problems. OCPD individuals present as over-controlled and this extends to the relationships they have with other people. Individuals with OCPD are reverential to authority and rules. OCPD individuals may therefore punish those who violate their strict standards. The inability to accept differences in belief or behaviors from others often leads to high conflict and controlling relationships with coworkers, spouses, and children.

==Cause==
The cause of OCPD is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is clear evidence to support the theory that OCPD is genetically inherited; however, the relevance and impact of genetic factors vary with studies placing it somewhere between 27% and 78%.

A twin study on the influence of genetics on the development of personality disorders over multiple personality disorders found that OCPD had a 0.78 heritability correlation, thus demonstrating that the development of OCPD can be strongly linked to genetics.

Other studies have found links between attachment theory and the development of OCPD. According to this hypothesis, those with OCPD have never developed a secure attachment style, had overbearing parents, were shown little care, and/or were unable to develop empathetically and emotionally.

==Diagnosis==
===DSM-5===
The fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&quot; a widely used manual for diagnosing mental disorders, places obsessive–compulsive personality disorder under section II, under the &quot;personality disorders&quot; chapter, and defines it as: &quot;a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts&quot;. A diagnosis of OCPD is only received when four out of the eight criteria are met.

The eight criteria of OCPD described in the DSM-5 (of which four are required to be present in a patient for a diagnosis) are:

# Preoccupation with details
# Perfectionism interfering with task completion
# Rigidity and stubbornness
# Reluctance to delegate
# Excessive conscientiousness and pedantry (excessive concern with minor details and rules)
# Workaholic behavior
# Miserliness (excessive desire to save money)
# Inability to discard worn-out or worthless objects

The list of criteria for the ICD-10 is similar, but does not include the last three criteria in the above list, and additionally includes the symptoms &quot;intrusive thoughts&quot; and &quot;excessive doubt and caution&quot; as criteria for diagnosis.

====Alternative model for diagnosis====
The DSM-5 also includes an alternative set of diagnostic criteria as per the dimensional model of conceptualizing personality disorders. Under the proposed set of criteria, a person only receives a diagnosis when there is an impairment in two out of four areas of one&#x27;s personality functioning, and when there are three out of four pathological traits, one of which must be rigid perfectionism.

The patient must also meet the general criteria C through G for a personality disorder, which state that the traits and symptoms being displayed by the patient must be stable and unchanging over time with an onset of at least adolescence or early adulthood, visible in a variety of situations, not caused by another mental disorder, not caused by a substance or medical condition, and abnormal in comparison to a person&#x27;s developmental stage and culture/religion.

====Differential diagnosis====
There are several mental disorders in the DSM-5 that are listed as differential diagnoses for OCPD. They are as follows:

* Obsessive–compulsive disorder. OCD and OCPD have a similar name which may cause confusion; however, OCD can be easily distinguished from OCPD: OCPD is not characterized by true obsessions or compulsions.
* Hoarding disorder. A diagnosis of hoarding disorder is only considered when the hoarding behavior exhibited is causing severe impairment in the functioning of the person, such as an inability to access rooms in a house due to excessive hoarding.
* Narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals with a narcissistic personality disorder usually believe that they have achieved perfection (especially compared to other people) and cannot get better, whereas those with OCPD do not believe that they have achieved perfection, and are self-critical. Those with NPD tend to be stingy and lack generosity; however, they are usually generous when spending on themselves, unlike those with OCPD who hoard money and are miserly on themselves and others.
* Antisocial personality disorder. Similarly, individuals with antisocial personality disorder are not generous, but miserly around others, although they usually over-indulge themselves and are sometimes reckless in spending.
* Schizoid personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder may both display restricted affectivity and coldness; however, in OCPD, this is usually due to a controlling attitude, whereas, in SPD, it occurs due to a lack of ability to experience emotion and display affection.
* Other personality traits. Obsessive–compulsive personality traits may be particularly useful and helpful, especially in productive environments. Only when these traits become extreme and maladaptive and cause clinically significant impairment in several aspects of one&#x27;s life should a diagnosis of OCPD be considered.
* Personality change due to another medical condition. Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder must be differentiated from a personality change due to a medical condition, which affects the central nervous system, and may cause changes in behavior and traits.
* Substance use disorders. Substance use may cause the advent of obsessive–compulsive traits. It is necessary that this is distinguished from underlying and persistent behavior, which must occur when a person is not under influence of a substance.

===ICD-10===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-10 uses the term &quot;&quot; (). At least four of the following must be present:

# Feelings of doubt
# Perfectionism
# Excessive conscientiousness
# Checking and preoccupation with details
# Stubbornness 
# Caution 
# Rigidity
# Insistent and unwelcome thoughts or impulses that do not attain the severity of an obsessive–compulsive disorder.

===Millon&#x27;s subtypes===
In his book, Personality Disorders in Modern Life, Theodore Millon describes five types of obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, which he shortened to compulsive personality disorder.
==Comorbidity==

===Obsessive–compulsive disorder===
OCPD is often confused with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite the similar names, they are two distinct disorders. Some OCPD individuals do have OCD, and the two can be found in the same family, sometimes along with eating disorders.

The rate of comorbidity of OCPD in patients with OCD is estimated to be around 15–28%. However, due to the addition of the hoarding disorder diagnosis in the DSM-5, and studies showing that hoarding may not be a symptom of OCPD, the true rate of comorbidity may be much lower.

There is significant similarity in the symptoms of OCD and OCPD, which can lead to complexity in distinguishing them clinically. For example, perfectionism is an OCPD criterion and a symptom of OCD if it involves the need for tidiness, symmetry, and organization. Hoarding is also considered both a compulsion found in OCD and a criterion for OCPD in the DSM-5. Even though OCD and OCPD are seemingly separate disorders there are obvious redundancies between the two concerning several symptoms.

Regardless of similarities between the OCPD criteria and the obsessions and compulsions found in OCD, there are discrete qualitative dissimilarities between these disorders, predominantly in the functional part of symptoms. Unlike OCPD, OCD is described as invasive, and stressful. Individuals with OCD have avoidance behaviors, compulsive routines, and other methods to alleviate obsessive triggers.Time-consuming obsessions and habits are aimed at reducing obsession-related stress. OCD symptoms are at times regarded as egodystonic because they are experienced as alien and repulsive to the person. Therefore, there is a greater mental anxiety associated with OCD.

In contrast, the symptoms seen in OCPD, although repetitive, are not linked with repulsive thoughts, images, or urges. OCPD characteristics and behaviors are known as egosyntonic, as people with this disorder view them as suitable and correct. On the other hand, the main features of perfectionism and inflexibility can result in considerable suffering in an individual with OCPD as a result of the associated need for control.

The presence of OCPD in patients with OCD has been linked to a worse prognosis of OCD, especially when cognitive behavioral therapy was used. This may be due to the egosyntonic nature of OCPD which may lead to the obsessions becoming aligned with one&#x27;s personal values. In contrast, the trait of perfectionism may improve the outcome of treatment as patients are likely to complete homework assigned to them with determination. The findings with regards to pharmacological treatment has also been mixed, with some studies showing a lower reception to SRIs in OCD patients with comorbid OCPD, with others showing no relationship.

Comorbidity between OCD and OCPD has been linked to a more severe presentation of symptoms, a younger age of onset, more significant impairment in functioning, poorer insight, and higher comorbidity of depression and anxiety.

===Autism spectrum===
There are considerable similarities and overlap between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and OCPD, such as list-making, inflexible adherence to rules, and obsessive aspects of ASD, although the latter may be distinguished from OCPD especially regarding affective behaviors, worse social skills, difficulties with Theory of Mind and intense intellectual interests, e.g. an ability to recall every aspect of a hobby. A 2009 study involving adult autistic people found that 32% of those diagnosed with ASD met the diagnostic requirements for a comorbid OCPD diagnosis.

===Eating disorders===
Perfectionism has been linked with anorexia nervosa in research for decades. A researcher in 1949 described the behavior of the average &quot;anorexic girl&quot; as being &quot;rigid&quot; and &quot;hyperconscious&quot;, observing a tendency to &quot;[n]eatness, meticulosity, and a mulish stubbornness not amenable to reason [which] make her a rank perfectionist.&quot; So common are such traits as perfectionism and rigidity among anorectics, that they have been referred to in clinical literature as &quot;classical childhood features of patients with anorexia nervosa&quot; or &quot;classical premorbid personality descriptors of anorexia nervosa&quot;.

Regardless of the prevalence of the full-fledged OCPD among eating disordered samples, the presence of this personality disorder or its traits, such as perfectionism, has been found to be positively correlated with a range of complications in eating disorders and a negative outcome, as opposed to impulsive features—those linked with histrionic personality disorder, for example—which predict a better outcome from treatment. OCPD predicts more severe symptoms of anorexia nervosa, and worse remission rates, however, OCPD and perfectionistic traits predicted a higher acceptance of treatment, which was defined as undergoing 5 weeks of treatment.

People with anorexia nervosa who exercise excessively display a higher prevalence of several OCPD traits when compared to their counterparts who did not exercise excessively. The traits included self-imposed perfectionism, and the childhood OCPD traits of being rule-bound and cautious. It may be that people with OCPD traits are more likely to use exercise alongside restricting food intake in order to mitigate fears of increased weight, reduce anxiety, or reduce obsessions related to weight gain. Samples that had the childhood traits of rigidity, extreme cautiousness, and perfectionism endured more severe food restriction and higher levels of exercise and underwent longer periods of underweight status. It may be that OCPD traits are an indicator of a more severe manifestation of AN which is harder to treat.

=== Gambling disorder ===
A majority of those with lifelong gambling disorder have some sort of personality disorder, and the most common personality disorder amongst them is obsessive compulsive personality disorder. OCPD has a strong comorbidity with individuals who have gambling disorder. A study of data collected in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions looked at pathological gambling and psychiatric conditions as defined by the DSM-IV. Of the surveyed population consistent with gambling disorder, 60.8% also had a personality disorder, with OCPD appearing most frequently at 30%. About 300,000 U.S citizens have both a gambling disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder; and yet, there is little research on the comorbidity of the two disorders. Those with gambling disorders and OCPD do, indeed, exhibit different behavioral patterns than those with gambling disorders alone. More research on the relationship between the disorders is thought to help uncover causes and develop treatments for patients.

=== Mental fatigue ===
Recently, in 2020, the connection between mental fatigue and OCPD was published for the first time, even though mental fatigue has been previously associated with identified characteristics of OCPD such as workaholic behavior and perfectionism.

===Other disorders and conditions===
A diagnosis of OCPD is common with anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and mood disorders. OCPD is also highly comorbid with Cluster A personality disorders,[4] especially paranoid and schizotypal personality disorders.

OCPD is also linked to hypochondriasis, with some studies estimating a rate of co-occurrence as high as 55.7%.

Moreover, OCPD has been found to be very common among some medical conditions, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease and the hypermobile subtype of Ehler-Danlos syndrome. The latter may be explained by the need for control that arises from musculoskeletal problems and the associated features that arise early in life, whilst the former can be explained by dysfunctions in the fronto-basal ganglia circuitry.

==Treatment==
The best-validated treatment for OCPD is cognitive therapy (CT) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with studies showing an improvement in areas of personality impairment, and reduced levels of anxiety and depression. Group CBT is also associated with an increase in extraversion and agreeableness and reduced neuroticism. Interpersonal psychotherapy has been linked to even better results when it came to reducing depressive symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
Estimates for the prevalence of OCPD in the general population are 3%, making it the most common personality disorder. Current evidence is inconclusive as to whether OCPD is more common in men than women, or in equal rates among sexes. It is estimated to occur in 8.7% of psychiatric outpatient settings.

A study of data collected in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions looked specifically for seven personality disorders as defined by the DSM-IV. The study concluded the most prevalent personality disorder of the survey&#x27;s population to be OCPD, at 7.88%. This study also concluded there were no gender differences in prevalence and that OCPD was not a predictor of disability.

==History==

In 1908, Sigmund Freud named what is now known as obsessive–compulsive or anankastic personality disorder &quot;anal retentive character&quot;. He identified the main strands of the personality type as a preoccupation with orderliness, parsimony (frugality), and obstinacy (rigidity and ness). The concept fits his theory of psychosexual development. Freud believed that the anal retentive character faced difficulties regulating the control of defecation, leading to repercussions by the parents, and it is the latter that would cause the anal retentive character.

Aubrey Lewis, in his 1936 book &quot;Problems of Obsessional Illness&quot;, suggests that anal-erotic characteristics are found in patients without obsessive thoughts, and proposed two types of obsessional personality, one melancholy and stubborn, the other uncertain and indecisive.

In the book &quot;Contributions to the theory of the anal character,&quot; Karl Abraham noted that the core feature of the anal character is being perfectionistic, and he believed that these traits will help an individual in becoming industrious and productive, whilst hindering their social and interpersonal functioning, such as working with others.

OCPD was included in the first edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association under the name &quot;compulsive personality&quot;. It was defined as a chronic and excessive preoccupation with adherence to rules and standards of conscience. Other symptoms included rigidity, over-conscientiousness, and a reduced ability to relax.

The DSM-II (1968) changed the name to &quot;obsessive–compulsive personality&quot;, and also suggested the term &quot;anankastic personality&quot; in order to reduce confusion between OCPD and OCD, but the proposed name was removed from later editions. The symptoms described in the DSM-II closely resembled those in the original DSM.

In 1980, the DSM-III was released, and it renamed the disorder back to &quot;compulsive personality disorder&quot;, and also included new symptoms of the disorder: a restricted expression of affect, and an inability to delegate tasks. Devotion to productivity, perfectionism, and indecisiveness were the other symptoms included. The DSM-III-R (1987) renamed the disorder again to &quot;obsessive–compulsive personality disorder&quot; and the name has remained since then. A diagnosis of OCPD was given when 5 of the 9 symptoms were met, and the 9 symptoms included perfectionism, preoccupation with details, an insistence that others submit to one&#x27;s way, indecisiveness, devotion to work, restricted expression of affect, excessive conscientiousness, lack of generosity, and hoarding.

With DSM-IV, OCPD was classified as a &#x27;Cluster C&#x27; personality disorder. There was a dispute about the categorization of OCPD as an Axis II anxiety disorder. Although the DSM-IV attempted to distinguish between OCPD and OCD by focusing on the absence of obsessions and compulsions in OCPD, OC personality traits are easily mistaken for abnormal cognitions or values considered to underpin OCD. The disorder is a neglected and understudied area of research.

<doc id="290843" wikidata="Q1136956" url="?curid=290843" title="SG-1000">
<text>The is a home video game console manufactured by Sega. It was Sega&#x27;s first entry into the home video game hardware business. Developed in response to a downturn in arcades starting in 1982, the SG-1000 was created on the advice of Hayao Nakayama, president of Sega&#x27;s Japanese arm, and was released on July 15, 1983, the same day that Nintendo released the Family Computer in Japan. It also had a limited release in Australia and New Zealand.

The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the SC-3000 computer and the redesigned SG-1000 II released in 1984. The SG-1000 and the SC-3000 both support a library of 51 ROM cartridge games and 29 Sega My Card games. 

A third iteration of the console, the Mark III, was released in 1985. It provided an improved custom video display processor over previous iterations and served as the basis for the Master System in 1986, Sega&#x27;s first internationally released console. All SG-1000 games are fully compatible with the Mark III and the Japanese version of the Master System.

==History==
In the early 1980s, Sega Enterprises, Inc., then a subsidiary of Gulf and Western Industries, was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 million. A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing. The company retained Sega&#x27;s North American R&amp;D operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Hayao Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time. Nakayama received permission to proceed.

The first model to be developed was the &quot;SC-3000&quot;, a computer with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo&#x27;s plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the &quot;SG-1000&quot; alongside the SC-3000. The &quot;SG&quot; in the console&#x27;s name is an abbreviation for &quot;Sega Game&quot;, and the console is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mark I&quot;. To keep costs down while ensuring sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components.

The &quot;SG-1000&quot; was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, at ¥15,000. It was released on the same day as Nintendo launched the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan. It was released simultaneously with the &quot;SC-3000&quot;, as well as the upgraded &quot;SC-3000H&quot;. Though Sega themselves only released the SG-1000 in Japan, rebranded versions were released in several other markets worldwide. In November that same year as the Japanese version, the SC-3000 was released in Australia through John Sands Electronics and in New Zealand by Grandstand Leisure. The console also saw a release in Italy and Spain, but was not released in the larger video game markets of the United States, United Kingdom, or Germany. Despite this, an unauthorized clone system known as the Telegames Personal Arcade was produced and made available in the United States and Taiwan, and is able to play SG-1000 and ColecoVision games. An additional release of the SG-1000 in Taiwan was done by Aaronix. The console enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Taiwan before the market was taken over by cheaper Famicom clones.

Due in part to the SG-1000&#x27;s steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 sold 160,000 units in 1983, far exceeding Sega&#x27;s projection of 50,000. Former Sega consumer hardware development head Hideki Sato stated that because Sega had not predicted the SG-1000 would sell so well, the company became more enamored with developing video game consoles. Despite this, the three launch games, all of which were ported from Sega&#x27;s VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name recognition of Famicom launch games &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, and &quot;Popeye&quot;. Shortly after launch, Gulf and Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder Charles Bluhdorn, so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd.

Following the buyout, Sega released another console, the &quot;SG-1000 II&quot;, on July 31, 1984 at ¥15,000. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;SG-1000 Mark II&quot;. The SG-1000 II replaced the hardwired joystick with two detachable joypads. Sato disliked the original cartridges, saying they looked like &quot;small black tombstones&quot; when inserted in the console, and later remarked that his proudest achievement of the SG-1000 era was replacing them with the &quot;cheerier&quot;, pocket-sized Sega My Cards. Sega also employed popular owarai comedy duo Tunnels to provide celebrity endorsement for the console. Japanese company, Tsukuda Original Co., Ltd. created the Othello Multivision, based around the SC-3000 and SG-1000 hardware.

By 1984, the Famicom&#x27;s success began to outpace the SG-1000. The Famicom had more advanced hardware, allowing it to perform smoother scrolling and more colorful sprites, and Nintendo boosted its games library by courting third-party developers, whereas Sega was less than eager to collaborate with the same companies they were competing with in arcades. The SG-1000 was also coming up against game consoles from companies including Tomy and Bandai. This would result in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985, which later became the Master System worldwide.

==Technical specifications==
The SG-1000 is powered by an 8-bit Zilog Z80A central processing unit rated for 4 MHz, but runs at 3.58 MHz. Its Video Display Processor (VDP) is a Texas Instruments TMS9918A, capable of displaying up to 15 colors, and its sound processor is a Texas Instruments SN76489AN. The system includes 8 kbit (1 KB) of main RAM, and 128 kbit (16 KB) of video RAM (VRAM). The controller is hardwired to the system in the original model, and detachable in the SG-1000 II. Video and audio output are supplied through an RF switch. Power is supplied through a 9 V DC connector connected to an AC adapter.

The SC-3000 includes hardware nearly identical to the SG-1000, but includes a built-in rubber keyboard and 16 kbit (2 KB) of main RAM. The SC-3000H retains the same technical specifications as the SC-3000, but uses a plastic keyboard instead and includes some altered keycaps. BASIC cartridges containing up to 32 KB of additional RAM were available.

Several peripherals exist for the SG-1000 series. Available at ¥13,800 at its time of release, the SK-1100 keyboard connects through the expansion slot and is compatible with all models. Multiple controllers were created, including the SJ-200 joystick attached to the SG-1000, and the SJ-150 joypad, made for use with the SG-1000 II. A racing wheel known as the SH-400 was made for use with games such as &quot;Monaco GP&quot;. The C-1000 Card Catcher, sold at ¥1,000, allows players to play Sega My Card titles. Additional accessories existed solely for use with the SC-3000, including the SR-1000 cassette deck, the SP-400 4-color plotter printer, and the SF-7000 expansion device which adds a floppy disk drive and additional memory.

==Game library==


Sega&#x27;s software library for the SG-1000 and SC-3000 consists of 51 game cartridges, which includes both licensed titles from Sega and also the titles released for the licensed console from Tsukuda Original Co., Ltd. called the Othello Multivision, as well as 29 Sega My Card releases that required the Card Catcher add-on. There were also 26 educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 that could only be played on the SG-1000 with the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral. Titles for the system include &quot;Flicky&quot;, &quot;Congo Bongo&quot;, &quot;Sega-Galaga&quot;, and &quot;Girl&#x27;s Garden&quot;, the first video game programmed by &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; developer Yuji Naka. The library included licensed titles, such as &quot;Golgo 13&quot;. Packaging and game manuals came with both Japanese and English text until 1984, when manuals were switched to Japanese only and the size of the cartridge box was reduced. Hideki Sato stated that Sega lacked adequate staff to develop games for the console at the time. SC-3000/SG-1000 games were continued to be produced after the launch of the Mark III in 1985. The last two SC-3000/SG-1000 cartridge games were &quot;The Castle&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Loretta no Shōzō: Sherlock Holmes&quot; on February 18, 1987. The final Sega My Card game for the SC-3000/SG-1000 was &quot;The Black Onyx&quot;, also in 1987. In 2006, the GameTap subscription gaming service added an emulator of the SG-1000, and several playable titles.

==Reception==
The SG-1000 console series (including the Mark III) sold over units in Japan , with the original SG-1000 model having sold 400,000 units in Japan. The SC-3000 home computer model sold 120,000 units in Japan during 1983.

The SG-1000 made little impact on the video game industry, but has been recognized for being Sega&#x27;s first video game console. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writer Damien McFerran said it was an &quot;abject failure&quot;, but called it and the SG-1000 II &quot;the Japanese forefathers of the Master System&quot;. Writing for &quot;Wired&quot;, Chris Kohler criticized the poor response of the controller&#x27;s joystick and the lack of an RCA output. He said the release timing hurt its success; &quot;[al]though its graphics were of better quality than most consoles on the market, it had the bad luck to be released in the same month as Nintendo&#x27;s world-changing Famicom, which had killer apps like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and could run circles around Sega&#x27;s hardware.&quot; Of its legacy, Kohler said, &quot;Few have heard of it, even fewer have played it, and the games weren&#x27;t that great anyway.&quot; By contrast, Luke Plunkett of &quot;Kotaku&quot; recognized that &quot;while all this makes it sound like the SG-1000 was a bit of a misfire, it was still important in the development of Sega&#x27;s home console business.&quot;

Hideki Sato reflected positively on the innovations in the development of the SG-1000, but admitted that the console had limitations because of how new the market was and that Sega was inexperienced in developing for a video game console at the time. According to Sato, &quot;The problem was, while we knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development. In fact, the very idea of a “consumer” market for video games was unheard of then: back then it was just a &#x27;new business&#x27; idea.&quot;

<text>First Great Eastern was a train operating company in England owned by FirstGroup that operated the Great Eastern franchise from January 1997 until March 2004.

==Services==
First Great Eastern operated all stops and limited stops services on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria, Southminster, , Colchester Town, Clacton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze, Harwich Town and Ipswich. It also ran services on the Romford to Upminster Line and Gainsborough Line from Marks Tey to Sudbury.

==Rolling stock==
First Great Eastern inherited a fleet of Class 312, Class 315 and Class 321s from British Rail. A Class 153 was hired from Anglia Railways for the Marks Tey to Sudbury service due to it not being electrified, a Class 150 being used on weekdays and a Class 153 on weekends. Prior to this arrangement, a Class 121 &quot;Bubble Car&quot; was hired from Silverlink.

A franchise commitment was the replacement of the Class 312s. In May 2001, First Great Eastern ordered 21 Class 360 &quot;Desiros&quot; with the first entering service in August 2003.

==Depot==
First Great Eastern&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Ilford depot.

==Demise==
In 2002, as part of a franchise reorganisation by the Strategic Rail Authority, it was announced that the Great Eastern franchise would be merged into the Greater Anglia franchise. In December 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority awarded the Greater Anglia franchise to National Express, and the services operated by First Great Eastern were transferred to One (later National Express East Anglia) on 1 April 2004.

<doc id="290850" wikidata="Q216466" url="?curid=290850" title="Alejo Carpentier">
<text>Alejo Carpentier y Valmont (, ; December 26, 1904 – April 24, 1980) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous &quot;boom&quot; period. Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, of French and Russian parentage, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro&#x27;s Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies.

With a developed knowledge of music, Carpentier explored musicology, publishing an in-depth study of the music of Cuba, &quot;La música en Cuba&quot; and integrated musical themes and literary techniques throughout his works. He explored elements of Afro-Cubanism and incorporated the cultural aspects into the majority of his writings. Although Carpentier wrote in a myriad of genres, such as journalism, radio drama, playwrighting, academic essays, opera and libretto, he is best known for his novels. He was among the first practitioners of magical realism using the technique, &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot; to explore the fantastic quality of Latin American history and culture. The most famous example of Afro-Cuban influence and use of &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot; is Carpentier&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;El reino de este mundo&quot; (&quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot;) about the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century.

Carpentier&#x27;s writing style integrated the resurgent Baroque style, or &quot;New World Baroque&quot; style that Latin American artists adopted from the European model and assimilated to the Latin American artistic vision. With a first-hand experience of the French Surrealist movement, Carpentier also adapted the Surrealist theory to Latin American literature. Always eager to explore more than Cuban identity, Carpentier used his traveling experiences throughout Europe and Latin America to expand his understanding of Latin American identity. Carpentier wove elements of Latin American political history, music, social injustice and art into the tapestries of his writings, all of which exerted a decisive influence on the works of younger Latin American and Cuban writers like Lisandro Otero, Leonardo Padura and Fernando Velázquez Medina.

Carpentier died in Paris, France, in 1980 and was buried in Havana&#x27;s Colon Cemetery with other Cuban political and artistic luminaries.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Carpentier was born on December 26, 1904, in Lausanne, Switzerland, to Jorge Julián Carpentier, a French architect, and Lina Valmont, a Russian language teacher. For a long time it was believed that he was born in Havana, where his family moved immediately after his birth; however, following Carpentier&#x27;s death, his birth certificate was found in Switzerland.

In 1912, Alejo and his family moved from Cuba to Paris. As an adolescent, he read Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola. In 1921, Carpentier attended the School of Architecture of the University of Havana. When he was 18, his parents&#x27; marriage broke up and his father left. The following year, Carpentier left his studies and tried to find work to support his mother. He turned to journalism, working for the Cuban newspapers &quot;Carteles&quot; and &quot;Social&quot;. He also studied music.

Though bilingual from an early age, Carpentier always spoke Spanish with a marked French accent.

===Cuba and exile in France===
In 1921, while studying in Havana, Carpentier became a cultural journalist, writing mostly about avant-garde developments in the arts, particularly music.&quot; He contributed columns to &quot;La Discusión&quot;, a daily journal from Havana. His journalistic work, which was considered leftist, helped establish the first Cuban Communist Party.
During 1923 and 1924 he continued to work as a columnist and also edited musical and theatre reviews for &quot;La Discusión&quot; and &quot;El Heraldo de Cuba&quot;. In 1927, with the help of Jorge Mañach, Juan Marinello, Francisco Ichaso, and Martí Casanovas, he became a founding member of &quot;Revista de Avance&quot;, a magazine devoted to nationalism, radicalism and new ideas in the arts.

The first issue appeared on March 15, 1927; it lasted until September 15, 1930, and became the &quot;voice of the vanguard&quot; and the primary voice of expression of the Cuban movement. Because of his involvement in such projects, Carpentier was often suspected of having subversive and ultramodern cultural ideas. Carpentier was arrested in 1927 for opposing Gerardo Machado y Morales dictatorship and had signed a democratic and anti-imperialist manifesto against Machado&#x27;s regime and, as a result, spent forty days in jail. During this brief period in jail he started working on his first novel, &quot;Ecué-Yamba-O&quot;, an exploration of Afro-Cuban traditions among the poor of the island. (The book was eventually completed in 1933.)

After his release, he escaped Cuba with the help of journalist Robert Desnos who lent him his passport and papers. Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he was fortunate enough to avoid the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave.

During this time abroad, his disconnection from Cuba and the interaction with different groups of intellectuals and artists in Paris helped with his &quot;critical vision&quot;. Carpentier felt that it was important for him to remain outside the influences of movements because he believed in maintaining a &quot;balance against the insularity of his homeland&quot;. Upon arriving in Paris he immediately began working on poems and editorials in Parisian and Cuban magazines. Contributions to the Parisian Journal such as the short story &quot;Cahiers du Sud&quot; (1933), in French, were an effort to acquire European readers as a way to improve his recognition. He also contributed to the magazines &quot;Documents&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;. Carpentier was familiar with the activities of the &quot;Comité de Jeunes Revolutionnaires Cubains&quot;, a group of exiled Cuban leftists who had published &quot;La Terreur á Cuba&quot;, a brochure against the Machado government. He documented the latest news about this group and their activities in his book &quot;Homenaje a nuestros amigos de Paris&quot;. It was also during this time that, with the help of Robert Desnos, Carpentier became part of the surrealist movement which became a positive influence in his work. While in France, Carpentier also founded a literary magazine called &quot;Imán&quot; in 1931, for which he became editor-in-chief. Most of the authors who worked with him in &quot;La Revolution Surrealiste&quot; also contributed works in &quot;Imán&quot; under the title &quot;Conocimiento de America&quot;. Carpentier contributed the short story &quot;Histoire de Lunes&quot; (1933); it was experimental for its time as it contained elements of fantasy and folklore characterized as magical reality.

Surrealism helped Carpentier to see contexts and aspects, especially those of American life, which he did not see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his &quot;surrealist attempts ha[d] been in vain&quot; describing his frustration, as he felt he had &quot;nothing to add to this movement in France&quot;.

As Carpentier became acquainted with those among the arts community he had several encounters to meet other famous authors such as Pablo Neruda, who had sent him a draft of his book &quot;Residencia en la Tierra&quot; to review; Guatemalan author Miguel Ángel Asturias, whose work on pre-Columbian mythology influenced his writing; and Pablo Picasso, an introduction made possible through Carpentier&#x27;s connection with friends in the arts.

Throughout his time in France Carpentier was occupied with not only literary works, but also other projects that kept him engaged within the arts. He collaborated with French composer Marins François Gaillard on the musical &quot;Yamba-O&quot;, &quot;a burlesque tragedy&quot;, that was presented in the &quot;Théâtre Beriza&quot; in Paris (1928); and with composer Amadeo Roldán helped organize the Cuban premieres of works by Stravinsky and Poulenc. In film, Carpentier wrote text and edited music for the French documentary &quot;Le Vaudou&quot;. He continued to earn his living by writing on contemporary culture, both in French and Spanish. He also began working for a French radio station as a sound-technician and producer. From 1932 until 1939 Carpentier worked on several projects produced by Foniric Studios. He directed the production of &quot;Le Livre de Christophe Colomb&quot; and collaborated with Desnos on arranging readings of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, and Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Salute to the World&quot;. Although abroad, Carpentier still maintained contact with Cuba by sending articles and poems to contribute to Havana publications such as &quot;Ensayos Convergentes&quot;.

When the Machado regime came to an end in 1933, Carpentier decided to make plans to return to his native land to visit, and in 1936 he made the trip back to Cuba. The time he had spent in Paris for over eleven years had enriched and &quot;oriented his expressive abilities&quot;. Carpentier himself indicated that he was tiring of Paris, and &quot;...in 1939 without any other reason than the nostalgia of Cuba, I vacated my apartment and started the return to La Habana&quot;.

=== Years in Haiti and return to Cuba ===

In 1943, accompanied by French theatrical director Louis Jouvet, Carpentier made a crucial trip to Haiti, during which he visited the fortress of the Citadelle Laferrière and the Palace of Sans-Souci, both built by the black king Henri Christophe. This trip, along with readings from Oswald Spengler&#x27;s cyclical interpretation of history, provided the inspiration for his second novel, &quot;El Reino de Este Mundo&quot; &quot;(The Kingdom of this World)&quot; (1949).

Carpentier returned to Cuba and continued to work as a journalist at the outbreak of World War II. He worked on a history of Cuban music, eventually published in 1946 as &quot;La música en Cuba&quot;.

=== Life in Venezuela ===

In 1945, Carpentier moved to Caracas as an exile. From 1945 to 1959 he lived in Venezuela, which is the inspiration for the unnamed South American country in which much of his novel &quot;The Lost Steps&quot; takes place.

He wrote short stories which were later collected in &quot;The War of Time&quot; (1958). While in Cuba, Carpentier attended a &quot;santería&quot; ceremony that was to further deepen his interest in Afro-Cubanism. In 1949, he finished his novel &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot;. This novel has a prologue that &quot;outlines Carpentier&#x27;s faith in the destiny of Latin America and the aesthetic implications of its peculiar cultural heritage.&quot;

===Later life===
Carpentier returned to Cuba after the triumph of the revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959. He worked for the State Publishing House while he completed the baroque-style book, &quot;El Siglo de las Luces&quot; &quot;(Explosion in a Cathedral)&quot; (1962). This novel discusses the advent of the Enlightenment and the ideas of the French Revolution in the New World. It has twin leitmotifs of the printing press and the guillotine and can be read as a &quot;meditation on the dangers inherent in all revolutions as they begin to confront the temptations of dictatorship.&quot; After reading the book, Gabriel García Márquez is said to have discarded the first draft of &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; and begun again from scratch.

In 1966, Carpentier settled in Paris where he served as Cuban ambassador to France. In 1975 he was the recipient of the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. He received the Cervantes Prize in 1977 and was recipient of the French Laureates Prix Médicis étranger in 1979 for &quot;La harpe et l&#x27;ombre&quot;. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, Carpentier was first nominated for the award in 1965.

Carpentier was struggling with cancer as he completed his final novel, &quot;El arpa y la sombra&quot;, and finally died in Paris on April 24, 1980. His remains were returned to Cuba for interment in the Colon Cemetery, Havana.

&quot;École Française de la Havane &quot;Alejo Carpentier&quot;&quot;, a French international school in Havana, is named after him.

==Themes==

===&quot;Lo real maravilloso&quot;===
Carpentier is widely known for his theory of &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot;. This is the notion that the history and the geography of Latin America are both so extreme as to appear fictional or even magical to outsiders. Thus, Latin America is a region where the line between magic and reality is blurred. It was in the prologue to &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot;, a novel of the Haitian Revolution, that he described his vision of &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot;: &quot;But what is the history of Latin America but a chronicle of magical realism?&quot; The novel itself develops the outlandish (but true) history of Henri Christophe, first king of Haiti, as an example of how the real history of Latin America is so strange as to appear fictional. Some critics interpret the &quot;real maravilloso&quot; as being synonymous with magical realism. However, Carpentier&#x27;s theory and its development in his work are more limited in their scope than is the magical realism of, for example, Gabriel García Márquez. Whereas García Márquez&#x27;s works include events that the reader never mistakes for reality (rainfall of flowers, old men with wings, etc.), Carpentier, for the most part, simply writes about extreme aspects of the history and geography of Latin America, aspects that are almost unbelievable, but that are in fact true.

===Music===
As a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under Pablo Casals, and his grandmother played the organ. Carpentier studied music theory at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time. Carpentier&#x27;s own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes.

Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was Amadeo Roldán, a French musician of Cuban background. They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era &quot;Conciertos de música nueva&quot; (&quot;Concerts of New Music&quot;), featuring composers such as Stravinsky, Milhaud, Ravel, Malipiero, Poulenc and Satie. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Roldán were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. &quot;¡Abajo la lira, arriba el bongó!&quot; (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Roldán collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece &quot;Obertura sobre temas cubanos&quot; (&quot;Overture on Cuban Themes&quot;) which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music. Other well-known collaborations between the two included &quot;Tres pequeñas poemas: Oriente, Pregón, Fiesta negra&quot; (&quot;Three little poems&quot;) produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: &quot;La Rebambaramba&quot;, a colonial ballet in two parts (1928) and &quot;El milagro de Anaquille&quot; (1929).

Carpentier&#x27;s interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier&#x27;s works are more listeners than they are readers. Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music&#x27;s influence over Carpentier&#x27;s work. In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying &quot;Music is present in all of my work.&quot; For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music. As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing.

===Ethnomusicology and Afro-Cubanism===
With this intrinsic appreciation of music and a fascination with Cuban identity, Carpentier began investigating the origins of Cuban music in a more academic sense. In 1946, Carpentier published the ethnomusicological study &quot;La Música en Cuba&quot; which explores how European music, transplanted African music and the indigenous music of the island all blended together to create Cuban music. Carpentier took particular interest in Afro-Cuban themes.

Particularly fascinated with the overwhelming influence of African music in Cuban music, Carpentier introduced Afro-Cuban influenced music called &quot;lo afrocubano&quot;, (i.e. heavily improvised and rhythm based music) into what was deemed more formal music venues dependent on European styles, called &quot;lo guajiro&quot;. Carpentier once wrote that &quot;lo guajiro&quot; was, &quot;very poetic, but &quot;lo guajiro&quot; is not music...On the other hand, in mestizo and black music...the rich material has an incredible wealth to it...to make it the work of national expression.&quot; Because of racial tensions between white Cubans and black and criollo Cubans, such preferences were not well received by the Cuban elite of the mid century. Carpentier devoted the majority of his musicology research to the Afro-Cuban influences present in Cuba. For example, Carpentier paid particular attention to Contradanza, a wildly popular Cuban dance derived from the European style of music and dance, Contredanse. The ample room left for musical improvisation and the element of group dance were easily adapted into African musical tradition where improvisation and dance play integral roles. Hence, a hybrid musical form unique to Cuba was created. Carpentier argued that the improvisation inherent in African influenced music allowed for varied interpretations that catalyzed regional differences and therefore regional identity, and concluded that this was why Cuba had such a varied musical identity.

===&quot;El reino de este mundo&quot; (&quot;The Kingdom of This World&quot;)===
Carpentier&#x27;s &quot;El reino de este mundo&quot; (1949) highlights the Haitian Revolution of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights. The novel combines not only historical references of the event with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably Haitian vodou; but also the connections between corporeal and spiritual self. The story is seen through the eyes of the protagonist Ti Noël, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published on the subject of the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti Noël&#x27;s point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping. Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the Sans-Souci Palace and the fortress of La Ferrière.

===&quot;La música en Cuba&quot; (&quot;The Music of Cuba&quot;)===

&quot;La música en Cuba&quot; (&quot;The Music of Cuba&quot;) is an ethno-musicological study of the Music of Cuba starting from the sixteenth century with the arrival of European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different cultures—black, white, mulattoes, criollos and natives—mirrors the blending of Cuba&#x27;s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island. The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, &quot;Los Negros&quot; (&quot;The Blacks&quot;) that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th- and 19th-century Cuba. At the time of the book&#x27;s publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it. Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba&#x27;s past and integral relationships with a wide range of cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.

===&quot;Guerra del tiempo&quot; (&quot;The War of Time&quot;)===

&quot;Guerra del tiempo&quot; (&quot;The War of Time&quot;) is a set of surrealistic short stories, in a variety of styles, which evidences Carpentier&#x27;s ability to work with the fantastic and the surreal. The most important is the first one, &quot;El Camino de Santiago&quot; (The Way of Santiago), which narrates the adventures of a commoner, a Spaniard in the Age of Discovery, who is today a soldier, tomorrow pilgrim, then a sailor, a colonizer, prisoner, and so on; he pursues every dream and suffers every disappointment. The second tale is called &quot;Viaje a la semilla&quot; (Journey Back to the Source). This narrative is striking for the function of the time inversion that the narrator operates to tell the life of the main character, Don Marcial (Marqués de Capellanías).

=== &quot;El Acoso&quot; (&quot;The Chase&quot;) ===

Carpentier&#x27;s &quot;El Acoso&quot; was originally published in Spanish in 1956. It was translated into American English by Alfred MacAdam as &quot;The Chase&quot; and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1989, after over three decades of suppression in the United States for Carpentier&#x27;s affiliation with Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba (Carpentier had been Cuba&#x27;s ambassador to France during this time). The novel is one of the most influential novels in contemporary Latin American literature, cited by authors such as Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, José Donoso and others as a major influence in the movement known in North America as Latin American Magical Realism, though this identification is somewhat misleading (see section above on Carpentier&#x27;s theory of &quot;Lo real maravilloso&quot;) as Carpentier, in his &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot;, makes a point of referring to actual events that are so fantastic they seem magical, while the Magic Realists used Surrealist techniques and invent completely imaginary events with only the most tenuous connection to history or real events. As for &quot;El Acoso&quot;, the novel is highly compressed, richly atmospheric, philosophical, stylistically brilliant, and non-linear; plot is treated almost as an inconsequential side-effect. Though short (121 pages in its English translation), the novel exhibits a certain labyrinthine quality as its fragmented narrative cycles and circles in upon itself. Ostensibly a man is being chased by somewhat shadowy, probably sinister, perhaps governmental, forces. The action starts on a rainy night at a symphonic concert and music plays a part in the clues necessary to piece together what is happening. &quot;The Chase&quot; is perhaps Carpentier&#x27;s strongest novel, and easily one of the better novels written in the 20th century, though it is almost unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of MacAdam&#x27;s superb 1989 translation.

=== &quot;El arpa y la sombra&quot; (&quot;The Harp and the Shadow&quot;) ===
&quot;The Harp and the Shadow&quot; is a historic novel (also considered the first novel in the literary style of La nueva crónica de Indias) published in 1979. It follows two attempts by popes Pius IX and Leo XIII to beatify Christopher Columbus, both of which eventually fail. The second part of the novel, which is considerably longer than the other two, is a confession by Columbus, to be given to a Franciscan confessor. Raymond L. Williams sees the novel as &quot;a fictional narrative about the life of Christopher Columbus and his fate as a historical figure. This novel is laden with allusions to Western literary tradition, from classical antiquity to modern Caribbean&quot;. James J. Pancrazio writes that &quot;the confession is ironic because it never occurs; when the priest arrives to administer the Last Rites, Columbus, after painstakingly contemplating his life, decides that he has nothing to confess. In this regard, the mediation of guilt, not repentance, is what structures the confession.&quot;

==Style==

===Baroque===
The Baroque style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is most often defined as &quot;the dominant style of art in Europe between the Mannerist and Rococo eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric&quot;. Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes &quot;el barroco&quot; as &quot;un espíritu&quot;, and not &quot;un estilo histórico&quot; (&quot;a spirit, not an historical style&quot;). Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier&#x27;s background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story. Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: &quot;first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship&quot;.

This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early &quot;Ecue-Yamba-O&quot; to the celebrated &quot;El reino de este mundo&quot;, regarding Carpentier&#x27;s use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of &quot;nativism&quot; by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use.

Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the &quot;New World Baroque&quot;, since Latin America didn&#x27;t come into contact with the Enlightenment or &quot;European modernity&quot;. This &quot;contraconquista&quot; (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them. As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that &quot;American Baroque develop[ed] along with &quot;criollo&quot; culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a &quot;criollo&quot;; and the &quot;criollo&quot; spirit is itself a Baroque spirit.&quot; This &quot;criollo&quot; of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America.

===Influence of travel===
Wakefield notes that Carpentier&#x27;s diverse travels were motivated by his need to incorporate the sights he experienced into familiar descriptions within his novels. Carpentier&#x27;s &quot;El reino de este mundo&quot; was inspired by his 1943 trip to Haiti, and &quot;Los pasos perdidos&quot; drew on his visit to Venezuela in 1949. Similarly, his travels to Guadeloupe and the Gulf of Santa Fe inspired &quot;El siglo de las luces&quot;, and Vera and Enrique&#x27;s firsthand descriptions of Baku and Mexico in &quot;La consegración de la primavera&quot; were drawn from Carpentier&#x27;s trips to those places.

===Surrealism===
During his visit to France early in his life, Carpentier met and collaborated with many figures of the French Surrealist movement. Taken with Surrealist theory, Carpentier absorbed much of it from his contemporaries, mainly his friend and colleague, the Parisian journalist Robert Desnos. Striving to portray unlikely beauty, termed, &quot;the third beauty&quot;, Surrealist theory embraced unique perspectives of the world. Within the Surrealist theory was the concept of Primitivism or a reverence for presiding folkloric tradition. Carpentier, inspired by French Surrealists, learned to view his Cuban home in this new light. He left France with a bursting sense of Cuban and Latin American pride and the artistic goal to capture what it meant to be both.

<text>Prince Joachim of Denmark, Count of Monpezat, (; Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian; born 7 June 1969) is a member of the Danish royal family. The younger son of Queen Margrethe II, he is fifth in the line of succession to the Danish throne, following the four children of his elder brother King Frederik X.

==Early life==
Prince Joachim was born on 7 June 1969 at Rigshospitalet, part of the Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen. He was christened Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian on 15 July 1969 in Aarhus Cathedral, the first member of the royal family to have been christened outside of Copenhagen. His godparents were his maternal aunt, Princess Benedikte of Denmark; his paternal uncle, Jean Baptiste de Laborde de Monpezat; his mother&#x27;s first cousin, Princess Christina of Sweden; and King Harald V (then Crown Prince of Norway).

Prince Joachim attended school as a private pupil from 1974 until 1976 at Amalienborg Palace and then from 1976 until 1982 at Krebs&#x27; Skole in Copenhagen. In the period 1982–1983 the Prince studied as a boarder at École des Roches in Normandy, France. In 1986, Prince Joachim graduated from Øregård Gymnasium. In 1993, he completed his studies in agrarian economics at Den Classenske Agerbrugskole Næsgaard. The Prince&#x27;s first language is Danish, but he also speaks French (his father&#x27;s language), English and German.

==Schackenborg==
In 1993, Prince Joachim took over the estate of Schackenborg Castle in the town of Møgeltønder, in Southern Jutland, having been granted the estate in the will of Count Hans Schack in 1978.

Joachim and his first wife, now the Countess of Frederiksborg, received 13 million DKK collected by the people of Denmark as a national gift, reserved for restoration of the estate. The restoration was completed in 1999. The couple was divorced in 2005, whereupon Countess Alexandra moved with their two sons to Copenhagen. Joachim remained at Schackenborg – from 2007 alongside his second wife – until 2014 when the estate was handed over to the Schackenborg Foundation, which consists of Prince Joachim, Bitten and Mads Clausens foundation, Ole Kirks Foundation, and Ecco Holding. Joachim, Marie and their children moved from the castle to Klampenborg, north of Copenhagen, but still holiday at the castle. In 2023, they sold their home at Klampenborg and purchased a home at Vedbaek.

==Military career==
=== As junior officer===
In 1987, Joachim enlisted as a recruit in the Queen&#x27;s Life Regiment, where from he first entered the NCO School and where after the lieutenant school. Between 1989 and 1990, he served as platoon commander in the 3rd tank squadron/1st Battalion (3/I/PLR) of the Prince&#x27;s Life Regiment.

In 1992 He entered the Royal Danish Military Academy&#x27;s course for reserve officers to become a captain.

Between 1996 and 2004, he served as squadron commander of 3rd tank squadron/2nd Battalion (3/II/PLR) also in the Prince&#x27;s Life Regiment.

=== As senior officer===
In 2005 he was an staff officer in the staff of Danske Division and from 2011 He was liaison officer at the Defence Region of Fuen and South Jutland.

In 2015, Joachim was appointed special advisor to the Chief of Defense in the Royal Danish Army.

During the summer of 2019, Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their two children moved to Paris, France, while the Prince had been admitted to the highest-ranking military educational program at École Militaire by invitation from the French Minister of Defense. Prince Joachim graduated on 26 June 2020, being the first Danish Officer to complete the two-part special education.

=== As general officer and Denmark&#x27;s military attaché to France ===
Earlier in June 2020, Minister of Defence Trine Bramsen promoted the Prince to Brigadier General due to his new acquired educational merits at École Militaire. He was subsequently named Military Attaché at the Royal Danish Embassy in Paris, France, by the Danish Ministry of Defense, a position he was expected to hold for at least three years while maintaining his patronages and royal engagements in Denmark when possible. Joachim commenced his new position on 1 September 2020.

On 24 July 2020, while on holiday in Château de Cayx, Prince Joachim was admitted to Toulouse University Hospital for surgery on a blood clot in his brain. He was discharged from hospital in early August.

===Denmark&#x27;s military attaché to the United States===
In March 2023, it was announced that Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their two younger children would be moving to Washington, D.C. where the Prince would be taking up the role of defense industry attaché at the Danish Embassy from September 2023.

==Marriages and children==

===First marriage===
On 18 November 1995, at Frederiksborg Palace Church in Hillerød, near Copenhagen, Joachim married Alexandra Christina Manley, a Hong Kong-born former sales and marketing deputy chief executive of English, Chinese, and Austrian ancestry. The couple had two sons, Count Nikolai and Count Felix.

The couple announced their separation on 16 September 2004; their divorce was final on 8 April 2005. The couple shared custody of their sons until they came of age. Alexandra received the title of Countess of Frederiksborg, and was permitted to retain the courtesy title of princess pending remarriage. She subsequently remarried and forfeited the royal title, but retained the title of countess. She continues to live in Denmark.

===Second marriage===
On 3 October 2007, the Danish court announced that Prince Joachim had become engaged to French native Marie Cavallier. Their wedding took place on 24 May 2008 in Møgeltønder Church near Schackenborg Castle. The wedding date marked the 73rd anniversary of the wedding of Joachim&#x27;s grandparents, King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark. The couple have two children, Count Henrik and Countess Athena.

None of Joachim&#x27;s four children have been styled as Royal Highnesses but simply as &quot;Highnesses&quot; per the Danish court. From 1 January 2023 all four of his children are known as His or Her Excellency Count/Countess of Monpezat. They no longer hold a princely title. The prince expressed his sadness at his mother&#x27;s decision to make that change.

==Interests==
Joachim enjoys historic motor sports car racing and has participated in the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix multiple times.

In 2019, Joachim presented the documentary series &quot;Prins Joachim fortæller&quot; for Danmarks Radio. In the six-part series that he also co-produced, Joachim investigates the ideas and events that shaped Denmark&#x27;s history.

<text>Édouard Adolphe Drumont (3 May 1844 – 5 February 1917) was a French journalist, author and politician, most often remembered for his antisemitic ideology and animus. He initiated the Antisemitic League of France in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; (founded in 1892). After spending years of research, he synthesised three major types of antisemitism. The first type was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the alien &quot;Christ killers&quot; augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second type was hostility toward capitalism. The third type was so-called scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and asserting that Jews have negative characteristics. His work played a key role in catalyzing the Dreyfus Affair.

Drumont&#x27;s biographer, Grégoire Kauffmann, places Drumont within the counter-revolutionary tradition of Louis Veuillot, Antoine Blanc de Saint-Bonnet, and anti-modern Catholicism. Socialist leader Jean Jaurès stated that &quot;all the ideas and arguments of Drumont were taken from certain clerical opponents of the French Revolution.

==Early life==
Drumont was born in Paris in 1844 to a family of porcelain-painters from Lille. His father died when he was seventeen, and had to care for himself and earn his own livelihood from then onwards. He attended high school at Lycée Charlemagne.

==Public career==
He first worked in government service and at one point became a police spy for Napoleon III. Later he became a contributor to the press and was the author of a number of works, of which &quot;Mon vieux Paris&quot; (1879) was awarded by the French Academy. He also worked for Louis Veuillot&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Univers&quot;.

Drumont&#x27;s 1886 book, &quot;La France juive&quot; (&quot;Jewish France&quot;), attacked the role of Jews in France and argued for their exclusion from society. In 1892, Drumont initiated the newspaper the &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; which became known for intense antisemitism. 
Gaston Méry was soon made editor in chief due to his skill in exploiting scandalous affairs and his daring invective.
The newspaper took &quot;France for the French&quot; as its motto.
The newspaper was skeptical of Léo Taxil&#x27;s anti-Catholic &quot;Diana Vaughan&quot; hoax before Taxil admitted it in 1897. It was the first paper to publish news of Alfred Dreyfus&#x27;s arrest, in an article titled “High Treason: The Jewish Traitor Alfred Dreyfus Arrested” in 1894.

Initially, Drumont was a supporter of Pope Leo XIII and his policy of &quot;ralliement&quot; in his encyclical of 1892, &quot;Au milieu des sollicitudes&quot; which called for French Catholics to embrace the Republic. He soon denounced this course and bitterly insulted the Pope, the Church, and any Catholic who supported it. In one editorial Drumont hoped for a &quot;modern iron-fisted Nogaret for the modern Boniface VIII&quot;. In &quot;La Libre Parole&quot; Drumont&#x27;s old friend Count Adrien Albert Marie de Mun and Papal Nuncio Cardinal Domenico Ferrata were denounced liked common criminals. 

For the French legislative election of May 1898, the antisemitic activist Max Régis endorsed Drumont before this election from Algiers.
On 8 May 1898, Édouard Drumont was elected triumphantly with 11,557 votes against 2,328 and 1,741 for his opponents.
Of six Algerian national deputies, four were elected on the platform of Regis&#x27;s Anti-Jewish League.
Drumont represented Algiers in the Chamber of Deputies from 1898 to 1902. He was sued for accusing a parliamentary deputy of having accepted a bribe from the wealthy Jewish banker Édouard Alphonse de Rothschild to pass a piece of legislation the banker wanted.

Drumont had many devotees. He exploited the Panama Company scandal and reached the maximum of his notoriety during the Dreyfus Affair, in which he was the most strident of Alfred Dreyfus&#x27; accusers.

For his anti-Panama articles, Drumont was condemned to three months&#x27; imprisonment. In 1893, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the representation of Amiens; the next year he retired to Brussels. The Dreyfus affair helped him to regain popularity, and in 1898, he returned to France and was elected deputy for the first division of Algiers, but was defeated as a candidate for re-election in April–May 1902.

<doc id="290854" wikidata="Q2914803" url="?curid=290854" title="Ostap Bender">
<text>Ostap Bender () is a fictional con man and the central antiheroic protagonist in the novels &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; (1931) written by Soviet authors Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov. The novels belong to the picaresque novel genre, which was previously rare in Russian literature. In &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; he called himself Ostap-Suleyman-Berta-Maria-Bender-[[Bey]], in &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; he called himself Bender-Zadunaysky, and he was called Ostap Ibragimovich by one of his companions.

Bender is an attractive, resourceful crook, full of energy while operating within the law (&quot;Bender knew 400 relatively legal ways to make the population part with their money.&quot;); his description as &quot;The Great Combinator&quot; became a catchphrase in the Russian language.

His exploits have been enjoyed by readers throughout the Soviet times and in modern Russia. In post-Soviet times Bender&#x27;s character was elevated from the status of a con man to that of an entrepreneur. His statues may be found in several cities, and a commemorative plaque was set in Odesa, the city of his birth.

==Appearances==
&quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; was released in January 1928.

In the first novel, Ostap Bender searches for a stash of diamonds hidden in one of the twelve eponymous chairs. The action takes place in the Soviet Union in 1927 during the New Economic Policy era. At the end of the novel, Bender is killed by his partner, Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, who does not want to share the treasure when it seems like they are about to reach their goal.

In the second novel, &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot;, published in 1931, Bender is alive, he says, because &quot;surgeons barely saved my life&quot;, Ilf and Petrov having conjured the character&#x27;s death away retroactively. This book provided an extended satire on certain elements of Soviet life. Here, Bender follows Soviet underground multi-millionaire Koreiko, hoping to acquire some of his riches and thus amass a fortune. Bender gets his money, but soon discovers he cannot spend it in the USSR. He proceeds to lose it as he attempts to flee the country by crossing the border into Romania.

Film-makers have produced a number of screen adaptations of the novels; see &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; adaptations and &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; adaptations. Over the years, the part was played on screen by Frank Langella (The Twelve Chairs (1970 film)), Archil Gomiashvili (The Twelve Chairs (1971 film)), Andrei Mironov (actor) (The Twelve Chairs (1976 film)), Sergei Yursky (The Golden Calf (1968 film)), Oleg Menshikov (The Little Golden Calf, 2006), etc.

==Character==
Ostap Bender&#x27;s origins are mysterious; he mentions only that his father was &quot;a Turkish subject&quot;, his mother was &quot;a Countess and received unearned income&quot; and that his full name is Ostap-Suleyman-Berta-Maria-Bender-Bey (Остап-Сулейман-Берта-Мария-Бендер-Бей). In the comments to the &quot;Complete Works&quot; of Ilf and Petrov by M. Odessky and D. Feldman, this phrase is explained as a hint to his supposed Jewish origin from a port city in Novorossiya, most probably Odesa, where many Jews claimed Turkish citizenship to evade discrimination and conscription for military service. Some of them indeed held Turkish citizenship, such as Julius Martov.

In &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot;, Ostap Bender is also called &quot;Бендер-Задунайский&quot; (&quot;Bender-Zadunaisky&quot;, literally: &quot;Bender-Trans-Danubian&quot;) and &quot;Остап Ибрагимович&quot; (Ostap Ibragimovich, where &quot;Ibragimovich&quot; is a patronymic, literally meaning &quot;son of Ibrahim&quot;). The city of Bender and the Danube river are historically and geographically close to both the large regional city of Odesa and the former Ottoman (Turkish) Empire.

Bender dreams of travelling to Rio de Janeiro, &quot;the city of his dreams&quot;, while admitting the futility of that obsession.

There were a number of possible prototypes for Bender, most famously Ostap (Osip) Shor (1899–1978), a friend of the authors who spent his youth in Odesa gaining money as a con man and then—as a Cheka inspector. He was a good story-teller, and many of his tales inspired the adventures of Ostap Bender. Valentin Kataev who came up with the idea for the novel (which, in turn, is dedicated to him) is named as another prototype; he also led an adventurous life and was known as a literary hoaxer, adding many original touches to the biography of Osip Shor whom he saw as fitting the readers&#x27; expectations of a &quot;real-life combinator&quot;.

Another suggested influence was the character of Alexander Ametistov from Mikhail Bulgakov&#x27;s play &quot;Zoyka&#x27;s Flat&quot; that had been written and staged in 1926, before the work on &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; was even started. Also an elegant con man with many names and occupations, he is seen as a direct inspiration by a number of modern researches, to the point that some of them believe that both novels were ghostwritten by Bulgakov.

===Bender&#x27;s leadership===
The entrepreneurial abilities of Bender attracted attention of researchers in management. Parallels have been drawn of Bender&#x27;s schemes with failures of businesses in early post-Soviet Russia, a period compared to that of NEP when Bender operated. 
Bender is educated and has an analytical mind; is full of energy; in the case of a failure keeps his optimism and has an ability to reassess the situation; has an empathy towards his subordinates, opponents and &quot;marks&quot;; has exceptional organizational skills, even when limited by scarce resources.

While Bender is endowed with many traits of a charismatic leader, it was concluded that the major reason of his failures was lack of clear understanding of his own goals and needs, and short-term perspective. A serious drawback of Bender as a leader is his paternalism. Also, while he is aware of the drawbacks of his companions, he puts no efforts into their betterment. While at times he can be a motivational speaker, he did not care about the long-term motivation of his subordinates; instead, he preferred to manipulate or simply force them.

==Cultural influence==
A chapter in &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; was called &quot;The Great Combinator&quot; (&quot;Великий комбинатор&quot;, &quot;The Great Schemer&quot;). It was one of the choices for the title of the book. Since then the expression &quot;the great combinator&quot; came to refer in Russian culture either a con man or to an enterprising person.

One of the attractions of Bender is the witty language of the novels which produced numerous catchphrases:
*&quot;Maybe I should also give you the key to the flat where I keep my money?&quot; (&quot;Может быть, тебе дать ещё ключ от квартиры, где деньги лежат?&quot;) – it became a cliche rebuke to unreasonable requests.
*&quot;Stay strong. The West will help us.&quot; (&quot;Крепитесь. Запад нам поможет.&quot;) – now an ironical hint that a situation is hopeless. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ironical meaning has become nearly literal.
*&quot;Money in the morning, chairs in the evening.&quot; (&quot;Утром деньги, вечером стулья.&quot;) – now a jocular hint to payment in advance.
*&quot;The task of helping the drowning people is in the hands of the drowning people themselves.&quot; (&quot;Спасение утопающих — дело рук самих утопающих&quot;.) – &quot;not our business&quot; Notably, this quote was cited in the situation when Russia was trying to attract foreign investors, while Russia&#x27;s own capital was fleeing the country.
*&quot;The ice has broken, ladies and gentlemen of the jury!&quot; (&quot;Лёд тронулся, господа присяжные заседатели!&quot;) – said to declare the onset of a progress in something after a period of deadlock, uncertainty, or stagnation.
*To cover up his activities, Bender created the fake office named &quot;Horns and Hooves&quot; (&quot;Рога и копыта&quot;). This name in Russian is used to describe shell companies and other small dubious organizations.

<text>Mansalay, officially the Municipality of Mansalay (), is a municipality in the province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 59,114 people.

This town is notable for its indigenous Mangyan population. The municipal hall is located on the upper land of Mansalay Town proper, in front of a Medical Care Hospital. Nearby is the church and the only Catholic School, Mansalay Catholic High School. Santa Catalina is the town&#x27;s patron saint.

The town also has a wide ammonite formation area discovered in the 1940s. Since then, thousands of ammonite fossils have been discovered. Due to the complexity and vastness of the collection found in the area, the town has been called the &quot;Ammonite Capital of the Philippines&quot;. Various local and international scientific institutions have conducted research on the ammonite formations of Mansalay. Scholars have argued that due to the natural significance of the area to Southeast Asian pre-history, the site has a big chance of being declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site or a UNESCO Geopark Reserve. It is from Calapan.

== History ==
The etymology of Mansalay is thought of to have originated from a conversation between the indigenous datu of Mansalay at the time, Abucay, and Spanish conquistadores. When Spanish conquistadors arrived at present-day Mansalay, they inquired the datu of Mansalay, Abucay, about the name of the area. To which, Datu Abucay responded with the phrase: &quot;Man may malay&quot; in the indigenous language which meant &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Indicating the failure of Datu Abucay to understand the inquiry of the Spanish conquistadors. Subsequently, they (Spanish conquistadors) thought that Abucay gave the real name of the area in spite of the clear language barrier. Henceforth, Spanish conquistadors recorded the area&#x27;s name as &quot;Mansalay&quot;.

Prior to the Spanish arrival, and eventual colonisation in the Philippines, Mansalay was inhabited by migrants from nearby islands in the Philippine archipelago such as Palawan and Panay.

During the Spanish colonisation of the Philippines, Mansalay was under the jurisdiction of the government of &quot;Mangarin, Mindoro&quot;. (present-day San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.)

In the year of 1901, during the Philippine-American War, Mansalay was occupied by American forces.

On 24 July 1929, Mansalay was made its own municipality by a bill authored by Mariano Leuterio, representative at the time for Mindoro. Teotimo P. Cusi became the first Municipal-President. 

During the later-Interwar years, Mansalay attracted migrants from provinces in Central Luzon, Batangas, Romblon, and Capiz.

On 16 December 1944, Mansalay was liberated by American troops from the Japanese occupation forces in the Battle of Mindoro

<doc id="290885" wikidata="Q7874365" url="?curid=290885" title="USS Starr">
<text>USS &quot;Starr&quot; (AKA-67) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was sold into commercial service and scrapped in 1970.

==History==
&quot;Stokes&quot; was named for Starr County, Texas. Her keel was laid down as a Type C2-S-AJ3 ship on 13 June 1944 (as MC hull 1392), under Maritime Commission contract, by North Carolina Shipbuilding Company of Wilmington, North Carolina. She was launched on 18 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. C. L. Griffin and acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration on a bareboat charter; and was commissioned on 29 September 1944.

===World War II, 1944–1945===
&quot;Starr&quot; completed fitting out at Charleston, South Carolina, and sailed on 31 October for the Chesapeake Bay on her shakedown cruise. After loading cargo, she stood out of Norfolk, Virginia, on 27 November and proceeded, via the Panama Canal, to the Pacific. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 December 1944 and remained there until after Christmas. &quot;Starr&quot; participated in amphibious landing exercises during the first week of January and then entered Kahului Harbor, Maui, for combat loading.

&quot;Starr&quot; joined a large convoy and sailed west on 27 January, stopping at Eniwetok for two days, before proceeding to Saipan, where the Iwo Jima assault force was staging. The force cleared Tanapag Harbor on 16 February. At 0640 three days later, &quot;Starr&quot; launched her boats against the Iwo Jima beaches. The attack cargo ship had multiple duties: she was a receiving ship for wounded; an ammunition ship for ; and she had a priority cargo of vehicles which were to be delivered only when requested and then, as quickly as possible. She waited until 25 February to begin discharging her cargo and finished on 5 March. She then got underway for Leyte.

&quot;Starr&quot; loaded combat cargo from 9 to 27 March and joined a convoy for the Ryukyu Islands. On 1 April, her first boats hit the water at 0615; and they soon joined their prearranged waves for hitting the Okinawa beaches. At 0420 on 9 April the ship was raked from stem to stern by an explosion. At first, it was thought that she had been torpedoed; but it was soon learned that she had been attacked by a Japanese Explosive Motor Boat (No. 326). The suicide boat had exploded as it contacted one of a cluster of &quot;Starr&quot;″s landing craft that were moored alongside. The explosion was sufficiently removed from the side of the ship, and the water absorbed the shock so &quot;Starr&quot; suffered little damage.

&quot;Starr&quot; sailed for Guam on 10 April with a convoy and was routed onward to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 26 April and was notified that she was to return to the West Coast for overhaul. She arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 5 May; and repairs were begun immediately. When they were completed, the ship participated in an amphibious exercise and then loaded cargo at San Francisco, California, to be delivered to Guam. She sailed on 24 June and arrived at Guam on 11 July. On 20 July, she steamed to Pearl Harbor for another load of cargo for Guam. &quot;Starr&quot; was several days out of Guam when word was received that hostilities with Japan had ended.

===Post-war activities, 1945–1946===
After discharging her cargo at Guam, the ship was routed to the Philippines on 2 September; she arrived at Leyte on 5 September. &quot;Starr&quot; operated in the Philippines until 29 November when she got underway for China and arrived at Tsingtao on 4 December 1945.

&quot;Starr&quot; sailed from China to Sasebo, Japan, and thence to Vladivostok. She arrived there on 2 January 1946, unloaded her cargo, and returned to Sasebo where she received orders to proceed, via San Diego, to San Francisco. She remained at San Francisco from 9 to 18 March and then got underway for Hampton Roads. &quot;Starr&quot; arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 April 1946; was decommissioned on 31 May 1946, and was returned to the War Shipping Administration on 1 June 1946. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 June 1946.

===In commercial service, 1947–1970===
As a civilian vessel, &quot;Starr&quot; was sold on 3 December 1947 to Pacific Far East Line, which changed her name to &quot;India Bear&quot;. In April 1957 she was sold to Trans-Pacific Company, who sold her in turn on 11 November 1959 to Dorama, Incorporated. On 10 July 1959 she was named &quot;Lanakila&quot;, and on 27 May 1960 she was sold to Long Island Tankers Corporation which renamed her &quot;India Bear&quot;. On 7 February 1961 she returned to Pacific Far East Line. Finally, on 9 September 1970, she was sold to Sing Cheng Yung Iron &amp; Steel Company for scrapping in Taiwan.

==Awards==
&quot;Starr&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="290888" wikidata="Q3239924" url="?curid=290888" title="Ligne de Sceaux">
<text>The Ligne de Sceaux (, &quot;Sceaux Line)&quot; was a railway line in France running from Paris, which initially linked the Place Denfert-Rochereau (then called the &quot;Place d&#x27;Enfer&quot;, in Paris, to the town of Sceaux.
The line originally opened in 1846 as a broad gauge line to demonstrate the Arnoux system and was extended to the south to Sceaux. A branch, now the main line, was built to Orsay and extended to Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse and then to Limours. In the latter configuration, it is also called the Paris-Luxembourg–Limours line (line 552000 of the national rail network) by SNCF Réseau.
With a capital of 3 million francs, it was one of five companies placed under sequestration by the State during the Crash of 1847, along with the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans on 4 April 1848, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Bordeaux à La Teste on 30 October 1848 and the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Marseille à Avignon on 21 November 1848. Similarly, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Lyon was nationalised in 1848.
In 1895, it was extended north into Paris to Luxembourg station. In 1937, it was transferred by the &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans&quot; to the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) after thorough modernisation. The commissioning of electric railcars suitable for the line, the Z railcars, and the redevelopment of the infrastructure with high platforms and high-performance signalling made it a core section of a future regional metro, enabling it to double its traffic in less than a year. The section from Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse to Limours was abandoned in 1939.
After a period of particularly high traffic during the Second World War and the following years, the long line was integrated into the Réseau Express Régional (Regional Express Network, RER) in 1977. It now constitutes the two southern branches of line B of the RER south of the Gare du Nord: branch B2 to Robinson and branch B4 to Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.

== Construction of the line ==

=== Paris to Sceaux ===
In 1838, Jean-Claude-Républicain Arnoux, a graduate of the École polytechnique, proposed a technical solution to improve the speed of trains in curves, while reducing wear on the rails and wheels. He suggested separating the wheels from the same axle and hinging the axles on a central pivot instead of fixing them to the carriage frames. In addition, he recommended the use of a broad gauge of . This is called the Arnoux system (&quot;système Arnoux&quot;).
In order to implement his system, Arnoux secured the adoption of a law on 5 August 1844 that granted him a concession to build and operate the Sceaux line for a period of fifty years. On 21 February 1845, he founded the &quot;Compagnie du Chemin de fer de Paris à Sceaux&quot; (Paris–Sceaux Railway Company). The first section connected the &quot;embarcadère&quot; (pier) of Enfer (renamed Denfert-Rochereau in 1895), located at the Barrière d&#x27;Enfer in Paris, to Sceaux. It was inaugurated on 7 June 1846 and opened to the public on 23 June.
This first section, which wound around several sharp curves and reverse curves from Bourg-la-Reine to enable a gradient of 1.15% and passed through an intermediate station called Fontenay (named after the street of &quot;Rue de Fontenay&quot; in Sceaux), had its terminus at Sceaux. The winding route was intended to prove the relevance and effectiveness of the Arnoux system. The gradient of the track did not exceed 3.0%. Although the structures were planned from the start to enable a double track, only a single track was laid for the opening. A second track was laid from Paris to Bourg-la-Reine in 1863.

=== Bourg-la-Reine to Orsay ===

The line suffered from losses during its operations: while very profitable during fine weather, it struggled to attract travellers during the rest of the year. The company considered an extension to Orsay to improve its profitability. The first route considered would have branched off near Fontenay station and would have included a branch towards Longjumeau. This first proposal was not pursued, but the current route, with a branch at Bourg-la-Reine, was seriously studied.
However, the financial crisis of 1847 further weakened the company, so that it was placed in receivership in 1849–1850. During the Revolution of 1848, earthworks were built from Sceaux to Orsay, financed by the State within the framework of the National Workshops. They reached Palaiseau in 1849. The State, wary of the company&#x27;s future, built the platforms to conventional railway standards, that is to say with radii of curvature grrater than the sharp curves accepted by the Arnoux system.
The company, partially refloated, obtains a concession to build a line from Bourg-la-Reine to Orsay by a law of 10 June 1853. In addition to passenger traffic, significant freight traffic was forecast, notably the transport of sandstone from the Yvette valley and fresh vegetables.
The line was single track, broad gauge, although the concession provides for its conversion to standard gauge in the long term. The line comprised 17 structures, including a -long tunnel. Between Palaiseau and Orsay, the line was also sinuous, unlike the section built by the state: the radii of curvature were as little as .
The section was inaugurated to Orsay on 28 July 1854. The terminus was at a place called &quot;les Planches&quot;, near the current Guichet.
Despite some signs of financial improvement, the company remained fragile, and in particular could not acquire the rolling stock for the establishment of a freight service, which would nevertheless have been lucrative.

=== Orsay to Limours ===
The Compagnie du Paris-Orléans bought the Sceaux line from the Arnoux company in 1857 to thwart the plans of a competing company that wanted to gain rail access to Paris. In the project presented, the Sceaux line was to be integrated into a route from Paris to Tours through Châteaudun and Vendôme. However, once this competitor had been eliminated and in-depth studies carried out, the Paris-Orléans determined that the beginning of the line to Tours via Orsay was impractical due to a succession of plateaus and valleys. The Paris-Orléans gained approval for a new route via Brétigny. Following the financial collapse of the Compagnie du chemin de fer Grand-Central de France and its dismantling organised by the State in 1857 for the benefit of the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans and the establishment of the Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans bought the line from Paris to Orsay under an agreement signed between the two companies on 18 June 1855. This treaty was approved by decree on 19 June 1857.
As compensation for a population that was to be deprived of a railway, it was proposed to build a section from Orsay to Limours as an extension of the Sceaux line. A decree of August 28, 1862 ratified this extension to Limours, via Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse and the valley of Saint-Paul. Thus, the Paris-Orleans was allowed to make a saving by not having to serve Chevreuse, even if it meant building a 2% ramp in the valley of Saint-Paul. The concession to build line &quot;from Orsay to Limours&quot; was officially granted to the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans by an agreement signed on 11 June 1863 between the Minister of Public Works and the Company. This agreement was approved by an imperial decree on 6 July 1863.
The last section was inaugurated on 26 August 1867. It was built as a single track.

== The Paris-Orléans period==


=== Acquisition and modernisation ===

Towards the end of the 19th century, the emergence of bogies overcame the problem of wear on rails and restrictions on speed through curves without resorting to the complex system, including broad gauge, designed by Arnoux. To make the Sceaux line compatible with other networks, a decree of 1889 permitted the Arnoux system to be abandoned and adopted.
In order not to interrupt the traffic, the conversion of gauge and change of rolling stock was carried out on the night of 21/22 May 1891. The original route from Bourg-la-Reine to Sceaux was abandoned and replaced by the current route, which also comprises three stations and ends in Robinson, passing through Fontenay-aux-Roses. Work began in June 1891 and ended in May 1893.

=== Extension to Luxembourg ===
The extension in Paris between Denfert station and Luxembourg was declared to be of public utility by a decree of 14 December 1889.
In the 1890s, the line was extended in tunnel to a new Parisian terminus at Luxembourg. Vents were provided for the extraction of the steam locomotives&#x27; fumes.
The Compagnie du Paris-Orléans also planned to move this terminus to its new Orsay station (later converted to house the Musée d&#x27;Orsay), opened in 1900. The beginning of this extension still exists at the east exit of RER C from the station in the form of a second double-track running tunnel parallel to the one heading towards the Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz. This is now used for train storage.

=== Development projects ===
A line from Limours to Dourdan was granted as a possible concession to the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans by an agreement signed between the Minister of Public Works and the Company on 17 June 1892. This agreement was enacted by a law of 20 March 1893.
In 1913, the government considered that the electrification of the Sceaux line was not a priority, because the opening of the line from Paris to Chartres via Gallardon was imminent. Two of its four tracks would have been electrified, but this line was never finished. Meanwhile, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans was given a concession to extend the Sceaux line from Limours to Dourdan under an agreement signed by the Minister of Public Works and the company on 20 February 1913. This convention was approved by law on 7 July 1913, which also declared that the line had public utility. This line was never built.
As early as 1929, the Langevin plan (named after the then Minister of Public Works) included link lines in the Paris region so as to create an urban transport infrastructure on the model of the German S-Bahn. This developed into the Réseau Express Régional (RER).
As the Langevin plan involved crossing Paris underground, the operation of steam trains would have been problematic. In 1929, it was decided to electrify the line to Massy-Palaiseau. The Compagnie du Paris-Orléans refused to take on this work at its own expense. It nevertheless carried out the electrification due to its experience and then transferred the line to the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP). This company became part of the future Régie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP) as a result of a merger after the Second World War with the &quot;Société des transports en commun de la région parisienne&quot; (STCRP), which managed the bus network and was entrusted with the operation of this section of the line. 
The line was electrified between 1935 and 1937 and two substations were built at Paris-Montsouris and Massy-Villaine (between Massy-Verrières and Massy-Palaiseau). The first electric train carrying passengers ran on 16 November 1937. The electrification was carried out with overhead line, using the 1500 volts DC system. 

Electrification continued to the south and reached Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse on 1 January 1939. A new substation was installed near Gif-sur-Yvette. Electrification was never undertaken towards the town of Limours, which was always served over a single track by a Renault VH petrol railcar, operated every day from Versailles-Matelots.
The operation of the unprofitable Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse – Limours section was abandoned on 15 May 1939 and replaced by a coach service.
Automatic block light signalling was installed during the electrification. The colour-light signaling adopted was original and different from that of the SNCF (&quot;Code Verlant&quot;), since turning off a light made the signal more restrictive. Thus the absolute stop signal consisted of a single red light, the forward indication of an occupied section was indicated by two red lights. A warning was given by two yellow lights and an early warning by three yellow lights. A clear section was indicated by a green light. This signalling was replaced by the standard SNCF signalling when the line was extended to Châtelet–Les Halles to connect with RER A.

== The War ==

The tracks of the Saint-Rémy–Limours section were torn up by the German occupiers in 1941; the ballast was used for the construction of the runways at Villacoublay airfield by allied forces in 1944. This was the end of use of the section, although it was not officially closed until 1967.
The rest of the line was spared by the war until 1944. However, Massy-Palaiseau railway junction, located on the Grande Ceinture (Great Belt), which was used by the occupying forces, was the target of four Allied air raids in June 1944. The Bures sector was the target of a fifth air raid.

== The post-war era and the RER ==
 
Newly electrified, the line was served by Z 23000 (popularly known as Z) railcars for fifty years. MS 61 sets, which later circulated on the RER A, also first operated on the line in 1967 and some MS 61 sets known as series A ran on the line until 1983. The last Z 23000s were withdrawn from service in 1987, not without having been of great help during the winters of 1985 and 1986, when the new MI 79 sets suffered many breakdowns due to snow.
In the 1970s, it was decided to connect the Sceaux line to the Gare du Nord and the lines of the Paris-Nord suburban network, in accordance with the &quot;Master plan for development and town planning in the Paris region&quot; (&quot;Schéma directeur d&#x27;aménagement et d&#x27;urbanisme de la région de Paris&quot;) of 1965.
The route involved a difficult crossing under the Seine and it was initially envisaged that Luxembourg station would be closed to allow an earlier descent to pass under the river and it would be replaced by the construction of a new station called &quot;Quartier Latin&quot;, which would have been built further north towards the Carrefour de l&#x27;Odéon to allow a connection with lines 4 and 10 of the Métro.
A protest campaign by residents led to the retention of Luxembourg station. As a result, the new tunnel was built with a 4.08% grade, beginning its descent just north of the station. This required the total reconstruction of the station and the establishment of a temporary terminus at the station, with one of the platforms being extended by means of wooden planks so that both sides of the trains had access to the platforms.
A new station at Châtelet–Les Halles, built to give interchange with line A was inaugurated on 8 December 1977. The Sceaux line now formed the southern branch of RER line B.
The connection between the Sceaux line in the south and the line to Roissy in the north (operated by the SNCF) and to Mitry–Claye was finally completed at the Gare du Nord in 1983. The RER B opened in its entirety, with direct services between Charles de Gaulle Airport or Mitry-Claye and Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse or Robinson.
The four letter &quot;mission codes&quot; were introduced: the first letter indicates the terminus station for the service and the following letters indicate the details of the route (for instance: AILO, KNUT, POLY, LYRE, etc.)
Saint-Michel - Notre-Dame station, built to allow connection with line C of the RER and line 10 of the métro, was opened on 17 February 1988. This involved fitting out spaces reserved for it during the construction of the tunnel and the station is located partly under the Seine. At the same time Cluny - La Sorbonne station on line 10 was reopened to provide interchange with line 10.

== Current operations==

The line is now operated by RATP from Gare du Nord to Robinson, Massy-Palaiseau and Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse; it is enjoying significant commercial success. In Paris, the trains follow one another every three minutes.
Since 1987, line B has been operated by sets called MI 79 by the RATP (and Z 8100 by the SNCF) and MI 84 (called Z 8400 by the SNCF), Eight MI 84 sets were assigned to this line to complete the MI 79 fleet; the two classes are totally compatible and mixed sets of MI 79 and MI 84 are sometimes seen.
Since 2002, the RATP has carried out major work to replace the overhead line and its supports, as well as the ticket validation equipment. Consistent signage has been put in place for passengers, who also benefit from real-time information on train movements.

<text>Pandit Birju Maharaj (born Brijmohan Nath Mishra; 4 February 1938 – 17 January 2022) was an Indian dancer, composer, singer, and exponent of the Lucknow &quot;Kalka-Bindadin&quot; Gharana of Kathak dance in India. He was a descendant of the Maharaj family of Kathak dancers, which includes his two uncles, Shambhu Maharaj and Lachhu Maharaj, and his father and guru, Acchan Maharaj. He also practised Hindustani classical music and was a vocalist. After working along with his uncle, Shambhu Maharaj at Bhartiya Kala Kendra, later the Kathak Kendra, New Delhi, he remained head of the latter, for several years, until his retirement in 1998 when he opened his own dance school, &quot;Kalashram&quot;, also in Delhi.

Birju Maharaj was a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian honor, in 1986.

==Early life==
Maharaj was born Brijmohan Nath Mishra, on 4 February 1938 into a Hindu Brahmin family at Handia of Allahabad district. His father was the Kathak exponent, Jagannath Maharaj, popularly known as Acchan Maharaj of Lucknow gharana and the Kalka-Bindadin family in Lucknow. His father served as the court dancer in Raigarh princely state. Maharaj started dancing early at the age of four, and was trained by his uncles, Lachhu Maharaj and Shambhu Maharaj and his father. He started his performances first at his father&#x27;s concerts before performing solo at the age of seven in West Bengal. His father died when Maharaj was nine.

==Career==
Maharaj started teaching the dance form at the age of thirteen, at the Sangeet Bharti in New Delhi. He then taught at the Bharatiya Kala Kendra in Delhi, and at the Kathak Kendra (a unit of the Sangeet Natak Akademi) where he was Head of Faculty, and director, retiring in 1998 after which he opened his own dance school, &quot;Kalashram&quot;, also in Delhi.

In addition to performing the Kathak dance form, he also brought along knowledge of Hindustani classical music and percussion instruments. He was noted to have been able to sing the &quot;thumri&quot; while dancing to it, and also playing instruments like the &quot;tabla&quot; and the &quot;dholak&quot;. His Kathak performances in addition to mythological stories had contemporary elements including stories from daily life and social issues being communicated by way of the dance. His &quot;ginti ki tihaais&quot; () were noted to have been studied by Kathak students. He collaborated with other artists including the tabla player Zakir Hussain, and singers Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Some of his students included Priti Singh, Saswati Sen, Aditi Mangaldas, and Nisha Mahajan.

Maharaj also choreographed and composed music for many Indian movies. Some of the performances that he choreographed included for Saswati Sen in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Shatranj ke Khiladi&quot; (1977), Madhuri Dixit in &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Devdas&quot; (2002) and &quot;Dedh Ishqiya (2014)&quot;, Kamal Haasan in &quot;Vishwaroopam&quot; (2012), Deepika Padukone in &quot;Bajirao Mastani&quot; (2015) and Alia Bhatt in &quot;Kalank&quot; (2019). His choreography for Kamal Hassan in &quot;Vishwaroopam&quot; won him the National Film Award for Best Choreography in 2012, while his choreography for Deepika Padukone in &quot;Bajirao Mastani&quot; won him a Filmfare Award for Best Choreography in 2016.

Maharaj was one of the youngest artists to receive the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, when he received the award at the age of 28. He also received the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, in 1986.

==Personal life==
Maharaj was married and had five children (2 sons and 3 daughters). In later life, Maharaj had kidney disease and diabetes, and received dialysis. He died from a heart attack at his residence in Delhi, on 16 January 2022, at age 83.

<text>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (&quot;Huawei&quot; sometimes stylized as &quot;HUAWEI&quot;; ; ) is a Chinese multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Longgang, Shenzhen, Guangdong. It designs, develops, manufactures and sells digital telecommunications equipment, consumer electronics, smart devices, distributed operating systems, electric vehicle autonomous driving systems, and various rooftop solar products. The corporation was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA).

Initially focused on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded to more than 170 countries to include building telecommunications network infrastructures, providing equipment, operational and consulting services, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market. It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world. Huawei surpassed Apple and Samsung, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, to become the largest smartphone manufacturer worldwide. As of 2024, Huawei&#x27;s biggest area of business is in telecommunications equipment. Its largest customer is the Chinese government.

Amidst its rise, Huawei has been accused of intellectual property infringement, for which it has settled with Cisco. Questions regarding the extent of state influence on Huawei have revolved around its national champions role in China, subsidies and financing support from state entities, and reactions of the Chinese government in light of opposition in certain countries to Huawei&#x27;s participation in 5G. Its software and equipment have been linked to the mass surveillance of Uyghurs and Xinjiang internment camps, drawing sanctions from the United States.

The company has faced difficulties in some countries arising from concerns that its equipment may enable surveillance by the Chinese government due to perceived connections with the country&#x27;s military and intelligence agencies. Huawei has argued that critics such as the US government have not shown evidence of espionage. Experts say that China&#x27;s 2014 Counter-Espionage Law and 2017 National Intelligence Law can compel Huawei and other companies to cooperate with state intelligence. In 2012, Australian and US intelligence agencies concluded that a hack on Australia&#x27;s telecom networks was conducted by or through Huawei, although the two network operators have disputed that information.

In January 2018, the United States alleged that its sanctions against Iran were violated by Huawei, which was subsequently restricted from doing business with American companies. The US government also requested the extradition of Huawei&#x27;s chief financial officer from Canada. In June 2019, Huawei cut jobs at its Santa Clara research center, and in December, Ren said it was moving the center to Canada. In 2020, Huawei agreed to sell the Honor brand to a state-owned enterprise of the Shenzhen government to &quot;ensure its survival&quot; under US sanctions. In November 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) banned sales or import of equipment made by Huawei out of national security concerns, and other countries such as all members of the Five Eyes, Quad members India and Japan, and ten European Union states have since also banned or restricted Huawei products.

==Name==
According to the company founder Ren Zhengfei, the name &quot;Huawei&quot; comes from a slogan he saw on a wall, &quot;Zhonghua youwei&quot; meaning &quot;China has achievements&quot; (), when he was starting up the company and needed a name. &quot;Zhonghua&quot; or &quot;Hua&quot; means China, while &quot;youwei&quot; means &quot;promising/to show promise&quot;. &quot;Huawei&quot; has also been translated as &quot;splendid achievement&quot; or &quot;China is able&quot;, which are possible readings of the name.

In Chinese pinyin, the name is &quot;Huáwéi&quot;, and pronounced in Mandarin Chinese; in Cantonese, the name is transliterated with Jyutping as &quot;Waa4-wai4&quot; and pronounced . However, the pronunciation of &quot;Huawei&quot; by non-Chinese varies in other countries, for example &quot;Hoe-ah-wei&quot; in Belgium and the Netherlands.

The company had considered changing the name in English out of concern that non-Chinese people may find it hard to pronounce, but decided to keep the name, and launched a brand recognition campaign instead to encourage a pronunciation closer to &quot;Wah-Way&quot; using the words &quot;Wow Way&quot;. Ren states, &quot;We will not change the name of our brand and will teach foreigners how to pronounce it. We have to make sure they do not pronounce it like &#x27;Hawaii.&#x27;&quot;

==History==
===Early years===
In the 1980s, the Chinese government endeavored to overhaul the nation&#x27;s underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure. A core component of the telecommunications network was telephone exchange switches, and in the late 1980s, several Chinese research groups endeavored to acquire and develop the technology, usually through joint ventures with foreign companies.

Ren Zhengfei, a former deputy director of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army engineering corps, founded Huawei in 1987 in Shenzhen. The company reports that it had RMB 21,000 (about $5,000 at the time) in registered capital from Ren Zhengfei and five other investors at the time of its founding where each contributed RMB 3,500. These five initial investors gradually withdrew their investments in Huawei. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; has suggested, however, that Huawei received approximately &quot;$46 billion in loans and other support, coupled with $25 billion in tax cuts&quot; since the Chinese government had a vested interest in fostering a company to compete against Apple and Samsung.

Ren sought to reverse engineer foreign technologies with local researchers. China borrowed liberally from Qualcomm and other industry leaders (PBX as an example) in order to enter the market. At a time when all of China&#x27;s telecommunications technology was imported from abroad, Ren hoped to build a domestic Chinese telecommunications company that could compete with, and ultimately replace, foreign competitors.

During its first several years the company&#x27;s business model consisted mainly of reselling private branch exchange (PBX) switches imported from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, it was reverse-engineering imported switches and investing heavily in research and development to manufacture its own technologies. By 1990 the company had approximately 600 R&amp;D staff and began its own independent commercialization of PBX switches targeting hotels and small enterprises.

In order to grow despite difficult competition from Alcatel, Lucent, and Nortel Networks, in 1992 Huawei focused on low-income and difficult to access market niches. Huawei&#x27;s sales force traveled from village to village in underdeveloped regions, gradually moving into more developed areas.

The company&#x27;s first major breakthrough came in 1993 when it launched its C&amp;C08 program controlled telephone switch. It was by far the most powerful switch available in China at the time. By initially deploying in small cities and rural areas and placing emphasis on service and customizability, the company gained market share and made its way into the mainstream market.

Huawei also won a key contract to build the first national telecommunications network for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, a deal one employee described as &quot;small in terms of our overall business, but large in terms of our relationships&quot;. In 1994, founder Ren Zhengfei had a meeting with General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin, telling him that &quot;switching equipment technology was related to national security, and that a nation that did not have its own switching equipment was like one that lacked its own military.&quot; Jiang reportedly agreed with this assessment.

In the 1990s, Canadian telecom giant Nortel outsourced production of their entire product line to Huawei. They subsequently outsourced much of their product engineering to Huawei as well.

Another major turning point for the company came in 1996 when the government in Beijing adopted an explicit policy of supporting domestic telecommunications manufacturers and restricting access to foreign competitors. Huawei was promoted by both the government and the military as a national champion, and established new research and development offices.

===Foreign expansion===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Huawei built communications networks throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. It has become the most important Chinese telecommunications company operating in these regions.

In 1997, Huawei won a contract to provide fixed-line network products to Hong Kong company Hutchison Whampoa. Later that year, Huawei launched wireless GSM-based products and eventually expanded to offer CDMA and UMTS. In 1999, the company opened a research and development (R&amp;D) centre in Bengaluru, India to develop a wide range of telecom software.

In May 2003, Huawei partnered with 3Com on a joint venture known as H3C, which was focused on enterprise networking equipment. It marked 3Com&#x27;s re-entrance into the high-end core routers and switch market, after having abandoned it in 2000 to focus on other businesses. 3Com bought out Huawei&#x27;s share of the venture in 2006 for US$882 million.

In 2004, Huawei signed a $10 billion credit line with China Development Bank to provide low-cost financing to customers buying its telecommunications equipment to support its sales outside of China. This line of credit was tripled to $30 billion in 2009.

In 2005, Huawei&#x27;s foreign contract orders exceeded its domestic sales for the first time. Huawei signed a global framework agreement with Vodafone. This agreement marked the first time a telecommunications equipment supplier from China had received Approved Supplier status from Vodafone Global Supply Chain.

In 2007, Huawei began a joint venture with US security software vendor Symantec Corporation, known as Huawei Symantec, which aimed to provide end-to-end solutions for network data storage and security. Huawei bought out Symantec&#x27;s share in the venture in 2012, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; noting that Symantec had fears that the partnership &quot;would prevent it from obtaining United States government classified information about cyber threats&quot;.

In May 2008, Australian carrier Optus announced that it would establish a technology research facility with Huawei in Sydney. In October 2008, Huawei reached an agreement to contribute to a new GSM-based HSPA+ network being deployed jointly by Canadian carriers Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility, joined by Nokia Siemens Networks. Huawei delivered one of the world&#x27;s first LTE/EPC commercial networks for TeliaSonera in Oslo, Norway in 2009. Norway-based telecommunications Telenor instead selected Ericsson due to security concerns with Huawei.

In July 2010, Huawei was included in the Global Fortune 500 2010 list published by the US magazine &quot;Fortune&quot; for the first time, on the strength of annual sales of US$21.8 billion and net profit of US$2.67 billion.

In October 2012, it was announced that Huawei would move its UK headquarters to Green Park, Reading, Berkshire.

Huawei also has expanding operations in Ireland since 2016. As well as a headquarters in Dublin, it has facilities in Cork and Westmeath.

In September 2017, Huawei created a Narrowband IoT city-aware network using a &quot;one network, one platform, N applications&quot; construction model utilizing Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, and other next-generation information and communications technology, it also aims to be one of the world&#x27;s five largest cloud players in the near future.
In 2017, Huawei and the government of Malaysia began cooperating to develop public security programs and Malaysian Smart City programs, as well as a related lab in Kuala Lumpur. In April 2019, Huawei established the Huawei Malaysia Global Training Centre (MGTC) at Cyberjaya, Malaysia.

Huawei has had a major role in building, by 2019, approximately 70% of Africa&#x27;s 4G networks.

In November 2020, Telus Mobility dropped Huawei in favor of Samsung, Ericsson, and Nokia for their 5G/Radio Access Network

===Recent performance===

By 2018, Huawei had sold 200 million smartphones. In 2019, Huawei reported revenue of US$122 billion. By the second quarter of 2020, Huawei had become the world&#x27;s top smartphone seller, overtaking Samsung for the first time. In 2021, Huawei was ranked the second-largest R&amp;D investor in the world by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) in its EU Industrial R&amp;D Investment Scoreboard and ranked fifth in the world in US patents according to a report by Fairview Research&#x27;s IFI Claims Patent Services.

However, heavy international sanctions saw Huawei&#x27;s revenues drop by 32% in the 2021 third quarter. Linghao Bao, an analyst at policy research firm Trivium China said the &quot;communications giant went from being the second-largest smartphone maker in the world, after Samsung, to essentially dead.&quot; By the end of third quarter in 2022, Huawei revenue had dropped a further 19.7% since the beginning of the year. Yet, for the seventh consecutive year, Huawei remained the top patent applicant for patents filled under the PCT, with 6494 published applications in 2023.

By mid-2024, the company had recovered after a brief decline in turnover and profit and continued its expansion. Most foreign parts in the supply chain were successfully replaced by domestic products in a relatively short period of time. In the first quarter of 2024, the company&#x27;s profits increased nearly six-fold compared to the previous year to just under US$2.7 billion. On 21 June 2024, Huawei announced that HarmonyOS is now installed on over 900 million devices and has become the second most popular mobile OS in China.

==Corporate affairs==
Huawei classifies itself as a &quot;collective&quot; entity and prior to 2019 did not refer to itself as a private company. Richard McGregor, author of &quot;The Party: The Secret World of China&#x27;s Communist Rulers&quot;, said that this is &quot;a definitional distinction that has been essential to the company&#x27;s receipt of state support at crucial points in its development&quot;. McGregor argued that &quot;Huawei&#x27;s status as a genuine collective is doubtful.&quot; Huawei&#x27;s position has shifted in 2019 when, Dr. Song Liuping, Huawei&#x27;s chief legal officer, commented on the US government ban, said: &quot;Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after &quot;a private company&quot;.&quot; (emphasis added).

===Leadership===
Ren Zhengfei is the founder and CEO of Huawei and has the power to veto any decisions made by the board of directors. Huawei also has rotating co-CEOs.

Huawei disclosed its list of board of directors for the first time in 2010. Liang Hua is the current chair of the board. , the members of the board are Liang Hua, Guo Ping, Xu Zhijun, Hu Houkun, Meng Wanzhou (CFO and deputy chairwoman), Ding Yun, Yu Chengdong, Wang Tao, Xu Wenwei, Shen-Han Chiu, Chen Lifang, Peng Zhongyang, He Tingbo, Li Yingtao, Ren Zhengfei, Yao Fuhai, Tao Jingwen, and Yan Lida.

Guo Ping is the Chairman of Huawei Device, Huawei&#x27;s mobile phone division. Huawei&#x27;s Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer is Zhou Daiqi who is also Huawei&#x27;s Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary. Their chief legal officer is Song Liuping.

===Ownership===
At its founding in 1987, Huawei was established as a collectively-owned enterprise. Collectively-owned enterprises were an intermediary corporate ownership status between state-owned enterprises and private businesses. The Chinese government began issuing licenses for private businesses starting in 1992.

Huawei states it is an employee-owned company, but this remains a point of dispute. Ren Zhengfei retains approximately 1 percent of the shares of Huawei&#x27;s holding company, Huawei Investment &amp; Holding, with the remainder of the shares held by a trade union &quot;committee&quot; (not a trade union per se, and the internal governance procedures of this committee, its members, its leaders or how they are selected all remain undisclosed to the public) that is claimed to be representative of Huawei&#x27;s employee shareholders. The company&#x27;s trade union committee is registered with and pays dues to the Shenzhen federation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. About half of Huawei staff participate in this structure (foreign employees are not eligible), and hold what the company calls &quot;virtual restricted shares&quot;. These shares are non-tradable and are allocated to reward performance. When employees leave Huawei, their shares revert to the company, which compensates them for their holding. Although employee shareholders receive dividends, their shares do not entitle them to any direct influence in management decisions, but enables them to vote for members of the 115-person Representatives&#x27; Commission from a pre-selected list of candidates. The Representatives&#x27; Commission selects Huawei Holding&#x27;s board of directors and Board of Supervisors.

Academics Christopher Balding of Fulbright University and Donald C. Clarke of George Washington University have described Huawei&#x27;s virtual stock program as &quot;purely a profit-sharing incentive scheme&quot; that &quot;has nothing to do with financing or control&quot;. They found that, after a few stages of historical morphing, employees do not own a part of Huawei through their shares. Instead, the &quot;virtual stock is a contract right, not a property right; it gives the holder no voting power in either Huawei Tech or Huawei Holding, cannot be transferred, and is cancelled when the employee leaves the firm, subject to a redemption payment from Huawei Holding TUC at a low fixed price&quot;. Balding and Clarke add, &quot;given the public nature of trade unions in China, if the ownership stake of the trade union committee is genuine, and if the trade union and its committee function as trade unions generally function in China, then Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned.&quot; Tim Rühlig, a Research Fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, asked Huawei for a response to the Balding and Clarke paper; the &quot;information provided by Huawei gives an indication of how difficult it is to run an independent company in such a crucial sector in China&quot;. After the publication of Balding and Clarke&#x27;s paper, Huawei has &quot;engaged in a PR blitz to manufacture an image of a transparent company&quot;.

Academic Toshio Goto of the Japan University of Economics has disagreed with Balding and Clarke&#x27;s assessment of Huawei employee shareholders’ ownership. Goto writes that the Huawei&#x27;s ownership structure is a function of its formation amid the Chinese reforms, with the only mechanism for concentrating employee ownership under Shenzen&#x27;s 1997 Provisions on State-owned Company Employee Stock Option Plans being to do so via Huawei&#x27;s trade union. In contrast to Balding and Clarke, Goto writes that the Huawei&#x27;s virtual shares are substantially equivalent to voting stock, and that nominal ownership through the trade union does not change the legal and financial independence of employee ownership from the union itself. Goto concludes that the firm is effectively owned by employees and therefore it is not effectively state-owned. In analyzing Huawei&#x27;s corporate governance and ownership structure, Academic Wang Jun of the Chinese University of Politics and Law also rejects the argument that Huawei is a state-owned enterprise controlled by a labor union, writing that normative practices and legal requirements distinguish between the shareholding vehicle of union-held employee assets and assets belonging to the union itself. Academics Kunyuan Qiao of Cornell University and Christopher Marquis of the University of Cambridge likewise conclude that Huawei is a private company owned collectively by its employees and is neither owned nor controlled directly by the Chinese government.

Academics Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung write that Huawei is a private company. Likewise, academics Simon Curtis and Ian Klaus write that Huawei is not state-owned, but is a private company which the Chinese government views as a national champion.

In 2021, Huawei did not report its ultimate beneficial ownership in Europe as required by European anti-money laundering laws.

=== Lobbying and public relations ===
In July 2021, Huawei hired Tony Podesta as a consultant and lobbyist, with a goal of nurturing the company&#x27;s relationship with the Biden administration.

Huawei has also hired public relations firms Ruder Finn, Wavemaker, Racepoint Global, and Burson Cohn &amp; Wolfe for various campaigns.

In January 2024, Bloomberg News reported that Huawei ended its in-house lobbying operations in Washington, D.C.

=== Corporate culture ===
According to its CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei, Huawei&#x27;s corporate culture is the same as the culture of the CCP, &quot;and to serve the people wholeheartedly means to be customer-centric and responsible to society.&quot; Ren frequently states that Huawei&#x27;s management philosophy and strategy are commercial applications of Maoism.

Ren states that in the event of a conflict between Huawei&#x27;s business interests and the CCP&#x27;s interests, he would &quot;choose the CCP whose interest is to serve the people and all human beings&quot;. Qiao and Marquis observe that company founder Ren is a dedicated communist who seeks to ingrain communist values at Huawei.

=== Finances ===
==Partners==

, approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s top 50 telecoms companies had worked with Huawei.

In 2016, German camera company Leica has established a partnership with Huawei, and Leica cameras will be co-engineered into Huawei smartphones, including the P and Mate Series. The first smartphone to be co-engineered with a Leica camera was the Huawei P9. As of May 2022, Huawei partnership with Leica had ended.

In August 2019, Huawei collaborated with eyewear company Gentle Monster and released smartglasses. In November 2019, Huawei partners with Devialet and unveiled a new specifically designed speaker, the Sound X. In October 2020, Huawei released its own mapping service, Petal Maps, which was developed in partnership with Dutch navigation device manufacturer TomTom.

==Products and services==

===Telecommunication networks===
Huawei offers mobile and fixed softswitches, plus next-generation home location register and Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystems (IMS). Huawei sells xDSL, passive optical network (PON) and next-generation PON (NG PON) on a single platform. The company also offers mobile infrastructure, broadband access and service provider routers and switches (SPRS). Huawei&#x27;s software products include service delivery platforms (SDPs), base station subsystems, and more. As of 2023, telecoms-network equipment remains Huawei&#x27;s core area of business, which constituted half of its revenues for the year.

=== Fiber-optic cable projects ===
Huawei Marine Networks delivered the HANNIBAL submarine communications cable system for Tunisie Telecom across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy in 2009.

Huawei Marine is involved in many fiber-optic cable projects connected with the Belt and Road Initiative. Huawei Marine completed the China-Pakistan Fiber Optic Project which runs along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In 2018, Huawei Marine completed the South Atlantic Interlink (SAIL) Cable System which runs from Kribi, Cameroon to Fortaleza, Brazil. It also built the Kumul Domestic Fiber Cable from Indonesia to Papua New Guinea.

As part of the Smart Africa project, Huawei Marine built the 2,800 mile fiber-optic network Guinea Backbone Network.

===Global services===
Huawei Global Services provides telecommunications operators with equipment to build and operate networks as well as consulting and engineering services to improve operational efficiencies. These include network integration services such as those for mobile and fixed networks; assurance services such as network safety; and learning services, such as competency consulting.

===Devices===

Huawei&#x27;s Devices division provides white-label products to content-service providers, including USB modems, wireless modems and wireless routers for mobile Wi-Fi, embedded modules, fixed wireless terminals, wireless gateways, set-top boxes, mobile handsets and video products. Huawei also produces and sells a variety of devices under its own name, such as the smartphones, tablet PCs, earbuds and Huawei Smartwatch.

===Semiconductors===

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, HiSilicon, Huawei is one of the largest domestic designers of chips in China. It frequently partners with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) to manufacture its chips. As of April 2024, Huawei is also building or supporting the construction of five semiconductor fabs.

===Phones===

Huawei is the second-biggest smartphone maker in the world, after Samsung, as of the first quarter of 2019. Their portfolio of phones includes both high-end smartphones, its Huawei Mate series and Huawei Pura series, and cheaper handsets that fall under its Honor brand.

Cheaper handsets fall under its Honor brand. Honor was created in order to elevate Huawei-branded phones as premium offerings. In 2020, Huawei agreed to sell the Honor brand to a state-owned enterprise of the Shenzhen municipal government. Consequently, Honor was initially reported to be cut off from access to Huawei&#x27;s IPs, which consists of more than 100,000 active patents by the end of 2020, and additionally cannot tap into Huawei&#x27;s large R&amp;D resources where $20 billion had been committed for 2021. However, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine noted in 2021 that Honor devices still had not differentiated their software much from Huawei phones and that core apps and certain engineering features, like the Honor-engineered camera features looked &quot;virtually identical&#x27; across both phones.

====History of Huawei phones====

In July 2003, Huawei established their handset department and by 2004, Huawei shipped their first phone, the C300. The U626 was Huawei&#x27;s first 3G phone in June 2005 and in 2006, Huawei launched the first Vodafone-branded 3G handset, the V710. The U8220 was Huawei&#x27;s first Android smartphone and was unveiled in MWC 2009. At CES 2012, Huawei introduced the Ascend range starting with the Ascend P1 S. At MWC 2012, Huawei launched the Ascend D1. In September 2012, Huawei launched their first 4G ready phone, the Ascend P1 LTE. At CES 2013, Huawei launched the Ascend D2 and the Ascend Mate. At MWC 2013, the Ascend P2 was launched as the world&#x27;s first LTE Cat4 smartphone. In June 2013, Huawei launched the Ascend P6 and in December 2013, Huawei introduced Honor as a subsidiary independent brand in China. At CES 2014, Huawei launched the Ascend Mate2 4G in 2014 and at MWC 2014, Huawei launched the MediaPad X1 tablet and Ascend G6 4G smartphone. Other launched in 2014 included the Ascend P7 in May 2014, the Ascend Mate7, the Ascend G7 and the Ascend P7 Sapphire Edition as China&#x27;s first 4G smartphone with a sapphire screen.

In January 2015, Huawei discontinued the &quot;Ascend&quot; brand for its flagship phones, and launched the new P series with the Huawei P8. Huawei also partnered with Google to build the Nexus 6P which was released in September 2015.

In May 2018, Huawei stated that they will no longer allow unlocking the bootloader of their phones to allow installing third party system software or security updates after Huawei stops them.
Huawei is currently the most well-known international corporation in China and a pioneer of the 5G mobile phone standard, which has come to be used globally in the last few years.

In December 2019, Huawei unveiled HMS version 4.0, and as of 16 January 2020, the company reported that it had signed up 55,000 apps using its HMS Core software.

====MetaERP====
MetaERP is an proprietary enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution developedlaunched on April 24, 2023. The company began with a manufacturing resource planning (MRP) solution in 1996. It upgraded its legacy ERP system from third-party American suppliers, followed by further improvements for internal management. Since the United States Entity List of May 2019 barred American software technology companies from supplying ERP systems to Huawei prompted the company to develop an in-house ERP system for the next following three years.

MetaERP targets mid-sized and large enterprises. For ease of migration to the ERP system, it consists of the following modules such as Financials and Operations, Sales Enterprise, Marketing, Customer Service, Field Service, and Project Service Automation using its Linux-based EulerOS server operating system and GaussDB relational database management system. After launch in 2023, the first batch of large-scale switching was carried out in May 14 midnight, across Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia, Southern Africa, and Latin America. The business covers ICT and Huawei Cloud, alongside terminals and other industries. Over thousands of employees in 75 countries use MetaERP in stable operation post-launch. MetaERP currently handles 100% of Huawei&#x27;s internal business and most of the 80% of its business operations.

==== AI Chip ====
In November 2024, Huawei announced its plans to start mass-producing advanced artificial intelligence chips within the first quarter of 2025. This chip named 910C has been made by top Chinese contract chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) via its N+2 process.

=== Huawei Solar ===
Huawei entered the photovoltaic (PV) market in 2011, and opened an Energy Center of Competence in Nuremberg, Germany the same year. In September 2016, Huawei integrated new manufacturing capabilities into its Eindhoven hub in the Netherlands, where it can produce 7,000 inverter units per month. In October that same year, Huawei entered the North American market and formed a strategic partnership with Strata Solar. In April 2017, Huawei enters the residential solar market with the launch of its string solar inverters and DC power optimizers, later also solar batteries. Some of its solar products are also sold under the &quot;iStore&quot; brand in Australia from 2024 onwards.

As of 2022, Huawei is the largest producer of solar inverters in the world with a 29% market share, which saw a significant shipment increase of 83% compared to 2021.

==Competitive position==
Huawei&#x27;s global growth has largely been driven by its offering of competitive telecommunications equipment at a lesser price than rival firms.

Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. was the world&#x27;s largest telecom equipment maker in 2012 and China&#x27;s largest telephone-network equipment maker. With 3,442 patents, Huawei became the world&#x27;s No. 1 applicant for international patents in 2014. In 2019, Huawei had the second most patents granted by the European Patent Office. In 2021, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)&#x27;s annual World Intellectual Property Indicators report ranked Huawei&#x27;s number of patent applications published under the PCT System as 1st in the world, with 5464 patent applications being published during 2020. The Madrid Yearly Review ranked Huawei&#x27;s number of marks applications filed under the Madrid System as 9th in the world, with 78 trademarks applications submitted during 2023.

, Huawei is the leading 5G equipment manufacturer and has the greatest market share of 5G equipment and has built approximately 70% of worldwide 5G base stations.

===Research and development===
, more than half of Huawei&#x27;s employees are involved in research. In the same year, Huawei spent $22.1 billion on R&amp;D, around 22.4% of its net sales, being one of the six companies in the world to spend more than $20 billion on R&amp;D spending. In recent years, Huawei has prioritized technological innovation as a means of vertically integrating its supply chain, particularly in to areas vulnerable to sanctions.

The company has numerous R&amp;D institutes in countries including China, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Finland, France, Belgium, Germany, Colombia, Sweden, Ireland, India, Russia, and Turkey. It opened in July 2024 its biggest R&amp;D center to date near Shanghai to accommodate nearly 35,000 members of its personnel.

Huawei also funds research partnerships with universities such as the University of British Columbia, the University of Waterloo, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Guelph, and Université Laval.

== Controversies ==

Huawei has faced allegations that its products contain backdoors for Chinese government espionage and domestic laws require Chinese citizens and companies to cooperate with state intelligence when warranted. Huawei executives denied these claims, saying that the company has not received requests by the Chinese government to introduce backdoors in its equipment, would refuse to do so, and that Chinese law does not compel them to do so. As of 2019, the United States had not produced evidence of coordinated hacking by Huawei.

=== Early business practices ===
Huawei employed a complex system of agreements with local state-owned telephone companies that seemed to include illicit payments to the local telecommunications bureau employees. During the late 1990s, the company created several joint ventures with their state-owned telecommunications company customers. By 1998, Huawei had signed agreements with municipal and provincial telephone bureaus to create Shanghai Huawei, Chengdu Huawei, Shenyang Huawei, Anhui Huawei, Sichuan Huawei, and other companies. The joint ventures were actually shell companies, and were a way to funnel money to local telecommunications employees so that Huawei could get deals to sell them equipment. In the case of Sichuan Huawei, for example, local partners could get 60–70 percent of their investment returned in the form of annual &#x27;dividends&#x27;.

=== Allegations of state support ===

Martin Thorley of the University of Nottingham noted that a &quot;company of Huawei’s size, working in what is considered a sensitive sector, simply cannot succeed in China without extensive links to the Party&quot;. Klon Kitchen has suggested that 5G dominance is essential to China in order to achieve its vision where &quot;the prosperity of state-run capitalism is combined with the stability and security of technologically enabled authoritarianism&quot;. Nigel Inkster of the International Institute for Strategic Studies suggested that &quot;Huawei involvement in the core backbone 5G infrastructure of developed western liberal democracies is a strategic game-changer because 5G is a game-changer”, with “national telecoms champions” playing a key role, which in turn is part of China&#x27;s &quot;ambitious strategy to reshape the planet in line with its interests” through the Belt and Road Initiative. On 7 October 2020, the U.K. Parliament&#x27;s Defence Committee released a report concluding that there was evidence of collusion between Huawei and Chinese state and the Chinese Communist Party, based upon ownership model and government subsidies it has received.

Huawei has a strong rapport with, and support from, the Chinese government. The Chinese government has granted Huawei much more comprehensive support than other domestic companies facing troubles abroad, such as ByteDance, since Huawei is considered a national champion along with Alibaba Group and Tencent. For instance after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was detained in Canada pending extradition to the United States for fraud charges, China immediately arrested Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in what was widely viewed as &quot;hostage diplomacy&quot;. China has also imposed tariffs on Australian imports in 2020, in apparent retaliation for Huawei and ZTE being excluded from Australia&#x27;s 5G network in 2018. In June 2020, when the UK mulled reversing an earlier decision to permit Huawei&#x27;s participation in 5G, China threatened retaliation in other sectors by withholding investments in power generation and high-speed rail. A House of Commons defence committee found that &quot;Beijing had exerted pressure through &quot;covert and overt threats&quot; to keep Huawei in the UK&#x27;s 5G network&quot;. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reassured the UK saying &quot;the US stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s coercive bullying tactics,&quot; and &quot;the US stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have, from building secure and reliable nuclear power plants to developing trusted 5G solutions that protect their citizens&#x27; privacy&quot;.

The &quot;optics of Beijing&#x27;s diplomats coming to [Huawei]&#x27;s defense&quot; in the European Union has also contradicted Huawei&#x27;s claims that it is &quot;fully independent from the Chinese government&quot;. In November 2019, the Chinese ambassador to Denmark, in meetings with high-ranking Faroese politicians, directly linked Huawei&#x27;s 5G expansion with Chinese trade, according to a sound recording obtained by Kringvarp Føroya. According to &quot;Berlingske&quot;, the ambassador threatened with dropping a planned trade deal with the Faroe Islands, if the Faroese telecom company Føroya Tele did not let Huawei build the national 5G network. Huawei said they did not knоw about the meetings. China&#x27;s ambassador to Germany, Wu Ken, warned that ‘there will be consequences’ if Huawei was excluded, and floated the &quot;possibility of German cars being banned on safety grounds&quot;.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; has suggested that Huawei received approximately &quot;$46 billion in loans and other support, coupled with $25 billion in tax cuts&quot; since the Chinese government had a vested interest in fostering a company to compete against Apple and Samsung. In particular, China&#x27;s state-owned banks such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China make loans to Huawei customers which substantially undercut competitors&#x27; financing with lower interest and cash in advance, with China Development Bank providing a credit line totaling US$30 billion between 2004 and 2009. In 2010, the European Commission launched an investigation into China&#x27;s subsidies that distorted global markets and harmed European vendors, and Huawei offered the initial complainant US$56 million to withdraw the complaint in an attempt to shut down the investigation. Then-European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht found that Huawei leveraged state support to underbid competitors by up to 70 percent.

=== Allegations of military and intelligence ties ===
In 2011, a report by the Open Source Enterprise detailed its &quot;suspicions over potential close links between Huawei and the Chinese Government,&quot; such as former chairwoman Sun Yafang&#x27;s prior employment by the Ministry of State Security (MSS)&#x27;s Communications Department.

In 2019, Ren Zhengfei stated &quot;we never participate in espionage and we do not allow any of our employees to do any act like that. And we absolutely never install backdoors. Even if we were required by Chinese law, we would firmly reject that&quot;. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was quoted saying &quot;the Chinese government did not and will not ask Chinese companies to spy on other countries, such kind of action is not consistent with the Chinese law and is not how China behaves.&quot; Huawei has cited the opinion of Zhong Lun Law Firm, co-signed by a CCP member, whose lawyers testified to the FCC that the National Intelligence Law doesn&#x27;t apply to Huawei. The opinion of Zhong Lun lawyers, reviewed by British law firm Clifford Chance, has been distributed widely by Huawei as an &quot;independent legal opinion&quot;, although Clifford Chance added a disclaimer stated that &quot;the material should not be construed as constituting a legal opinion on the application of PRC law&quot;. Follow up reporting from &quot;Wired&quot; cast doubt on the findings of Zhong Lun, particularly because the Chinese &quot;government doesn&#x27;t limit itself to what the law explicitly allows&quot; when it comes to national security. &quot;All Chinese citizens and organisations are obliged to cooperate upon request with PRC intelligence operations—and also maintain the secrecy of such operations&quot;, as explicitly stipulated in Article 7 of the 2017 PRC national intelligence-gathering activities law. Tim Rühlig, a Research Fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, observed that &quot;Not least in the light of the lack of the rule of law in China, but also given the clarity of the Intelligence Law, this legal opinion [by Clifford Chance] does not provide any substantial reassurance that Huawei could decline to cooperate with Chinese intelligence, even if the company wanted to do so&quot;.

Experts have pointed out that under Xi Jinping&#x27;s &quot;intensifying authoritarianism [since] Beijing promulgated a new national intelligence law&quot; in 2017, as well as the 2014 Counter-Espionage Law, both of which are vaguely defined and far-reaching. The two laws &quot;[compel] Chinese businesses to work with Chinese intelligence and security agencies whenever they are requested to do so&quot;, suggesting that Huawei or other domestic major technology companies could not refuse to cooperate with Chinese intelligence. Jerome Cohen, a New York University law professor and Council on Foreign Relations adjunct senior fellow stated &quot;Not only is this mandated by existing legislation but, more important, also by political reality and the organizational structure and operation of the Party-State’s economy. The Party is embedded in Huawei and controls it&quot;. One former Huawei employee said &quot;The state wants to use Huawei, and it can use it if it wants. Everyone has to listen to the state. Every person. Every company and every individual, and you can&#x27;t talk about it. You can&#x27;t say you don&#x27;t like it. That&#x27;s just China.&quot; The new cybersecurity law also requires domestic companies, and eventually foreign subsidiaries, to use state-certified network equipment and software so that their data and communications are fully visible to China&#x27;s Cybersecurity Bureau. University of Nottingham&#x27;s Martin Thorley has suggested that Huawei would have no recourse to oppose the CCP&#x27;s request in court, since the party controls the police, the media, the judiciary and the government. Klon Kitchen has suggested that 5G dominance is essential to China in order to achieve its vision where &quot;the prosperity of state-run capitalism is combined with the stability and security of technologically enabled authoritarianism&quot;.

In 2019, Henry Jackson Society researchers conducted an analysis of 25,000 Huawei employee CVs and found that some had worked or trained with China&#x27;s Ministry of State Security, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), its academies, and a military unit accused of hacking US corporations, including 11 alumni from a PLA information engineering school. One of the study researchers says this shows &quot;a strong relationship between Huawei and all levels of the Chinese state, Chinese military and Chinese intelligence. This to me appears to be a systemized, structural relationship.&quot; In a report by academics Christopher Balding of Fulbright University and Donald C. Clarke of George Washington University, a person &quot;simultaneously held a position at Huawei and a teaching and research role at a military university through which they were employed by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army...a section in the PLA that is responsible for the Chinese military’s space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities&quot;. Charles Parton, a British diplomat, said this &quot;give the lie to Huawei&#x27;s claim that there is no evidence that they help the Chinese intelligence services. This gun is smoking.&quot; Huawei said that while it does not work on Chinese military or intelligence projects, it is no secret that some employees have a previous government background. It criticized the report&#x27;s speculative language such as ‘believes’, ‘infers’, and ‘cannot rule out’. In 2014, the National Security Agency penetrated Huawei&#x27;s corporate networks in China to search for links between the company and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. It was able to monitor accounts belonging to Huawei employees and its founder Ren Zhengfei.

U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission member Michael Wessel said: “If there’s a locksmith who’s installing more and more locks on the doors in a community and suddenly there’s a rash of silent robberies, at some point the locksmith becomes a person of interest. Huawei around that time became a significant entity of interest&quot;. A Bloomberg News report stated that Australian intelligence in 2012 detected a backdoor in the country&#x27;s telecom network and shared its findings with the United States, who reported similar hacks. It was reportedly caused by a software update from Huawei carrying malicious code that transmitted data to China before deleting itself. Investigators managed to reconstruct the exploit and determined that Huawei technicians must have pushed the update through the network on behalf of China&#x27;s spy agencies. Huawei said updates would have required authorization from the customer and that no tangible evidence was presented. China&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the accusation a &quot;slander&quot;. Australian telecom operators Optus and Vodafone disputed that they were compromised. Senior security officials in Uganda and Zambia told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that Huawei played key roles enabling their governments to spy on political opponents. Several IT sources told &quot;Le Monde&quot; that inside the African Union headquarters, whose computer systems were supplied by Huawei, data transfers on its servers peaked after hours from January 2012 to January 2017, with the AU&#x27;s internal data sent to unknown servers hosted in Shanghai. In May 2019, a Huawei Mediapad M5 belonging to a Canadian IT engineer living in Taiwan was found to be sending data to servers in China despite never being authorized to do so, as the apps could not be disabled and continued to send sensitive data even after appearing to be deleted. At the end of 2019, United States officials disclosed to the United Kingdom and Germany that Huawei has had the ability to covertly exploit backdoors intended for law enforcement officials since 2009, as these backdoors are found on carrier equipment like antennas and routers, and Huawei&#x27;s equipment is widely used around the world due to its low cost. The United Kingdom established a lab that it ran, but which was paid for by Huawei, to evaluate Huawei equipment. After eight years of study, the lab did not identify any Huawei backdoor, but concluded that Huawei&#x27;s equipment had bugs that could be exploited by hackers.

====Timeline====
Yale University economist Stephen Roach stated in 2022 that there was no hard evidence to support the allegations of Huawei having a backdoor for industrial espionage other than one arguable instance, which was when UK telecom Vodafone disclosed in 2011 that its Italian fixed line network contained a security vulnerability in its Huawei-installed software. Huawei fixed the vulnerability at Vodafone&#x27;s request. There was no report of any suspicious data capture or systems control activity. Vodafone was satisfied with the outcome and thereafter increased its reliance on Huawei as an equipment-supplier.

A 2012 White House-ordered security review found no evidence that Huawei spied for China and said instead that security vulnerabilities on its products posed a greater threat to its users. The details of the leaked review came a week after a US House Intelligence Committee report which warned against letting Huawei supply critical telecommunications infrastructure in the United States.

Huawei has been at the center of concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks. In 2018, the United States passed a defense funding bill that contained a passage barring the federal government from doing business with Huawei, ZTE, and several Chinese vendors of surveillance products, due to security concerns. The Chinese government has threatened economic retaliation against countries that block Huawei&#x27;s market access.

Similarly in November 2018, New Zealand blocked Huawei from supplying mobile equipment to national telecommunications company Spark New Zealand&#x27;s 5G network, citing a &quot;significant network security risk&quot; and concerns about China&#x27;s National Intelligence Law.

Huawei was involved in developing the United Kingdom&#x27;s 5G network, which initially led to serious policy and diplomatic disagreements between the UK and the United States, which opposed Huawei&#x27;s involvement. Between December 2018 and January 2019, German and British intelligence agencies initially pushed back against the US&#x27; allegations, stating that after examining Huawei&#x27;s 5G hardware and accompanying source code, they have found no evidence of malevolence and that a ban would therefore be unwarranted. Additionally, the head of Britain&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre (the information security arm of GCHQ) stated that the US has not managed to provide the UK with any proof of its allegations against Huawei and also their agency had concluded that any risks involving Huawei in UK&#x27;s telecom networks are &quot;manageable&quot;. The Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), set up in 2010 to assuage security fears as it examined Huawei hardware and software for the UK market, was staffed largely by employees from Huawei but with regular oversight from GCHQ, which led to questions of operating independence from Huawei. On 1 October 2020, an official report released by National Cyber Security Centre noted that &quot;Huawei has failed to adequately tackle security flaws in equipment used in the UK&#x27;s telecoms networks despite previous complaints&quot;, and flagged one vulnerability of &quot;national significance&quot; related to broadband in 2019. The report concluded that Huawei was not confident of implementing the five-year plan of improving its software engineering processes, so there was &quot;limited assurance that all risks to UK national security&quot; could be mitigated in the long-term. On 14 July 2020, the United Kingdom Government announced a ban on the use of company&#x27;s 5G network equipment, citing security concerns. In October 2020, the British Defence Select Committee announced that it had found evidence of Huawei&#x27;s collusion with the Chinese state and that it supported accelerated purging of Huawei equipment from Britain&#x27;s telecom infrastructure by 2025, since they concluded that Huawei had &quot;engaged in a variety of intelligence, security, and intellectual property activities&quot; despite its repeated denials. In November 2020, Huawei challenged the UK government&#x27;s decision, citing an Oxford Economics report that it had contributed £3.3 billion to the UK&#x27;s GDP.

In March 2019, Huawei filed three defamation claims over comments suggesting ties to the Chinese government made on television by a French researcher, a broadcast journalist and a telecommunications sector expert. In June 2020 ANSSI informed French telecommunications companies that they would not be allowed to renew licenses for 5G equipment made from Huawei after 2028. On 28 August 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron assured the Chinese government that it did not ban Huawei products from participating in its fifth-generation mobile roll-out, but favored European providers for security reasons. The head of the France&#x27;s cybersecurity agency also stated that it has granted time-limited waivers on 5G for wireless operators that use Huawei products, a decision that likely started a &quot;phasing out&quot; of the company&#x27;s products.

In February 2020, US government officials claimed that Huawei has had the ability to covertly exploit backdoors intended for law enforcement officials in carrier equipment like antennas and routers since 2009.

In mid July 2020, Andrew Little, the Minister in charge of New Zealand&#x27;s signals intelligence agency the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), announced that New Zealand would not join the United Kingdom and United States in banning Huawei from the country&#x27;s 5G network.

In May 2022, Canada&#x27;s industry minister Francois-Philippe Champagne announced that Canada will ban Huawei from the country&#x27;s 5G network, in an effort to protect the safety and security of Canadians, as well as to protect Canada&#x27;s infrastructure. The Canadian federal government cited national security concerns for the move, saying that the suppliers could be forced to company with &quot;extrajudicial directions from foreign governments&quot; in ways that could &quot;conflict with Canadian laws or would be detrimental to Canadian interests&quot;. Telcos will be prevented from procuring new 4G or 5G equipment from Huawei and ZTE and must remove all ZTE- and Huawei-branded 5G equipment from their networks by 28 June 2024.

=== Meng Wanzhou case ===
=== Intellectual property infringement ===

Huawei has settled with Cisco Systems, Motorola, and PanOptis in patent infringement lawsuits. In 2018, a German court ruled against Huawei and ZTE in favor of MPEG LA, which holds patents related to Advanced Video Coding.

Huawei has been accused of intellectual property theft. In February 2003, Cisco Systems sued Huawei Technologies for allegedly infringing on its patents and illegally copying source code used in its routers and switches. By July 2004, Huawei removed the contested code, manuals and command-line interfaces and the case was subsequently settled out of court. As part of the settlement Huawei admitted that it had copied some of Cisco&#x27;s router software.

At the 2004 Supercomm tech conference in Chicago, a Huawei employee allegedly opened up the networking equipment of other companies to photograph the circuit boards.

Brian Shields, former chief security officer at Nortel, said that his company was compromised in 2004 by Chinese hackers; executive credentials were accessed remotely, and entire computers were taken over. Shields does not believe Huawei was directly involved but thinks that Huawei was a beneficiary of the hack. Documents taken included product roadmaps, sales proposals, and technical papers. Nortel sought for but failed to receive help from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service said it approached the company but was rebuffed.

Cybersecurity experts have some doubts about a hack of such magnitude as described by Shields, calling it &quot;unlikely&quot;. An extensive analysis by University of Ottawa professor Jonathan Calof and recollections of former Nortel executive Tim Dempsey place the blame mostly on strategic mistakes and poor management at Nortel. On the other hand, some employees recall when Huawei or a front company returned a fibre card to Nortel disassembled, around a time when knock-offs products emerged in Asia. There remains a suspicion that industrial espionage brought down or at least accelerated Nortel&#x27;s demise.

In 2017, a jury found that Huawei had misappropriated trade secrets of T-Mobile US but awarded damages only for a breach of supplier contract; it did not compensate T-Mobile for claims of espionage.

In February 2020, the United States Department of Justice charged Huawei with racketeering and conspiring to steal trade secrets from six US firms. Huawei said those allegations, some going back almost 20 years, had never been found as a basis for any significant monetary judgment.

=== North Korea ===
Leaked documents obtained by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2019 raised questions about whether Huawei conducted business secretly with North Korea, which was under numerous US sanctions.

=== Xinjiang internment camps ===
Huawei has been accused of providing technology used in the mass surveillance and detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang internment camps, resulting in sanctions by the United States Department of State. Documents show that it has developed facial recognition software that recognizes ethnicity-specific features for surveillance and filed a patent in China for a technology that could identify Han and Uyghur pedestrians. The company and its suppliers have also been accused of using forced labor. Huawei denied operating such technology.

=== Alleged use by Hamas ===
On 8 October 2023, former MI6 spy Aimen Dean posted on X that Israel&#x27;s failure to detect the Hamas-led attack on Israel was due partly to its militants use of Huawei phones, tablets and laptops, elaborating that US tech companies barring of Huawei had forced it to develop its own systems that were not easy to hack except by China.

=== Lawsuit ===
In January 2024, Netgear, a computer networking company based in San Jose, California, filed a lawsuit with a California federal court against Huawei, claiming the company broke the United States antitrust law by withholding patent licenses, in addition to allegations of fraud and racketeering.

== NSA infiltration ==
In 2014, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, according to global surveillance disclosures, the National Security Agency (NSA) infiltrated Huawei&#x27;s computer network in 2009. The White House intelligence coordinator and the FBI were also involved. The operation obtained Huawei&#x27;s customer list and internal training documents. In addition, the company&#x27;s central email archive was accessed, including messages from founder Ren Zhengfei and chairwoman Sun Yafang. So much data was gathered that &quot;we don&#x27;t know what to do with it&quot;, according to one document. The NSA was concerned that Huawei&#x27;s infrastructure could provide China with signals intelligence capabilities. It also wanted to find ways to exploit the company&#x27;s products because they are used by targets of interest to the NSA.

== Sanctions, bans, and restrictions ==
=== United States ===
==== Before the 2020 semiconductor ban ====
In August 2018, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA 2019) was signed into law, containing a provision that banned Huawei and ZTE equipment from being used by the US federal government, citing security concerns. Huawei filed a lawsuit over the NDAA 2019 in March 2019, alleging it to be unconstitutional because it specifically targeted Huawei without granting it a chance to provide a rebuttal or due process. The federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in February 2020, concluding that U.S. Congress acted within its powers by including the restriction in the NDAA 2019.

Additionally, on 15 May 2019, the Department of Commerce added Huawei and 70 foreign subsidiaries and &quot;affiliates&quot; to its Entity List under the Export Administration Regulations, citing the company having been indicted for &quot;knowingly and willfully causing the export, re-export, sale and supply, directly and indirectly, of goods, technology and services (banking and other financial services) from the United States to Iran and the government of Iran without obtaining a license from the Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)&quot;. This restricts US companies from doing business with Huawei without a government license. Various US-based companies immediately froze their business with Huawei to comply with the regulation.

The May 2019 ban on Huawei was partial: it did not affect most non-American produced chips, and the Trump administration granted a series of extensions on the ban in any case, with another 90-day reprieve issued in May 2020. In May 2020, the US extended the ban to cover semiconductors customized for Huawei and made with US technology. In August 2020, the US again extended the ban to a blanket ban on all semiconductor sales to Huawei. The blanket ban took effect in September 2020. Samsung and LG Display were banned from supplying displays to Huawei.

==== After 2020 ====
The sanctions regime established in September 2020 negatively affected Huawei production, sales and financial projections. However, on 29 June 2019 at the G20 summit, the US President made statements implicating plans to ease the restrictions on US companies doing business with Huawei. Despite this statement, on 15 May 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended its export restrictions to prevent Huawei from producing semiconductors derived from technology or software of US origin, even if the manufacturing is performed overseas. In June 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated Huawei a national security threat, thereby barring it from any US subsidies. In July 2020, the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council published a Federal Register notice prohibiting all federal government contractors from selling Huawei hardware to the federal government and preventing federal contractors from using Huawei hardware.

In November 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting any American company or individual from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which included Huawei. In January 2021, the Trump administration revoked licenses from US companies such as Intel from supplying products and technologies to Huawei. In June 2021, the FCC voted unanimously to prohibit approvals of Huawei gear in US telecommunication networks on national security grounds.

In June 2021, the administration of Joe Biden began to persuade the United Arab Emirates to remove the Huawei Technologies Co. equipment from its telecommunications network, while ensuring to further distance itself from China. It came as an added threat to the $23 billion arms deal of F-35 fighter jets and Reaper drones between the US and the UAE. The Emirates got a deadline of four years from Washington to replace the Chinese network. A report in September 2021 analyzed how the UAE was struggling between maintaining its relations with both the United States and China. While Washington had a hawkish stance towards Beijing, the increasing Emirati relations with China have strained those with America. In that light, the Western nation has raised concerns for the UAE to beware of the security threat that the Chinese technologies like Huawei 5G telecommunications network possessed. However, the Gulf nations like the Emirates and Saudi Arabia defended their decision of picking Chinese technology over the American, saying that it is much cheaper and had no political conditions.

After President Joe Biden signed into law the Secure Equipment Act of 2021, on 25 November 2022, the FCC issued a ban on Huawei for national security reasons, citing the national security risk posed by the technology owned by China. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce revoked some export licenses that allow Intel and Qualcomm to supply Huawei with semiconductors.

==== Huawei&#x27;s reaction ====

===== Stockpiling of processors =====
Before the 15 September 2020 deadline, Huawei was in &quot;survival mode&quot; and stockpiled &quot;5G mobile processors, Wifi, radio frequency and display driver chips and other components&quot; from key chip suppliers and manufacturers, including Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, MediaTek, Realtek, Novatek, and RichWave. Even in 2019, Huawei spent $23.45 billion on the stockpiling of chips and other supplies in 2019, up 73% from 2018. In May 2020, SMIC manufactured 14 nm chips for Huawei, which was the first time Huawei used a foundry other than TSMC. In July 2020, TSMC confirmed it would halt the shipment of silicon wafers to Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei and its subsidiary HiSilicon by 14 September.

On its most crucial business, namely, its telecoms business (including 5G) and server business, Huawei has stockpiled 1.5 to 2 years&#x27; worth of chips and components. It began massively stockpiling from 2018, when Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei&#x27;s founder, was arrested in Canada upon US request. Key Huawei suppliers included Xilinx, Intel, AMD, Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron and Kioxia. On the other hand, analysts predicted that Huawei could ship 195 million units of smartphones from its existing stockpile in 2021, but shipments may drop to 50 million in 2021 if rules are not relaxed.

===== Development of processors =====
In late 2020, it was reported that Huawei had planned to build a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Shanghai that did not involve US technology. The plan may have helped Huawei obtain necessary chips after its existing stockpile became depleted, which would have helped the company chart a sustainable path for its telecoms business. Huawei had also planned to collaborate with the government-run Shanghai IC R&amp;D Center, which is partially owned by the state-owned enterprise Hua Hong Semiconductor. Huawei may have been purchasing equipment from Chinese firms such as AMEC and NAURA Technology Group, as well as using foreign tools which it could still find on the market.

In August 2023, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), a US trade association, alleged that Huawei was building a collection of secret semiconductor-fabrication facilities across China, a shadow manufacturing network that would let the company skirt US sanctions. Huawei was receiving an estimated $30 billion in state funding from the government at the time and had acquired at least two existing plants, with plans to construct at least three others. The United States Department of Commerce had put Huawei on its entity list in 2019, eventually &quot;prohibiting it from working with American companies in almost all circumstances.&quot; However, if Huawei were to function under the names of other companies without disclosing its own involvement, it might have been able to circumvent those restrictions to &quot;indirectly purchase American chipmaking equipment and other supplies that would otherwise be prohibited.&quot;

On 6 September 2023, Huawei launched its new Mate 60 smartphone. The phone is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip, made in China by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC). This processor was the first to use the new 7 nanometre SMIC technology. TechInsights had stated in 2022 that it believed SMIC had managed to produce 7 nm chips, even though faced by a harsh sanctions regime, by adapting simpler machines that it could still purchase from ASML. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said that this showed that the US sanctions might have had the effect of sending China&#x27;s chip-making industry into overdrive: &quot;If SMIC really has perfected its 7nm process, this would be a major advance that can help Huawei remain at the forefront of the smartphone industry.&quot; TechInsights found evidence that the processor had been manufactured using SMIC&#x27;s N+2 7 nm node. One of its analysts, Dan Hutcheson, who had led the breakdown of the new device, stated that it demonstrates &quot;impressive technical progress China&#x27;s semiconductor industry has made&quot; despite not having EUVL tools, and that &quot;the difficulty of this achievement also shows the resilience of the country&#x27;s chip technological ability&quot;. However other analysts have said that such an achievement may lead to harsher sanctions against it.

===== Replacement operating systems =====

After the US sanctions regime started in summer 2018, Huawei started working on its own in-house operating system codenamed &quot;HongMeng OS&quot;: in an interview with &quot;Die Welt&quot;, executive Richard Yu stated in 2019 that an in-house OS could be used as a &quot;plan B&quot; if it were prevented from using Android or Windows as the result of US action. Huawei filed trademarks for the names &quot;Ark&quot;, &quot;Ark OS&quot;, and &quot;Harmony&quot; in Europe, which were speculated to be connected to this OS. On 9 August 2019, Huawei officially unveiled Harmony OS at its inaugural HDC developers&#x27; conference in Dongguan with the ARK compiler which can be used to port Android APK packages to the OS.

In September 2019, Huawei began offering the Linux distribution Deepin as a pre-loaded operating system on selected Matebook models in China.

Whereas at first the official Huawei line was that Harmony OS was not intended for smartphones, in June 2021 Huawei began shipping its smartphones with Harmony OS by default in China (in Europe it kept Android, in its own version EMUI, as the default). The operating system proved a success in China, rising from no market share at all to 10 per cent of the Chinese market for smartphones within two years (from mid-2021 to mid-2023), at the expense of Android.

=== Other countries ===
In 2013, Taiwan blocked mobile network operators and government departments from using Huawei equipment.

In 2018, Japan banned Huawei from receiving government contracts.

In 2019, Vietnam left Huawei out of bids to build the country&#x27;s 5G network out of national security concerns.

Following the initial 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes, India announced that Huawei telecommunication gear would be removed from the country and that the company would be blocked from participating in India&#x27;s 5G network out of national security concerns.

Ten out of the 27 European Union member states have regulatory frameworks curbing Huawei products. They range from bans, higher barriers to approval, refusal to renew licenses, and unimplemented proposals.

Having previously banned Huawei from participating in its 5G auction, Brazil reversed its position in early 2021 and allowed Huawei to participate.

In May 2022, Canada&#x27;s government banned Huawei and ZTE equipment from the country&#x27;s 5G network, with network operators having until 28 June 2024 to remove what they had already installed. The ban followed years of lobbying from the US, part of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Australia and New Zealand have also banned or restricted Huawei products.

In October 2022, the UK extended the deadline by a year to the end of 2023 for removing core Huawei equipment from network functions. The ban, originally announced in 2020 following US pressure, calls for the phasing out of all Huawei gear from UK&#x27;s 5G network by the end of 2027, which remains unchanged.

Per an August 2023 decree on 5G network development, Costa Rica barred firms from all countries that have not signed the Budapest Convention on cybercrime. The decree affects Chinese firms like Huawei, as well as firms from South Korea, Russia and Brazil, among others.

In July 2024, the German government announced a deal with telecommunication companies in the country to remove Chinese 5G equipment, including from Huawei, by 2029.

=== Chinese view ===
Western distrust and targeting of Huawei is generally viewed by the Chinese public as unjustified. This has led to a perspective in the Chinese public and among city governments that patronizing Huawei helps support China in geopolitical and technological competition with the United States. Huawei has thus received high levels of support in terms of public sentiment which its rival firms do not benefit from to the same extent. Huawei&#x27;s top position in China&#x27;s smart cities technology market has in particular been boosted by these sentiments.

<doc id="290921" wikidata="Q313922" url="?curid=290921" title="Epiphanius of Salamis">
<text>Epiphanius of Salamis (; – 403) was the bishop of Salamis, Cyprus, at the end of the 4th century. He is considered a saint and a Church Father by both the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches. He gained a reputation as a strong defender of orthodoxy. He is best known for composing the &quot;Panarion&quot;, a compendium of eighty heresies, which included also pagan religions and philosophical systems. There has been much controversy over how many of the quotations attributed to him by the Byzantine Iconoclasts were actually by him. Regardless of this, he was clearly strongly against some contemporary uses of images in the church.

==Life==
Epiphanius was either born into a Romaniote Christian family or became a Christian in his youth. Either way, he was a Romaniote Jew who was born in the small settlement of Besanduk, near Eleutheropolis (modern-day Beit Guvrin in Israel), and lived as a monk in Egypt, where he was educated and came into contact with Valentinian groups. He returned to Roman Palestine around 333, when he was still a young man, and he founded a monastery at Ad near Eleutheropolis, which is often mentioned in the polemics of Jerome with Rufinus and John, Bishop of Jerusalem. He was ordained a priest, and lived and studied as superior of the monastery in Ad that he founded for thirty years and gained much skill and knowledge in that position. In that position he gained the ability to speak in several languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, Egyptian, Greek, and Latin, and was called by Jerome on that account &quot;Pentaglossos&quot; (&quot;Five-tongued&quot;).

Epiphanius was a contemporary of 
Hilarion (c. 291–371), an anchorite who followed the example of his Egyptian mentor, Anthony the Great (c. 251–356) retreating to the wilderness in the coastal area near Gaza and is considered by his biographer Jerome to be the founder of Palestinian monasticism, and Chariton (mid-3rd century – c. 350), founder of monasticism in the Judaean Desert.

Epiphanius&#x27; reputation for learning prompted his nomination and consecration as Bishop of Salamis, Cyprus, in 365 or 367, a post which he held until his death. He was also the Metropolitan of the Church of Cyprus. He served as bishop for nearly forty years, as well as travelled widely to combat differing beliefs. He was present at a synod in Antioch (376) where the Trinitarian questions were debated against the heresy of Apollinarianism. He upheld the position of Bishop Paulinus, who had the support of Rome, over that of Meletius of Antioch, who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he was present at the Council of Rome, again upholding the cause of Paulinus.

==Origenist controversy and death==

During a visit to Palestine in 394 or 395, while preaching in Jerusalem, he attacked Origen&#x27;s followers and urged the Bishop of Jerusalem, John II, to condemn his writings. He urged John to be careful of the &quot;offence&quot; of images in the churches. He noted that when travelling in Palestine he went into a church to pray and saw a curtain with an image of Christ or a saint which he tore down. He told Bishop John that such images were &quot;opposed ... to our religion&quot; (see below). This event sowed the seeds of conflict which erupted in the dispute between Rufinus and John against Jerome and Epiphanius. Epiphanius fuelled this conflict by ordaining a priest for Jerome&#x27;s monastery at Bethlehem, thus trespassing on John&#x27;s jurisdiction. This dispute continued during the 390s, in particular in the literary works by Rufinus and Jerome attacking one another.

In 399, the dispute took on another dimension, when the Bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, who had initially supported John, changed his views and started persecuting Origenist monks in Egypt. As a result of this persecution, four of these monks, the so-called Tall Brothers, fled to Palestine, and then travelled to Constantinople, seeking support and spreading the controversy. John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, gave the monks shelter. Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria saw his chance to use this event to bring down his enemy Chrysostom: in 402 he summoned a council in Constantinople, and invited those supportive of his anti-Origenist views. Epiphanius, by this time nearly 80, was one of those summoned, and began the journey to Constantinople. However, when he realised he was being used as a tool by Theophilus against Chrysostom, who had given refuge to the monks persecuted by Theophilus and who were appealing to the emperor, Epiphanius started back to Salamis, only to die on the way home in 403.

==The curtain incident==
Letter LI in Jerome&#x27;s letters gives Jerome&#x27;s Latin translation, made at Epiphanius&#x27; request, of his letter, originally in Greek from c. 394, &quot;From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem&quot; (see previous section for wider context). The final section covers the often quoted incident of the curtain, which unlike other passages attributed to Epiphanius and quoted by the Iconoclasts, is accepted as authentic by modern scholars:

9. Moreover, I have heard that certain persons have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the holy place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect, after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to pray, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered. It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the saints; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ’s church contrary to the teaching of the Scriptures, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to Cyprus for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the presbyter of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort—opposed as they are to our religion—shall not be hung up in any church of Christ. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offence unworthy alike of the Church of Christ and of those Christians who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia—a man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God&#x27;s pity—for he preaches and teaches the heresy of Origen; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are intrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine. I pray that you may fare well in the Lord.

==Writings==

===&quot;Panarion&quot;===

His best-known book is the &quot;Panarion&quot; (from Latin , &quot;bread basket&quot; &lt; &quot;panis&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;), also known as &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot;, &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, presented as a book of antidotes for those bitten by the serpent of heresy. Written between 374 and 377, it forms a handbook for dealing with the arguments of heretics.

It lists, and refutes, 80 heresies, some of which are not described in any other surviving documents from the time. Epiphanius begins with the &#x27;four mothers&#x27; of pre-Christian heresy – &#x27;barbarism&#x27;, &#x27;Scythism&#x27;, &#x27;Hellenism&#x27; and &#x27;Judaism&#x27; – and then addresses the 16 pre-Christian heresies that have flowed from them: four philosophical schools (Stoics, Platonists, Pythagoreans and Epicureans), and 12 Jewish sects. There then follows an interlude, telling of the Incarnation of the Word. After this, Epiphanius embarks on his account of the 60 Christian heresies, from assorted gnostics to the various trinitarian heresies of the fourth century, closing with the Collyridians and Messalians.

While Epiphanius often let his zeal come before facts – he admits on one occasion that he writes against the Origenists-based only on hearsay (&quot;Panarion&quot;, Epiphanius 71) – the &quot;Panarion&quot; is a valuable source of information on the Christian Church of the fourth century. It is also an important source regarding the early Jewish gospels such as the Gospel according to the Hebrews circulating among the Ebionites and the Nazarenes, as well as the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus.

One unique feature of the &quot;Panarion&quot; is in the way that Epiphanius compares the various heretics to different poisonous beasts, going so far as to describe in detail the animal&#x27;s characteristics, how it produces its poison, and how to protect oneself from the animal&#x27;s bite or poison. For example, he describes his enemy Origen as &quot;a toad noisy from too much moisture which keeps croaking louder and louder.&quot; He compares the Gnostics to a particularly dreaded snake &quot;with no fangs.&quot; The Ebionites, a Christian sect that followed Jewish law, were described by Epiphanius as &quot;a monstrosity with many shapes, who practically formed the snake-like shape of the mythical many-headed Hydra in himself.&quot; In all, Epiphanius describes fifty animals, usually one per sect.

Another feature of the &quot;Panarion&quot; is the access its earlier sections provide to lost works, notably Justin Martyr&#x27;s work on heresies, the Greek of Irenaeus&#x27; &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, and Hippolytus&#x27; &quot;Syntagma&quot;. The &quot;Panarion&quot; was first translated into English in 1987 and 1990.

===Other works===
His earliest known work is the &quot;Ancoratus&quot; (the well anchored man), which includes arguments against Arianism and the teachings of Origen. Aside from the polemics by which he is known, Epiphanius wrote a work of biblical antiquarianism, called, for one of its sections, &quot;On Weights and Measures&quot; (περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων). It was composed in Constantinople for a Persian priest, in 392, and survives in Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian translations (this last is found in &quot;Shatberd ms 1141&quot; along with &quot;Physiologus&quot; and &quot;De Gemmis&quot;). The first section discusses the canon of the Old Testament and its versions, the second of measures and weights, and the third, the geography of Palestine. The texts appear not to have been given a polish but consist of rough notes and sketches, as Allen A. Shaw, a modern commentator, concluded; nevertheless Epiphanius&#x27; work on metrology was important in the history of measurement.

Another work, &quot;On the Twelve Gems&quot; (&quot;De Gemmis&quot;), survives in a number of fragments, the most complete of which is the Georgian. The letter written by Epiphanius to John, Bishop of Jerusalem, in 394 and preserved in Jerome&#x27;s translation, is discussed above. The collection of homilies traditionally ascribed to a &quot;Saint Epiphanius, bishop&quot; are dated in the late fifth or sixth century and are not connected with Epiphanius of Salamis by modern scholars.

Such was Epiphanius&#x27;s reputation for learning that the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, the principal source of medieval bestiaries, came to be widely falsely attributed to him.

<doc id="290931" wikidata="Q22662" url="?curid=290931" title="René Maurice Fréchet">
<text>René Maurice Fréchet (; 2 September 1878 – 4 June 1973) was a French mathematician. He made major contributions to general topology and was the first to define metric spaces. He also made several important contributions to the field of statistics and probability, as well as calculus. His dissertation opened the entire field of functionals on metric spaces and introduced the notion of compactness. Independently of Riesz, he discovered the representation theorem in the space of Lebesgue square integrable functions. He is often referred to as the founder of the theory of abstract spaces.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born to a Protestant family in Maligny to Jacques and Zoé Fréchet. At the time of his birth, his father was a director of a Protestant orphanage in Maligny and was later in his youth appointed a head of a Protestant school. However, the newly established Third Republic was not sympathetic to religious education and so laws were enacted requiring all education to be secular. As a result, his father lost his job. To generate some income his mother set up a boarding house for foreigners in Paris. His father was able later to obtain another teaching position within the secular system – it was not a job of a headship, however, and the family could not expect as high standards as they might have otherwise.

Maurice attended the secondary school Lycée Buffon in Paris where he was taught mathematics by Jacques Hadamard. Hadamard recognised the potential of young Maurice and decided to tutor him on an individual basis. After Hadamard moved to the University of Bordeaux in 1894, Hadamard continuously wrote to Fréchet, setting him mathematical problems and harshly criticising his errors. Much later Fréchet admitted that the problems caused him to live in a continual fear of not being able to solve some of them, even though he was very grateful for the special relationship with Hadamard he was privileged to enjoy.

After completing high-school Fréchet was required to enroll in military service. This is the time when he was deciding whether to study mathematics or physics – he chose mathematics out of dislike of the chemistry classes he would have had to take otherwise. Thus in 1900 he enrolled to École Normale Supérieure to study mathematics.

He started publishing quite early, having published four papers in 1903. He also published some of his early papers with the American Mathematical Society due to his contact with American mathematicians in Paris—particularly Edwin Wilson.

===Middle life===
Fréchet served at many different institutions during his academic career. From 1907 to 1908 he served as a professor of mathematics at the Lycée in Besançon, then moved in 1908 to the Lycée in Nantes to stay there for a year. After that he served at the University of Poitiers between 1910 and 1919.

He married in 1908 to Suzanne Carrive (1881–1945) and had four children: Hélène, Henri, Denise and Alain.

===First World War===
Fréchet was planning to spend a year in the United States at the University of Illinois, but his plan was disrupted when the First World War broke out in 1914. He was mobilised on 4 August the same year. Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the British Army. However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front. French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised. They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war. It is remarkable that during his service in the war, he still managed to produce cutting edge mathematical papers frequently, despite having little time to devote to mathematics.

===After the war===
After the end of the war, Fréchet was chosen to go to Strasbourg to help with the reestablishment of the university. He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute. Despite being burdened with administrative work, he was again able to produce a large amount of high-quality research.

In 1928 Fréchet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from Borel, who was then chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. Fréchet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne&#x27;s Rockefeller Foundation and from 1928 was a Professor (without a chair). Fréchet was promoted to tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. In 1941 Fréchet succeeded Borel as chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fréchet held until he retired in 1949. From 1928 to 1935 Fréchet was also put in charge of lectures at the École Normale Supérieure; in this latter capacity Fréchet was able to direct a significant number of young mathematicians toward research in probability, including Doeblin, Fortet, Loève, and Jean Ville.

Despite his major achievements, Fréchet was not overly appreciated in France. As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the Académie des sciences until the age of 78. In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1950 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Fréchet was an Esperantist, publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language. He also served as president of the &quot;Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista&quot; (&quot;International Scientific Esperantist Association&quot;) from 1950 to 1953.

==Main works==
His first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis &quot;Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel&quot;, on the calculus of functionals. Here Fréchet introduced the concept of a metric space, although the name is due to Hausdorff. Fréchet&#x27;s level of abstraction is similar to that in group theory, proving theorems within a carefully chosen axiomatic system that can then be applied to a large array of particular cases.

Here is a list of his most important works, in chronological order:
* &quot;Sur les opérations linéaires I-III, 1904–1907 (On linear operators)
* &quot;Les Espaces abstraits&quot;, 1928 (Abstract spaces)
* &quot;Recherches théoriques modernes sur la théorie des probabilités&quot;, 1937–1938 (Modern theoretical research in the theory of probability)
* &quot;Les Probabilités associées à un système d&#x27;événements compatibles et dépendants&quot;, 1939–1943 (Probabilities Associated with a System of Compatible and Dependent Events)
* &quot;Pages choisies d&#x27;analyse générale&quot;, 1953 (Selected Pages of General Analysis)
* &quot;Les Mathématiques et le concret&quot;, 1955 (Mathematics and the concrete)

Fréchet also developed ideas from the article &quot;Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique&quot; (1938; an English translation &quot;The Two Fundamental Types of Statistical Distribution&quot;) of Czech geographer, demographer and statistician Jaromír Korčák.

Fréchet is sometimes credited with the introduction of what is now known as the Cramér–Rao bound, but Fréchet&#x27;s 1940s lecture notes on the topic appear to have been lost.

==Family==

In 1908 he married Suzanne Carrive.

<doc id="290935" wikidata="Q2486179" url="?curid=290935" title="Music of Venezuela">
<text>Several styles of the traditional music of [[Venezuela]], such as salsa and merengue, are common to its Caribbean neighbors. Perhaps the most typical Venezuelan music is joropo, a rural form which originated in the llanos, or plains.

==Genres==

===Joropo===

Joropo was developed by creative artists such as Juan Vicente Torrealba, Ignacio Figueredo, Augusto Bracca, Genaro Prieto, Eneas Perdomo and Angel Custodio Loyola, who helped to popularize the music throughout the country. Since then a slick, contemporary form of pop-llanera has developed which has earned the scorn of some purists who perceive it as stale and watered-down. Some singers, such as Adilia Castillo, Lorenzo Herrera, Simon Diaz, Mario Suarez, Edith Salcedo, Magdalena Sanchez, Rafael Montaño, Reyna Lucero, Vidal Colmenares, Armando Martinez, Cristina Maica, José Catire Carpio, Cristobal Jimenez, Juan de los Santos Contreras (El Carrao de Palmarito) and Reynaldo Armas have maintained a huge following over the years. In a similar vein, there is also neo-folklore, which takes traditional music and arranges it in an electronic style.

===Folk===

Another very popular music in Venezuela is the &quot;Gaita Zuliana&quot;. This genre originated from the region of Zulia State and is very popular during the Christmas season. The gaita united to the Aguinaldo, conforms the national representation of the Venezuelan Christmas. In the east, the malagueña, punto and galerón accompanies the &quot;velorios de cruz de mayo&quot;, (religious tradition, that is celebrated on 3 May in honor to the Christian cross). In the Venezuelan Andes, the Venezuelan bambuco is a local variation of the bambuco. Other forms include polo and the Venezuelan waltz. The Quinteto Contrapunto, founded by Rafael Suárez and Aida Navarro, was a celebrated Venezuelan vocal quintet which reached nationwide and international celebrity in the early 1960s, and was very active for about a decade.

Other forms of Venezuelan folk music are tensively recorded and researched due to the work of Caracas-based Fundación Bigott. African-derived percussion (including multiple rhythms, such as sangueo, fulia, parranda and tamborera) is perhaps the best documented musical form. Fundacion Bigott has also produced groups such Un Solo Pueblo, Huracán de Fuego and Grupo Madera. These more experimental fusion artists combine rumba, Latin jazz, joropo, salsa, Venezuelan traditional chants and other forms of Latin American music.Then there is also the genre commonly known as &quot;Onda Nueva&quot; (New Wave), which is a combination of joropo and jazz music, with influences from the Brazilian Bossa Nova. The genre was introduced by Aldemaro Romero with a special contribution by famed drummer and timpanist Frank Hernandez, nicknamed &quot;El Pavo&quot; (The Turkey (Venezuelan slang for “the youth”)) by employing a very peculiar drum beat. The term was coined by jazz analyst Jacques Braunstein after having been shown a copy of Romero&#x27;s earliest composition called &quot;Araguita&quot;, (originally to be used as jingle material), which Braunstein described as &quot;something of a new wave&quot;. Onda Nueva music was heralded as the Venezuelan Bossa Nova with a very particular seal.

Dominican merengue, Cuban Latin pop acts such as Billo&#x27;s Caracas Boys, the Porfi Jiménez Orchestra and Los Melódicos.

== Contemporary Music ==

=== Venezuelan Salsa ===
Salsa music arrived in Venezuela in the latter half of the 20th century, primarily influenced by the vibrant salsa scenes of Cuba and Puerto Rico. As the genre spread across Latin America, Venezuelan musicians embraced and adapted it, developing a distinct local sound. By the late 1970s, Venezuela had become not just a hub for salsa consumption but also a key center for its production, with new groups emerging that reflected the country’s unique cultural and musical identity.

One of the pioneering salsa groups in Venezuela was Dimensión Latina, founded in 1973. Known for their tight brass arrangements and infectious rhythms, the band played a crucial role in popularizing salsa within the country. Their collaboration with renowned vocalist Oscar D&#x27;León, who has been credited with bringing salsa to &quot;all corners of the world,&quot; cemented Venezuela’s place in the international salsa scene. In 1980, he released &quot;Llorarás&quot;, a salsa classic that became a defining song of his career and Venezuelan salsa.

By the 1990s, salsa in Venezuela continued to evolve, incorporating contemporary influences. Salserín, formed in the early part of the decade, stood out as one of the few successful boy bands in the genre. Their early success was driven by hits like &quot;De Sol a Sol&quot;, &quot;Yo Sin Ti&quot;, and &quot;Un Amor Como El Nuestro&quot;. Around the same time, Adolescentes Orquesta emerged as another key group in the Venezuelan salsa scene, gaining popularity with romantic salsa hits such as &quot;Virgen&quot;, &quot;Persona Ideal&quot;, &quot;Anhelo&quot;, and &quot;Arrepentida&quot;. Both of these groups’ success helped keep salsa music relevant among younger generations, bridging the gap between traditional salsa and newer influences. 

This period also set the stage for Servando &amp; Florentino’s rise as a duo, with the brothers later becoming a prominent act, further expanding the reach of Venezuelan salsa. They achieved widespread success with salsa hits such as &quot;Una Fan Enamorada&quot;, &quot;Aliviame&quot;, and &quot;Estás Hecha Para Mí&quot;, the latter two written by Ricardo Montaner. Beyond salsa, they explored genres like pop and rock, releasing hits like &quot;Si Yo Fuera Tú&quot; and &quot;Una Canción Que Te Enamore&quot;, which broadened their appeal across Latin America. After a decade-long hiatus from touring, they returned in 2022 with the En Tu Ciudad World Tour, performing in 55 cities across three continents and selling out 45 shows, reaffirming their lasting impact on Latin music.

===Pop and Rock===

Franco De Vita emerged in the 1980s as one of Venezuela’s most influential artists, blending melodic pop with rock elements. He released his self-titled debut album Franco De Vita in 1984, followed by Fantasía (1986), Al Norte del Sur (1988), and Extranjero (1990). Throughout this period, he gained widespread recognition with hits such as &quot;Un Buen Perdedor&quot;, &quot;Te Amo&quot;, and &quot;Louis&quot;, which became staples across Latin America. His success extended beyond Venezuela, reaching major markets like Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina, as well as Spain and Italy, where his music resonated with audiences. 

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, De Vita continued to release commercially successful albums, including Nada Es Igual (1999) and Stop (2004). These albums produced chart-topping singles such as &quot;Si Tú No Estás&quot;, &quot;Tú de Qué Vas&quot;, and &quot;Si La Ves&quot;, further cementing his status as a leading figure in Latin pop. His ability to craft heartfelt lyrics and memorable melodies allowed him to maintain a strong presence in the Latin America for decades.

Ricardo Montaner, who grew up in Maracaibo, emerged in the 1980s as another one of Venezuela’s most successful artists, blending pop and ballad influences to create a signature romantic style. He released his debut album Ricardo Montaner (1986), followed by Ricardo Montaner 2 (1988), Un Toque de Misterio (1989), En el Último Lugar del Mundo (1991), and Los Hijos del Sol (1992), among others. During this period, he gained widespread recognition with hits such as &quot;Tan Enamorados&quot;, &quot;Me Va a Extrañar&quot;, La Cima del Cielo, Ojos Negros, Será, and Déjame Llorar, many of which became defining songs of Latin American pop music.

In the late 1990s, Montaner reimagined many of his greatest hits with orchestral arrangements on Con la London Metropolitan Orchestra (1999), which included the widely popular &quot;El Poder de Tu Amor&quot;. Moving into the 2000s and beyond, he continued to solidify his legacy with new releases and consistent chart success, such as &quot;Bésame&quot;. As one of Venezuela’s best-selling artists, Montaner’s influence extends far beyond his home country, making a significant impact in major Latin American markets such as Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and the Dominican Republic, as well as in Spain. His ability to adapt his style while maintaining his signature sound has helped him sustain a multi-decade career, securing his place as one of Latin pop’s most enduring figures.
José Luis Rodríguez has been a defining figure in Venezuelan music, influencing the region&#x27;s music scene for decades. Widely Known as &quot;El Puma,&quot; he has gained recognition for hits, such as Dueño de Nada, Culpable Soy Yo, and Agárrense de las Manos.Carlos Baute gained widespread recognition with his hit song &quot;Colgando en Tus Manos&quot; (2008), a duet with Spanish singer Marta Sánchez. The song became an international success, topping the charts in multiple countries across Latin America and Spain. As of February 2024, its music video has reached nearly 900 million views on YouTube.

Other influential Pop artists include Yordano, Guillermo Dávila, Kiara, Karina, and Ilan Chester have gained popularity across Latin American countries as well.

Several Venezuelan bands have played a significant role in shaping the country’s diverse musical scene, with some gaining international recognition. Los Amigos Invisibles, known for their acid jazz style, and Caramelos de Cianuro, a punk and alternative rock group, have enjoyed success abroad. Other influential groups such as Voz Veis, Desorden Público, Sentimiento Muerto, Zapato 3, and Aditus have made important contributions to Venezuela’s music culture.

=== Electronic music ===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s a few Venezuelan artists began experimenting with sounds, using emerging electronic equipment that was being produced. Artists like Vytas Brenner and Grupo C.I.M. used Moog style synthesizers and effects to embrace the shift in new sounds. Alfredo del Mónaco, who founded the Venezuelan branch of ISCM, is considered the pioneer in electronic music in Venezuela having released &quot;Estudio electrónico I&quot; para cinta in 1968. Jose Enrique Sarabia also known as &quot;Chelique,&quot; who was already internationally known for producing songs since the late 50s like &quot;Ansiedad,&quot; helped by other gifted musicians, recorded and released a record in 1971 through a private press titled: 4 &quot;Fases del Cuatro - Música Venezolana desarrollada Electrónicamente por Chelique Sarabia (4 Phases of Four - Venezuelan Music Electronically Developed by Chelique Sarabia)&quot;. In 1973, when exclusivity of the private contract ended, Chelique commercially released the record under a different title: &quot;Revolución &quot;Electrónica&quot; en Música Venezolana (Electronic Revolution in Venezuelan Music)&quot;. &quot;Revolución &quot;Electrónica&quot; en Música Venezolana&quot; is notable for being one of the earliest electronic records in Venezuela and is considered a trailblazing album for electronic music in Latin America.

In the late 1990s a very strong electronic music movement spread through the country. Several big multimedia festivals took place, such as &quot;Caracas No Duerme,&quot; &quot;AX,&quot; &quot;Petaquire,&quot; and &quot;Mare Nostrum.&quot; These events combined music with the video and performance art of Venezuelan artists such as Luis Poleo, Frank Wow, and Sony. The main bands/DJ&#x27;s of this era are Ojo Fatuo, DJ Oddo and DJ Wyz.

<text>The Symphony No. 4 in B major, Op. 60, is the fourth-published symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was composed in 1806 and premiered in March 1807 at a private concert in Vienna at the town house of Prince Lobkowitz. The first public performance was at the Burgtheater in Vienna in April 1808.

The symphony is in four movements. It is predominantly genial in tone, and has tended to be overshadowed by the weightier Beethoven symphonies that preceded and followed it – the Third Symphony &quot;(Eroica)&quot; and the Fifth. Although later composers including Berlioz, Mendelssohn and Schumann greatly admired the work it has not become as widely known among the music-loving public as the &quot;Eroica&quot;, the Fifth and other Beethoven symphonies.

==Background==
Beethoven spent the summer of 1806 at the country estate of his patron, Prince Lichnowsky, in Silesia. In September Beethoven and the Prince visited the house of one of the latter&#x27;s friends, Count Franz von Oppersdorff, in nearby Oberglogau. The Count maintained a private orchestra, and the composer was honoured with a performance of his Second Symphony, written four years earlier. After this, Oppersdorff offered the composer a substantial sum to write a new symphony for him.

Beethoven had been working on what later became his Fifth Symphony, and his first intention may have been to complete it in fulfilment of the Count&#x27;s commission. There are several theories about why, if so, he did not do this. According to George Grove, economic necessity obliged Beethoven to offer the Fifth (together with the &quot;Pastoral&quot;) jointly to Prince Lobkowitz and Count Razumovsky. Other commentators suggest that the Fourth was essentially complete before Oppersdorff&#x27;s commission, or that the composer may not yet have felt ready to press on with &quot;the radical and emotionally demanding Fifth&quot;, or that the count&#x27;s evident liking for the more Haydnesque world of the Second Symphony prompted another work in similar vein.

The work is dedicated to &quot;the Silesian nobleman Count Franz von Oppersdorff&quot;. Although Oppersdorff had paid for exclusive rights to the work for its first six months, his orchestra did not give the first performance. The symphony was premiered in March 1807 at a private concert in Vienna at the town house of Prince Lobkowitz, another of Beethoven&#x27;s patrons. The first public performance was at the Burgtheater in Vienna in April 1808. The orchestral parts were published in March 1809, but the full score was not printed until 1821. The manuscript, which was for a time owned by Felix Mendelssohn, is now in the Berlin State Library and can be seen online.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for flute, two oboes, two soprano clarinets in B, two bassoons, two horns in F, two trumpets in B, timpani and strings. It typically takes between 30 and 35 minutes to perform.

==Analysis==
In general the symphony is sunny and cheerful, with light instrumentation that for some listeners recalls the symphonies of Joseph Haydn, with whom Beethoven had studied a decade before. In a commentary on the symphony Grove comments that Haydn – who was still alive when the new symphony was first performed – might have found the work too strong for his taste. The Fourth Symphony contrasts with Beethoven&#x27;s style in the previous Third Symphony &quot;(Eroica)&quot;, and has sometimes been overshadowed by its massive predecessor and its fiery successor, the Fifth Symphony.

=== I. Adagio – Allegro vivace ===

The first movement is in time. Like those of the first, second, and seventh of Beethoven&#x27;s nine symphonies, it has a slow introduction. Leonard Bernstein described it as a &quot;mysterious introduction which hovers around minor modes, tip-toeing its tenuous weight through ambiguous unrelated keys and so reluctant to settle down into its final B major.&quot; It begins in B minor with a low B, played pizzicato and pianissimo by the strings, followed by a long-held chord in the wind, during which the strings move slowly in the minor.

The quiet introduction is thirty-eight bars long, and is followed by a fortissimo repetition of the chord of F, leading into the allegro vivace first subject of the main, sonata form part of the movement, described by Grove as &quot;gaiety itself, and most original gaiety&quot;:

The second subject is, in the words of Donald Tovey, &quot;a conversation between the bassoon, the oboe, and the flute.&quot; The development section takes the tonality towards the remote key of B major before returning to the tonic B, and the recapitulation and coda follow the conventional classical form.

=== II. Adagio ===

The second movement, in time (E major), is a slow rondo. The rhythmic figure of the opening theme persists throughout, and underpins, the whole movement:

Tovey calls the first episode (or second subject) &quot;a still more subtle melody&quot;:

The main theme returns in an elaborate variation, followed by a middle episode and the reappearance of the varied main theme, now played by the flute. A regular recapitulation is followed by a coda that makes a final allusion to the main theme, and the timpani bring the movement to an end with the last appearance of the rhythmic theme with which the movement began.

=== III. Scherzo-trio: Allegro vivace ===

The movement, in and B major, is headed Menuetto in most printed scores, though not in Beethoven&#x27;s original manuscript. It is marked &quot;Allegro vivace&quot;, and was originally to have been &quot;allegro molto e vivace&quot;, but Beethoven deleted the &quot;molto&quot; in the autograph score. His metronome marking is dotted minim = 100, at which brisk speed a traditional minuet would be impossible. Haydn had earlier wished that &quot;someone would show us how to make a new minuet&quot;, and in this symphony, as in the First, Beethoven &quot;forsook the spirit of the minuet of his predecessors, increased its speed, broke through its formal and antiquated mould, and out of a mere dance-tune produced a &quot;Scherzo&quot;&quot;. (Grove). 

In the Fourth Symphony (and later, in the Seventh) Beethoven further departed from the traditional minuet-trio-minuet form by repeating the trio after the second rendition of the scherzo section, and then bringing the scherzo back for a third hearing. The final repetition of the scherzo is abridged, and in the coda the two horns &quot;blow the whole movement away&quot; (Tovey).

=== IV. Allegro ma non troppo ===

The last movement is in time in B major. The tempo marking is Allegro ma non troppo; this, like that of the third movement, is an afterthought on Beethoven&#x27;s part: the original tempo indication in the autograph score is an unqualified &quot;allegro&quot;. The composer added (in red chalk) &quot;ma non troppo&quot; – i.e. but not too much so. The movement is in a playful style that the composer called (unbuttoned).

After some 340 bars of what Grove describes as a &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot;, Beethoven concludes the symphony with the Haydnesque device of playing the main theme at half speed, interrupted by pauses, before a final fortissimo flourish.

==Reception==
As usual by this stage of the composer&#x27;s career, the symphony divided opinion among those who heard early performances. In 1809 Carl Maria von Weber, never an admirer of Beethoven, wrote:
:First a slow movement full of short disjointed unconnected ideas, at the rate of three or four notes per quarter of an hour; then a mysterious roll of the drum and passage of the violas, seasoned with the proper quantity of pauses and ritardandos; and to end all a furious finale, in which the only requisite is that there should be no ideas for the hearer to make out, but plenty of transitions from one key to another – on to the new note at once! never mind modulating! – above all things, throw rules to the winds, for they only hamper a genius.
Other critics were less hostile, praising the composer&#x27;s &quot;richness of ideas, bold originality and fullness of power&quot; though finding the Fourth and the works premiered alongside it &quot;rough diamonds&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s biographer Anton Schindler later recalled the Fourth as being a great success from the outset, although later scholars have expressed reservations about his reliability.

When Beethoven&#x27;s younger contemporary Hector Berlioz heard the symphony he wrote that the slow movement was the work of the Archangel Michael, and not that of a human. Nonetheless, by the time Berlioz was writing musical criticism, the Fourth was already less often played than other Beethoven symphonies. Robert Schumann is said to have called the Fourth Symphony &quot;a slender Greek maiden between two Norse giants&quot;, and it was an important influence on his First Symphony. Mendelssohn loved the Fourth, and programmed it when he was conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. But their enthusiasm was not shared by the wider musical public. As early as 1831 a British critic noted that the Fourth was the &quot;least frequently brought forward&quot; of the first six, though, in his view &quot;not inferior to any&quot;. In 1838 the French impresario Louis-Désiré Véron called the Fourth sublime and regretted that in Paris it was not merely neglected but denigrated. In 1896 Grove commented that the work had &quot;met with scant notice in some of the most prominent works on Beethoven&quot;.

In the 20th century, writers continued to contrast the Fourth with the &quot;Eroica&quot; and the Fifth. In a study of the Fourth written in 2012 Mark Ferraguto quotes a 1994 description of the work as &quot;a rich, verdant valley of yin expressiveness … poised between the two staggering yang peaks of the Third and the Fifth&quot;.

According to the musicologist Robert Greenberg of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music:
:If &quot;any&quot; of Beethoven&#x27;s contemporaries had written this symphony, it would be considered that composer&#x27;s masterwork, and that composer would be remembered &quot;forever&quot; for this symphony, and this symphony would be played – often – as an example of that composer&#x27;s great work. As it is, for Beethoven, it is a work in search of an audience. It&#x27;s the least known and least appreciated of the nine.

==Recordings==

The symphony has been recorded, in the studio and in concert performances, more than a hundred times. Early recordings were mostly issued as single sets, sometimes coupled with another Beethoven symphony, such as the Second. More recently, recordings of the Fourth have often been issued as part of complete cycles of the Beethoven symphonies.

Monaural recordings, made in the era of 78 rpm discs or mono LPs, include a 1933 set with Felix Weingartner conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, a 1939 version by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini, recordings from the 1940s conducted by Willem Mengelberg, Serge Koussevitzky and Sir Thomas Beecham, and from the early 1950s under Georg Solti (1951) and Wilhelm Furtwängler (1952).

Recordings from the stereo LP era of the mid-1950s to the 1970s include those conducted by Otto Klemperer (1957), Pierre Monteux (1959), Herbert von Karajan (1963) and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt (1966).

The late 1950s and early 1960s saw the first recordings based on recent musicological ideas of authentic early-19th-century performance practice: Hermann Scherchen (1958) and René Leibowitz (1961) conducted sets of the symphonies attempting to follow Beethoven&#x27;s metronome markings, which up to then had been widely regarded as impossibly fast. These pioneering efforts were followed in later decades by recordings of performances in what was currently regarded as authentic style, often played by specialist ensembles on old instruments, or replicas of them, playing at about a semitone below modern concert pitch. Among conductors of such versions of the Fourth Symphony have been Christopher Hogwood (1986), Roger Norrington (1988), Frans Brüggen (1991) and John Eliot Gardiner (1994).

More recently some conductors of modern symphony or chamber orchestras have recorded the Fourth (along with other Beethoven symphonies), drawing to a greater or lesser degree on the practices of the specialist groups. Among these are Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1992), and Sir Charles Mackerras (2007). In a survey of all available recordings in 2015 for BBC Radio 3 the top recommended version was in this category: the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra, conducted by David Zinman. Among conductors of more traditional recordings have been Leonard Bernstein (1980), Claudio Abbado (2000) and Bernard Haitink (2006).

<text>The Triple Entente (from French meaning &quot;friendship, understanding, agreement&quot;) describes the informal understanding between the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. It was built upon the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the Entente Cordiale of 1904 between France and Britain, and the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. It formed a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy. The Triple Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance itself, was not an alliance of mutual defence.

The Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907 was a key part of building a coalition as France took the lead in creating alliances with Japan, Russia, and (informally) with Britain. Japan wanted to raise a loan in Paris, so France made the loan contingent on a Russo-Japanese agreement and a Japanese guarantee for France&#x27;s strategically vulnerable possessions in Indochina. Britain encouraged the Russo-Japanese rapprochement. Thus was built the Triple Entente coalition that fought World War I.

At the start of World War I in 1914, all three Triple Entente members entered it as Allied Powers against the Central Powers: Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. On September 4, 1914, the Triple Entente issued a declaration undertaking not to conclude a separate peace and only to demand terms of peace agreed among the three parties. Historians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system as one of the causes of World War I.

== Alliance system ==
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, Prussia and its allies defeated the Second French Empire, resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic. In the Treaty of Frankfurt, Prussia forced France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire, souring subsequent relations. France, worried about the escalating military development of Germany, began building up its own war industries and army to deter German aggression. 

Russia had previously been a member of the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance in 1873 with Austria-Hungary and Germany. The alliance was part of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s plan to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France&#x27;s revanchist aspirations might lead it to attempt to regain its 1871 losses stemming from the Franco-Prussian War. The alliance also served to oppose such socialist movements as the First International, which the conservative rulers found unsettling.
However, the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary, mainly over the Balkans, where the rise of nationalism and the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire made many former Ottoman provinces struggle for independence.
To counter Russian and French interests in Europe, the Dual alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary was concluded in October 1879 and with Italy in May 1882.
The situation in the Balkans, especially in the wake of the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, which made Russia feel cheated of its gains made in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877/78, prevented the League from being renewed in 1887. In an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France, Bismarck signed the secret Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887. This treaty assured that both parties would remain neutral if war broke out. The growing rapprochement between Russia and France and Bismarck&#x27;s exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 prevented the treaty from being renewed in 1890, ending the alliance between Germany and Russia.
After the forced resignation of Bismarck in 1890, the young Kaiser Wilhelm set out on his imperialist course of Weltpolitik (&quot;world politics&quot;) to increase the empire&#x27;s influence in and control over the world.

== Franco-Russian Alliance ==
Russia had by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers, but it was also the most backward economically. Russia shared France&#x27;s worries about Germany. Additionally, the Russians feared that the Ottomans, who had received assistance from the British under Admiral Limpus, et al., the French, and the Germans to reorganize and modernize the Ottoman armed forces, would come to control the Dardanelles, a vital trade artery that carried two-fifths of Russia&#x27;s exports.

There was also Russia&#x27;s recent rivalry with Austria-Hungary over the spheres of influence in the Balkans and after the Reinsurance Treaty was not renewed in 1890, Russian leaders grew alarmed at the country&#x27;s diplomatic isolation and joined the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894.

France developed a strong bond with Russia by ratifying the Franco-Russian Alliance, which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance. France&#x27;s main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany and to regain Alsace-Lorraine.
==Entente cordiale==
In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Britain continued its policy of &quot;splendid isolation&quot;, with its primary focus on defending its massive overseas empire. However, by the early 1900s, the German threat had increased dramatically, and Britain thought it was in need of allies. London made overtures to Berlin which were not reciprocated, so London turned to Paris and St. Petersburg instead.

In 1904, Britain and France signed a series of agreements, the Entente cordiale, mostly aimed toward resolving colonial disputes. That heralded the end of British splendid isolation. France and Britain had signed five separate agreements regarding spheres of influence in North Africa in 1904, the &quot;Entente cordiale&quot;. The Tangier Crisis later encouraged co-operation between the two countries from their mutual fear of apparent German expansionism.

=== Naval race with Germany ===
Britain, traditionally having control of the seas, by 1909 saw the German navy as a serious threat to its Royal Navy. Britain was well ahead in terms of Dreadnought technology and responded with a major building program. They built a Royal Navy that Germany could never rival. The British sent war minister Lord Haldane to Berlin in February 1912 to reduce friction stemming from the Anglo-German naval arms race. The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a &quot;naval holiday&quot; with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where &quot;Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.&quot; Zara Steiner says, &quot;It would have meant abandoning the whole system of ententes which had been so carefully nurtured during the past six years. There was no German concession to counter the fear of German aggression.&quot; Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany even if Germany did not start the conflict, dooming the talks to failure. According to German historian Dirk Bönker, &quot;To be sure, the [naval] race was decided early on; political leaders and diplomats learned to bracket it as an issue, and it did not cause the decision for war in 1914. But the naval competition nonetheless created an atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust, which circumscribed the space for peaceful diplomacy and public recognition of shared interests, and helped to pave the twisted road to war in Europe.&quot;

===Not an alliance===
The Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defense and so Britain was free to make its own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As British Foreign Office Official Eyre Crowe minuted, &quot;The fundamental fact, of course, is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies, it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content&quot;.

==Anglo-Russian Convention==

Russia had also recently lost the humiliating Russo-Japanese War, a cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905, and the apparent transformation into a constitutional monarchy. Although it was perceived as useless during the war with Japan, the alliance was valuable in the European theatre to counteract the threat of the Triple Alliance. Tomaszewski describes the evolution of the triple entente relationship from the Russian standpoint during the period 1908 to 1914 as a progression from a shaky set of understandings that withstood various crises and emerged as a fully-fledged alliance after the outbreak of World War I.

In 1907, the Anglo-Russian Entente was agreed, which attempted to resolve a series of long-running disputes over Persia, Afghanistan and Tibet and end their rivalry in Central Asia, nicknamed The Great Game. and helped to address British fears about the Baghdad Railway, which would help German expansion in the Near East.

==The entente in operation==
The coming into being of the entente did not necessarily fix a permanent division into two opposing power blocs. The situation remained flexible.
The alignment of the Russian Empire with Europe&#x27;s two largest power centres was controversial on both sides. Many Russian conservatives distrusted the secular French and recalled British past diplomatic manoeuvres to block Russian influence in the Near East. In turn, prominent French and British journalists, academics, and parliamentarians found the reactionary tsarist regime distasteful. Mistrust persisted even during wartime, with British and French politicians expressing relief when Tsar Nicholas II abdicated and was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government after the February Revolution in 1917. An offer of political asylum for the Romanovs was even withdrawn by the British king for fear of popular reaction. Also, France never brought up the subject of asylum with the deposed tsar.

<doc id="290946" wikidata="Q912052" url="?curid=290946" title="Wei (state)">
<text>Wei (; ) was one of the seven major states during the Warring States period of ancient China. It was created from the three-way Partition of Jin, together with Han and Zhao. Its territory lay between the states of Qin and Qi and included parts of modern-day Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong. After its capital was moved from Anyi to Daliang (present-day Kaifeng) during the reign of King Hui, Wei was also called Liang ().

Not to be confused with the Wey state 衞, which is still sometimes only differentiated by its Chinese character in scholarship.

==History==
===Foundation===
Surviving sources trace the ruling house of Wei to the Zhou royalty: Gao, Duke of Bi (), was a son of King Wen of Zhou. His descendants took their surname, Bi, from his fief. Bi Wan () served the Jin, where he became a courtier of Duke Xian&#x27;s. After a successful military expedition, Bi Wan was granted Wei, from which his own descendants then founded the house of Wei.

===Spring and Autumn period===
Jin&#x27;s political structure was drastically changed after the slaughter of its ruling dynasty during and after the Li Ji Unrest. Afterwards, &quot;Jin ha[d] no princely house&quot; () and its political power diffused into extended relations of the ruling family, including the Wei. In the last years of the Spring and Autumn period, the founders of Wei, Zhao, and Han joined to attack and kill the dominant house of Zhi () in 453 BCE, resulting in the partition of Jin. King Weilie of Zhou finally legitimized the situation in 403 BCE, when he elevated the three houses&#x27; heads to the rank of marquess ().

===Warring States Period===
The state reached its apogee during the reigns of its first two rulers, Marquess Wen of Wei and Marquess Wu of Wei. The third ruler, King Hui of Wei (reign 369–319 BC), declared himself an independent sovereign and concentrated on economic developments, including irrigation projects at the Yellow River and adoption of Legalist reforms proposed by Li Kui (, c. 459 – c. 395 BCE). Hui felt that Qin in the west was weak and their land a barren waste. He focused on conquering the well-settled eastern lands which were richer in known resources, but a series of battles including the battle of Maling in 341 BCE checked Wei&#x27;s ambitions while Qin&#x27;s expansion went largely unimpeded, boosting its economy and military strength.

===Defeat===
Wei eventually lost the western Hexi (河西) region, a strategic area of pastoral land on the west bank of the Yellow River between the border of modern-day Shanxi and Shaanxi, to Qin. Thereafter, it remained continuously at war with Qin, requiring the capital to be moved from Anyi to Daliang. Wei surrendered to Qin in 225 BCE, after the Qin general Wang Ben diverted the Yellow River into Daliang, destroying the capital in a flood.

==Rulers==

#Marquess Wen of Wei, personal name Si (斯) or Du (都), (445–396 BCE)
#Marquess Wu of Wei, personal name Ji (擊), son of Marquess Wen, (396–370 BCE)
#King Hui of Wei, personal name Ying (罃), son of Marquess Wu, (370–319 BCE) 
#King Xiang of Wei (魏襄王), personal name Si (嗣) or He (赫), son of King Hui, (319–296 BCE)
#King Zhao of Wei (魏昭王), personal name Chi (遫), son of King Xiang, (296–277 BCE)
#King Anxi of Wei (魏安釐王),personal name Yu (圉), son of King Zhao, (277–243 BCE)
#King Jingmin of Wei (魏景湣王), personal name Zeng (增) or Wu (午), son of King Anxi, (243–228 BCE)
#King Jia, (魏王假), personal name Jia (假), son of King Jingmin, (228–225 BCE)

According to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; written in the first centuryBCE, the list of rulers is slightly different: King Hui died in 335BCE and was succeeded by his son King Xiang in 334BCE. King Xiang died in 319BCE and was succeeded by his son King Ai (), who died in 296BCE and was succeeded by his son King Zhao. However, the majority of scholars and commentators believe that King Ai, whose personal name is not recorded, never existed. It seems that Sima Qian assigned the second part of the reign of King Hui (starting in 334BCE, on which date Marquess Hui probably proclaimed himself King) to his son King Xiang and added King Ai to fill in the gap between 319 and 296BCE. On the other hand, a minority of scholars believe King Ai did indeed exist.

==Family tree of Wei rulers==
===Notable people===
* Li Kui, a Legalist philosopher and chancellor
* Yue Yang, ancestor of Yue Yi and prime minister of Zhongshan
* Pang Juan, a successful general who was defeated by Lord Mengchang of Qi and Sun Bin at the battle of Maling

==Legacy==

===Chinese legend===
According to the &quot;Records of the Warring States&quot;, a king of Wei had a lover named Lord Longyang, with whom he enjoyed fishing. One day, Longyang began to weep. When questioned, Longyang said he saw his own future in how he had treated a fish. Happy to have the catch at first, Longyang had wanted to throw it back when he caught a better fish. He wept, &quot;I am also a previously-caught fish! I will also be thrown back!&quot; To show his fidelity to Longyang, the king declared that, &quot;Anyone who dares to speak of other beauties will be executed along with his entire family&quot;.

===Chinese astronomy===

In traditional Chinese astronomy, Wei is represented by one star in the &quot;Twelve States&quot; asterism of the &quot;Girl&quot; lunar mansion of the &quot;Black Turtle&quot; symbol and other star in the &quot;Left Wall&quot; of the &quot;Heavenly Market&quot; enclosure. Sources differ, however, in whether those two stars are (respectively) 33 Capricorni and Delta Herculis or whether they are Chi Capricorni and Phi Capricorni.

She acted in the Hindi movie titled &quot;Himalay Se Ooncha&quot; that was released in 1975. The movie which had &quot;Sunil Dutt&quot; as the hero, did not do very well at the box office. In 1986 she acted in the Basu Chatterji directed movie titled &quot;Sheesha&quot; opposite super star Mithun Chakraborty.

In 1989 she performed hard-hitting solo theatrical works, Shakti: The Power of Women. Her performance Sita&#x27;s Daughters has toured the world and been performed over 500 times in three languages. After that, she directed and acted in numerous productions reflecting current issues and awareness among people. Amongst them is An Idea Named Meera; In Search of the Goddess and SvaKranti: The Revolution Within.

Mallika Sarabhai also wrote the script for the play &#x27;Unsuni&#x27; based on Harsh Mander&#x27;s book &#x27;Unheard Voices&#x27; to raise awareness amongst children in elite schools and colleges to the real issues facing India&#x27;s marginalized. The play went around 120 schools and colleges. Arvind Gaur later directed it as a play, with the same name. Darpana Academy has launched the people awareness movement through its production Unsuni which travels all over India.

In 2009 Mallika Sarabhai acted in an Indian adaptation Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s of &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot; (Ahmedabadki Aurat Bhali-Ramkali) directed by Arvind Gaur in 34th Vikram Sarabhai International Art Festival.

In the year 2012, Mallika co-directed &#x27;Women with Broken Wings,&#x27; an international production with filmmaker Yadavan Chandran and Swiss pianist Elizabeth Sombart, an ode to the millions of women who have been the victims of violence. In 2014 she recreated, with Yadavan Chandran, Kadak Badshaahi, a multimedia production on the 603-year-old history of the city of Ahmedabad. The performance ran for an unprecedented 33 full nights in Darpana&#x27;s venue, Natarani.

=== Television ===

Through Darpana Communications, she has been responsible for the production of three thousand hours of TV broadcast programming, all of which has been shown through Doordarshan, Gujarati. The programming uses the most popular genres of TV. She has anchored many shows on STAR TV and Doordarshan as well as the first NACO series on HIV, Talk Positive; the science series &quot;Turning Point&quot;; Vaividhyotsav, the culture quiz and Srishti: The Environment Quiz.

==Politics==
On 19 March 2009, Mallika Sarabhai announced her candidature against the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s prime ministerial candidate L K Advani for the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat, as an independent candidate in the 2009 general election. She had several offers from the Congress to contest elections, the first being in 1984 from Rajiv Gandhi, but did not join any political party as she believed that all parties are corrupt. She eventually lost to L K Advani by a huge margin and forfeited her election deposit in the process.

She protested against Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi during Sadbhavna Mission in September 2011. She accused Narendra Modi of scuttling the petition filed in Supreme court by her on the 2002 Gujarat violence. She joined the Aam Aadmi Party on 8 January 2014.

== Personal life ==
Mallika met Bipin Shah in 1982 and married him. They have two children, a son, Revanta and a daughter Anahita. They divorced in 1989.
Bipin and Mallika co-founded Mapin Publishing in 1984 and continue to run it together. The loss of her mother, classical dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai, in 2016, left her bereft; yoga, dance, Transcendental Meditation (TM) and Non-Violent Communication (NVC) were some of the ways that she coped.

She is the cousin of Indian politician and member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Subhashini Ali, daughter of her mother’s sister Captain Lakshmi Sehgal (née Dr. Lakshmi Swaminathan) and Colonel Prem Sehgal. Her brother is environmental educator and director of Centre for Environment Education (CEE) Kartikeya Sarabhai.

<doc id="290959" wikidata="Q477291" url="?curid=290959" title="King Hui of Wei">
<text>King Hui of Wei (; 400–319 BC), also known as King Hui of Liang (), personal name Wei Ying, was a monarch of the Wei state, reigning from 369 BC to 319 BC. He initially ruled as marquess, but later elevated himself to kingship in 344 BC. He was a grandson of Marquess Wen, the founder of the state, and a son of his predecessor, Marquess Wu. He was succeeded by his son, King Xiang.

He came to the throne after a war of succession during which Wei was nearly partitioned by the Zhao and Han states.

He is notable for four policies:
# In 361 BC, he moved the capital from Anyi to Daliang to get it out of the reach of the Qin state. Anyi was on the plateau south of the Fen River not far from where the Fen River and Wei River join the Yellow River. Daliang was to the far southeast of Wei near the border with the Song state. Thereafter, the Wei state was briefly called &quot;Liang&quot;.
# In 362–359 BC, he made exchanges of territory with Zhao to the north and Han to the south. This gave Wei more rational borders, secured the new capital and gave Wei more control over trade routes.
# In 361–355 BC, he held several face-to-face meetings with the rulers of the neighboring states.
# In 344 BC, he promoted the Wei state from a march to a kingdom.

He also conducted several dialogues with the renowned Confucian Mencius.

<text>Keynote is a presentation software application developed as a part of the iWork productivity suite by Apple Inc. Version 14 of Keynote for Mac, the latest major update, was released in April 2024. Keynote is available for a range of Apple devices across macOS, iOS and visionOS. 

== History ==
Keynote began as a computer program for Apple CEO Steve Jobs to use in creating the presentations for Macworld Conference and Expo and other Apple keynote events. Before using Keynote, Jobs had used Concurrence, from Lighthouse Design, a similar product which ran on the NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP platforms.

The program was first sold publicly as Keynote 1.0 in 2003, competing against existing presentation software, most notably Microsoft PowerPoint.

In 2005, Apple began selling Keynote 2.0 in conjunction with Pages, a new word processing and page layout application, in a software package called iWork. At the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo 2006, Apple released iWork &#x27;06 with updated versions of Keynote 3.0 and Pages 2.0. In addition to official HD compatibility, Keynote 3 added new features, including group scaling, 3D charts, multi-column text boxes, auto bullets in any text field, image adjustments, and free-form masking tools. In addition, Keynote features three-dimensional transitions, such as a rotating cube or a simple flip of the slide.

In the fall of 2007, Apple released Keynote 4.0 in iWork &#x27;08, along with Pages 3.0 and the new Numbers spreadsheet application.

On October 23, 2013, Apple redesigned Keynote with version 6.0, and made it free for anyone with a new iOS device or a recently purchased Mac.

A version of Keynote for visionOS was released on February 2, 2024, alongside the launch of the Apple Vision Pro. The app is largely based upon the iPadOS version of the program, and is currently the only component of the iWork suite to offer a native visionOS app.

== Features ==
* Themes that allow the user to keep consistency in colors and fonts throughout the presentation, including charts, graphs, and tables.
* OpenGL-powered 3D slide transitions and builds that resemble rolling cubes or flipping pages, or dissolving transitions that fade one slide into the next.
* Dual monitor support: the presenter can show the presentation on a screen and still see the desktop or notes from their laptop or presenter screen.
* Exports to: PDF, QuickTime, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, HTML (with JPEG images) and PowerPoint. Keynote also uses .key (presentation files) and .kth (theme files) bundles based on XML.
* Supports all QuickTime video formats (including MPEG-2 and DV) in slideshows.
* Version 3 brings export to iDVD with clickability.
* Compatibility with Apple Remote and the Keynote remote application for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

== Keynote Remote ==
Keynote Remote was an iOS application that controlled Keynote presentations from an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad over a Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth connection and was released through the App Store. With the release of Keynote for iOS, the app was integrated into the new Keynote application and the stand-alone app was withdrawn.

<doc id="290967" wikidata="Q5514087" url="?curid=290967" title="GOPAC">
<text>GOPAC is a Republican (GOP) state and local political training organization. Although often thought of as a PAC, or political action committee, it is actually a 527 organization.

==History==
GOPAC was founded by Delaware Governor Pierre S. du Pont, IV in 1978 in &quot;an effort to build a farm team of Republican officeholders who could then run for congress or higher state offices later&quot;. On February 1, 2007, former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele became the chairman and served until his election as chairman of the Republican National Committee in January 2009. The current chairman of GOPAC is David Avella.

Others who have chaired GOPAC include former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Georgia Representative and Secretary of the Army Bo Callaway, California Representative David Dreier, Arizona Representative John Shadegg, former Oklahoma Representative J.C. Watts, Gay Gaines, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia.

Instructional tapes used to train aspiring Republican politicians from 1986 to 1994 were selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry for their influence in &quot;shaping political discourse&quot;. The Library of Congress selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==GOPAC memo of 1990==
Drawing rhetorical inspiration from Newt Gingrich, GOPAC wrote and distributed a memo to Republican Party legislative candidates in 1990. The memo, which came from a list drawn up by Frank Luntz, called &quot;Language: A Key Mechanism of Control&quot;, contained a list of &quot;contrasting words&quot; and &quot;optimistic positive governing words&quot; that Gingrich recommended for use in describing Democrats and Republicans, respectively. For example, words to use against opponents include decay, failure (fail), collapse(ing), deeper, crisis, urgent(cy), destructive, destroy, sick, pathetic, lie, radical, liberal, they/them, unionized bureaucracy, betray, consequences, limit(s), shallow, traitors, sensationalists,&quot;compassion&quot; is not enough; words to use in defining a candidate&#x27;s own campaign and vision included share, change, opportunity, legacy, challenge, control, truth, moral, courage, reform, prosperity, crusade, movement, children, family, debate, compete, active(ly), we/us/our, candid(ly), humane, pristine, provide.

The cover page of the memo said: &quot;The words in that paper are tested language from a recent series of focus groups where we actually tested ideas and language.&quot;

The comic strip &quot;Doonesbury &quot; mentions the memo in a strip, calling it the &quot;Magna Carta
of attack politics.&quot; Al Franken, a comedian and later a U.S. senator from Minnesota, wrote that GOP candidates were drilled to adopt three basic techniques in debating: &quot;Go Negative Early&quot;; &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Educate&quot;; &quot;Never Back Off&quot;. Minor details were relevant only to &#x27;demolish the opposition&#x27;.

<text>Zhao (; ) is a Chinese-language surname. The name is first in the Hundred Family Surnames – the traditional list of all Chinese surnames – because it was the emperor&#x27;s surname of the Song dynasty (960–1279) when the list was compiled. The first line of the poem is 趙錢孫李 (Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li).

Zhao may be romanized as &quot;Chiu&quot; from the Cantonese pronunciation, and is romanized in Taiwan and Hong Kong as &quot;Chao&quot; in the Wade–Giles system. It is romanized as Vietnamese family name &quot;Triệu&quot; among the Chinese diaspora in Vietnam. Zhao is cognate to Korean family name &quot;Cho&quot; (조) in Korea.

The romanization is shared with the much rarer family name Zhào (兆).

==Evolution of the Zhao clan==

== Modern culture ==
In Lu Xun&#x27;s novel &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot;, Ah Q said he belonged to the same clan as Mr. Zhao, who was an honored landlord of the village. Mr. Zhao was very angry. He slapped Ah Q&#x27;s face and said, &quot;&#x27;How could you be named Zhao!—Do you think you are worthy of the name Zhao?&quot;&#x27;

Since 2015 or earlier, in the Chinese internet, &quot;Zhao&quot; became the intimation of the Chinese Communist Party and the &#x27;&quot;State of Zhao&quot;&#x27; became the intimation of China. Similarly, &#x27;&quot;The Zhao Family&quot;&#x27; refers to the dignitaries of China, and &quot;The Zhao&#x27;s Army&quot; refers to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. &quot;&#x27;How could you be named Zhao!&quot;&#x27; is popular to satirize the people who are humble but pretend to be powerful.

In 2016, the blog writer Program Think set up a GitHub project named Zhao. The project collects the relationships among more than 700 people in over 130 families including Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and many other high level government officials of the Chinese Communist Party. The Cyberspace Administration of China requested GitHub to remove the project. Error status code 451 would be reached if the connection request to the project is from China.

<doc id="290970" wikidata="Q1129778" url="?curid=290970" title="East of Eden (film)">
<text>East of Eden is a 1955 American epic period drama film directed by Elia Kazan and written by Paul Osborn, adapted from the fourth and final part of John Steinbeck&#x27;s epic 1952 novel.

It stars James Dean as a wayward young man who, while seeking his own identity, vies for the affection of his deeply religious father against his favored brother, thus retelling the story of Cain and Abel. Appearing in supporting roles are Julie Harris, Raymond Massey, Burl Ives, Richard Davalos, and Jo Van Fleet.

Although set in early 20th century Monterey, California, much of the film was actually shot on location in Mendocino, California. Some scenes were filmed in the Salinas Valley. Of the three films in which James Dean played the lead, this is the only one to have been released during his lifetime.

&quot;East of Eden&quot;, along with Dean&#x27;s other films &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955) and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), was named one of the 400 best American films of all time by the American Film Institute. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.
==Plot==
In 1917, during World War I, in the central California towns of Monterey and Salinas, Caleb &quot;Cal&quot; and Aron are the young adult sons of a farmer and wartime draft board chairman, Adam Trask, with whom they live in the Salinas Valley. Adam is a deeply religious Christian. Aron is pious, dutiful, and responsible, while Cal is moody, embittered, and thinks that he is sinful. He believes his father loves only his brother Aron. Adam told the boys their mother, Kate, died when they were infants. However, Cal discovers Kate operates a brothel in nearby Monterey, though he keeps this information from Adam and Aron.

Adam&#x27;s idealistic plans for a long-haul vegetable shipping enterprise end disastrously, losing his entire fortune. To recoup his father&#x27;s loss, and to earn his father&#x27;s love, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, knowing that if the United States enters the war, bean prices will skyrocket. Cal borrows the $5,000 capital he needs from Kate. Kate reveals to Cal that she deserted the family because she hated living on the farm, that she never loved Adam, and rebelled against his completely controlling her. She shot Adam in the shoulder when he attempted to stop her leaving. In lending Cal the money, Kate notes the irony that the loan proceeds from her business are intended to preserve Adam&#x27;s goodness.

Meanwhile, Aron&#x27;s girlfriend, Abra, is growing attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings. Cal&#x27;s bean venture is successful, and he intends to give the profits to Adam at a surprise birthday party that he and Abra have planned. As the party begins, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased, both Abra and Cal are uneasy due to their growing feelings for one another. Cal presents the money to his father; however, Adam refuses it, claiming it is war profiteering and demands he give it back to the farmers he &quot;robbed.&quot; Adam adds that Aron&#x27;s gift, compared to Cal&#x27;s, is &quot;honest and...good.&quot; A confused Cal sees his father&#x27;s refusal as just another emotional rejection. When a distraught Cal leaves the room, Abra goes after him. Aron follows and orders Cal to stay away from her. Cal angrily tells Aron that their mother is alive, then takes him to her Monterey bordello. Cal roughly shoves the stunned Aron at the elderly Kate, causing her to fall. When Cal arrives home, Adam demands to know where Aron is. Cal initially responds he is not his brother&#x27;s keeper, then tells Adam what he did.

The truth about his mother drives the pacifistic Aron to get drunk, lose control, and then board a troop train to enlist in the army. When the sheriff informs Adam, he rushes to the station in a futile attempt to dissuade him. Adam fails and watches helplessly as Aron smashes his head through the rail car window, maniacally laughing as the train pulls away. A shocked Adam suffers a stroke, leaving him paralyzed and unable to communicate. Cal tries talking to Adam, but Adam is unresponsive. Abra pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. When Cal makes his last bid for acceptance before leaving town, Adam manages to speak. He tells Cal to fire the annoying nurse, then whispers something to him. Cal tells Abra that Adam said he wants only Cal to care for him. Cal sits alone by his father&#x27;s bedside, the emotional chasm between the father and son apparently healing, with Cal presumably staying to care for him.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was originally planned to be made in 3-D but Warner Brothers later announced that it was to be made in WarnerSuperScope instead using Warner&#x27;s new All-Media camera with no mention of 3-D. It was eventually released in CinemaScope.

Director Elia Kazan first toyed with the idea of casting Marlon Brando as Cal and Montgomery Clift as Aron, but at 30 and 34 years old, respectively, they were simply too old to play teenage brothers. Paul Newman, who was one year younger than Brando, was a finalist for the part of Cal, which eventually was played by James Dean, who was six years younger than Newman.

Newman and Dean, who were up for the part of Cal, screen tested together for the parts of the rival brothers. In the end, Richard Davalos got the part of Aron. This was his screen debut.

Julie Harris was cast as Abra James. Executive producer Jack L. Warner was opposed to her casting, because she was ten years older than her character.

Kazan denied rumors that he didn&#x27;t like Dean: &quot;You can&#x27;t not like a guy with that much pain in him… You know how a dog will be mean and snarl at you, then you pat him, and he&#x27;s all over you with affection? That&#x27;s the way Dean was.&quot; Kazan did intervene sternly, however, when Dean started to feel his power as a hotly emerging star and treated crew members disrespectfully.

Locations include: Mendocino County, California; Salinas, California; and Salinas Valley, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmdb/16719&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and character motivations==
The underlying theme of &quot;East of Eden&quot; is a biblical reference to the brothers Cain and Abel. Cal is constantly struggling to earn his father&#x27;s approval. The relationship between Cal and his father is a stressful one and is not resolved until late in the story, after his father suffers a paralyzing stroke. In his paralyzed state and with the help of Julie Harris&#x27; character, Abra, Cal&#x27;s father finally expresses his suppressed love for the boy.

Other themes touched upon in the film include anti-German xenophobia, specifically as wrought against a local German immigrant as resentment about United States entry into World War I grew. The themes of young love and sibling rivalry are also present in the film, as Aron&#x27;s girlfriend finds herself increasingly drawn to the more rebellious Cal.

==Critical reaction==
Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the film as having &quot;energy and intensity but little clarity and emotion&quot;; he notes:
Jack Moffitt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, in a review that appeared after the March 1955 premiere, wrote &quot;Beautifully acted, and superbly directed by Elia Kazan, it is bound to be one of the year’s important contributions to screen literature.&quot; Of its star, he wrote: 

in 1957 Truman Capote wrote: &quot;…many critics reviewing [the film] remarked on the well-nigh plagiaristic resemblance between [Dean&#x27;s] acting mannerisms and [Marlon] Brando&#x27;s.&quot; Bosley Crowther called Dean&#x27;s performance a &quot;mass of histrionic gingerbread&quot; which clearly emulated the style of Brando. Kate Cameron, of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, on the other hand, proclaimed Dean &quot;a new star&quot; who had &quot;walked away with most of the honors.&quot; While conceding that he did &quot;sound at times like Marlon Brando,&quot; she called him &quot;a fine actor&quot; who &quot;plays his first film role with a naturalness that is completely convincing.&quot;

In 2005 film critic Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;East of Eden&quot; is &quot;not only one of Kazan&#x27;s richest films and Dean&#x27;s first significant role, it is also arguably the actor&#x27;s best performance.&quot; The film&#x27;s depiction of the interaction between Dean and Massey was characterized by Turan as &quot;the paradigmatic generational conflict in all of American film.&quot;

In a short retrospective for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2012, critic Pauline Kael called the film &quot;An amazingly high-strung, feverishly poetic movie about Cain and Abel as American brothers...It’s far from a dull movie, but it’s certainly a very strange one; it’s an enshrinement of the mixed-up kid. Here and in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, Dean seems to go just about as far as anybody can in acting misunderstood.&quot;

In 2013, Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised the adaptation by Kazan and the &quot;down-to-earth&quot; performances of James Dean and Richard Davalos.

As of May 2024 &quot;East of Eden&quot; holds a 86% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;East of Eden&quot; strains to swell its story to epic dimensions, but James Dean&#x27;s riveting performance gives this CinemaScope drama much of its raging heart.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 11 critics through May 2024, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
==Legacy==
Actor Nicolas Cage said in a 2014 interview that he wanted to go into acting because of Dean and his performance in the film: &quot;I started acting because I wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, &quot;East of Eden&quot;. Nothing affected me – no rock song, no classical music – the way Dean affected me in &quot;Eden&quot;. It blew my mind. I was like, &#x27;That&#x27;s what I want to do&#x27;,&quot; Cage said.

In a 2019 MTV interview, actor Leonardo DiCaprio stated that &quot;East of Eden&quot; was the film that made him &quot;obsessed with movies&quot;. Adding in 2016 when asked about which performances stayed with him the most:

<doc id="290971" wikidata="Q376895" url="?curid=290971" title="As (Roman coin)">
<text>The (: ), occasionally assarius (: assarii, rendered into Greek as , assárion), was a bronze, and later copper, coin used during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.

== Republican era coinage ==
The Romans replaced the usage of Greek coins, first by bronze ingots, then by disks known as the &quot;aes rude&quot;. The system thus named &quot;as&quot; was introduced in ca. 280 BC as a large cast bronze coin during the Roman Republic. The following fractions of the were also produced: the (), (), (), (), (), (), (, also a common weight unit), and (), as well as multiples of the &quot;as&quot;, the (2), (2), and (3).

After the &quot;as&quot; had been issued as a cast coin for about seventy years, and its weight had been reduced in several stages, a &quot;as&quot; was introduced (meaning that it weighed one-sixth of a pound). At about the same time a silver coin, the &quot;denarius&quot;, was also introduced. Earlier Roman silver coins had been struck on the Greek weight standards that facilitated their use in southern Italy and across the Adriatic, but all Roman coins were now on a Roman weight standard. The &quot;denarius&quot;, or &#x27;tenner&#x27;, was at first tariffed at ten &quot;assēs&quot;, but in about 140 BC it was retariffed at sixteen &quot;assēs&quot;. This is said to have been a result of financing the Punic Wars.

During the Republic, the &quot;as&quot; featured the bust of Janus on the obverse, and the prow of a galley on the reverse. The &quot;as&quot; was originally produced on the libral and then the reduced libral weight standard. As the weight decreased, the bronze coinage of the Republic switched from being cast to being struck. During certain periods, no &quot;as&quot;ses were produced at all.

== Imperial era coinage ==
Following the coinage reform of Augustus in 23 BC, the &quot;as&quot; was struck in reddish pure copper (instead of bronze), and the or &#x27;two-and-a-halfer&#x27; (originally 2.5 &quot;as&quot;ses, but now four &quot;as&quot;ses) and the (2 &quot;as&quot;ses) were produced in a golden-colored alloy of bronze known by numismatists as . The &quot;as&quot; continued to be produced until the 3rd century AD. It was the lowest valued coin regularly issued during the Roman Empire, with semis and being produced infrequently, and then not at all sometime after the reign of Marcus Aurelius. The last &quot;as&quot; seems to have been produced by Aurelian between 270 and 275 and at the beginning of the reign of Diocletian.

== Byzantine coinage ==
The &quot;as&quot;, under its Greek name &quot;assarion&quot;, was re-established by the Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) and minted in great quantities in the first half of the 14th century. It was a low-quality flat copper coin, weighing ca. 3–4 grams and forming the lowest denomination of contemporary Byzantine coinage, being exchanged at 1:768 to the gold &quot;hyperpyron&quot;. It appears that the designs on the &quot;assarion&quot; changed annually, hence they display great variations. The &quot;assarion&quot; was replaced in 1367 by two other copper denominations, the &quot;tournesion&quot; and the &quot;follaro&quot;.

<text>Zion&#x27;s Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI) was an American department store chain. It was founded in Salt Lake City, Utah, on October 9, 1868, by Brigham Young. For many years it used the slogan, &quot;America&#x27;s First Department Store.&quot;

==History==
Even though the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) had been headquartered in Salt Lake City for some twenty years by that time, they were despised by the surrounding community, as Young had disparaged non-Mormon merchants who had engaged in price gouging on necessities, and encouraged boycotting these businesses in 1866. Mormon business owners were routinely charged higher prices by wholesalers who discovered they were dealing with Latter-day Saints.

Partly because of the impending completion of the railroad, and partly to create a more fair business atmosphere, it was Young&#x27;s idea to encourage Mormon businesses to band together under one roof. By pooling their resources, they were able to make larger orders to sell materials and goods exclusively (at the time) to fellow LDS Church members.

ZCMI was formally organized in 1868 and incorporated for a 25-year renewable contract in 1870. The central component of this was the LDS Church&#x27;s purchase of the Eagle Emporium, a conglomerate of mercantile companies owned by William Jennings.

ZCMI became a formidable business force, eventually manufacturing its own line of boots and shoes, and a line of work clothes. It also sold everything from housing needs, lumber, nails, and the like, to household needs such as fabric, needles, thread, food preservation products, furniture, and draperies, even some beauty products; nearly everything the pioneers needed to survive and thrive.
Based in Salt Lake City, it quickly became a household name in the community. The LDS Church was a significant influence in the company, retaining a majority interest in ZCMI until its eventual sale in December 1999. The store was established by a vote from the Council of Fifty, an early organization in the LDS Church. The President of the store would often also be President of the LDS, with Harold Harper Bennett being the first President of the store to not also hold the LDS office.

In 1990, ZCMI opened its first concept store called ZCMI II. Featuring a smaller floor plan than its usual stores, this concept sold solely men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s clothing and shoes, while lacking other departments such as housewares, linens, and children&#x27;s clothing. The first of these opened at Tri City Mall in Mesa, Arizona in 1990.

In October 1999, as a result of losses for two consecutive years, along with mounting economic and social pressures, ZCMI was sold to May Department Stores Company of St. Louis, ZCMI operated under its original name as a part of May&#x27;s Portland-based Meier &amp; Frank division until April 2001, when the stores adopted the Meier &amp; Frank name. In addition to the name change, the Utah stores in Logan and St. George, along with the Idaho stores in Idaho Falls and Pocatello, were sold to Dillard&#x27;s in March 2001. May Co. was sold to Federated Department Stores (now Macy&#x27;s, Inc.) in 2005. In September 2006, all Meier &amp; Frank stores were converted to Macy&#x27;s.
The façade of ZCMI was used in the City Creek Center, retaining the original ZCMI nameplate as a front for Macy&#x27;s.

<doc id="290986" wikidata="Q1900359" url="?curid=290986" title="Serial Copy Management System">
<text>The Serial Copy Management System (SCMS) is a copy protection scheme that was created in response to the digital audio tape (DAT) invention, in order to prevent DAT recorders from making second-generation or copies. SCMS sets a &quot;copy&quot; bit in all copies, which prevents anyone from making further copies of those first copies. It does not, however, limit the number of first-generation copies made from a master.

SCMS was also included in consumer CD-R, MiniDisc and Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) players and recorders. With the demise of these formats, SCMS is not in widespread use. However, the concept of SCMS was resurrected in the broadcast flag, a measure formerly mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to limit the copying of digital TV signals. SCMS flags are also included in the MP3 specifications, though no known decoder or player honors them. Personal Computers were not required to include SCMS in the US.

==History==
SCMS was created as a compromise between electronics manufacturers, mainly Sony and Philips, who wanted to make DAT machines available in the United States, and the RIAA, which had previously hampered the availability of DAT machines in the US with the threat of lawsuits. The RIAA did not want low-cost digital recorders readily available, since it felt that such technology would result in widespread piracy. These lawsuit threats resulted in a chilling effect, which prevented DAT decks from becoming readily affordable.

In 1987, a member of the RIAA proposed a system where DAT recorders would have copy protection in them. The copy protection would look for the presence of frequencies in a particular high-frequency band; if there was no audio present in this band, the recorder would assume that the music in question was copy protected, and would not allow recording of the music. The record companies would then release all music with this particular frequency band filtered out. It would be illegal to manufacture a DAT machine with the presence of audio in this frequency band; the RIAA was lobbying Congress to make this the law of the land.

The reaction to this proposed scheme was very negative. The Home Recording Rights Coalition orchestrated a letter writing campaign opposing this scheme. Editorials in musician&#x27;s and home stereo magazines attacked this scheme. The proposed law never made it out of committee.

Even after this law was shot down, the RIAA still threatened to sue anyone who released an affordable consumer DAT recorder in the US. No one made such a recorder available.

In 1992, Congress passed the Audio Home Recording Act. In this law, blank digital media (including DAT tapes and music CD-Rs) would be taxed, with the money going to the RIAA, and a new copy protection scheme, SCMS, would be enforced. Blank analog media, such as cassette tapes, were not subject to the tax. SCMS was compulsory in digital media because there is zero deterioration of quality from copy to copy. SCMS was universally disliked by home musicians who used DAT decks to record their own music; the acronym was pronounced as a derogatory term, &quot;scums&quot;.

==Technical details==
SCMS copy protection looks for bits written in the subcode data in a digital link. There are two bits which are relevant:
* Bit 2 in the Channel Status subchannel is the &quot;Cp&quot; bit indicating whether the source signal is copyrighted or not: 0 means copyrighted, 1 means not copyrighted
* Bit 15 in the Channel Status subchannel is the &quot;L&quot; bit indicating whether the source signal is an original medium (such as an audio CD or a prerecorded DCC tape) or &quot;not determined&quot;. For audio CDs and laser optical media, 0 means original and 1 means &quot;not determined&quot;; for other digital sources the values of this bit are reversed.

Copying is only allowed if the source signal for the recording is not copyrighted, or is copyrighted and is an original. If the source signal is a copyrighted recording, the recorder must set the &quot;L&quot; bit to &quot;not determined&quot; when it plays the copy, so that the copy cannot be copied digitally again.

==Circumvention==
Software and design defects in certain models of consumer Minidisc player allow SCMS to be defeated. Professional-grade Minidisc systems costing several thousand US dollars may have SCMS disabled as standard. Professional CD recorders, including all computer drives, have SCMS disabled and can also record audio onto data CD-R discs.

European electronic hobby magazine &quot;Elektor&quot; published a construction project in the 1990s. The device, once completed, was designed to be inserted in the digital link between SCMS enabled devices (the article was designed around the optical TOSLINK interface, but it would have been easy to adapt it to the S/PDIF coaxial link). The circuit intercepted the SCMS control bits, and changed the &quot;Cp&quot; bit to the &quot;not copyrighted&quot; state.

Similar functionality is often also included in commercially available bitrate-converters, like the Behringer Ultramatch.

There is another way that SCMS can be defeated, but it requires copying the Table of Contents from a blank disc that already allows copying, to a recorded &#x27;copy disallowed&#x27; disc. The method is laborious, and suffers the disadvantage that the track marks and titles are lost in the process.

<text>The gens Lucilia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. The most famous member of this gens was the poet Gaius Lucilius, who flourished during the latter part of the second century BC. Although many Lucilii appear in Roman history, the only one known to have obtained any of the higher offices of the Roman state was Lucilius Longus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in AD 7.

==Origin==
The nomen &quot;Lucilius&quot; is a patronymic surname, derived from the common Latin praenomen &quot;Lucius&quot;. The satirist Lucilius is said to have come from Suessa Aurunca, an ancient town of the Aurunci, where a Latin colony was established in 313 BC.

==Branches and cognomina==
In the time of the Republic, the surnames of the Lucilii were &quot;Balbus&quot; and &quot;Bassus&quot;, the former originally referring to one who stammers, and the latter referring to someone &quot;stout&quot; or &quot;sturdy&quot;. Later, in imperial times, we find &quot;Capito&quot;, given to one with a large or prominent head, and &quot;Longus&quot;, &quot;tall&quot;. &quot;Rufus&quot;, commonly given to someone with red hair, appears on coins of the Lucilii, but the cognomen is not mentioned by any ancient writer. A number of the Lucilii are mentioned without a surname.

==Members==
* Gaius Lucilius, the originator of Roman satire, lived during the second century BC, and is said to have served in the Roman cavalry under Scipio Aemilianus during the Numantine War. When he died at Neapolis in 103 BC, he was honoured with a public funeral.
* Manius Lucilius M. f., a senator in 129 BC.
* Marcus Lucilius Rufus, as &quot;triumvir monetalis&quot; in 101 BC, minted coins depicting Pallas on the obverse, and Victoria driving a biga on the reverse.
* Lucius Lucilius L. f., praetor about 91 BC, governor of Asia.
* Sextus Lucilius was tribune of the plebs in 86 BC. He was a partisan of Sulla, but the following year, with Sulla&#x27;s enemies in control of the city, he was hurled from the Tarpeian Rock by his successor, Publius Popillius Laenas.
* Lucius Lucilius Balbus, a jurist, who studied under Quintus Mucius Scaevola, and was in turn one of the instructors of Servius Sulpicius Rufus. Cicero describes him as a man of much learning, who gave his opinions in a slow and deliberate manner.
* Gaius Lucilius C. f. Hirrus, a merchant from Pompeii, was tribune of the plebs in 53 BC. From 43, he was in Sicily with Sextus Pompeius.
* Quintus Lucilius Balbus, probably the brother of the jurist, was a Stoic philosopher, and a student of Panaetius. He was much admired by Cicero, who uses him as an exponent in both &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot; and &quot;Hortensius&quot;.
* Lucilius Bassus, according to Cicero an author well known for his lack of literary merit. In a letter to Titus Pomponius Atticus, he writes of his panegyric upon Cato the Younger, &quot;I am well pleased with my work, but so is Bassus Lucilius with his.&quot;
* Sextus Lucilius, military tribune in the army of Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus in 50 BC. He was slain at Mount Amanus.
* Lucius Lucilius (L. f. Balbus), probably the son of the jurist, served under Appius Claudius Pulcher in Cilicia. He is probably the same Lucilius who commanded the fleet of Publius Cornelius Dolabella in Cilicia, in 43 BC.
* Gaius Lucilius, a friend of Cicero and Milo.
* Lucilius, a partisan of Brutus, who fought at the Battle of Philippi. During the retreat, he pretended to be Brutus in order to save his friend. Struck by his self-sacrifice, Marcus Antonius pardoned Lucilius, and the two became fast friends.
* Marcus Lucilius Paetus, a military tribune in the time of Augustus. A tomb belonging to him and his sister, Lucilia Polla, was discovered in Rome, near the Villa Albani, in 1885. It is a round structure about thirty-four metres across, and believed to have been surmounted by a conical mound of earth seventeen metres high.
* Lucilius Longus, a senator, and a close friend of Tiberius. He was consul &quot;suffectus&quot; for the last six months of AD 7. When Augustus required the latter to withdraw to Rhodes, Lucilius was the only senator to accompany him. When he died in AD 23, Tiberius honoured him with a censor&#x27;s funeral.
* Lucilius, a centurion killed in the Pannonian mutiny, AD 14. He was known as &quot;Cedo Alterum&quot; (&quot;Fetch Me Another&quot;), for his tendency to break his &quot;vitis&quot; during beatings.
* Lucilius Capito, procurator of Asia in AD 23. He was accused of corruption by the people of his province, and was tried in the Senate.
* Lucilia Polla, commemorated on a monument in the Santa Giulia museum at Brescia.
* Lucilius Junior, procurator of Sicily, was a friend and correspondent of the younger Seneca.
* Lucilius Bassus, commander of a cavalry squadron in AD 69 under Vitellius, who gave him command of the fleet at Ravenna and Misenum. Disappointed at not receiving command of the Praetorian Guard, he went over to Vespasian, to whom he delivered the fleet. Once established in power, Vespasian sent Bassus to pacify Campania.
* Sextus Lucilius Bassus, governor of Judaea from AD 71 to 72.

<text>USS &quot;Arkansas&quot; (CGN-41) was a nuclear-propelled guided-missile cruiser of the U.S. Navy. She was in commission (in active service) from October 1980 through July 1998. Her primary missions were in defending aircraft carrier task forces in air defense (AAW) and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) by using her guided missiles, radar systems, and sonar systems. 
For her short-range self-defense, especially for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles, &quot;Arkansas&quot; carried two automated Phalanx radar-directed rapid-fire guns. Also, her two 5-inch rapid-fire naval guns had some capability for anti-aircraft defense. 

==Construction==
The keel of &quot;Arkansas&quot; was laid on 17 January 1977 at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Newport News, Virginia. This warship was launched on 21 October 1978, sponsored by Betty Bumpers, the wife of U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas). She was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 18 October 1980, with Captain Dennis S. Read as her first commanding officer.

==History==
USS &quot;Arkansas&quot; spent the first months following her commissioning in the area of Hampton Roads, Virginia, while detailed, minor shortcomings in her construction were corrected. Late in February 1981, she made a voyage from Virginia to Puerto Rico and back, and then preparations were resumed for her shakedown training. In March, she completed contractor&#x27;s sea trials, and she carried out a public relations visit to Port Everglades, Florida.

April brought a series of underway qualifications and certifications. On 28 April, &quot;Arkansas&quot; steamed out from Norfolk to carry out shakedown training in the West Indies. This training cruise included more tests and trials, port visits at several Caribbean Islands, and her first voyage south of the Equator to visit Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Recife, Brazil. &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to the port of Norfolk on 25 June, and then she began a period of postshakedown availability at the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. &quot;Arkansas&quot; completed her maintenance and performance upgrades on 15 December, and then she steamed out for three more days of sea trials. She returned to her seaport for shore leave for her crew for the rest of 1981.

The warship did not get underway again until three weeks into 1982. She put to sea on 22 January and then steamed south to Key West, Florida, where she underwent explosive shock tests. In the intervals between the several tests, &quot;Arkansas&quot; visited Mayport, Florida, and Port Everglades for work on some of her equipment. Returning north at the beginning of March, she entered the yard at the Newport News Shipbuilding Co. for two months of post-shakedown repairs. &quot;Arkansas&quot; carried out sea trials on 3 and 4 May, and then she returned to Newport News, for another eleven days to correct minor malfunctions. She arrived back in Norfolk on 20 May, and on the next day, she began local operations from her home port. Over the ensuing four months, &quot;Arkansas&quot; carried out a schedule of training operations conducted mostly off the Virginia Capes. Two missions, however, took her south to the West Indies. From 23 June to 16 July, the vessel steamed to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. Between 24 September and 16 October, &quot;Arkansas&quot; escorted the nuclear aircraft carrier during an operational readiness exercise that was carried out around Puerto Rico.

Upon her return to Norfolk in mid-October, &quot;Arkansas&quot; began preparations for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. The guided-missile cruiser embarked upon that assignment on 10 November 1982. She completed the transatlantic voyage on 30 November, then set out across the Mediterranean bound for the coast of troubled Lebanon. She arrived on station near Beirut on 6 December. Though &quot;Arkansas&quot; spent most of her time supporting the multinational force ashore in its efforts to keep peace in Lebanon, she left the eastern Mediterranean occasionally for port calls and to participate in some of the 6th Fleet&#x27;s freedom-of-navigation maneuvers into the Gulf of Sidra off the coast of Libya. The warship completed her final tour on station near Lebanon on 4 May 1983 and laid in a course for Gibraltar. After a two-day visit to the &quot;Rock,&quot; &quot;Arkansas&quot; got underway for Norfolk on 10 May.

The cruiser stood into her home port again at the end of the third week in May. Norfolk, however, remained her home port only for the duration of her post-deployment stand-down period. On 8 July, &quot;Arkansas&quot; began the long voyage to her new base of operations at Alameda, California Steaming by way of Port Everglades in Florida and Charlotte Amalie in the U.S. Virgin Islands, she arrived in the Canal Zone on 21 July and transited the Panama Canal on 22 July. From there, the warship headed north to Alameda, reaching her destination on 31 July. She spent the next five weeks at her new home port clearing up incidentals attendant to the shift of bases and carried out nuclear propulsion safety training.

Normal operations at sea resumed during the second week of September and occupied the guided-missile cruiser for the remainder of 1983 and the first six weeks of 1984. Between 12 and 14 February 1984, &quot;Arkansas&quot; made the passage from Alameda to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a three-month repair period. The warship returned to Alameda in mid-May and readied herself for a deployment that became a circumnavigation of the globe. On 1 June, &quot;Arkansas&quot; put to sea on the first leg of her long voyage. En route to Hawaii, she participated in the multinational exercise Operation RIMPAC 84. She spent the latter half of June conducting exercises in the Hawaiian islands then resumed the voyage west on 2 July. &quot;Arkansas&quot; arrived at Subic Bay on 20 July and remained in the Philippines until the beginning of August. At that time, she set out for Hong Kong where she visited during the period 6 to 10 August.

From there, &quot;Arkansas&quot; headed for the Indian Ocean. The guided-missile cruiser served almost three months in the Indian Ocean, primarily in that portion known as the Arabian Sea where the protracted war between Iraq and revolutionary Iran threaten to engulf their neighbors and perhaps involve the superpowers as well. On 1 November, &quot;Arkansas&quot; entered the Red Sea on her way to the Suez Canal. She passed through the canal on 3 November and, after an expeditious passage, became the first nuclear powered vessel to sail the canal before stopping at Toulon, France, from 7 to 12 November. Returning to sea the next day, the warship shaped a course through the Strait of Gibraltar and across the Atlantic. She rounded out her circumnavigation with calls at the Azores, Barbados and St. Thomas. &quot;Arkansas&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 9 December and reached Alameda on 17 November.

Post-deployment stand-down kept her in port at Alameda through the end of 1984 and into February 1985. Between 17 and 19 February, &quot;Arkansas&quot; steamed north to Bremerton for a four-month restricted availability during which she was armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and the Phalanx CIWS close-in air defense system. Back at Alameda on 25 June, the guided-missile cruiser resumed training operations out of her home port soon thereafter. The usual exercises, inspections and examinations kept her busy through the summer and fall of 1985. On 7 December, the warship began preparations for overseas movement.

The usual year-end holiday leave and upkeep period interrupted her efforts to get ready for the upcoming deployment, but the guided-missile cruiser put to sea as scheduled on 15 January 1986. Again she participated in exercises during the passage, stopped at Pearl Harbor, and spent only a brief period of time in the western Pacific. By mid-March, after visits to Subic Bay and Singapore, she made her way across the Indian Ocean to Karachi, Pakistan. The guided-missile cruiser called at Karachi between 15 and 20 March then resumed her voyage to the Arabian Sea. Once more, &quot;Arkansas&quot; patrolled the waters of the troubled Middle East.

However, her sojourn in the Arabian Sea lasted only until late April. On 29 and 30 April, she transited the Suez Canal and headed for another hot spot. During the month of May and June, &quot;Arkansas&quot; served with the aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser off the coast of Libya in the wake of the air strikes launched on that country by the United States in reprisal for terrorist activity against Americans. During her stay in the Mediterranean, she paid visits to Monaco and Gaeta, Italy. &quot;Arkansas&quot; left the Mediterranean at the end of June and shaped a course for Australia. On 4 July, the same day as the Centennial re-dedication of the Statue of Liberty, she held another line-crossing ceremony, somewhere west of Africa. She stopped at Fremantle between 18 and 22 July and then headed for Subic Bay where she laid over for two days at the end of the month. From there, the warship headed for Pearl Harbor, where she paused overnight on 8 and 9 August. She arrived back in her home port on 13 August. &quot;Arkansas&quot; remained at Alameda until late September for the leave and upkeep period that usually follows an extended tour of duty overseas. Early in October, the warship resumed local operations along the west coast. She remained so occupied for the rest of 1986.

===1990s===
In 1990 &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted extended counter-drug operations off the west coast of Central America. Vigilance was rewarded at the conclusion of that deployment as MV &quot;Nordkapp&quot; carrying 14 tons of cocaine was interdicted near Clipperton Island. &quot;Nordkapp&quot; was set afire and scuttled by her crew. &quot;Arkansas&quot; delivered the crew to the US Coast Guard in San Diego where they were subsequently tried and convicted in federal court.

In May 1991, &quot;Arkansas&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the carrier battle group. While en route to the Persian Gulf, &quot;Arkansas&quot; made a port call at Subic Bay, RP just as Mount Pinatubo erupted in June 1991. &quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in Operation Fiery Vigil making two voyages from Subic Bay to Cebu transporting military and dependent personnel evacuating from Clark AFB escaping the volcanic activity.

In 1996, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was part of the carrier battle group off the coast of Iraq and participated in the Rugged Nautilus exercise and Operation Desert Strike, though for the latter she played a support role as she was not equipped to fire any land-attack missiles.

==Early decommissioning==
The decision had been made in 1993 to cancel the mid-life refueling overhauls of the &quot;Virginia&quot;-class cruisers. With the end of the Cold War, the extra costs of the nine nuclear powered cruisers was no longer seen as justified and the later stages of the Vietnam War had heightened concerns about the risks of action damage to nuclear powered surface vessels. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was decommissioned on 7 July 1998 and entered the US Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ships Recycling Program. She had once been considered for preservation as a museum ship in her namesake state, but as an ocean-going vessel, would not have been able to navigate inland rivers, except during the springtime flood of the Mississippi River.

Arkansas arrived at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 7 July 1998, to begin the recycling process. She ceased to exist on 1 November 1999, with her remains being sold to a scrapyard. As for her two nuclear reactors, they were sent to Hanford for disposal.

Artifacts from &quot;Arkansas&quot;, including the ship&#x27;s bell and anchor, are on public display at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum in North Little Rock, Arkansas.

Her 16,000 pound bow anchor is on display at the Craighead County courthouse, in Jonesboro, Arkansas.

<doc id="290993" wikidata="Q3841274" url="?curid=290993" title="Cynthia (butterfly)">
<text>Cynthia is a group of colourful butterfly species that used to be considered a subgenus of the genus &quot;Vanessa&quot;, in the family Nymphalidae. Before that, it was first described as a genus. Nowadays, this group is not considered a valid taxon anymore, because it is paraphyletic. The name &quot;Cynthia&quot; is now a junior subjective synonym of &quot;Vanessa&quot; .

In English, the species of the &quot;Cynthia&quot; group are sometimes collectively referred to as the painted ladies, although the name &quot;painted lady&quot; usually specifically refers to the near-cosmopolitan species &quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;.

The &quot;Cynthia&quot; group includes at least five species (to which some authors add other South American &quot;Vanessa&quot; species):
* the Painted lady (&quot;Vanessa cardui&quot;), which is almost global in its distribution,
* the Australian painted lady (&quot;Vanessa kershawi&quot;), mostly present in Australia,
* the American (painted) lady (&quot;Vanessa virginiensis&quot;), mostly in North America,
* the West Coast lady (&quot;Vanessa annabella&quot;) in Western North America,
* the Western painted lady (&quot;Vanessa carye&quot;) in South America.

==Distinguishing features==

The Painted lady (&quot;V. cardui&quot;) is a large butterfly (wing span ) identified by the black and white corners of its mainly deep orange, black-spotted wings. It has five white spots in the black forewing tips and while the orange areas may be pale here and there, there are no clean white dots in them. The hindwings carry four small submarginal eyespots on the dorsal and ventral sides. Those on the dorsal side are black, but in the summer morph sometimes small blue pupils are present.

The Australian painted lady (&quot;V. kershawi&quot;) is quite similar to &quot;V. cardui&quot;. Its four ventral eyespots are less clearly defined, and it always sports at least three (often four) blue pupil spots on its dorsal hindwing. Caterpillars are found mainly on &quot;Ammobium alatum&quot;.

The American painted lady (&quot;V. virginiensis&quot;) is most easily distinguishable by its two large hindwing eyespots on the ventral side. &quot;V. virginiensis&quot; also features a white dot within the subapical field of the forewings set in pink on the ventral side, and often as a smaller clean white dot in the orange of the dorsal side too. A less reliable indicator is the row of eyespots on the dorsal submarginal hindwing; &quot;V. virginiensis&quot; often has two larger outer spots with blue pupils. The black forewing tips have four to five white spots; usually the largest is whitish orange.

The West Coast lady (&quot;V. annabella&quot;) and the Western painted lady (&quot;V. carye&quot;) are two very similar-looking species that occur in separate ranges (North and South America, respectively). They do not have obvious ventral eyespots. On the dorsal side, they lack the white dot in the subapical orange found in &quot;V. virginiensis&quot;, and are a purer orange color. &quot;V. annabella&quot; and &quot;V. carye&quot; have a fully orange subapical band and leading edge on the forewing. Their submarginal row of hindwing spots features three or four blue pupils. Their two larger pupils are the inner spots, rather than the outer spots as in corresponding &quot;V. virginiensis&quot;.

<text>Broderbund Software, Inc. (stylized as Brøderbund) was an American maker of video games, educational software, and productivity tools. Broderbund is best known for the 8-bit video game hits &quot;Choplifter&quot;, &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, &quot;Karateka&quot;, and &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (all of which originated on the Apple II), as well as &quot;The Print Shop&quot;—originally for printing signs and banners on dot matrix printers—and the &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; games. The company was founded in Eugene, Oregon, and moved to San Rafael, California, then later to Novato, California. Broderbund was purchased by SoftKey in 1998.

Many of Broderbund&#x27;s software titles, such as &quot;The Print Shop&quot;, &quot;PrintMaster&quot;, and &quot;Mavis Beacon&quot;, are still published under the name &quot;Brøderbund&quot;. Games released by the revived Broderbund are distributed by Encore, Inc. &quot;Brøderbund&quot; is now the brand name for Riverdeep&#x27;s graphic design, productivity, and edutainment titles such as The Print Shop, &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;, &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;, the Living Books series, and &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; titles, in addition to publishing software for other companies, notably Zone Labs&#x27; &quot;ZoneAlarm&quot;.

The company would often release school editions of their games, which contained extra features to allow teachers to use the software to facilitate students&#x27; learning.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;brøderbund&quot; is not an actual word in any language and has never been used as a surname, but is a somewhat loose translation of &quot;band of brothers&quot; into a mixture of Danish, Dutch, German, and Swedish. The &quot;ø&quot; in &quot;brøderbund&quot; was used partially as a play on the letter ø from the Dano-Norwegian alphabet; however, the letter was mainly referencing the slashed zero found in mainframes, terminals, and early personal computers. The three crowns above the logo are also a reference to the lesser national coat of arms of Sweden.

The company&#x27;s name is pronounced instead of the popularly used .

==History==
Broderbund was founded by brothers Doug and Gary Carlston in 1980 to market &quot;Galactic Empire&quot;, a strategy computer game that Doug Carlston had created in 1979. Before founding the company, Doug was a lawyer and Gary had held several jobs, including teaching Swedish at an American college. Their sister Cathy joined the company a year later from Lord &amp; Taylor. Besides Doug and Gary Carlston, their brother Don wrote an Apple II game and invested $500 in the company. &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; had many names taken from African languages; a group of merchants was named Broederbond, Afrikaans for &quot;association of brothers&quot;. To emphasize its family origin while avoiding a connection with the ethnonationalist Afrikaner organization of the same name, the Carlstons altered the spelling when naming their company &quot;Brøderbund&quot;. Gary Carlston said &quot;If we had known we were going to be successful we would not have [chosen that name], as we endured a fair bit of criticism because of the South African connection&quot;.

The company&#x27;s original intention was to market software for law offices, with games as a side business. By 1982, Broderbund produced action games which, the company told Jerry Pournelle, sold much better than strategy games. Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co. invested in the company that year. In 1983, the Carlstons publicly discussed their plans to emphasize home utility software (Bank Street Writer and other &quot;Bank Street&quot; applications), computer literacy with The Jim Henson Company, and edutainment. By early 1984 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; estimated that Brøderbund was tied with Human Engineered Software as the world&#x27;s tenth-largest microcomputer-software company and largest entertainment-software company, with $13 million in 1983 sales. That year it took over the assets of the well-regarded but financially troubled Synapse Software. Although intending to keep it running as a business, they were unable to make money from Synapse&#x27;s products, and closed it down after a year.

Broderbund&#x27;s The Print Shop software produced signs and greeting cards. Broderbund started discussions with Unison World about creating an MS-DOS version. The two companies could not agree on a contract, but Unison World developed a product with similar function and a similar user interface. Broderbund sued for infringement of their copyright. &quot;Brøderbund v. Unison&quot; (1986) became a landmark case in establishing that the look and feel of a software product could be subject to copyright protection.

The company turned down what Gary Carlston later described as &quot;the worldwide rights to Tetris for $50,000&quot;. Sierra On-Line and Broderbund ended merger discussions in March 1991. By that year Brøderbund had about $50 million in revenue, and 25% share of the education market. &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; had been its first internally developed product, but the company now developed most of its software; Doug Carlston stated that Brøderbund needed &quot;to control our own sources, to control our future&quot;. After an unsuccessful initial public offering in 1987, the company executed a private placement for 20% of shares with Jostens. Broderbund became a public company in November 1991 with the NASDAQ symbol BROD. When it went public The Print Shop comprised 33% of total revenue, and the &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; series 26%. After considering another merger with Electronic Arts in 1994, Brøderbund stock price and market capitalization climbed to $72.50 per share by September 1995, and then fell steadily because of continued losses for several years.

The early and mid-1990s saw a video game industry trend of consolidation of development and publishing companies, as rising development costs and pressure from large retailers put pressure on smaller companies. Brøderbund acquired PC Globe in July 1992. It attempted to purchase The Learning Company in 1995, but was outbid by SoftKey, who purchased The Learning Company for US$606 million in cash and then adopted its name. 

===Acquisition===
On June 22, 1998, The Learning Company bought Broderbund for about US$420 million in stock. The acquisition was structured as a stock swap, with The Learning Company issuing 0.80 shares for each share of Brøderbund&#x27;s, with the purchasing price set at about 21 percent higher than Broderbund&#x27;s valuation according to its stock price. The Learning Company then fired five hundred employees at Broderbund the same year, representing 42% of the company&#x27;s workforce. Doug Carlston explained that in a bid to roll up Broderbund, SoftKey used their previous acquisitions to weaken the company&#x27;s position in the industry. They allegedly gave a rebate to Mindscape&#x27;s PrintMaster, a direct competitor to Broderbund&#x27;s Print Shop, that was more than the product was worth.

In 1998, Broderbund agreed a deal with Nickelodeon to develop CD-ROM games based on its animated cartoons, such as &quot;Rugrats&quot;.

In 1999, the combined company was purchased by Mattel for $3.6 billion. Mattel reeled from the financial impact of this transaction, and Jill E. Barad, the CEO, ended up being forced out in a climate of investor outrage. Mattel sold their game division Mattel Interactive as well as all its assets in September 2000 to Gores Technology Group, a private acquisitions firm, for a share of whatever Gores could obtain by selling the company. During this time, Broderbund products were owned by The Learning Company Deutschland GmbH, located in Oberhaching, Germany. Headed by Jean-Pierre Nordmann, the company was a subsidiary of The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey), which itself was a wholly owned subsidiary of Gores Technology Group. The company published games under two logos: Blue (Broderbund) and Red (The Learning Company). The &quot;Brøderbund&quot; label was used for &quot;high-quality infotainment, design and lifestyle titles such as Cosmopolitan My Style 2 and PrintMaster&quot;, while &quot;The Learning Company&quot; label was used for children&#x27;s software.

In 2001, Gores sold The Learning Company&#x27;s entertainment holdings to Ubi Soft, and most of the other holdings, including the Brøderbund name, to Irish company Riverdeep. Many of Brøderbund&#x27;s games, such as the &quot;Myst&quot; series, are published by Ubisoft. The &quot;Brøderbund&quot; line of products is published by Encore, Inc. under license from Riverdeep. Under the terms of the agreement, Encore now manages the Broderbund family of products as well as Brøderbund&#x27;s direct to consumer business. In May 2010, Encore acquired the assets of Punch! Software.

In 2014, Doug Carlston donated a collection of Brøderbund&#x27;s business records, software, and a collection of games that includes &quot;Myst&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, and &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; to The Strong National Museum of Play. The Strong National Museum of Play forwarded the collection to the ICHEG museum for preservation.

In 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt offered the Brøderbund, The Print Shop, Calendar Creator, and ClickArt brands for licensing.

===Products===
Broderbund scored an early hit with the game &quot;Galactic Empire&quot;, written by Doug Carlston for the TRS-80. The company&#x27;s first title for the Apple II, &quot;Tank Command&quot;, was written by the third Carlston brother, Professor Donal Carlston.

The company became a powerhouse in the educational and entertainment software markets with titles like &quot;Fantavision&quot;, &quot;Choplifter&quot;, &quot;Apple Panic&quot;, &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, &quot;Karateka&quot;, &quot;Wings of Fury&quot;, &quot;Prince of Persia&quot;, &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, &quot;The Guardian Legend&quot;, &quot;Logical Journey of the Zoombinis&quot;, and &quot;Myst&quot;, which stayed the highest grossing home video game for years. 
Broderbund became one of the most dominant publishers in the computer market of the 1980s, releasing video games for virtually all major computer systems in the United States. 

Like most early computer gaming developers, Broderbund began as an Apple II-focused company and began expanding to other platforms as time went along. They released IBM PC ports of a few games very early on, however, it was not until after 1985 that Broderbund would seriously develop for PC compatibles. Due to their strong focus on education titles, they were one of a few developers to actively support the Apple IIGS in the late 1980s. Some of the more popular Broderbund titles were licensed to Western European and Japanese developers and ported to systems in those regions. During the 1990s, Brøderbund mostly concentrated on educational titles for PCs and Macintoshes with a few forays into RPGs and strategy games.

Broderbund published the &quot;Print Shop&quot; series of desktop publishing making programs; Family Tree Maker (a genealogy program supported by hundreds of CDs of public genealogy data); 3D Home Architect, a program for designing and visualizing family homes; and Banner Mania, a program for designing and printing multi-page banners. By the end of the 1980s, games represented only a few percent of Broderbund&#x27;s annual sales, which by then were heavily focused in the productivity arena and early education and learning areas.

Just before being acquired by The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey), Broderbund spun off its &quot;Living Books&quot; series by forming a joint venture with Random House Publishing. Despite the success and quality of the Living Books series, the joint venture was only marginally successful and was dissolved with The Learning Company deal.

For a brief time, Broderbund was involved in the video game console market when it published a few games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) through its New Ventures Division. All of Broderbund&#x27;s games for the NES, including the port of its own franchises &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, &quot;Spelunker&quot;, and &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot;, were developed by third-party Japanese companies. Broderbund published some titles that were produced by companies that didn&#x27;t have a North American subsidiary, such as Irem&#x27;s &quot;Deadly Towers&quot;, Compile&#x27;s &quot;The Guardian Legend&quot;, Imagineer&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Olympus&quot;, and &quot;Legacy of the Wizard&quot;, the fourth installment in Nihon Falcom&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series. 

Broderbund also developed and marketed an ill-fated motion sensitive NES controller device called the U-Force, which was operated without direct physical contact between the player and the device. Broderbund also served as distributing agent of Irem&#x27;s North American NES release of &quot;Sqoon&quot;, because Irem didn&#x27;t yet have its own American operation. In 1990, Broderbund sold its New Ventures Division, including manufacturing equipment, inventory, and assets, to then-fledgling company THQ.

Broderbund released in the United States Arsys Software&#x27;s 1986 third-person action RPG shooter &quot;WiBArm&quot;.

Broderbund briefly had a board game division, which published Don Carlston&#x27;s Personal Preference, along with several board game versions of its video games.
