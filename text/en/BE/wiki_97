<text>John Townes Van Zandt (March 7, 1944 – January 1, 1997) was an American singer-songwriter. He wrote numerous songs, such as &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, &quot;For the Sake of the Song&quot;, &quot;If I Needed You&quot;, &quot;Snake Mountain Blues&quot;, &quot;Our Mother the Mountain&quot;, &quot;Waitin&#x27; Round to Die&quot;, and &quot;To Live Is to Fly&quot;. His musical style has often been described as melancholic and features rich, poetic lyrics. During his early years, Van Zandt was respected for his guitar playing and fingerpicking ability.

Much of Van Zandt&#x27;s life was spent touring various bars, music clubs, colleges, and folk venues and festivals, often lodging in motel rooms or the homes of friends. He suffered from drug addiction and alcoholism, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When he was young, the now-discredited insulin shock therapy erased much of his long-term memory.

In 1983, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covered and popularized Van Zandt&#x27;s song &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, reaching number one on the Billboard country music chart. Van Zandt&#x27;s influence has been cited by countless artists across multiple genres and his music has been recorded or performed by Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, Merle Haggard, Norah Jones, Emmylou Harris, Counting Crows, Steve Earle, Whitey Morgan, Rodney Crowell, Robert Earl Keen Jr., Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark, Wade Bowen, Gillian Welch, Richard Buckner, Pat Green, Colter Wall, Billy Strings, Molly Tuttle, Jason Isbell, Calvin Russell, Natalie Maines, Jason Molina, Kevin Morby, Stephen Duffy, Doc Watson, Cowboy Junkies, Frank Turner, Rowland S. Howard, Tindersticks, Cave In, Amenra, Charley Crockett, Tyler Childers, Lost Dog Street Band, The Brothers Lazaroff and Marissa Nadler.

Van Zandt died on New Year&#x27;s Day 1997 from cardiac arrhythmia caused by health problems stemming from years of substance abuse. A revival of interest in Van Zandt blossomed in the 2000s. During the decade, two books, a documentary film (&quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot;), and numerous magazine articles were written about him.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, into a wealthy family, Van Zandt was a great-great-great-grandson of Isaac Van Zandt (a prominent leader of the Republic of Texas) and a great-great-grandnephew of Khleber Miller Van Zandt (a major in the Confederate army and one of the founders of Fort Worth).

Townes&#x27; parents were Harris Williams Van Zandt and Dorothy Townes. He had two siblings, Bill (1949–2009) and Donna (1941–2011). Harris was a corporate lawyer and his career required the family to move several times during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1952, the family relocated from Fort Worth to Midland, Texas for six months before moving to Billings, Montana.

At Christmas in 1956, Townes&#x27;s father gave him a guitar, which he practiced while wandering the countryside. He later told an interviewer that &quot;seeing Elvis Presley on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was the starting point for me becoming a guitar player... I just thought that Elvis had all the money in the world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, and all he did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me.&quot; In 1958, the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt remembered his time in Colorado fondly and often visited it as an adult. He later referred to Colorado in &quot;My Proud Mountains&quot;, &quot;Colorado Girl&quot;, and &quot;Snowin&#x27; on Raton&quot;. Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he was found to have a high IQ, and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School in Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.

In 1962, he enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder, wrote poetry, and listened to records by Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and Hank Williams. In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes back to Houston, worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression. They admitted him to the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where he was diagnosed with manic depression. He received three months of insulin shock therapy, which erased much of his long-term memory. Afterwards, his mother said that her &quot;biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur&quot;. In 1965, he was accepted into the University of Houston&#x27;s pre-law program. Soon after, he attempted to join the Air Force, but was rejected because of a doctor&#x27;s diagnosis that labelled him &quot;an acute manic-depressive who has made minimal adjustments to life&quot;. After Townes&#x27;s father died in January 1966 at age 52, he quit school and went on the road for the first time having been inspired by his singer-songwriter heroes to pursue a career in playing music.

=== Early musical career ===
In 1965, Van Zandt began playing regular shows at the Jester Lounge in Houston for $10 per night. After the Jester closed, he began to regularly perform (and occasionally live) at Sand Mountain Coffee House. In these Houston clubs, he met fellow musicians Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Doc Watson. His repertoire consisted mostly of covers of songs written by Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and others, as well as original novelty songs like &quot;Fraternity Blues.&quot; In 1966, Harris Van Zandt had encouraged his son to stop playing covers and write his own songs.

At one point around 1968, Van Zandt was roommates with 13th Floor Elevators singer Roky Erickson. Erickson suggested that he audition as the Elevators&#x27; new bassist, even though he was a guitarist who had never played bass before. When Tommy Hall found out he never played bass, he kicked him out of the audition.

In 1968, Van Zandt met songwriter Mickey Newbury in a Houston coffee shop. Newbury persuaded Van Zandt to go to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was introduced by Newbury to the man who became his longtime producer, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Jack Clement.

Van Zandt cited Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams and such varied artists as Muddy Waters, The Rolling Stones, Blind Willie McTell, Tchaikovsky, and Jefferson Airplane as having had a major impact on his music.

=== 1970s ===
The years between 1968 and 1973 proved to be his most prolific era. Van Zandt released six albums during the time period: &quot;For the Sake of the Song&quot;, &quot;Our Mother the Mountain&quot;, &quot;Townes Van Zandt&quot;, &quot;Delta Momma Blues&quot;, &quot;High, Low and In Between&quot;, and &quot;The Late Great Townes Van Zandt&quot;. Among the tracks written for these albums were &quot;To Live Is to Fly&quot;, &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, and &quot;If I Needed You&quot;. These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.

In 1972, he recorded tracks for an album with a working title of &quot;Seven Come Eleven&quot;, which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers sneaked into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a cassette tape. Tracks from the aborted &quot;Seven Come Eleven&quot; debacle later surfaced on &quot;The Nashville Sessions&quot;.

In 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film &quot;Heartworn Highways&quot; with Guy Clark, Steve Earle, Steve Young, Gamble Rogers, Charlie Daniels and David Allan Coe. His segment of the film was shot at his run-down trailer home in Austin, Texas, where Van Zandt is shown drinking straight whiskey during the middle of the day, shooting and playing with guns, and performing the songs &quot;Waitin&#x27; Around to Die&quot; and &quot;Pancho and Lefty.&quot; He was the only person in the film to play directly to the camera, and, according to Steve Earle, &quot;stole that entire film.&quot; His soon-to-be second wife Cindy and dog Geraldine (a large, &quot;keenly intelligent&quot; half-wolf, half-husky) are featured in the film.

In 1977, &quot;Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas&quot; was released. The album showcased Van Zandt solo at a 1973 concert before a small audience, and less elaborately produced than many of his early records. The album received positive reviews, and is considered by many to be among the best albums that the songwriter ever released.

In the mid-1970s, Van Zandt split from his longtime manager, Kevin Eggers. He found a new manager, John Lomax III (grandson of the famed folk music historian John Lomax), who set up a fan club for Van Zandt. Though the club was only advertised through small ads in the back of music magazines, Lomax immediately began to receive hundreds of impassioned letters from around the world written by people who felt touched by Van Zandt. Some of the letters described how his material often served as a crutch for those who were dealing with depression. In 1978, the singer fired Lomax and re-hired Eggers. He soon signed with Eggers&#x27; new label, Tomato Records. The following year, he recorded &quot;Flyin&#x27; Shoes&quot;; he did not release another album until 1987&#x27;s &quot;At My Window&quot;. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Several of Van Zandt&#x27;s compositions were recorded by other artists, such as Emmylou Harris who, with Don Williams, had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with &quot;If I Needed You,&quot; and Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard, the pair taking &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot; to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as &quot;Marie&quot; and &quot;The Hole&quot;.

According to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan. Dylan was reportedly a &quot;big fan&quot; of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan&#x27;s songs, but didn&#x27;t care for his celebrity. The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the South Congress district of Austin, on June 21, 1986. According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter. The Drag in Austin was shut down due to Dylan being in town; Van Zandt drove his motorhome to the cordoned-off area, after which Dylan boarded the vehicle and requested to hear him play several songs. In May and June 1990, he opened for the Cowboy Junkies during a two-month-long tour of the United States and Canada, which exposed him to a younger generation of fans. As a result, he wrote the song &quot;Cowboy Junkies Lament&quot; for the group, with a verse about each member of the band.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
Van Zandt married Fran Peterson on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes &quot;J.T.&quot; Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston. The couple divorced on January 16, 1970. He began dating Cindy Morgan in 1974 and they married in 1978. Cindy was 15 years old to Van Zandt&#x27;s 30 when they met, though she initially hid her age from him. Van Zandt and Cindy became estranged for much of the early 1980s, and were divorced on February 10, 1983, in Travis County, Texas. They had no children.

Van Zandt&#x27;s third marriage was to Jeanene Munsell. They met on December 9, 1980, at a memorial for John Lennon. When Townes&#x27; terminally-ill mother learned that he had impregnated Munsell, she told him, &quot;You&#x27;re going to do the right thing and honor that baby.&quot; He divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983. Their first child, William Vincent, was born ten days later. Another child, Katie Belle, was born February 14, 1992. Van Zandt and Munsell divorced on May 2, 1994. However, the two remained close, and Jeanene was an executor of his estate.

Around the time of their April 1993 separation, Jeanene coaxed the musician into signing over the publishing rights of his back catalog and recording royalties to her and their children. Van Zandt&#x27;s only source of income after making that change was money received from concert engagements and, even then, Van Zandt frequently visited his ex-wife and gave her the money in his pockets. Following their divorce in 1994, his only possessions were a 1989 GMC Truck with camper shell, a 1984 Honda Shadow motorcycle and a 1983 Starwind 22-foot boat named &quot;Dorothy.&quot; He also retained sole ownership of his family inheritance of ownership in oil lease and mineral rights.

At the time of his death, he had begun a long-distance relationship with a woman named Claudia Winterer from Darmstadt, Germany. The two met in November 1995 during a concert of his in Hanau, Germany. Van Zandt told friends, he planned on marrying Winterer, but the two never became engaged.

=== Addiction ===
Van Zandt was addicted to heroin and alcohol throughout his adult life. At times, he became drunk on stage and forgot the lyrics to his songs. At one point, his heroin habit was so intense that he offered Kevin Eggers the publishing rights to all of the songs on each of his first four albums for $20. At various points, his friends saw him shoot up not just heroin, but also cocaine, vodka, as well as a mixture of rum and Coke. On at least one occasion, he shot up heroin in the presence of his son J.T., who was only eight years old at the time.

As a result of Van Zandt&#x27;s constant drinking, Harold Eggers, Kevin&#x27;s brother, was hired as his tour manager and 24-hour caretaker in 1976, a partnership that lasted for the rest of the singer&#x27;s life. Although the musician was years older than he was, Eggers later said that Van Zandt was his &quot;first child.&quot; His battles with addiction led him into rehab nearly a dozen times throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Medical records from his recovery centers indicate that he believed his drinking had become a problem around 1973, and that by 1982 he was drinking at least a pint of vodka daily. Doctors&#x27; notes reported: &quot;He admits to hearing voices, mostly musical voices&quot;, and &quot;Affect is blunted and mood is sad. Judgment and insight is impaired.&quot; At various times he was prescribed the antidepressant Zoloft and the mood stabilizer lithium. The longest and final period of sobriety during his adult life was about a year in 1989 and 1990.

=== Death ===

Van Zandt continued writing and performing through the 1990s, though his output slowed noticeably. He had enjoyed some sobriety during the early 1990s, but actively abused alcohol during his final years. In 1994, he was admitted to the hospital to detox, when a doctor told Jeanene Van Zandt that trying to detox Townes again could potentially kill him. He grew increasingly frail during the mid-1990s, with friends noting that he seemed to have &quot;withered.&quot;

In early 1996, he was contacted by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Steve Shelley, who informed Van Zandt that he was interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band&#x27;s Ecstatic Peace label, funded by Geffen. Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip. After lying outside for an hour, he dragged himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him. He told the couple that he had sustained the injury while getting out of bed, and refused medical treatment. They took him back to their home, and he spent Christmas week on their couch, unable to get up even to use the bathroom.

Determined to finish the album that he had scheduled to record with Shelley and Two Dollar Guitar, Van Zandt arrived at the Memphis studio being pushed in a wheelchair by road manager Harold Eggers. Shelley canceled the sessions due to the songwriter&#x27;s erratic behavior and drunkenness. Van Zandt finally agreed to hospitalization, but not before returning to Nashville. By the time he consented to receive medical care, eight days had passed since the injury. On December 31, X-rays revealed that Van Zandt had an impacted left femoral neck fracture in his hip, and several corrective surgeries were performed. Jeanene informed the surgeon that one of Townes&#x27;s previous rehab doctors had told her detoxing could kill him. The medical staff tried to explain to her that detoxing a &quot;late-term alcoholic&quot; at home would be ill-advised, and he would have a better chance at recovering under hospital supervision. She did not heed the warnings, and checked Townes out of the hospital. Understanding that he would most likely drink immediately after leaving the hospital, the physicians refused to prescribe him any painkillers.

By the time Van Zandt was checked out of the hospital early the next morning, he had begun to show signs of delirium tremens. Jeanene rushed him to her car, where she gave him a flask of vodka to ward off the withdrawal delirium. She later reported that after getting him back home to Smyrna, Tennessee, and giving him alcohol, he became &quot;lucid, in a real good mood, calling his friends on the phone.&quot; Jim Calvin shared a marijuana joint with him, and he was also given about four Tylenol PM tablets.

While Jeanene was on the phone with Susanna Clark, their son Will noticed that Townes had stopped breathing and &quot;looked dead&quot;, and alerted his mother, who attempted to perform CPR, &quot;screaming his name between breaths&quot;. Townes Van Zandt died in the early morning hours of January 1, 1997, at the age of 52. His official cause of death was &quot;natural&quot; cardiac arrhythmia.

Two services were held for Van Zandt: one in Texas for family, and another in a large Nashville church, attended by friends, acquaintances, and fans. Some of his ashes were placed underneath a headstone in the Van Zandt family plot at the Dido Cemetery in Dido, Texas, near Fort Worth.

== Legacy ==
=== Legal issues over his work ===
In the years immediately following Van Zandt&#x27;s death, his former manager and label owner Kevin Eggers issued 14 albums of both new and previously unreleased material by the singer, all without consent of his estate (represented by Jeanene Van Zandt and his three children). Eggers claimed a 50% interest in eighty of Van Zandt&#x27;s songs. After nearly ten years of legal battles, the court sided with the estate, issuing &quot;injunctive relief against Eggers, restraining him from reproducing or distributing any of Van Zandt&#x27;s songs.&quot;

It was revealed through these proceedings that Van Zandt&#x27;s annual income in the years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, thanks in large part to the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Lyle Lovett, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars. After Van Zandt&#x27;s death his road manager, Harold Eggers, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter&#x27;s concerts. An out-of-court settlement in 2006 granted the Van Zandts conditional control of Harold Eggers&#x27; mastered recordings with Eggers retaining a 50% ownership of seven albums and some royalties for the remaining recordings.

On October 21, 2008, a number of Van Zandt&#x27;s personal possessions were auctioned off at The Northside in Akron, Ohio at a benefit for Rex &quot;Wrecks&quot; Bell. Bell was a close friend and bandmate, and the inspiration for the song &quot;Rex&#x27;s Blues&quot;. Bell was also part owner of the bar Old Quarter in Houston, where Van Zandt performed the songs that would comprise the album &quot;Live at the Old Quarter&quot;.

=== In music ===
Van Zandt has been referred to as a cult musician and &quot;a songwriter&#x27;s songwriter.&quot; Musician Steve Earle, who met him in 1978 and considered Van Zandt a mentor, once called Van Zandt &quot;the best songwriter in the whole world and I&#x27;ll stand on Bob Dylan&#x27;s coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that.&quot; The quote was printed on a sticker featured on the packing of &quot;At My Window&quot;, much to Van Zandt&#x27;s displeasure. In the years following, the quote was often cited by the press, much to Van Zandt and Earle&#x27;s embarrassment; in 2009, Earle told the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Did I ever believe that Townes was better than Bob Dylan? No.&quot; But he concluded at the end of the same article that, &quot;As a songwriter, you won&#x27;t find anybody better.&quot; Earle has championed the songwriter on a number of occasions: his eldest son, Justin Townes Earle, also a musician, was named after Van Zandt. Steve Earle wrote the song &quot;Fort Worth Blues&quot; as a tribute to the singer in the late 1990s, and in 2009 released an album titled &quot;Townes&quot;, which featured all covers of Van Zandt songs.

His Texas-grounded impact stretched farther than country. He has been cited as a source of inspiration by such notable artists as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, Guthrie Thomas, John Prine, Lyle Lovett, Chelsea Wolfe, Scott Avett of The Avett Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, Cowboy Junkies, Vetiver, Guy Clark, Devendra Banhart, Norah Jones, Robert Plant &amp; Alison Krauss, The Be Good Tanyas and Jolie Holland, Rowland S. Howard, Michael Weston King, Hayes Carll, Josh Ritter, Gillian Welch, Garth Brooks, Simon Joyner, Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes, Caleb Followill of Kings of Leon, Marissa Nadler, Laura Marling, and Frank Turner, Folk musician Shakey Graves has credited his fast-paced, rhythmic style of finger picked guitar playing partially to Van Zandt&#x27;s influence.

In 1994, Israeli singer David Broza performed with Van Zandt during a Writers in the Round concert in Houston. When Van Zandt died, he left a shoe box full of unreleased poems and lyrics with a request that Broza set them to music. The resulting album was &quot;Night Dawn: The Unpublished Poetry of Townes Van Zandt&quot;.

In 2012, Van Zandt was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In July 2012, Neurot Recordings released a three-way split album in tribute to Van Zandt, featuring Neurosis singer/guitarists Scott Kelly, Steve Von Till and doom/stoner metal legend Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich. Two years later another similar album was released featuring John Baizley, Mike Scheidt and Nate Hall, frontmen of the bands Baroness, YOB and U.S. Christmas respectively.

On June 18, 2015, Van Zandt was inducted into the second year&#x27;s ceremony of the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame, along with Asleep at the Wheel, Loretta Lynn, Guy Clark and Flaco Jimenez. Gillian Welch inducted Van Zandt by telling stories about how he had come to her early gigs in Nashville and how he had bolstered her confidence in writing sad songs.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2016, Van Zandt was cited as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

In 2016, Paal Flaata released an album of only Van Zandt songs, &quot;Come Tomorrow – Songs of Townes Van Zandt&quot;. A single with the track &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot;, where Paal Flaata sings with his daughter Maia Flaata, was released the same year.

=== In film and television ===
Van Zandt&#x27;s &quot;Roadsongs&quot; album version of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; was used during the final scene of the Coen Brothers&#x27; 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. The song was included on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. Since his death, Van Zandt&#x27;s recordings have been licensed by his family for use in a number of films and television programs, including &quot;Stepmom&quot;, &quot;Ozark&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;In Bruges&quot;, &quot;Calvary&quot;, &quot;Crazy Heart&quot;, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;, &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot;, &quot;Deadwood&quot;, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;Billions&quot;, &quot;Patriot&quot;, &quot;True Detective&quot;, &quot;Euphoria (American TV Series)&quot;, and &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; (Dollar Bill Blues). His &quot;Buckskin Stallion Blues&quot;&quot; was featured in the 2017 American film &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; both as his original recording and a cover by Amy Annelle.

In the film &quot;Country Strong&quot;, the &quot;Austin Statesman&quot; describes the character of Beau Hutton as &quot;the next Townes Van Zandt&quot;. The 2012 documentary film &quot;Low &amp; Clear&quot;, which revolves around Van Zandt&#x27;s son JT fly fishing for steelhead in British Columbia with his old fishing buddy Xenie, features Van Zandt&#x27;s songs.

=== Films and book ===
In 2004, the film &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot;, chronicling the artist&#x27;s life and musical career, was released in the United States. It was very well received, earning a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Georgia Christgau of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; called the documentary &quot;sympathetic but frank.&quot; Eddie Cockrell of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a dignified and wistful look at the unusual life, difficult career and lasting influence&quot; of Van Zandt.

A biography, titled &quot;To Live&#x27;s to Fly: The Ballad of the Late, Great Townes Van Zandt&quot; by John Kruth, was released in 2007. It received mixed reviews, with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; lamenting that Kruth&#x27;s &quot;efforts are diminished by oddly alternating first- and third-person narratives, awkward transitions and text cluttered with excessive quotes... more insight into why – rather than countless tales of how – would have made this bio a more worthwhile read.&quot;

In April 2008, the University of North Texas Press published Robert Earl Hardy&#x27;s biography on the songwriter, titled &quot;A Deeper Blue: The Life and Music of Townes Van Zandt&quot;, which took more than eight years of research, including interviews with Mickey Newbury, Jack Clement, Guy and Susanna Clark, Mickey White, Rex Bell, Dan Rowland, Richard Dobson, John Lomax III, Van Zandt&#x27;s brother and sister, cousins, his three ex-wives, and many others. The book has been described by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; as a &quot;poignant, clear and vivid portrait.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here in the Morning: The Songwriting Legacy of Townes Van Zandt&quot; by Brian T. Atkinson was released on New Year&#x27;s Day 2012 by Texas A&amp;M University Press, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of Van Zandt&#x27;s death. The book contains interviews with longtime Van Zandt friends Guy Clark, Billy Joe Shaver, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Kris Kristofferson, Tom Russell and Peter Rowan as well as younger disciples such as Scott Avett (the Avett Brothers), Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Kasey Chambers, Josh Ritter, and Grace Potter.

Van Zandt was portrayed by Charlie Sexton in the 2018 film &quot;Blaze&quot;, a biographical drama about the life of Blaze Foley.

More books and movies about Townes Van Zandt were released, e.g. Harold Eggers&#x27; &quot;My Years with Townes Van Zandt&quot; and Mickey White&#x27;s &quot;Another Mickey. Ruminations of a Texas Guitar Slinger&quot; (books) or &quot;Without Getting Killed or Caught&quot; (movie, director: Tamara Saviano).

Townes Van Zandt features prominently in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Here in the Morning&quot; author Brian T. Atkinson&#x27;s subsequent books &quot;Looks Like Rain: The Songwriting Legacy of Mickey Newbury&quot; (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2021) and &quot;Love at the Five and Dime: The Songwriting Legacy of Nanci Griffith&quot; (TAMU Press, 2024).

<doc id="292712" wikidata="Q44761" url="?curid=292712" title="Formosa Province">
<text>Formosa Province () is a province in northeastern Argentina, part of the Gran Chaco Region. Formosa&#x27;s northeast end touches Asunción, Paraguay, and the province borders the provinces of Chaco and Salta to its south and west, respectively. The capital is Formosa.

==Source of the provincial name==
The name of the city (and the province) comes from the archaic Spanish word (currently ) meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;. The name or was used by Spanish sailors in the 16th century to describe the area where the Paraguay River makes a turn, right in front of the actual city. These sailors were searching for the legendary Sierra del Plata.

== History ==

Native inhabitants of these lands include the Pilagás, Wichis and Tobas, whose languages are still spoken in the province.

Sebastian Cabot and Diego García de Moguer first explored the area at the beginning of the 16th century trying to find a route from Viceroyalty of Peru to Asunción. Because the Pilcomayo and Bermejo Rivers are so shallow, the attempts to set a route towards Asunción was abandoned.

The area&#x27;s first European settlement, &quot;Concepción del Bermejo&quot;, was established in 1585. Following the establishment of Argentine and Paraguayan independence in the 1810s, the area fell under dispute between the two nations, a matter not settled until after the War of the Triple Alliance (1865–70). Commander Luis Jorge Fontana founded the settlement of Formosa in 1879, bringing the remote area into national attention and helping to secure a territorial status in 1884.

Formosa had less than 20,000 inhabitants in 1914; but in 1955, when it acquired the status of Province by decree of President Juan Perón, it had already more than 150,000. Following the by the Argentinean Gendarmerie of nomadic Amerindians in 1947, President Perón initiated a program of land reform in the province; the program, by the time of his 1955 overthrow, had issued only around 4,000 land grants, however. Continuing to grow slowly, though relatively steadily, the Formosa campus of the National University of the Northeast was established as the National University of Formosa in 1988.

==Geography==
Located within the geographic coordinates 26° 22°30&#x27; south, and 57°30&#x27; 62°25&#x27; west, the plains run between the Bermejo and Pilcomayo Rivers with a slight inclination towards the southeast. Due to this flatness, riverbeds are not stable, and small lagoons that are slowly reabsorbed arise.

===Climate===
The average annual temperature is 21 °C; during summer it can rise to 45 °C.

The tropical weather is characterized with uniform annual rains in the east (1000 mm annual), while in the rest of the country winter is a drier season (80 mm). The humidity variation results in the jungle vegetation on one side, and the Chaqueño forest in the other. The limit with the Salta Province is known as the &quot;Impenetrable&quot; (&quot;Impenetrable&quot;).

Formosa&#x27;s protected areas are the Río Pilcomayo National Park and the Formosa National Reserve.

==Fauna==
Formosa, a province located in northern Argentina, is renowned for its exceptional fauna diversity. The region&#x27;s diverse ecosystems, encompassing wetlands, forests, grasslands, and rivers, provide a wide array of habitats for a rich variety of animal species.

The fauna of Formosa showcases a remarkable assortment, playing a vital role in preserving the ecological balance of this vast environment and contributing to the overall functionality of the ecosystem.

Nevertheless, the indigenous animals of Formosa have faced significant declines as a result of human activities. The yaguareté, once a prevalent inhabitant of the forests and jungles, has experienced a population decrease. Other felids, such as pumas and various feline species, also inhabit the area. The humid forest areas are home to tapirs and monkeys, with the distinctive howler monkey, known as carayá, standing out among them. In the drier forest zones, armadillos, including the giant armadillo, locally known as tatú carreta, alongside foxes and rodents commonly found in the Chaco region, have established their habitats. The bird and reptile populations in Formosa share similarities with those found in other provinces of Argentina.

===Mammals===
In Formosa Province, one can still find both large and small feline species, such as the jaguar, puma, ocelot, mountain cat, and pampas cat.

In the grassland areas, the maned wolf, known as &quot;aguara-guazu,&quot; can be found, although its population is currently declining. In more open and cleared areas, armadillos such as the mulita, giant armadillo, mataco, and peludo can be found.

Other abundant mammals in Formosa include coatis, tapirs, small deer known as corzuelas, foxes, skunks, vizcachas, overa weasels, howler monkeys or caraya, and various rodent species.

The 27 species of mammals that have been identified in Formosa are:
*Giant Anteater
*Southern Tamandua
*Marsh Deer
*Gray brocket
*Collared Peccary
*White-lipped Peccary
*Maned Wolf
*Crab-eating Fox
*Pampas Fox
*Jaguar
*Puma
*Jaguarundi
*Geoffroy&#x27;s Cat
*Tayra (Eira barbara)
*Neotropical Otter
*Crab-eating Raccoon
*South American Coati

*Nine-banded Armadillo
*Common tapeti
*South American Tapir
*Azara&#x27;s Night Monkey
*Black Howler Monkey
*Capybara
*Chacoan Mara
*Brazilian guinea pig

===Birds===
Formosa is one of the preferred destinations for nature enthusiasts due to the excellent state of conservation of its ecosystems across much of its territory. It is renowned for its rich birdlife, with many species easily observable during a day trip into nature.

Within this province, one can encounter rheas (ñandúes), various species of partridges among the terrestrial birds, and herons among the aquatic species. Other notable bird species include toucans, southern lapwings, crested caracaras, crows, caracaras, magpies, woodpeckers, kingfishers, different species of doves and ducks, guans, hoatzins, ovenbirds, cattle tyrants, fork-tailed flycatchers, owls, and nightjars, seedeaters, swans, and spoonbills. In the areas near rivers, especially along the Paraná River, common parakeets and the yellow-chevroned parakeet and blue-fronted parrot are abundant.

It could be said that half of Argentina&#x27;s bird species are found in Formosa, as 367 species have been recorded out of the 1,020 documented across the entire country. These are just a few examples of the diverse avian inhabitants of the province:
Some of the birds found in Formosa include:

*Rhea
*Southern Screamer
*Red-and-green Macaw
*Brazilian Teal
*Glittering-bellied_emerald
*Black-throated Mango
*Andean Flamingo
*White-barred Piculet
*Toco Toucan
*Ringed Kingfisher
*Scarlet Macaw

== Demographics ==

According to the 2022 Argentine national census, the Province of Formosa has 606,941 inhabitants.

==Economy==

Remote and saddled by its inhospitable geography and climate, Formosa&#x27;s economy has long been one of Argentina&#x27;s poorest. Its economy in 2006 was estimated at US$2.082 billion, or, US$4,278 per capita. Its economy is the third-smallest and second-least developed in Argentina, yet it has shared in Argentina&#x27;s recovery since 2002 very well.

Poorly industrialized, Formosa&#x27;s economy is based on cattle and agricultural activities like cotton and fruit cultivation, these being mostly centered in the Patino, Pilagás and Pilcomayo departments.

Cattle in Formosa exceed 1.5 million head and ranching has long been the agricultural mainstay of the province. Like elsewhere in Argentina, agriculture has long since been overtaken by other activities and amounts to about 10% of Formosa&#x27;s output (somewhat more than average).

Cotton cultivation passed from over 100,000 tons at the end of the 1970s to 10,000 at the end of the 1990s because of the drop of the international price, and the fixed exchange rate. After the 2001 crisis, production slightly revived to 50,000 tons a year in 2004. More than 70% of the area sown with cotton belongs to small family-run farms of less than 10 hectares.

Cotton represents half of the agricultural wealth of the province followed by soybean (25,000 tons a year) and maize (55,000 tons), who have experienced a less dramatic invigoration after the 2001 crisis.

Bananas, grown mainly for domestic consumption, amount to a steady annual average crop of 70,000 tons. Citrus and juice production for exportation, specially grapefruit, is growing rapidly, with 1,200 planted hectares and an annual production of around 15,000 tons.

Others; honey (273 tons) and derivatives, timber-wood (140,000 tons) and textile industry (cotton, leather).

Tourist infrastructure is barely developed. Sites of interest include the city of Formosa, the Río Pilcomayo National Park, &quot;Bañado La Estrella&quot;, &quot;Laguna Yema&quot;, &quot;Herradura&quot; town, and &quot;Misión Laishí&quot;.

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of Formosa Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Formosa Provincial Police.

== Political division ==
The province is divided into nine departments:

== Villages ==

*Herradura, settlement
*Villa General Güemes, settlement

== State anthem ==
Formosa has its own anthem, called &quot;Himno Marcha Formosa&quot;. On April 8, 1955, the Anthem &quot;Marcha Formosa&quot; was sung for the first time, in 1964 the definitive arrangement of it was made and it became official as a song. By decree No. 1471 of July 21, 1988, compulsory education was established in primary, secondary and tertiary establishments and its intonation in public events.

<doc id="292713" wikidata="Q44214" url="?curid=292713" title="Formosa, Argentina">
<text>Formosa () is the capital city of the Argentine province of Formosa, on the banks of the Paraguay River, opposite the Paraguayan town of Alberdi, about north from Buenos Aires, on National Route 11. The city has a population of about 234,000 per the .

Formosa is the hub of the provincial industry, that processes the product of its natural resources. The port that serves Paraguay towards the Paraná River is the main transport means for the provincial production.

Notable sights of the city include the &quot;Nuestra Señora del Carmen&quot; Cathedral, the Government House, the &quot;Torelli&quot; Botanic Forest Garden, the Provincial History Museum (&quot;Museo Histórico Provincial&quot;), the &quot;Estadio Centenario&quot; (&quot;Centenary Stadium&quot;) football stadium, the &quot;Guaicole&quot; fauna reserve, the shore of the Paraguay River, the &quot;Isla de Oro&quot; Island, and the Central Square named after José de San Martín.

== History ==
The lands were initially inhabited by the Toba and Wichí (Mataco) indigenous peoples. On April 8, 1879 Commander Luis Jorge Fontana founded the settlement that would become the capital of the National Territory of Chaco from 1884 to June 15, 1955, when it gained the status of province. The Formosa campus of the National University of the Northeast was established as the National University of Formosa in 1988.

The name of the city (and the province) comes from the archaic Spanish word &quot;fermosa&quot; (currently &quot;hermosa&quot;) meaning &quot;beautiful&quot;. The name &quot;Vuelta Fermosa&quot; or &quot;Vuelta la Formosa&quot; was used by Spanish sailors in the 16th century to describe the area where the Paraguay River makes a turn, right in front of the actual city. These sailors were searching for the legendary Sierra de la Plata.

== Government and politics ==
The city of Formosa is governed by the Municipal Council, which has autonomous status. It consists of an Executive Department (led by the Mayor), a Legislative Department (the Deliberative Council), and a Judicial Department (headed by the Municipal Chamber of Appeals and the misdemeanor judges distributed in the two Misdemeanor Courts of the city).

The Deliberative Council of Formosa has the highest number of members in the entire province, as it is the only municipality that currently has over 100,000 inhabitants in the province. There are a total of twelve councilors. The Council is headed by the President of the Council, followed by the 1st Vice President and the 2nd Vice President of the Council.

The Executive Department is led by the Mayor of the city of Formosa, who determines the members of the municipal cabinet. Within the cabinet, the Secretaries are responsible for endorsing the acts of the Mayor within their competence. Each Municipal Secretary is in charge of a specific area of the Executive Department. These secretaries, in turn, have sub-secretariats under their authority, which handle more specific competencies. Generally, the Sub-secretariats, such as the Traffic and Transportation sub-secretariat, are further divided into General Directorates, which are composed of Directorates and Departments.

== Culture ==
The city, which is only a few hundred meters away from Paraguay across the river, has a culture closer to that of Paraguay than the &quot;porteño&quot; culture of Buenos Aires. Laid back and relaxed, its young people relax on the Costanera, the recently restored pathway along the Río Paraguay which serves as a venue for arts displays and features a fast-food restaurant, or at boliches, local clubs. The city&#x27;s well-known cultural institutions include the Formosa Regional Historical Museum, the Juan Pablo Duffard Historical Museum (a National Historic Monument), the Qomp Toba Artisanal Museum, and the Oscar Albertazzi Arts Institute.

The city has, since the 1970s, enjoyed increasing domestic tourism as a winter destination and, since the devaluation of the peso in 2002, growing international tourism, as well. Formosa is currently home to one five-star hotel (the International Tourist Hotel) and four four-star hotels. One other five-star establishment, the Howard Johnson Neo Formosa, was completed in July 2011 and features a casino and shopping gallery. 23,000-capacity Estadio Don Carlos Antonio Romero, used mainly for association football, is the main venue in Formosa.

=== Festivals ===

Formosa celebrates Our Lady of Carmen (&quot;Nuestra Señora del Carmen&quot;), its patron saint, on July 16 in honor of its holy day. Celebrations, which occur in the main Plaza San Martín, include the traditional pericón dance and stalls selling everything from food to balloons.

It also celebrates the Fiesta del Río in November, Carnaval on weekends in February and Día de la Fundación de Formosa in April.

<doc id="292715" wikidata="Q511289" url="?curid=292715" title="Charles de Saint-Évremond">
<text>Charles de Marguetel de Saint-Denis, seigneur de Saint-Évremond (1 April 16139 September 1703) was a French soldier, hedonist, essayist and literary critic. After 1661, he lived in exile, mainly in England, as a consequence of his attack on French policy at the time of the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659). He is buried in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey. He wrote for his friends and did not intend his work to be published, although a few of his pieces were leaked in his lifetime. The first full collection of his works was published in London in 1705, after his death.

==Life==
He was born at Saint-Denis-le-Guast, near Coutances, the seat of his family in Normandy. He was a pupil of the Jesuits at the College de Clermont (now Lycée Louis-le-Grand), Paris; then a student at Caen. For a time he studied law in Paris at the College d&#x27;Harcourt (now Lycée Saint-Louis). He soon, however, took to arms, and in 1629 went with Marshal Bassompierre to Italy. He served through a great part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, distinguishing himself at the siege of Landrecies (1637), when he was made captain. During his campaigns he studied the works of Montaigne and the Spanish and Italian languages.

In 1639 he met Gassendi in Paris, and became one of his disciples. He was present at the battles of Rocroi, Nördlingen, and at Lerida. For a time he was personally attached to Condé, but offended him by a satirical remark and was deprived of his command in the prince&#x27;s guards in 1648. During the Fronde, Saint-Évremond was a steady royalist. The Duke of Candale, of whom Saint-Évremond has left a very severe portrait, gave him a command in Guienne after he had reached the grade of &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;, and he is said to have pocketed 50,000 livres in less than three years from this office. He was one of the numerous victims involved in the fall of Fouquet in 1661. His letter to Marshal Créquy on the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which is said to have been discovered by Colbert&#x27;s agents at the seizure of Fouquet&#x27;s papers, seems a very inadequate cause for his disgrace.

Saint-Évremond fled to the Netherlands and to England, where he was kindly received by Charles II and was pensioned. After James II&#x27;s flight to France, Saint-Évremond was invited to return, but he declined. Hortense Mancini, the most attractive of Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s group of attractive nieces, came to England in 1670, and set up a salon for flirtation, gambling, and witty conversation, and here Saint-Évremond was for many years at home. He died aged ninety on 9 September 1703 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his monument is in Poets&#x27; Corner, close to that of Prior.

==Literary work==
Saint-Évremond never authorised the printing of any of his works during his lifetime, though Barbin in 1668 published an unauthorised collection but he empowered Pierre des Maizeaux to publish his works after his death, and they were published in London (2 volumes, 1705), and often reprinted. His masterpiece in irony is the so-called &quot;Conversation du maréchal d&#x27;Hocquincourt avec le père Canaye&quot; (the latter a Jesuit and Saint-Évremond&#x27;s master at school), which has been frequently classed with the &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot;.

His &quot;Œuvres meslées&quot;, edited from the manuscripts by Silvestre and Maizeaux, were printed by Jacob Tonson (London, 1705, 2 volumes; 2nd edition, 3 volumes, 1709), with a notice by Maizeaux. His correspondence with Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos, whose fast friend he was, was published in 1752; &quot;La Comédie des académistes&quot;, written in 1643, was printed in 1650. Modern editions of his works are by Hippeau (Paris, 1852), C. Giraud (Paris, 1865), and a selection (1881) with a notice by M. de Lescure. Among his plays is one called &quot;Politick Would-be&quot;, modelled on a character from Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;.

<text>Cypress is a common name for various coniferous trees or shrubs from the &quot;Cupressus&quot; genus of the &quot;Cupressaceae&quot; family, typically found in warm-temperate and subtropical regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. 

== Description ==
Cypress trees typically reach heights of up to and exhibit a pyramidal form, particularly in their youth. Many are characterised by their needle-like, evergreen foliage and acorn-like seed cones. Some species develop flattened, spreading heads at maturity, while certain variants may manifest as shrubs, standing at less than . The bark of cypress trees varies, with some species having smooth surfaces, while most exhibit bark that separates into thin plates or strips, often shedding over time. Leaves of young cypress trees are spreading and awl-shaped, and are typically small, scale-like formations that tightly adhere to older branches. They are usually aromatic, with glandular pits on the outer surface, and cover the stem in opposite pairs, giving the branchlet a four-sided appearance.

==Species==
Cypress is any of the twelve species of ornamental and timber evergreen conifers constituting the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot; of the family &quot;Cupressaceae&quot;. Many resinous, aromatic evergreen trees called cypress belong to other genera of the same family, especially species of false cypress and cypress pine. The name &quot;cypress&quot; is occasionally used for some species of fustic and for bald cypress, and it often denotes jack pine in eastern Canada.

Species that are commonly known as cypresses include:

*Cypress (multiple species within the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot;):
**&quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot;, a common cypress also referred to as Italian cypress and Mediterranean cypress. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Iran.
**&quot;Hesperocyparis lusitanica&quot;, commonly known as the Mexican cypress, which is native to Mexico and Central America. 
*&quot;Chamaecyparis:&quot;
**&quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot;, known as the Lawson&#x27;s cypress or Port Orford cedar. This is a native species to Oregon and northwestern California.
*&quot;Taxodium:&quot;
**&quot;Taxodium ascendens&quot;, commonly known as pond cypress and native to North America. 
**&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;, commonly known as bald cypress and native to the southeastern United States. 
**&quot;Taxodium mucronatum&quot;, commonly known as Montezuma cypress or Montezuma bald cypress. It is native to Mexico, Guatemala, and southern-central United States. 
*&quot;Calocedrus:&quot;
**&quot;Calocedrus decurrens,&quot; which has the common names bastard-cedar, incense-cedar and California incense cedar. They are native to North America, specifically California, Oregon, Nevada, and Mexico. 
*&quot;Thuja:&quot;
**&quot;Platycladus orientalis&quot; or &quot;Thuja orientalis,&quot; commonly known as Chinese thuja and native to China and Korea.

*Siberian cypress (&quot;Microbiota decussata&quot;)
*Summer cypress (&quot;Bassia scoparia&quot;), in the family Amaranthaceae
*Western red cedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), native to North America.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;cypress&quot; is derived from Old French &quot;cipres&quot;, which was imported from Latin &quot;cypressus&quot;, the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (&quot;kyparissos&quot;).

== Symbology ==
In Greek mythology, &quot;Cyparissos&quot;, &quot;Cyparissus&quot; or &quot;Kyparissos&quot; (Ancient Greek: Κυπάρισσος, &quot;cypress&quot;) was a male lover of Apollo, as well as other deities in other versions of mythology. 

In the most prevalent version of the story, Cyparissus receives a stag as a gift from Apollo, which he accidentally kills with a spear while hunting in the forest. Cyparissus is overwhelmed by pain and sorrow, and asks Apollo to allow his tears to flow for eternity. Apollo transforms Cyparissus into a cypress tree, and the sap that typically drips down the tree&#x27;s trunk represents Cyparissus&#x27; tears. 

Consequently, the cypress emerged as a symbol of mourning, sadness, and loss in classical mythology, thereby serving an aetiological purpose in explaining its cultural significance. Due to its connection to grief, the cypress became one of the symbols of Hades and has been planted in cemeteries since the classical era. During the Renaissance period, the myth of &quot;Kyparissos&quot; was revived, and is depicted in several works of art and poetry.

<doc id="292722" wikidata="Q842836" url="?curid=292722" title="Game Boy Advance SP">
<text>The Game Boy Advance SP (SP stands for &quot;Special&quot;) is a 32-bit handheld game console made by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on February 14, 2003, and to international markets in March. This model is an upgraded version of the Game Boy Advance with a more compact, foldable clamshell design. It also featured two major improvements: it was the first device in the Game Boy family with a rechargeable battery and the first widely released model with an integrated screen light, starting with front lighting and later transitioning to backlighting. The light made it easier to play in low-light conditions than its predecessors, which relied on reflective screens. The console was the second-to-last in the Game Boy Advance lineup, preceding the smaller Game Boy Micro, released in September 2005.

== History ==
The Game Boy Advance SP was championed by Satoru Okada, who led the development of the original Game Boy Advance. When Okada first pitched to Nintendo leadership the idea of a small and thin Game Boy Advance that used a rechargeable battery, the feedback was almost entirely negative. Not deterred, Okada told one of his hardware engineers to build a conceptual model as small and thin as possible without regard to the feasibility of manufacturing the device. What resulted was the clamshell design of the Game Boy Advance SP. When Okada took this conceptual model to the same leadership group that rejected his initial pitch, they were quickly won over.

In addition to being smaller and using a rechargeable battery, the Game Boy Advance SP also addressed a key shortcoming of the original Game Boy Advance: the reflective color display that was hard to see in dark conditions.

The first Game Boy Advance SP had a frontlight that illuminated the front of the display and a reflective surface behind the screen that sent light back through the liquid crystal pixel elements to the viewer. A later revision replaced the frontlight and reflective surface with a backlight that also illuminated the liquid crystal pixel elements.

All Game Boy Advance SP models were discontinued globally by the end of 2010, outlasting the Game Boy Micro by two years.

== Hardware ==

=== Technical specifications ===
=== Headphone jack ===

Nintendo removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack from the SP, which had been included on all previous Game Boy models. Headphones designed specifically for the GBA SP can be purchased, or standard headphones can be attached with an optional adapter that plugs into the same port as the AC adapter. As both the AC adapter and headphones use the same port, it is not possible to charge the SP and listen to headphones at the same time with the Nintendo-brand adapter. There are, however, third-party adapters that &quot;split&quot; into two different cords: the power jack on one side and a headphone jack on the other.

== Backlit model (AGS-101) ==

In 2005 (around the same time as the Game Boy Micro&#x27;s release), Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in North America, featuring a brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version&#x27;s frontlit screen. This GBA SP was Nintendo&#x27;s first internationally-released handheld system to feature an integrated backlight. (However, there had already been a backlit system years earlier with the Japan-only Game Boy Light, which was essentially a Game Boy Pocket with an electroluminescent backlit display.) The AGS-101 was never officially released in Japan, however, and the frontlit AGS-001 models were still available on the market until the end of production.

The new model can be distinguished by the following features:

* The box states &quot;Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen!&quot; to distinguish the new model from the older, frontlit models.
* The model number of the backlit SP is AGS-101, whereas the model number of the original frontlit SP is AGS-001. This can be found on the label at the bottom of the unit.
* The mini button at the top center of the console&#x27;s lower face is now referred to in the manual as the &quot;Brightness Switch&quot; and selects between two levels of brightness, &quot;Normal&quot; (Low) and &quot;Bright&quot; (High) with no off setting. On the frontlit models, this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With the backlight set to &quot;Normal&quot; (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on.
* When powered off, the backlit model&#x27;s screen is completely black, but the frontlit model&#x27;s screen is noticeably lighter.

The North American backlit version comes in three standard colors: &quot;Pearl Blue&quot;, &quot;Pearl Pink&quot; and &quot;Graphite&quot; (a greyer version of Onyx Black). There were also two Toys &quot;R&quot; Us exclusive backlit models; a &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; model and a &quot;Limited Edition Pikachu&quot; model.

In 2006, the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in Europe. Few models made it to market, likely due to the release of the Game Boy Advance-compatible Nintendo DS one year prior. The European version was released in &quot;Surf Blue&quot; as well as re-issued in &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot; editions.

Unlike the North American release, the European box does not feature any prominent text to distinguish the backlit models from the older frontlit models. In addition, only the &quot;Surf Blue&quot; color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot; had already been released as frontlit models – for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box. (The European frontlit models of &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Tribal&quot; only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front, respectively.)

The AGS-101 Game Boy Advance SP was the final Nintendo handheld to have backward compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color games in North America and Europe.

== Unit colors ==
The GBA SP launched in Platinum Silver and Cobalt Blue, with the addition of Onyx in Europe and Japan. Later colors include: Flame Red, Pearl Pink, Pearl Blue, Graphite, Midnight Blue, Charizard Fire Red, Torchic Orange, Venusaur Leaf Green, Groudon Red, Kyogre Blue, Rayquaza Green, NES classic design, and Pikachu Yellow. A limited gold edition with a Triforce and the Hyrule Royal Family crest was available in Europe which included a copy of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap&quot;. In 2003, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us sold an exclusive gold edition (without any Zelda symbols) in the US starting on Black Friday of that year, initially with a &quot;Super Mario Advance 4&quot; game.

In Japan, it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages. In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black. Later, a Flame Red version was released. Six special editions have also been released: an NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller (and designed to resemble an NES deck when closed), a SpongeBob SquarePants model, a Pikachu model, and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it, known as the &#x27;Tribal Edition&#x27;. In other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, additional colors have been released, such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold.

The Game Boy Advance SP had other limited editions:

* All Blacks (New Zealand only)
* Deep Silver (&quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; Edition)
* Green &amp; Orange (Limited Edition)
* Mario
* Pearl Blue
* Pearl Green
* Pearl White (Limited Edition)
* Snow White
* Spice &amp; Lime
* Surf Blue (UK only)
* Tribal
* White Rip Curl special edition (Australia only)
* &quot;Who Are You?&quot; (Black with &quot;Who Are You?&quot; printed on the top)

Wiley of &quot;IGN&quot; called the Game Boy Advance SP &quot;a step in the right direction for Nintendo&quot;, praising the system&#x27;s new redesign over the original GBA and highlighting its inclusion of a backlit screen and rechargeable battery, although minor criticism went towards the system&#x27;s omission of a headphone jack. &quot;Engadget&quot; gave it a global score of 84 out of 100, also praising the new features of the redesign while noting the system&#x27;s lack of a headphone jack. Lawson Wong of &quot;Fresh Gear&quot; called it &quot;darn close to perfection&quot; aside from the missing headphone jack. Matthew D. Sarrel of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; suggested it to consumers as an improvement over the original model, praising the backlight and integration of a charger as well as improved visual quality, though he noted that players with larger hands may find difficulty with the system&#x27;s design.

== Sales ==
As of June 30, 2009, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.48 million units worldwide, of which 43.52 million are Game Boy Advance SP units.

<doc id="292733" wikidata="Q2084882" url="?curid=292733" title="Phantasy Star Online">
<text>Phantasy Star Online is an online role-playing game (RPG) developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega in 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was the first successful online RPG for game consoles; players adventure with up to three others over the internet to complete quests, collect items and fight enemies in real-time action RPG combat. The story is unrelated to previous games in the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series.

Before &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, online gaming was limited to western PC games, particularly RPGs such as &quot;Diablo&quot;, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, and &quot;EverQuest&quot;. Believing online play was the future, Sega chairman Isao Okawa instructed Sonic Team to develop an online game for the Dreamcast, produced by Yuji Naka. Sonic Team&#x27;s experiments led to the development of &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, the first online Dreamcast game. Using what they learned from the project, and taking significant inspiration from &quot;Diablo&quot;, Sonic Team built &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;. As Japanese internet service providers charged for dial-up access per minute, and high-speed connections were not yet widely available, Okawa personally paid for free internet access bundled with Japanese Dreamcasts.

&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was highly anticipated and launched to positive reviews and commercial success; critics praised the online gameplay as addictive but criticized the single-player mode. It received the Japan Game Award for &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and is recognized as a landmark console game, influencing multiplayer dungeon crawlers, as well as the &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; series.

&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was ported to Windows and rereleased on the Dreamcast as &quot;Ver. 2&quot; with expanded content. Following Sega&#x27;s exit from the console business in 2001, the game was ported to GameCube and Xbox as &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot;, featuring new characters, environments and other features. &quot;Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution&quot;, released for GameCube in 2003, was a turn-based card game. The online series continued with &quot;Phantasy Star Universe&quot; (2006) and &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot; (2012). Sega decommissioned the last official servers in 2010; &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; is still played on private servers.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; is an action role-playing game primarily played with other players cooperatively over the internet. Players take on the role of adventurers sent to explore Ragol, an uncharted planet. To create their character, they choose between a handful of races and classes, which define their abilities and statistics; for example, some types are better with &quot;techniques&quot; (magic spells) while others are more skilled with ranged or melee weapons.

Players can play either online or offline. Online, players are brought to a lobby where they can chat and organize teams of up to four. Team members can communicate by typing using a physical or onscreen keyboard, even when in different environments. Preset phrases are automatically translated between languages, and custom emoticons are also supported. Players can also exchange &quot;guild cards&quot; to exchange private messages and see when the other is online.

After organizing a team, players are transported to their own instance of the hub spaceship &quot;Pioneer 2&quot;, where they can buy and sell items, store money and items, heal, and browse quests. At any time, they can transport to Ragol, where combat and exploration take place. The four environments – forests, caves, mines, or ruins – comprise winding passages and large areas where enemies spawn. Players fight enemies in real time, using weapons and techniques and collecting items. Attacks can be chained for more accuracy and speed. Typically, all the monsters in a room must be defeated to advance. Each environment ends in a boss battle, which rewards the team with a large sum of experience points. Quests, taken on &quot;Pioneer 2,&quot; task players with specific challenges; once completed, the team returns to &quot;Pioneer 2&quot; to collect their reward. Higher difficulties reward players with more experience points and better items. Some items can be used to feed the player&#x27;s mag, a small creature that follows the player character and aids them in battle.

==Plot==
The story of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; is unrelated to the original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series, and is less substantial. Threatened by the imminent destruction of their home planet, thousands of refugees arrive at planet Ragol aboard the spaceship &quot;Pioneer 2.&quot; As they establish contact with colonists sent ahead on &quot;Pioneer 1&quot;, an enormous explosion shakes the planet. Adventurers from &quot;Pioneer 2&quot; land to investigate the explosion and search for Rico Tyrell, daughter of the head of &quot;Pioneer 2&quot;. They discover the planet overrun by monsters, and follow messages left by Rico leading to an ancient evil, Dark Falz.

==Development==
By the late 1990s, the popularity of online gaming on personal computers had grown substantially in the west, but was almost nonexistent in Japan, where consoles were more popular. Sega chairman Isao Okawa believed the internet was the future of gaming and wanted a flagship online game for Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast console. None of Sega&#x27;s development studios wanted the project, as they were occupied with their own ventures, such as &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; (2000) and the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series. Okawa gave the responsibility to Sonic Team, led by Yuji Naka. Sonic Team was not particularly receptive to the decision, but continued with development. After Okawa became ill, Naka sent reports to the hospital to update him on progress.

=== Concept ===
Sonic Team began experimenting with the Dreamcast&#x27;s network capabilities after completing &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; in 1998. They saw the creation of an online game for Japan, a nation of console gamers, as a serious challenge, akin to creating a new genre. Much of their time was spent learning the basic elements of online gaming; they wanted to make sure the network functionality worked before developing the gameplay, setting, and story. Their network experiments became &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, released in 1999 as the first online game for the Dreamcast. Sonic Team used the lessons learned from &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot; to implement network technology in the larger project.

Because of the lack of Japanese online games, and the developers&#x27; experience with the genre, Naka looked to western games for inspiration, and studied three online RPGs popular at the time: &quot;Diablo&quot; (1996), &quot;Ultima Online&quot; (1997), and &quot;EverQuest&quot; (1999). &quot;Diablo&quot; in particular impressed him on a gameplay and technical level; he enjoyed how smooth the graphics and action were despite requiring significant system memory. &quot;Diablo&quot; was a 2D game, however, and Sonic Team wanted to develop a 3D game with the same degree of smoothness and gameplay. This concerned Naka, as he did not want his game to use the cheap and bland graphics associated with online games.

Naka decided against creating a massively multiplayer game similar to &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and &quot;EverQuest&quot;, which would handle many players simultaneously in a persistent world; the necessary servers would have required two years of programming, and the Dreamcast did not have a hard disk drive to support continuous online patches. Naka was also more interested in working on new projects instead of continuously updating the same game for years, and doubted Sonic Team would be able to keep the game interesting. The team therefore adopted &quot;Diablo&quot; as their main inspiration, determined to outclass it.

=== Art and setting ===
Sonic Team built a science fiction-fantasy game under the working title &quot;Third World&quot;. The art style was &quot;comic-like&quot; at first, but became more realistic. One of artist Satoshi Sakai&#x27;s early concept drawings of a dragon reminded Naka of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series, which had been dormant since &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; (1993) for the Genesis. Naka had been the main programmer on &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; (1987) and &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; (1989). He had always wanted to develop a multiplayer &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; game, but previous hardware did not allow for it.

With the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series chosen as the setting, Sonic Team continued developing the gameplay and story. The team was given freedom not to adhere strictly to elements from earlier &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games. The game would not continue the story from the previous &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games, something that made Naka feel liberated. Since few of the &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; staff still worked at Sega, the art team felt little obligation to adhere to the previous games&#x27; style, retaining only the science fiction look and some enemy and item names. Naka and Sakai believed factors such as the change in graphical fidelity and genre were enough to differentiate it from previous &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games.

=== Music ===
The soundtrack was composed by Hideaki Kobayashi using a Roland JV-2080 synthesizer, with live orchestration on some tracks, including the theme song. Kobayashi composed ambient music for calm scenes, and incorporated more rhythm and melody for battles. He composed short four-bar melodies that are sequenced depending on gameplay; for example, when an enemy appears, the system plays music associated with that enemy. The process was a drain on the Dreamcast hardware, and gained the nickname &quot;the crasher&quot; among staff for how often it would crash the game during development.

=== Online functionality ===
Sonic Team had conceived their 1998 Saturn game &quot;Burning Rangers&quot; as an online game for four players, but abandoned the idea due to insurmountable network problems. They used the &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot; networking system as a template for the online functions for &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;. This presented new challenges, as the new network would connect players between different countries. Sonic Team ran experiments with different internet service providers, dial-up modems, cable modems, and other networking configurations to ensure the game would work for all players. In Japan, Sonic Team gave beta versions to 10,000 users who pre-ordered the game, so they could work with a variety of equipment and internet services to eliminate problems. They wanted to run a worldwide test but did not have time. 90% of the testers were able to play online. Despite technical success, Sega was concerned that the high cost of internet access in Japan would be prohibitive for gamers and reduce sales. Japanese internet service providers charged per-minute fees for dial-up access, and high-speed options such as broadband were not yet widely available. To combat this, chairman Okawa personally paid for free internet access for one year to be bundled with each Dreamcast.

One of the biggest challenges was bridging the language barrier between global players. Sonic Team felt that developing a universal language system would be the largest barrier to a global gaming network. The team started by developing the word select system, which allows players to select predefined expressions to be translated to other players. The system had about 2000 words near the end of development, and Naka found it difficult to add more words to satisfy all player needs. Sonic Team built support for five languages: Japanese, English, Spanish, German, and French. They omitted Italian and Portuguese due to time constraints. Korean was also considered because of the internet boom in Korea at the time. Japanese and English were easier to implement because the only concern is the word location in the sentence, whereas Spanish and French have grammatical gender. The language system had to be fully redesigned at least once.

Each server could accommodate one thousand players. Sega initially prepared 20 network servers to accommodate 20,000 online users for game&#x27;s launch, with room to add more servers as necessary. This was increased to support up to 36,000 players right before launch. Sonic Team partnered with Swatch to use Swatch Internet time (or &quot;beat time&quot;) as a universal clock for the game. The clock was implemented so players could coordinate with those in other countries on when to play online. The clock system divides each 24 hours into 1000 beats, with one beat equaling one minute and 26.4 seconds. The time was maintained directly on the server and not based on the user&#x27;s clock on their system. Sonic Team decided not to add jumping to keep the levels simple and simplify the network code.

Naka joked that future gamers would laugh at the word &quot;Online&quot; in the title, as he believed that online gaming would become standard; it was included as the concept was new and so important to communicate.

=== End of production ===
&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was planned for release in March 2000, but was delayed so more features could be added. The team planned 18 character types, and had male and female sketches for each, but settled on nine. A player-versus-player mode was included in beta versions given to journalists, but this was omitted in the final version because it distracted players from the cooperative focus and introduced game balance issues; additionally, as the console-playing audience was younger than the PC audience, Naka did not want to evoke competitive behavior. The development team had more ideas for features to implement as development came to a close, with Naka wishing he had six additional months to add more features. &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; took two years to develop. Naka found it difficult to make a networked game for consoles, and developed an appreciation for Microsoft for supporting online games so well.

== Promotion ==
Sega unveiled &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show with a gameplay demonstration. Naka called it the &quot;killer app&quot; for the Dreamcast as it used all aspects of the system, most importantly the modem.

As the first online RPG for consoles, &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was highly anticipated. Journalists saw it as the next evolutionary step in console-based role-playing games. Francesca Reyes of &quot;Official Dreamcast Magazine&quot; proposed that it would be an &quot;industry-changing title&quot;, a landmark in the history of console gaming. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; wrote that the Dreamcast was quickly becoming the platform for innovative games, and wrote that &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was &quot;arguably the most revolutionary - not the mention most ambitious - console game ever&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; believed it would &quot;change the way we think of RPGs&quot; and could possibly be &quot;the most exciting console RPG ever created&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that the multiplayer mechanics &quot;would lay the foundations for a new era of console gaming&quot;. &quot;Video Gamer&quot; called it the &quot;Dreamcast&#x27;s most ambitious project yet&quot;. Some journalists had concerns about the viability of the online modes, and saw the single-player option as a fail-safe should it not function correctly.

To promote the game, Sega bought a star on the International Star Registry and named it &quot;Ragol&quot;. The first 100,000 people to pre-order the game in Japan received &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; branded dog tags. A limited edition in Japan including a branded memory card was canceled and the memory card sold separately on Sega&#x27;s website. Early copies of the game included a demo for &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;.

== Launch ==
&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was released in Japan on December 21, 2000. The language could be changed to English or any of the other supported chat languages, making it &quot;import-friendly&quot;. Naka had hoped for a simultaneous global release, but the western release was delayed for beta testing and marketing reasons. While subscriptions would be free in North America, in Japan the game included a 30-day free trial, after which Japanese players were required to purchase 30-day or 90-day subscriptions. Immediately after the Japanese release, Sonic Team began maintaining the overworked servers and investigated network problems in Hiroshima and Okayama.

Sonic Team hoped that &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; would be successful in Japan; international sales were seen as a bonus. In North America, which Naka believed would be the biggest market, &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; was released on January 30, 2001. It sold 75,000 copies there on the first day and was the bestselling game that week. Sega&#x27;s North American online gaming service SegaNet was not required for online play. While the Japanese version supported the modem and broadband adapters, the North American release did not support the broadband adapter, but &quot;IGN&quot; explained how to use it by swapping discs with an import copy.

&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; sold 500,000 copies in Japan and one million worldwide, meeting Sega&#x27;s expectations almost exactly. Naka had hoped to sell more, but believed the servers may not have carried the load. Before its western launch, nearly 100,000 players had registered. By April 2001, over 235,000 players had registered worldwide: 130,000 in Japan, 70,000 in North America, and 35,000 in Europe. By May, over 270,000 had registered. The peak number of users connected simultaneously was 26,000.

&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; suffered problems common with other online games, with players cheating and selling rare items online. Several weeks after launch, Japanese players began exploiting bugs to duplicate items, enhance their stats, and kill other players. Sonic Team announced they would ban players found cheating or disrupting other players, starting in May 2001. According to &quot;IGN,&quot; cheating was prevalent because &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; used a peer-to-peer communication system. Blizzard Entertainment had similar problems with &quot;Diablo&quot;, but after moving to a client-server system for &quot;Diablo II&quot;, cheating became more difficult.

Sonic Team added more quests for players to download, translated into the five languages used in the game. In Japan, a special &quot;Fan Cup&quot; quest was held from March 23 to April 6, developed with the game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. In the event, over 70,000 players competed for the fastest time; the winner received a cash prize and a rare game item. As he had with &quot;ChuChu Rocket!,&quot; Naka played online and was happy to see American and Japanese players playing together using the communication system.

== Later releases ==
=== &quot;Ver. 2&quot; ===
In April 2001, Sega announced &quot;Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2,&quot; an updated version of the original game with new content and improved features, including an increased level cap (to 200), a new difficulty mode for players over level 80, a battle mode that pits players in one-on-one or team battles, a soccer minigame with balls shaped like characters from &quot;ChuChu Rocket!,&quot; new weapons and monsters, gameplay balance alterations, day and night effects, an improved user interface, and two new areas exclusive to online quests. &quot;Ver. 2&quot; also adds a challenge mode, which places teams in a stage with starting equipment and stats; if a teammate dies, the mission ends. Players could import their character from the original game or create a new one; characters registered for &quot;Ver. 2&quot; could not be used in the original game. Any illegal items were also deleted during the upgrade.

Sonic Team worked a tough schedule to develop &quot;Ver. 2&quot; in under six months, releasing it on June 7, 2001, in Japan and September 25, 2001, in North America. Unlike the original North American release, &quot;Ver. 2&quot; required subscription fees to play. Three months of unlimited gameplay could be purchased at a time. The game still had no dependencies on SegaNet, however. In Europe, DreamKey 3.0 was required. &quot;Ver. 2&quot; was ported to Windows in Japan and released on December 20, 2001.

=== &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; ===
On January 31, 2001, following years of losses, Sega announced it would discontinue the Dreamcast and restructure as a third-party developer. In May, Sega announced an expanded GameCube port of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, which became &quot;Phantasy Star Online: Episode I &amp; II&quot;. Sega chose the GameCube because it had similar architecture to the Dreamcast and supported dial-up, which Sega believed was important despite the approach of broadband internet. Sonic Team created a GameCube demo of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; within a month.

To make the game more viable for Nintendo&#x27;s family-oriented consumers, Sonic Team added a split-screen multiplayer mode. Since the GameCube had no out-of-the-box network capabilities, Nintendo developed a modem and broadband adapter and sold them separately. The servers were maintained by Sega. GameCube players could not play with Dreamcast players.

&quot;Phantasy Star Online: Episode I &amp; II&quot; comprises two &quot;episodes&quot;: Episode I is a port of &quot;Ver 2&quot; with improved graphics, whereas Episode II comprises entirely new content, which Naka described as a true sequel. The game adds characters, environments, quests, a split-screen mode, and updated graphics and interfaces. Some quests reward players with minigames based on Sonic Team games &quot;Puyo Pop&quot; and &quot;Nights into Dreams,&quot; which can be played on a Game Boy Advance connected to the GameCube. A Chao resembling Tails, a character from the &quot;Sonic&quot; games, can be imported into &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2: Battle&quot;.

Sonic Team ran a beta trial for some players who had pre-ordered &quot;Episode I &amp; II,&quot; starting on May 31, 2002. The game sold 70,000 copies within the first month in Japan, and by October had sold over 100,000. It was released in North America in October, and in Europe on March 7, 2003. Like &quot;Ver. 2&quot;, &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; required a paid monthly subscription. ASCII Corporation developed a keyboard controller for the game, released only in Japan, though plans were announced for a keyboard controller to be released in America. Some players resorted to importing the controller from Japan. An enhanced version of the game, &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; &quot;Plus,&quot; was released for the GameCube later. This version included many quests originally distributed exclusively online, a new challenge mode, and new items.

&quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; was ported to Xbox on April 15, 2003. Servers were hosted through Xbox Live and did not interface with the GameCube or Dreamcast servers. Because of its Xbox Live foundation, the Xbox version supports voice chat but did not connect players across regions. The game required an Xbox Live account to play online or offline; as the game was packaged with Xbox Live in Japan, to localize the game quickly, Microsoft did not remove the limitation. In addition to Xbox Live fees, Sega charged players an extra subscription fee to play online.

=== &quot;Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution&quot; ===
In 2003, Sega announced &quot;Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution&quot;. The game is a sequel to the story presented in &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot;, but replaces the action RPG gameplay with a turn-based strategy card game; after developing &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot;, Sonic Team thought that players may want a new experience. Players of &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; and &quot;Episode III&quot; can chat and interact in common lobbies, but cannot enter game instances together. The online servers for the game shut down at the same time as the GameCube Servers for &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot;.

=== &quot;Blue Burst&quot; ===
A new version for Windows, &quot;Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst&quot;, was released in Japan on July 15, 2004, following an open beta that began on May 22. It is a port of &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; with another episode of new content. It features enhancements including a system allowing players to communicate across different servers; the most significant change is that the game is online-only, with user data stored on the servers, reducing cheating. In January 2005, &quot;Blue Burst&quot; was released in China, Sega&#x27;s first online game there. It was released in beta in North America in May 2005, and fully in June.

=== Server closure ===
The North American Dreamcast servers operated until September 30, 2003. The North American and Japanese GameCube servers as well as the Japanese Dreamcast servers were shut down on March 30, 2007, following a month of free service. The Japanese Xbox servers were shut down on January 31, 2007, and the North American servers followed on April 22, a week earlier than the announced date of April 30. The North American and European &quot;Blue Burst&quot; servers were shut down following a free period lasting from January 12, 2008, until the server&#x27;s closing on March 31, 2008. This was followed by the shutdown of the Japanese &quot;Blue Burst&quot; servers on December 27, 2010, the last official Sega servers. Hobbyists have developed private servers, and so the game retains a cult following and can still be played online for all platforms.

==Reception==
&quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot; (Japan) wrote that the cooperative play was an interesting shift from a trend in multiplayer games being mostly competitive. &quot;Edge&quot; agreed, writing that the variety of gameplay experiences shared with other players kept the game fresh. Spanish magazine &quot;Dream Planet&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised how the players can take on different roles in the teams, such as a supporting healer or ranged attacker. &quot;IGN&quot; commended the extensive amount of equipment and items for eliciting friendly competition to collect them. The chat system was also praised for making communication easy, especially between players speaking different languages.

Critics agreed that the single-player mode was boring compared to the addictive online multiplayer. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; wrote that it lacked life and became tedious and repetitive when played alone, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; advised players not to try the game unless they were planning to play online. Other common complaints included poor camera control, the lack of map and quest variety, and poor storyline. Despite the concerns, critics agreed that the fun had in online multiplayer overshadowed these problems. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that the changes in gameplay experiences with different players replaced the variety that normally be expected in the quest design. Critics also praised the freedom for players to design and equip characters and develop their own playing style. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;PSO&quot; marks a step in a new direction for console adventures and there&#x27;s so much right with the game that to even mention these faults doesn&#x27;t quite feel in the spirit of what &quot;PSO&quot; represents&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Ver. 2&quot;, &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot; (UK) felt that it would renew interest in the game for those that enjoyed it, but would not convert new players. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; agreed, saying that the core gameplay remained the same, but the new features may be worthwhile for dedicated players, even with the new subscription costs. Reviewing &quot;Episode I &amp; II,&quot; critics praised the split-screen mode, Game Boy Advance downloads, graphics improvements, and gameplay tweaks. &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that the new material in &quot;Episode II&quot; was not significant enough for veteran players to return, and criticized some practical issues with how split-screen multiplayer was handled. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; criticized the cost for a network adapter, subscription fees, and the &quot;almost obligatory&quot; keyboard. Several critics complained about the lack of a keyboard available in the Americas.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; the best Dreamcast game and eighth-best console game of 2001. It was a nominee for the publication&#x27;s &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; prize among console games, but lost to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; for the &quot;Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World&quot; award, which was ultimately given to &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;. &quot;Episode I &amp; II&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Best Role-Playing Game on GameCube&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;.

==Legacy==

As the first online role-playing game for home consoles, &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; is considered a landmark game. It won several awards, including Japan Game Award for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, awarded three days after the death of Sega chairman Okawa, over the likes of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, and &quot;Kōkidō Gensō Gunparade March&quot;. &quot;VentureBeat&quot; dubbed it &quot;one of the most important games in console gaming evolution&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; named it one of the best RPGs of all time for being the first online experience for many gamers.

&quot;1UP.com&quot; called &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; one of the most revolutionary games of the 2000s, crediting it for creating &quot;an entire pantheon of multiplayer dungeon crawlers that continue to dominate the Japanese sales charts&quot; and making &quot;both online gaming and the concept of fee-based services a reality for consoles&quot;. Hiroshi Matsuyama, president of CyberConnect2 and developer of the &quot;.hack&quot; series, cited the game as an influence. It is also believed to be a major influence on Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; series.

According to &quot;GamesTM&quot;, the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series has struggled to live up to the legacy of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;. Sega has been slow to localize &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games, and the PSP entries in the series did not capture the attention of the west. Concurrently, &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; had a similar formula to &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; and became successful. Later &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games, such as &quot;Phantasy Star Universe&quot; (2006), share similar gameplay with &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; but failed to reach the same critical and commercial success in the West. In Japan, &quot;Phantasy Star Universe&quot; became the best selling game in the franchise. &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot; was released in Japan in 2012, and localized for the west in 2020. &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot; made over 900 million dollars since its release.

<doc id="292734" wikidata="Q1067465" url="?curid=292734" title="Charlottetown Conference">
<text>The Charlottetown Conference (A Conference to discuss the Confederation of Canada) was held in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, for representatives from colonies of British North America to discuss Canadian Confederation. The conference took place between September 1 through 9, 1864. The conference had been planned as a meeting of representatives from the Maritime colonies; Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Britain encouraged a Maritime Union between these colonies, hoping that they would then become less economically and politically dependent on the Crown, and provide for greater economic and military power for the region in light of the American Civil War. However, another colony, the Province of Canada, comprising present-day Ontario and Quebec, heard news of the planned conference and asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them.

Coincidentally there was a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and it was much more interesting to the majority of the population. At the very least, the circus made making accommodations for all the delegates difficult, since there had not been a circus in Prince Edward Island in over 20 years. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS &quot;Victoria&quot;, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals. Owing to the unexpectedly large number of visitors in the city, a sizeable proportion of the Canadian delegates remained aboard the &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; while others found accommodations at the &quot;Franklin.&quot; Meanwhile, circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town.

==Conference==
Unfortunately, there is no formal record of what was said during the Charlottetown meetings. What we know has been gathered from private sources, such as letters written home by delegates. We do know that there was agreement on the need for a detailed discussion of a potential union. It is known that the Maritime delegates put aside their idea of Maritime Union, while the Canadians could see solutions to their own problems in a larger union.

The majority of the conference took place at the colony&#x27;s legislative building, Province House, although some social functions such as dinners and banquets were held at other venues including Government House and Inkerman House, the home of the colony&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor.

The conference had begun on Thursday September 1 with a banquet for the delegates. Parties and banquets were held each night after the day&#x27;s discussions had ended, except for Sunday September 4, when they did not meet. The representatives from the Province of Canada dominated the conference, overshadowing the concerns of the Maritimes, and laying out foundations for the union that benefited them the most. Four of the first five days were spent outlining the Canadian position, and the Maritime representatives did not discuss their own plans until September 6 and 7. One Canadian delegate, George Brown, spent two days discussing the details of the proposed constitution, which would keep Canada within the British Empire. 

Most of the Maritimes were convinced that a wider union including the Province of Canada would also be beneficial to them; Prince Edward Island was unsure, however, and very much against confederation. The delegates also believed that union could be achieved within a few years, rather than in an undefined period in the future as they had originally planned. The initial intentions of the conference was for the Maritimes to discuss the possibility of a union within provinces. The Province of Canada (consisting of present-day Ontario and Quebec) requested one of their own delegates to attend the conference. If not for the inclusion of 8 Canadian delegates from the province of Canada, the constitution would not have been proposed within federal union.

The conference concluded on Wednesday September 7, but the representatives agreed to meet again the next month in both Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Quebec City (see Quebec Conference). A ball was also held on September 8, after which the delegates returned home. In addition to political meetings, the delegates participated in social activities like special lunches, small boating trips, and a ball, which gave delegates the opportunity to bond. The delegates from the respective provinces met again on September 10 and 12, 1864 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where further discussions arose regarding the union and idea of the constitution. Following meetings in Halifax, representatives met in Quebec city, on October 10 to 27, 1864. The Quebec Conference fostered a draft constitution for the proposed federal union.

== Confederation ==
Canada was founded on July 1, 1867 through negotiation at the aforementioned conferences above. To the south, during the Civil War, the United States Army grew dramatically in size. Some historians believe that Confederation was a pre-emptive action to reduce the chances that territories to the north and west of Canada would be annexed by the United States.

<text>Metroid Prime is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; is the fifth main &quot;Metroid&quot; game and the first to use 3D computer graphics and a first-person perspective. It was released in North America in November 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. Along with the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, &quot;Prime&quot; marked the return of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series after an eight-year hiatus following &quot;Super Metroid&quot; (1994).

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; takes place between the original &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot;. Players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was a collaboration between Retro in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producers Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto suggested the project after visiting Retro&#x27;s headquarters in 2000. Since exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo described the game as a &quot;first-person adventure&quot; rather than a first-person shooter.

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; sold more than 2.8 million copies worldwide. It won a number of Game of the Year awards and is regarded by many as one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic.

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was followed by &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; (2004) and &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; (2007), with &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot; scheduled for 2025. In 2009, an enhanced version of &quot;Metroid&quot; &quot;Prime&quot; was released for the Wii in Japan and as part of the &quot;Metroid Prime: Trilogy&quot; compilation internationally. A remastered version was released on the Nintendo Switch in 2023.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; is an action-adventure game in which players control protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, unlike previous games in the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, with third-person elements used for Morph Ball mode. The gameplay involves solving puzzles to reveal secrets, platform jumping, and shooting foes with the help of a &quot;lock-on&quot; mechanism that allows circle strafing while staying aimed at the enemy.

Samus must travel through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open the path to the Phazon meteor impact crater, while collecting power-ups that let her reach new areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus&#x27; armor against high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some items are obtained after boss fights. Items must be collected in a specific order; for example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Players are incentivized to explore to find upgrades that increase Samus&#x27; maximum ammunition and health.

The heads-up display, which simulates the inside of Samus&#x27; helmet, features a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. The game introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game.

Players can gain two features by connecting &quot;Prime&quot; with &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; using a GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable: cosmetic use of the Fusion Suit that Samus wears in &quot;Fusion&quot; and the ability to play the original &quot;Metroid&quot; game.

=== Items ===
Throughout the game, players must find and collect items that improve Samus&#x27; arsenal and suit, including weapons, armor upgrades for Samus&#x27; Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress herself into a ball in order to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple nodes, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that allows her to climb magnetic rails.

Items from previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games appear with altered functions. Art galleries and different endings are unlockable if the player collects a high percentage of items and Scan Visor logs. &quot;Prime&quot; is one of the first &quot;Metroid&quot; games to address the reason Samus does not start with power-ups acquired in previous games; she begins the game with some upgrades, including the Varia Suit, Missiles and Grapple Beam, but they are lost during an explosion on the Space Pirate frigate &quot;Orpheon&quot;. The producers stated that starting with some power-ups was a way to give the player &quot;different things to do&quot; and to learn the functions of these items before settling into the core gameplay.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
Retro Studios wrote an extensive storyline for &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, which was considered a major difference from previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games. Short cutscenes appear before important battles, and a scanner in the heads-up display extracts backstory-related information from objects. The &quot;Prime&quot; trilogy is set between the events of &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Metroid II&quot;.

The game takes place on the planet Tallon IV, formerly inhabited by the Chozo race. Five decades ago, the Chozo race fell after a meteor impacted on Tallon IV. The meteor contaminated the planet with a corruptive, mutagenic substance that the Space Pirates later named Phazon, and also brought with it a creature known to the Chozo as &quot;The Worm&quot;. A large containment field emitter of the Artifact Temple in the Tallon Overworld area was built as a seal to the meteor&#x27;s energies and influence within the crater where it landed, which the Space Pirates attempt to disable or bypass in order to gain better access to extract the Phazon. The containment field is controlled by twelve Chozo artifacts that are scattered around the planet.

=== Story ===
Samus Aran intercepts a distress signal from the Space Pirate frigate &quot;Orpheon&quot;, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates&#x27; own genetically modified, experimental subjects, using a mysterious radioactive substance called Phazon. At the ship&#x27;s core, she battles with the Parasite Queen, a giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship&#x27;s reactor core, initiating the destruction of the ship. While Samus is escaping from the frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta Ridley, who also escapes. During her escape, an explosion damages Samus&#x27; suit, causing some of her abilities to malfunction. Samus escapes the frigate and chases Ridley in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.

After landing in the Tallon Overworld, Samus explores nearby areas of Tallon IV and discovers ruins of an ancient Chozo settlement. As she explores the ruins, she learns that the Chozo on the planet had been killed off by the Phazon infesting the planet, which originated from a meteor that impacted on the planet many years ago. After regaining her lost abilities in the ruins, as well as defeating a mutated plant creature that was poisoning the local water supply, Samus finds her way to the Magmoor Caverns, a series of magma-filled tunnels, which are used by the Space Pirates as a source of geothermal power. Following the tunnels, Samus travels to the Phendrana Drifts, a cold, mountainous region which is home to another ancient Chozo ruin and a Space Pirate research laboratory used to study the Metroids. After obtaining new abilities, Samus explores the wreckage of the crashed &quot;Orpheon&quot; and then infiltrates the Phazon Mines, where she learns the outcome of the Phazon experimentation project, including the Metroid Prime, a creature that had come to Tallon IV with the meteor. Advancing deeper into the mines, Samus fights her way through the Phazon-enhanced Space Pirates and obtains the Phazon Suit after defeating the monstrous Omega Pirate.

At some point, Samus discovers the Artifact Temple that the Chozo built to contain the Metroid Prime and to stop the Phazon from spreading over the planet. To gain access to the meteor&#x27;s Impact Crater, Samus must collect and unite the twelve Chozo artifacts. As Samus returns to the temple with the artifacts, Meta Ridley appears and attacks her. Samus defeats Ridley and enters the Impact Crater, where she finds the Metroid Prime. After she defeats it, the Metroid Prime absorbs Samus&#x27; Phazon Suit and explodes. Samus escapes the collapsing crater and leaves Tallon IV in her ship.

If the player completes the game with all of the items obtained, Metroid Prime reconstructs itself into a body resembling Samus.

== Development ==

According to producer Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo did not develop a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the Nintendo 64 as the company &quot;couldn&#x27;t come out with any concrete ideas&quot;. &quot;Metroid&quot; co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the Nintendo 64 controller could be used to control Samus. Nintendo approached another company to make &quot;Metroid&quot; for Nintendo 64, but the offer was declined, supposedly because the developers thought they could not equal &quot;Super Metroid&quot;.

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was a collaboration between Nintendo EAD and R&amp;D1 and the American company Retro Studios. Retro was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new &quot;Metroid&quot; game after seeing their prototype first-person shooter engine. In 2000 and early 2001, four games in development at Retro were canceled, including an RPG, &quot;Raven Blade&quot;, leaving &quot;Prime&quot; the only game in development. During the last nine months of development, Retro&#x27;s staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach Nintendo&#x27;s deadline. According to senior artist James Dargie, it took them almost six months to do the first level that Nintendo approved, and then they had less than a year to do the rest of the game. Concept artist Android Jones, a lifelong fan of the series whose work included Samus&#x27;s Varia Suit and most of the art in the Scan Visor, would sleep in the office and resume working when he woke up.

Nintendo created the music, Retro handled art and engineering, and both teams worked on the overall design. The Japanese crew, which included producers Miyamoto, Kensuke Tanabe, Kenji Miki, and designer and &quot;Metroid&quot; co-creator Sakamoto, communicated with Retro through e-mails, telephone conferences and personal gatherings. The game was planned to use a third-person perspective, but after Miyamoto intervened this was changed to first-person perspective and almost everything already developed was scrapped. The change was prompted by camera problems experienced by Rare, which was developing the Nintendo 64 game &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot;. According to director Mark Pacini, Miyamoto believed that &quot;shooting in third person was not very intuitive&quot;; Pacini also said that exploration is easier using first-person. Pacini said that after picking that perspective, the crew decided not to make a traditional first-person shooter, instead they had to break down the stereotypes of what a first-person game is and make a fun &quot;Metroid&quot; game.

Pacini said that Retro tried to design the game so that the only difficult parts would be boss battles and players would not be afraid to explore because &quot;the challenge of the game was finding your way around&quot;. Senior designer Mike Wikan said that the focus on exploration led the team to spend time making the platform jumping &quot;approachable to the player&quot;, and to ensure the gameplay had &quot;shooting [as] a very important, though secondary, consideration&quot;. Retro developed the storyline under the supervision of Yoshio Sakamoto, who verified that the ideas were consistent with the earlier games. The developers intended that Kraid, a boss from &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, would appear in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and designer Gene Kohler modeled and skinned him for that purpose, but he was cut for time reasons. The team considered implementing the Speed Booster power-up from &quot;Super Metroid&quot; but concluded it would not work well because of the first-person perspective and the limitations imposed by the scale of game&#x27;s environment.

The first public appearance of the game was a ten-second video at Space World 2000. In November of the same year, Retro Studios confirmed its involvement with the game in the &quot;job application&quot; part of its website. In February 2001, the game was confirmed by Nintendo, which also announced that because of its emphasis on exploration and despite the first-person perspective, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; would be a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. The game was showcased at E3 2001 in May, with its title confirmed as &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;.

=== Audio ===
Kenji Yamamoto, assisted by Kouichi Kyuma, composed the music for &quot;Prime&quot;. The soundtrack contains arrangements of tracks from previous games in the series because Yamamoto wanted to satisfy old &quot;Metroid&quot; fans. The initial Tallon Overworld theme is a reinterpretation of &quot;Metroid&quot;″s Brinstar theme, the music heard in Magmoor Caverns is a new version of the music from &quot;Super Metroid&quot;″s Lower Norfair area, and the music heard during the fight with Meta Ridley is a fast-paced reimagining of the Ridley boss music first featured in &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, which has reappeared in most &quot;Metroid&quot; games since. Early in development, the English electronic duo Autechre were asked by Retro Studios to compose the soundtrack, but this was halted by Nintendo. Tommy Tallarico Studios initially provided sound effects, but Miyamoto deemed them not good enough for an extended presentation at Space World 2001. The game supports Dolby Pro Logic II setups and can be played in surround sound. A soundtrack album, &quot;Metroid Prime &amp; Fusion Original Soundtracks&quot;, was published by Scitron on June 18, 2003.

==Release==
&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was released for the GameCube in North America on November 18, 2002. In 2003, the game arrived in Japan on February 28, and Europe on March 21. In 2004, Nintendo released a &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; GameCube bundle, including a second disc featuring a trailer and a demo for &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, a timeline of &quot;Metroid&quot; games, and an art gallery.

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was re-released in Japan in 2009 for the Wii as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series. It has improved controls that use the Wii Remote&#x27;s pointing functionality, bonus content and the ability to take screenshots of gameplay. In other countries, this version was released in the Wii compilation &quot;Metroid Prime: Trilogy&quot;. The compilation became available for download from the Wii U&#x27;s Nintendo eShop in January 2015.

=== &quot;Metroid Prime Remastered&quot; ===
Metroid Prime Remastered, a high-definition remaster for the Nintendo Switch, was released digitally on February 9, 2023, with a physical release on February 22 in North America and March 3 in Europe and Japan. The remaster was developed by Retro Studios with assistance from developers including Iron Galaxy Studios. It features new visuals, updated control schemes (including an option for dual-stick controls) and unlockable art.

&quot;Metroid Prime Remastered&quot; was acclaimed. Samuel Claiborn of &quot;IGN&quot; described it as &quot;a perfect example of how to both honor a lauded classic and bring it up to code&quot;. It was criticized for not crediting the developers of previous versions of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; by name, instead crediting them as &quot;original Nintendo GameCube and Wii version development staff&quot;. As of March 2023, &quot;Metroid Prime Remastered&quot; had sold 1.09 million copies.

== Reception ==
&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; became one of the best-selling games on the GameCube. It was the second-best-selling game of November 2002 in North America, behind &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;; 250,000 units were sold in the first week of its release. As of July 2006, the game had sold more than 1.49 million copies in the U.S. alone, and had earned more than . It was also the eighth-bestselling GameCube game in Australia. More than 78,000 copies were sold in Japan, and Nintendo added the game to its Player&#x27;s Choice line in the PAL region. It sold 2.84 million copies worldwide and was the best-selling &quot;Metroid&quot; game until &quot;Metroid Dread&quot; (2021).

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to Metacritic. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awarded it a perfect score. It won numerous Game of the Year awards and was praised for its detailed graphics, special effects, varied environments, moody soundtrack and sound effects, level design, immersive atmosphere and innovative gameplay centered on exploration in contrast with action games such as &quot;&quot;, while staying faithful to the &quot;Metroid&quot; formula. Criticisms included the unusual control scheme, lack of focus on the story, and repetitive backtracking. &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered the control scheme awkward, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the game to a &quot;1990s arcade game, filled with over the top battle sequences, spectacular visual effectsand a pretty weak plot&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; wrote that inexperienced players &quot;might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over&quot;. In 2004, the video game countdown show &quot;Filter&quot; said &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; had the best graphics of all time.

During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; with &quot;Console First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, and outstanding achievement in &quot;Art Direction&quot;, &quot;Game Design&quot;, &quot;Gameplay Engineering&quot;, &quot;Original Music Composition&quot;, &quot;Sound Design&quot;, and &quot;Visual Engineering&quot;. It was the most nominated game at the awards ceremony.

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; appeared on several lists of best games; it was ranked 23rd in &quot;IGN&quot;″s Top 100, 29th in a 100-game list chosen by GameFAQs users, 18th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 2009 list of greatest Nintendo games and 10th in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; the best GameCube game, while &quot;GameSpy&quot; ranked it third in a similar list, behind &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also ranked &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; as the sixth-best game of the 2000s. &quot;Wired&quot; ranked the game 10th in its list of &quot;The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade&quot; for popularizing &quot;exploration, puzzle-solving, platforming and story&quot; among first-person shooters, saying that the game was &quot;breaking the genre free from the clutches of &quot;Doom&quot;&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot;″s writer continued that &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; took a massive stride forward for first-person games. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; also became popular among players for speedrunning; specialized communities were formed to share these speed runs.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was followed by &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; (2004) on the GameCube and &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; (2007) on the Wii. The first two games were re-released on Wii as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series in Japan, and as part of the Wii compilation &quot;Metroid Prime: Trilogy&quot; (2009). A pinball game, &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot; (2005), and the action spin-offs &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; (2006) were released for the handheld Nintendo DS console, and &quot;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&quot; (2016) for the Nintendo 3DS. &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot; is planned for release in 2025 for the Nintendo Switch.

Characters and stages from &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; have frequently appeared in other Nintendo games such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros&quot; series, in which the Frigate Orpheon is a playable stage, with the Parasite Queen in the background and music from &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;″s gameplay and HUD have influenced other first-person shooters such as &quot;Geist&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Republic Commando&quot;. 

===Unofficial versions===
A branch of the Dolphin emulator entitled &quot;Primehack&quot; was released unofficially in 2019. &quot;Primehack&quot; modifies the game, adding new high resolution textures, 4K and 60fps support, improved lighting and keyboard and mouse controls. The project was brought to Steam Deck in 2022 via Emudeck.

A demo of a 2D fangame version of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was released in April 2021. The development was forced to end via a cease and desist from Nintendo by that August.

<doc id="292741" wikidata="Q1126258" url="?curid=292741" title="Stanley Park">
<text>Stanley Park is a public park in British Columbia, Canada, that makes up the northwestern half of Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown peninsula, surrounded by waters of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The park borders the neighbourhoods of West End and Coal Harbour to its southeast, and is connected to the North Shore via the Lions Gate Bridge. The historic lighthouse on Brockton Point marks the park&#x27;s easternmost point. While it is not the largest urban park, Stanley Park is about one-fifth larger than New York City&#x27;s Central Park and almost half the size of London&#x27;s Richmond Park.

Stanley Park has a long history. The land was originally used by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years before British Columbia was colonized by the British during the 1858 Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and was one of the first areas to be explored in the city. For many years after colonization, the future park, with its abundant resources, would also be home to non-Indigenous settlers. The land was later turned into Vancouver&#x27;s first park when the city incorporated in 1886. It was named after Lord Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, a British politician who had recently been appointed Governor General of Canada. It was originally known as Coal Peninsula and was set aside for military fortifications to guard the entrance to Vancouver harbour. In 1886, Vancouver City Council successfully sought a lease of the park which was granted for $1 per year. In September 1888, Lord Stanley opened the park in his name.

Unlike other large urban parks, Stanley Park is not the creation of a landscape architect but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years. Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then-superintendent W.S. Rawlings. Additional attractions, such as a polar bear exhibit, aquarium, and a miniature train, were added in the post–World War II period.

Much of the park remains as densely forested as it was in the late 1800s, with about a half million trees, some of which stand as tall as and are hundreds of years old. Thousands of trees were lost (and many replanted) after three major windstorms that took place in the past 100 years, the last in 2006.

Significant effort was put into constructing the near-century-old Vancouver Seawall, which can draw thousands of people to the park in the summer. The park also features forest trails, beaches, lakes, children&#x27;s play areas, and the Vancouver Aquarium, among many other attractions. On June 18, 2014, Stanley Park was named &quot;top park in the entire world&quot; by Tripadvisor, based on reviews submitted.

==History==
=== Coast Salish land ===
Archaeological evidence suggests a human presence in the park dating back more than 3,000 years. The area is the traditional territory of multiple coastal Indigenous peoples. From the Burrard Inlet and Howe Sound regions, Squamish Nation had a large village in the park. From the lower Fraser River area, Musqueam Nation used its natural resources.

Where Lumberman&#x27;s Arch is now, there once was a large village called Whoi Whoi, or Xwayxway, roughly meaning &quot;place of masks&quot;. One longhouse, built from cedar poles and slabs, was measured at long by wide. These houses were occupied by large extended families living in different quadrants of the house. The larger houses were used for ceremonial potlatches where a host would invite guests to witness and participate in ceremonies and the giving away of property.

Another settlement was further west along the same shore. This place was called Chaythoos, meaning &quot;high bank&quot;. The site of Chaythoos is noted on a brass plaque placed on the lowlands east of Prospect Point commemorating the park&#x27;s centennial.

Both sites were occupied in 1888, when some residents were forcefully removed to allow a road to be constructed around the park, and their midden was used for construction material.

The popular landmark Siwash Rock, located near present-day Third Beach, was once called Slahkayulsh, meaning &quot;he is standing up&quot;. In the oral history, a fisherman was transformed into this rock by three powerful brothers as punishment for his immorality.

In 2010, the chief of the Squamish Nation proposed renaming Stanley Park as Xwayxway Park after the large village once located in the area.

===European exploration===
The first European explorations of the peninsula were made by expeditions commanded by Spanish captain José María Narváez (1791) and British captain George Vancouver (1792).

In &quot;A Voyage of Discovery&quot;, Vancouver describes the area as &quot;an island ... with a smaller island Deadman&#x27;s Island (the correct name being Deadman Island) lying before it&quot;, suggesting that it was originally surrounded by water, at least at high tide.

Vancouver also wrote about meeting the people living there:

According to historians, the Indigenous peoples probably first saw Vancouver&#x27;s ship from Chaythoos, a location in the future park that in today&#x27;s terms lay just east of the Lions Gate Bridge (or First Narrows Bridge as it is sometimes called). Speaking about this event later in a conversation with archivist Major Matthews, Andy Paull, whose family lived in the area, confirms the account given by Vancouver:
No significant contact with inhabitants in the area was recorded for decades, until around the time of the Crimean War (1853–1856). British admirals arranged with Chief Joe Capilano that if there were an invasion, the British would defend the south shore of Burrard Inlet and the Squamish would defend the north. The British gave him and his men 60 muskets. Although the attack anticipated by the British never came, the guns were used by the Squamish to repel an attack by an indigenous raid from the Euclataws. Stanley Park was not attacked, but this was when it started to be thought of as a strategic military position.

===Early uses of park land===
The peninsula was a popular place for gathering traditional food and materials in the 1800s, but it started to see even more activity after the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858, going through a succession of uses when non-Indigenous settlers moved into the area.

The shallow waters around the First Narrows and Coal Harbour were popular fishing spots for clams, salmon, and other fish. August Jack Khatsahlano, a celebrated dual chief of the Squamish and Musqueam who once lived at Chaythoos, remembered how he used to fish-rake in Coal Harbour and catch many herrings. They would also hunt grouse, ducks, and deer on the peninsula.

Second Beach was a source of &quot;clay ... which, when rolled into loaves, as (my people) did it, and heated or roasted before a fire, turned into a white like chalk&quot; that was used to make wool blankets.

Indigenous inhabitants also cut down large cedar trees in the area for a variety of traditional purposes, such as making dugout canoes.
By 1860, non-Indigenous settlers (Portuguese, Scots, and others) had started building homes on the peninsula, first at Brockton Point and later on Deadman Island. &quot;Portuguese Joe&quot; Silvey was the first European to settle in the future park. A Chinese settlement also grew in a cleared area at Anderson Point (near the present day Vancouver Rowing Club).

The peninsula was surveyed and made a military reserve in an 1863 survey completed by the Royal Engineers. Despite the houses and cabins on the land, it was again considered a strategic point in case Americans attempted an invasion and launched an attack on New Westminster (then the colonial capital) via Burrard Inlet.
In 1865, Edward Stamp decided that Brockton Point would be an ideal site for a lumber mill. He cleared close to with the permission of colonial officials, but the site proved too impractical and he moved his operation east, eventually becoming Hastings Mill. The land cleared by Stamp later became the Brockton sports fields.

The future park was selectively logged by six different companies between the 1860s and 1880s, but its military status saved the land from further development. Most of today&#x27;s trails in Stanley Park got their start as old skid roads.

Near the end of the 1800s, the city&#x27;s principal reservoir was built in the area south of Prospect Point that is now a playing field and picnic area. Despite the reservoir&#x27;s demolition in 1948, there is still a Reservoir Trail at that location.

From the 1860s to 1880s, settlers in Burrard Inlet used Brockton Point, Anderson Point, and nearby Deadman Island as burial grounds. This practice stopped when the Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1887. Deadman Island had already had a long history as a burial site. In 1865, unsuspecting newcomer John Morton found old cedar boxes in the trees. They turned out to be coffins that had been placed there to keep the remains of important Indigenous persons out of reach of wild animals.

===Leasing the land===

In 1886, as its first order of business, Vancouver City Council voted to petition the British government to lease the military reserve for use as a park. To manage their new acquisition, city council appointed a six-person park committee, which in 1890 was replaced with an elected body, the Vancouver Park Board.

In 1908, 20 years after the first lease, the federal government renewed the lease for 99 more years.

In 2006, a letter from Parks Canada stated that &quot;the Stanley Park lease is perpetually renewable and no action is required by the Park Board in relation to the renewal&quot;.

===Opening and dedication===

On September 27, 1888, the park was officially opened (although the legal status of Deadman Island as part of the park would remain ambiguous for many years). The park was named after Lord Stanley, who had recently become Canada&#x27;s sixth governor general. Mayor David Oppenheimer gave a formal speech opening the park to the public and delivering authority for its management to the park committee.

The following year, Lord Stanley became the first governor general to visit Vancouver when he officially dedicated the park. Mayor Oppenheimer led a procession of vehicles around Brockton Point along the newly completed Park Road to the clearing at Prospect Point. An observer at the event wrote:

===Eviction of pre-park residents===

When Lord Stanley made his declaration, there were still a number of homes on lands he had claimed for the park. Some, who had built their homes less than twenty years earlier, would continue to live on the land for years. Most were evicted by the park board in 1931, but the last resident, Tim Cummings, lived at Brockton Point until his death in 1958.

Sarah Avison, the daughter of the first park ranger, recalled when the city evicted the Chinese settlers at Anderson Point in 1889:
Most of the dwellings at Xwayxway were reported vacant by 1899, and in 1900, two of such houses were purchased by the park board for $25 each and burned. One Squamish family, &quot;Howe Sound Jack&quot; and Sexwalia &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; Kulkalem, continued to live at Xwayxway until Sally died in 1923. Sally&#x27;s ownership of the property surrounding her home was accepted by authorities in the 1920s, and following her death, the property was purchased from her heir, Mariah Kulkalem, for $15,500 and resold to the federal government.

Although most residents of the area were evicted by the early 20th century, the municipal government still owns a number of field homes used by the park&#x27;s &quot;live-in caretakers&quot;. Caretakers that occupy the field homes are not charged rent by the city, although they are required to assist in park operations and provide a permanent presence for the park board. In 2006, the City of Vancouver decided it would no longer replace live-in caretakers who retired or moved out from the field homes, with the city opting to convert several unoccupied field homes into artist studios.

===Construction of Lost Lagoon and causeway===

From 1913 to 1916, a lake was constructed in a shallow part of Coal Harbour, a project that was not without its detractors. The lake was named Lost Lagoon due to its history of &quot;disappearing&quot; at low tide. The lake and a causeway into the park were designed by Thomas Mawson, who also designed a lighthouse for Brockton Point around the same time. Before the causeway, a wooden footbridge provided the only access route into the park from Coal Harbour. Construction of the causeway (and new roads within the park for emergency access) was completed by 1926.

In 1923, the saltwater pipes entering the lake from Coal Harbour were shut off, turning it into a freshwater lake. A lit fountain was later erected to commemorate the city&#x27;s golden jubilee. The fountain, installed in 1936, was purchased from Chicago, a leftover from its world&#x27;s fair in 1933.

The causeway was widened and extended through the centre of the park in the 1930s with the construction of the Lions Gate Bridge, which connects downtown Vancouver to the North Shore. At the same time, two pedestrian subways were added under the causeway at the entrance to the park from Georgia Street.

By the 1950s, visitors could take rented rowboats on Lost Lagoon, but boating and other activities were banned in 1973 as the lake became a bird sanctuary. By 1995, the old boathouse had been turned into the Lost Lagoon Nature House. It is operated by the Stanley Park Ecology Society, which is a nonprofit organization that works alongside of the Vancouver Park Board to promote stewardship and conservation in Stanley Park.


===Seawall===
Construction of the seawall and walkway around the park began in 1917 and took several decades to complete. The original idea for the seawall is attributed to park board superintendent W. S. Rawlings, who conveyed his vision in 1918: 

James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Cunningham, a master mason, dedicated 32 years of his life to the construction of the seawall from 1931 until his retirement in 1963. Cunningham continued to return to monitor the wall&#x27;s progress until his death at 85.

The walkway was extended several times and, as of 2023, is from end to end, making it the world&#x27;s longest uninterrupted waterfront walkway. The Stanley Park portion is just under half of the entire length, which starts at Canada Place in the downtown core, runs around Stanley Park, along English Bay, around False Creek, and finally to Kitsilano Beach. From there, a trail continues to the west, connecting to an additional of beaches and pathways that terminate at the mouth of the Fraser River.

===Swimming pools===

By 1933, there were two seaside, saltwater pools in the park, one at Second Beach and one at Lumberman&#x27;s Arch. These &quot;draw and fill&quot; pools used sun-warmed water from the ocean. Once a week, the pool gates were opened at low tide to release the water back into the ocean, before the next high tide of clean water.

For many years, children could take swimming lessons for free at Lumberman&#x27;s Arch under the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;&#x27;s Learn to Swim program. The pool was filled in after developing persistent problems and replaced with the current water spray park in 1987. The spray park, the largest of its kind in Vancouver, consists of a series of water geysers, showers, and cannons.

In 1995, after more than 60 years of operation, the Second Beach pool was shut down because it failed to meet new health standards. By 1996, it had been replaced with the current heated pool.

At both locations, remnants of the old pool&#x27;s semicircle shaped outer wall can still be seen.

===In wartime===
:&quot;See List of World War II-era fortifications on the British Columbia Coast
In World War I, a gun battery (without a bunker) was placed at Siwash Point (above Siwash Rock) to protect the city from possible attacks from German merchant raiders. It was removed just prior to the end of the war in 1918.

In 1936, when the Empire of Japan began large-scale military repression in northeast China, the perceived Japanese threat resulted in fortifications being erected in Stanley Park, among other areas. In Stanley Park, a watch tower was built on the cliff directly above Siwash Rock and remains intact as an observation deck that is accessed from the trails above.

By 1940, a gun battery and bunker had been built at Ferguson Point, just east of Third Beach. The military also expanded its use of the park by closing the area around Ferguson Point and Third Beach, where it had established barracks for the battery detachment and was providing training. What is now the Teahouse Restaurant was originally built as an officers&#x27; mess. The bunker was buried and battery removed around the end of the war.

The army built several other coastal defence forts for the Second World War, as shown in the illustration at right, most notably at Tower Beach in Point Grey. In addition, an examination area was set up where any ships requesting entrance to the harbour had to stop and submit to an inspection.

===Zoo and Children&#x27;s Farmyard===

From the very beginning, the park kept and exhibited animals after the first park ranger, Henry Avison, captured an orphaned black bear cub and chained it to a stump for safety in 1888. By 1905, several animals had been donated: a monkey, a large seal, four grass parakeets, a raccoon, a canary, and a black bear. Avison was subsequently named city pound keeper, and his collection of animals formed the basis for the original zoo, which eventually housed over 50 animals, including snakes, wolves, emus, bison, kangaroos, monkeys, and Humboldt penguins.

By the 1970s, the zoowith its new polar bear exhibit, built in 1962had become the park&#x27;s main attraction. Today the only remnant of the old zoo is a large concrete grotto where the polar bears had entertained crowds for many years until the 1990s. In 1994, when plans were developed to upgrade the zoo, Vancouver voters instead decided to phase it out when the question was posed in a referendum. The zoo was shut down in 1996 and the animals were either moved to the petting zoo area, the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove, or to other facilities.

The Stanley Park Zoo closed completely in December 1997 after the last remaining animal, a polar bear named Tuk, died at age 36. He had remained after the other animals had left because of his old age. The polar bear grotto, often criticized by animal rights activists, was to be converted into a demonstration salmon spawning hatchery.

The Stanley Park Children&#x27;s Farmyard (petting zoo) opened in 1982. It was a successor to the original children&#x27;s zoo that started in 1950. Domestic animals and a few reptiles and birds were kept in the Children&#x27;s Farmyard until it closed in 2011.

===Aquarium===

The aquarium opened in 1956 after complicated negotiations, followed by a massive expansion in 1967. It was the first facility in the world to study a killer whale (1964), its researchers discovered a new species of shrimp in the Gulf Islands (1997), and it became the first aquarium to ensure that it would never result in the capture of a wild whale or dolphin (1996). The popular children&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Beluga&quot; was inspired by one of the whales at the facility.

In 2006, the park board approved an $80-million expansion of the facility following considerable public debate, including vocal opposition regarding animal rights and the loss of park trees required by the expansion.

===1960s counterculture===
By the 1960s, the neighbourhood around Stanley Park was similar to present day Commercial Drive, attracting many of the city&#x27;s beatniks and flower children. This made Stanley Park the perfect place for &quot;be-in&quot;s, a type of counterculture event inspired by the Human Be-In started in San Francisco. The Stanley Park event started on Easter weekend in 1967 and took place each spring until the mid-1970s, when most of the counterculture movement had fizzled out. At its peak, thousands would assemble at Ceperley Meadows near Second Beach to listen to bands, speakers, and poets, and socialize.

===Storms and loss of landmark trees===
Violent windstorms have struck Stanley Park and felled many of its trees numerous times in the past. Between 1900 and 1960, nineteen separate windstorms swept through the park, causing significant damage to the forest cover. The park lost some of its oldest trees through major storms twice in the last century and then again in 2006. The first was a combination of an October windstorm in 1934 and a subsequent snowstorm the following January that felled thousands of trees, primarily between Beaver Lake and Prospect Point.

Another storm in October 1962, the remnants of Typhoon Freda, cleared a virgin tract behind the children&#x27;s zoo, which opened an area for a new miniature railway that replaced a smaller version built in the 1940s. In total, approximately 3,000 trees were lost in that storm.

One stand of tall trees in the centre of the park did not survive beyond the 1960s after becoming a popular tourist attraction. The “Seven Sisters” are memorialized by a plaque and young replacement trees in the same location along Lovers Walk, a forest trail that connects Beaver Lake with Second Beach. &quot;They were so popular that people basically killed them by walking on their roots&quot;, said historian John Atkin.

The death of the distinctive fir tree atop Siwash Rock has also been memorialized with a replacement. The original died in the dry summer of 1965, and through the persistent efforts of park staff, a replacement finally took root in 1968.

Another major windstorm ravaged the park on December 15, 2006, with winds (Hanukkah Eve windstorm). Over 60 percent of the western edge was damaged; the worst part was the area around Prospect Point. In total, about 40 percent of the forest was affected, with an estimated 10,000 trees downed. Large sections of the seawall were also destabilized by the storm, and many areas of the park were closed to the public pending restoration. The cost of restoration was estimated at $9million, which was covered by contributions from all three levels of government and private and corporate donations.

Two landmark trees were affected. One tree that has achieved a lot of fame is the &quot;National Geographic&quot; Tree, so named because it appeared in the magazine&#x27;s October 1978 issue. With a circumference of , it was once one of the more impressive big western red cedars of the park. It diminished over time, ravaged by storms, a lightning strike, and topped by park staff to a height of before being uprooted in October 2007.

The Hollow Tree was probably the most photographed park element in bygone years, an obligatory stop for locals, tourists and dignitaries alike; a professional photographer was on hand to capture the visit for a fee. The tree was saved from road widening in 1910 through the lobbying efforts of the photographer who made his living at the tree. Automobiles and horse-drawn carriages would frequently be backed into the hollow, demonstrating the immensity of the tree for posterity. While the remaining 700- to 800-year-old stump still draws viewers and is commemorated with a plaque, it is no longer alive and has shrunk considerably over the years, from a circumference of many decades ago, to a more recent . Damaged by the December 2006 windstorm and leaning forward at a dangerous angle, on March 31, 2008, the tree was selected by the Vancouver Park Board for removal due to potential safety hazards. However, on January 19, 2009, the board accepted a proposal to save the tree by realigning and stabilizing it at a cost of $250,000, funded entirely by private donations.

=== National Historic Site designation ===
The park was designated a National Historic Site of Canada by the federal government in 1988. It was deemed significant because the relationship between its &quot;natural environmental and its cultural elements developed over time&quot; and because &quot;it epitomizes the large urban park in Canada&quot;.

==21st century==
The forest continues to give the park a more natural character than most other urban parks, leading many to call it an urban oasis. It consists primarily of second and third growth and contains many tall Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce trees. Since 1992, the tallest trees have been topped and pruned by park staff for safety reasons.

A large variety of animals live in the park. There are 200 bird species alone, including many water birds. A large great blue heron colony moved into the park in 2001 and has grown to now about 170 active nests. Mammals include a large raccoon population, coyotes, skunks, beavers, rabbits descended from discarded pets, and a thriving grey squirrel population (descended from eight pairs acquired from New York&#x27;s Central Park in 1909). However, there is a complete absence of large mammals, including deer, elk, bear, wolves, cougars, and bobcats.

There have been occasional attacks by coyotes on humans in the park, but in the nine months from December 2020, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there was a major increase in frequency: forty attacks by the estimated twelve coyotes in the park, none fatal, took place, four times more than all the attacks in the previous thirty years. No explanation had been found , not even whether the attacks were by one coyote or different animals. Several coyotes were killed, but the frequency of attacks did not decrease.

Stanley Park also has many manmade attractions. Recreational facilities are especially abundant in the park, having long coexisted, albeit uneasily, with the aesthetic and more natural park features preferred by those looking to the park as an enclave of nature in the city.

===Recognition===

Stanley Park was named the best park in the world in 2013, according to website Tripadvisor&#x27;s first ever Travellers&#x27; Choice Awards. Central Park in New York took second place and Colorado&#x27;s Garden of the Gods took third place.

===Attractions===
The Vancouver Seawall is popular for walking, running, cycling, inline skating, and even fishing (with a licence). There are two paths, one for skaters and cyclists and the other for pedestrians. The lane for cyclists and skaters goes one-way in a counterclockwise loop. Walking the entire loop around Stanley Park takes about two hours, while biking it takes about one hour.

There are also more than of forest trails inside the park. Forest trails are patrolled by members of the Vancouver Police Department on horseback. The police department mounted unit&#x27;s youth outreach includes offering guided tours of the stables and the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Trading Card Program&quot;, which encourages children of all ages to approach a constable on horseback and request a card.
The narrow-gauge Stanley Park Railway, a ridable miniature railway with different seasonal themes, is a Vancouver tradition, especially for families with young children. The original railway, started in 1947, featured a child-sized train. The current adult-sized railroad opened in 1964 in an area leveled by Typhoon Freda. The engine is a replica of Canadian Pacific 374, the first transcontinental passenger train to arrive in Vancouver in the 1880s.

The 2006 windstorm revealed traces of a long-forgotten rock garden, which had once been one of the park&#x27;s star attractions and one of its largest man-made objects by area. Soon after its discovery, a section that encircles part of the Stanley Park Pavilion was restored (the garden had originally extended from Pipeline Road to Coal Harbour).
Beaver Lake is a restful space nestled among the trees. The lake is almost completely covered with water lilies (introduced for the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee in 1938) and home to beavers, fish, and water birds. As of 1997, its surface area was just short of , but the lake is slowly shrinking in size. One of Vancouver&#x27;s few remaining free-flowing streams, Beaver Creek, joins Beaver Lake to the Pacific Ocean and is one of two streams in Vancouver where salmon still return to spawn each year.
Lost Lagoon, the captive freshwater lake near the Georgia Street entrance to the park, is a nesting ground to many bird species, such as Canada geese and ducks.

The Vancouver Aquarium is the largest in Canada and houses a collection of marine life that includes sea lions, harbour seals, and sea otters. In total, there are approximately 300 species of fish, 30,000 invertebrates, 56 species of amphibians and reptiles, and around 60 mammals and birds. The aquarium is also home to a 4D theatre.

The oldest manmade landmark in the park is an 1816 naval cannon located near Brockton Point. The 9 O&#x27;Clock Gun, as it is known today, was fired for the first time in 1898, a tradition that has continued for more than 100 years. The cannon was originally detonated with a stick of dynamite but is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger.

Stanley Park also has playgrounds, sandy beaches, gardens, tennis courts, an 18-hole pitch and putt golf course, a seaside swimming pool, a water spray park, and Brockton Oval, which is used for track sports, rugby, and cricket.

In summer, there is an outdoor theatre Malkin Bowl, which features events by Theatre Under The Stars and Live Nation (with their Concerts in the Park series).
===Monuments===
The park has a large number of monuments, including statues, plaques, and gardens. Among these are the Japanese Canadian War Memorial (a cenotaph and two rows of Japanese cherry &quot;Prunus Shirotae&quot; trees) and statues of poet Robert Burns, Olympic runner Harry Jerome, and &quot;Girl in a Wetsuit&quot;.

The park board has banned the erection of any further memorials to ensure that Stanley Park is kept in a more natural state (and based on the view that it is already saturated). As an exception to the ban, the park board agreed in 2006 to build a new playground at Ceperley Meadows near Second Beach honouring the victims of the Air India Flight 182 bombing. The federal government spent approximately $800,000 to build the memorial and playground.

===Great blue herons===
Stanley Park is home to one of the largest urban great blue heron colonies in North America, and the birds have been documented nesting in various locations in Stanley Park as far back as 1921. Great blue herons are classified as a species at risk in British Columbia, and the Stanley Park Ecology Society has been monitoring the heronry in Stanley Park since 2004. An estimated 156 young Pacific great blue herons fledged from the colony in 2013. Since monitoring started in 2007, the highest number of great blue herons fledged in a year were 258, in 2007. The lowest number of fledges was in 2011 with just 99 of the birds fledged.

<text>Indrema Corporation, also known as Indrema Entertainment Systems, was a consumer electronics company famous for the Indrema L600 Entertainment System, a game console intended for independent game developers.

Officially founded in 2000 by John Gildred, Indrema&#x27;s goal was to create a video game console based on common PC hardware and the Linux operating system. The console would have been the only open source console on the market, as well as the only modern console to allow free software to be written for it. An early developer unit was featured running &quot;Quake&quot; in the Indrema booth at LinuxWorld earlier in 2000.

The console was expected to be released by the holiday season of 2000, which was later delayed into Summer 2001 or later. Those subscribed to Indrema&#x27;s mailing list received a &quot;top ten&quot; list in the style of David Letterman in anticipation of the launch announcement, making fun of its competition.

After being unable to raise enough capital to mass-produce the console, Indrema shut down on April 6, 2001. In his last Indrema chat session, Gildred revealed that the company needed more than $10,000,000 in capital in order to continue and gave the following advice to the next video game startup: &quot;finish product before talking about it.&quot;

== L600 ==

The L600, also known as the Indrema Entertainment System, was to be a Linux-based game console/computer and was in the process of being developed by Indrema until they ceased operations in April 2001. Besides game play, it was also to be a CD player, DVD player, web browser, and TiVo-like video recorder. It also would have been an MP3 storage device.

Had the console been released, it would have cost US$299 and would have had 30 games available at launch. It would have had 64MB of system RAM and 96MB of total memory. Its storage was a 10GB hard drive (which could be upgraded to 50GB) and its games would be on DVD-9 discs and CD-R. It would have had HDTV support at resolutions up to 1080i. Indrema would have let regular end-users develop their games via their development kit, unlike other companies, which charge more than $10,000 USD for their kits. It would allow the user to upgrade their graphics processing unit via the &quot;GPU Slide Bay&quot;, and had an x86-based processor running at 600 MHz, which was later upgraded to a 750 MHz AMD Duron processor, and its GeForce 3 GPU would have been able to process 120-180 million polygons per second.

There was little hope for the L600, however, as its speculated release date of Summer 2001 or later was after the launch of Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, and very near or after the release of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube. The Dreamcast and GameCube had launched at considerably lower prices, and PlayStation 2 and Xbox at the same speculated US$299 despite having bigger budgets and less advanced hardware than the L600 was supposed to have, leading to doubts. It was just one of many independently developed systems that would be unable to take consumer attention and spending from more established, previously mentioned companies already in the market.

<text>The Ising model (or Lenz–Ising model), named after the physicists Ernst Ising and Wilhelm Lenz, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic &quot;spins&quot; that can be in one of two states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice (where the local structure repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. The model allows the identification of phase transitions as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.

The Ising model was invented by the physicist , who gave it as a problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional Ising model was solved by alone in his 1924 thesis; it has no phase transition. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is much harder and was only given an analytic description much later, by . It is usually solved by a transfer-matrix method, although there exists a very simple approach relating the model to a non-interacting fermionic quantum field theory.

In dimensions greater than four, the phase transition of the Ising model is described by mean-field theory. The Ising model for greater dimensions was also explored with respect to various tree topologies in the late 1970s, culminating in an exact solution of the zero-field, time-independent model for closed Cayley trees of arbitrary branching ratio, and thereby, arbitrarily large dimensionality within tree branches. The solution to this model exhibited a new, unusual phase transition behavior, along with non-vanishing long-range and nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations, deemed relevant to large neural networks as one of its possible .

The Ising problem without an external field can be equivalently formulated as a graph maximum cut (Max-Cut) problem that can be solved via combinatorial optimization.

==Definition==
Consider a set formula_1 of lattice sites, each with a set of adjacent sites (e.g. a graph) forming a formula_2-dimensional lattice. For each lattice site formula_3 there is a discrete variable formula_4 such that formula_5, representing the site&#x27;s spin. A &quot;spin configuration&quot;, formula_6 is an assignment of spin value to each lattice site.

For any two adjacent sites formula_7 there is an &quot;interaction&quot; formula_8. Also a site formula_9 has an &quot;external magnetic field&quot; formula_10 interacting with it. The &quot;energy&quot; of a configuration formula_11 is given by the Hamiltonian function

formula_12

where the first sum is over pairs of adjacent spins (every pair is counted once). The notation formula_13 indicates that sites formula_14 and formula_15 are nearest neighbors. The magnetic moment is given by formula_16. Note that the sign in the second term of the Hamiltonian above should actually be positive because the electron&#x27;s magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin, but the negative term is used conventionally. The &quot;configuration probability&quot; is given by the Boltzmann distribution with inverse temperature formula_17:

formula_18

where formula_19, and the normalization constant

formula_20

is the partition function. For a function formula_21 of the spins (&quot;observable&quot;), one denotes by

formula_22

the expectation (mean) value of formula_21.

The configuration probabilities formula_24 represent the probability that (in equilibrium) the system is in a state with configuration formula_25.

===Discussion===
The minus sign on each term of the Hamiltonian function formula_26 is conventional. Using this sign convention, Ising models can be classified according to the sign of the interaction: if, for a pair &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;

The system is called ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic if all interactions are ferromagnetic or all are antiferromagnetic. The original Ising models were ferromagnetic, and it is still often assumed that &quot;Ising model&quot; means a ferromagnetic Ising model.

In a ferromagnetic Ising model, spins desire to be aligned: the configurations in which adjacent spins are of the same sign have higher probability. In an antiferromagnetic model, adjacent spins tend to have opposite signs.

The sign convention of &quot;H&quot;(σ) also explains how a spin site &quot;j&quot; interacts with the external field. Namely, the spin site wants to line up with the external field. If:
===Simplifications===
Ising models are often examined without an external field interacting with the lattice, that is, &quot;h&quot; = 0 for all &quot;j&quot; in the lattice Λ. Using this simplification, the Hamiltonian becomes

formula_27

When the external field is zero everywhere, &quot;h&quot; = 0, the Ising model is symmetric under switching the value of the spin in all the lattice sites; a nonzero field breaks this symmetry.

Another common simplification is to assume that all of the nearest neighbors ⟨&quot;ij&quot;⟩ have the same interaction strength. Then we can set &quot;Jij&quot; = &quot;J&quot; for all pairs &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; in Λ. In this case the Hamiltonian is further simplified to

formula_28

===Connection to graph maximum cut===
A subset S of the vertex set V(G) of a weighted undirected graph G determines a cut of the graph G into S and its complementary subset G\S. The size of the cut is the sum of the weights of the edges between S and G\S. A maximum cut size is at least the size of any other cut, varying S.

For the Ising model without an external field on a graph G, the Hamiltonian becomes the following sum over the graph edges E(G)

formula_29.

Here each vertex i of the graph is a spin site that takes a spin value formula_30. A given spin configuration formula_25 partitions the set of vertices formula_32 into two formula_25-depended subsets, those with spin up formula_34 and those with spin down formula_35. We denote by formula_36 the formula_25-depended set of edges that connects the two complementary vertex subsets formula_34 and formula_35. The &quot;size&quot; formula_40 of the cut formula_36 to bipartite the weighted undirected graph G can be defined as

formula_42

where formula_43 denotes a weight of the edge formula_44 and the scaling 1/2 is introduced to compensate for double counting the same weights formula_45.

The identities

formula_46

where the total sum in the first term does not depend on formula_25, imply that minimizing formula_26 in formula_25 is equivalent to minimizing formula_50. Defining the edge weight formula_51 thus turns the Ising problem without an external field into a graph Max-Cut problem
 maximizing the cut size formula_40, which is related to the Ising Hamiltonian as follows,

formula_53

===Questions===
A significant number of statistical questions to ask about this model are in the limit of large numbers of spins:
* In a typical configuration, are most of the spins +1 or −1, or are they split equally?
* If a spin at any given position &quot;i&quot; is 1, what is the probability that the spin at position &quot;j&quot; is also 1?
* If &quot;β&quot; is changed, is there a phase transition?
* On a lattice Λ, what is the fractal dimension of the shape of a large cluster of +1 spins?

==Basic properties and history==
The most studied case of the Ising model is the translation-invariant ferromagnetic zero-field model on a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional lattice, namely, Λ = Z&quot;d&quot;, &quot;J&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = 1, &quot;h&quot; = 0.

=== No phase transition in one dimension ===
In his 1924 PhD thesis, Ising solved the model for the &quot;d&quot; = 1 case, which can be thought of as a linear horizontal lattice where each site only interacts with its left and right neighbor. In one dimension, the solution admits no phase transition. Namely, for any positive β, the correlations ⟨σ&quot;i&quot;σ&quot;j&quot;⟩ decay exponentially in |&quot;i&quot; − &quot;j&quot;|:
formula_54

and the system is disordered. On the basis of this result, he incorrectly concluded that this model does not exhibit phase behaviour in any dimension.

=== Phase transition and exact solution in two dimensions ===
The Ising model undergoes a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase in 2 dimensions or more. Namely, the system is disordered for small β, whereas for large β the system exhibits ferromagnetic order:

formula_55

This was first proven by Rudolf Peierls in 1936, using what is now called a Peierls argument.

The Ising model on a two-dimensional square lattice with no magnetic field was analytically solved by . Onsager obtained the correlation functions and free energy of the Ising model and announced the formula for the spontaneous magnetization for the 2-dimensional model in 1949 but did not give a derivation. gave the first published proof of this formula, using a limit formula for Fredholm determinants, proved in 1951 by Szegő in direct response to Onsager&#x27;s work.

=== Correlation inequalities ===
A number of correlation inequalities have been derived rigorously for the Ising spin correlations (for general lattice structures), which have enabled mathematicians to study the Ising model both on and off criticality.

==== Griffiths inequality ====

Given any subset of spins formula_56 and formula_57 on the lattice, the following inequality holds,

formula_58

where formula_59.

With formula_60, the special case formula_61 results.

This means that spins are positively correlated on the Ising ferromagnet. An immediate application of this is that the magnetization of any set of spins formula_62 is increasing with respect to any set of coupling constants formula_63.

==== Simon-Lieb inequality ====
The Simon-Lieb inequality states that for any set formula_64 disconnecting formula_65 from formula_66 (e.g. the boundary of a box with formula_65 being inside the box and formula_66 being outside),

formula_69

This inequality can be used to establish the sharpness of phase transition for the Ising model.

==== FKG inequality ====

This inequality is proven first for a type of positively-correlated percolation model, of which includes a representation of the Ising model. It is used to determine the critical temperatures of planar Potts model using percolation arguments (which includes the Ising model as a special case).

==Historical significance==
One of Democritus&#x27; arguments in support of atomism was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam. His idea was that small changes in atomic-scale properties would lead to big changes in the aggregate behavior. Others believed that matter is inherently continuous, not atomic, and that the large-scale properties of matter are not reducible to basic atomic properties.

While the laws of chemical bonding made it clear to nineteenth century chemists that atoms were real, among physicists the debate continued well into the early twentieth century. Atomists, notably James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, applied Hamilton&#x27;s formulation of Newton&#x27;s laws to large systems, and found that the statistical behavior of the atoms correctly describes room temperature gases. But classical statistical mechanics did not account for all of the properties of liquids and solids, nor of gases at low temperature.

Once modern quantum mechanics was formulated, atomism was no longer in conflict with experiment, but this did not lead to a universal acceptance of statistical mechanics, which went beyond atomism. Josiah Willard Gibbs had given a complete formalism to reproduce the laws of thermodynamics from the laws of mechanics. But many faulty arguments survived from the 19th century, when statistical mechanics was considered dubious. The lapses in intuition mostly stemmed from the fact that the limit of an infinite statistical system has many zero-one laws which are absent in finite systems: an infinitesimal change in a parameter can lead to big differences in the overall, aggregate behavior, as Democritus expected.

===No phase transitions in finite volume===
In the early part of the twentieth century, some believed that the partition function could never describe a phase transition, based on the following argument:

# The partition function is a sum of &quot;e&quot;−β&quot;E&quot; over all configurations.
# The exponential function is everywhere analytic as a function of β.
# The sum of analytic functions is an analytic function.

This argument works for a finite sum of exponentials, and correctly establishes that there are no singularities in the free energy of a system of a finite size. For systems which are in the thermodynamic limit (that is, for infinite systems) the infinite sum can lead to singularities. The convergence to the thermodynamic limit is fast, so that the phase behavior is apparent already on a relatively small lattice, even though the singularities are smoothed out by the system&#x27;s finite size.

This was first established by Rudolf Peierls in the Ising model.

===Peierls droplets===
Shortly after Lenz and Ising constructed the Ising model, Peierls was able to explicitly show that a phase transition occurs in two dimensions.

To do this, he compared the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. At infinite temperature (β = 0) all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus are represented by black and white, they look like television snow. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little bit, but the screen stays randomly looking, and there is no net excess of black or white.

A quantitative measure of the excess is the magnetization, which is the average value of the spin:

formula_70

A bogus argument analogous to the argument in the last section now establishes that the magnetization in the Ising model is always zero.
# Every configuration of spins has equal energy to the configuration with all spins flipped.
# So for every configuration with magnetization &quot;M&quot; there is a configuration with magnetization −&quot;M&quot; with equal probability.
# The system should therefore spend equal amounts of time in the configuration with magnetization &quot;M&quot; as with magnetization −&quot;M&quot;.
# So the average magnetization (over all time) is zero.

As before, this only proves that the average magnetization is zero at any finite volume. For an infinite system, fluctuations might not be able to push the system from a mostly plus state to a mostly minus with a nonzero probability.

For very high temperatures, the magnetization is zero, as it is at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation ε with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like ε2. For two spins separated by distance &quot;L&quot;, the amount of correlation goes as ε&quot;L&quot;, but if there is more than one path by which the correlations can travel, this amount is enhanced by the number of paths.

The number of paths of length &quot;L&quot; on a square lattice in &quot;d&quot; dimensions is
formula_71
since there are 2&quot;d&quot; choices for where to go at each step.

A bound on the total correlation is given by the contribution to the correlation by summing over all paths linking two points, which is bounded above by the sum over all paths of length &quot;L&quot; divided by
formula_72
which goes to zero when ε is small.

At low temperatures (β ≫ 1) the configurations are near the lowest-energy configuration, the one where all the spins are plus or all the spins are minus. Peierls asked whether it is statistically possible at low temperature, starting with all the spins minus, to fluctuate to a state where most of the spins are plus. For this to happen, droplets of plus spin must be able to congeal to make the plus state.

The energy of a droplet of plus spins in a minus background is proportional to the perimeter of the droplet L, where plus spins and minus spins neighbor each other. For a droplet with perimeter &quot;L&quot;, the area is somewhere between (&quot;L&quot; − 2)/2 (the straight line) and (&quot;L&quot;/4)2 (the square box). The probability cost for introducing a droplet has the factor &quot;e&quot;−β&quot;L&quot;, but this contributes to the partition function multiplied by the total number of droplets with perimeter &quot;L&quot;, which is less than the total number of paths of length &quot;L&quot;:
formula_73
So that the total spin contribution from droplets, even overcounting by allowing each site to have a separate droplet, is bounded above by
formula_74

which goes to zero at large β. For β sufficiently large, this exponentially suppresses long loops, so that they cannot occur, and the magnetization never fluctuates too far from −1.

So Peierls established that the magnetization in the Ising model eventually defines superselection sectors, separated domains not linked by finite fluctuations.

===Kramers–Wannier duality===

Kramers and Wannier were able to show that the high-temperature expansion and the low-temperature expansion of the model are equal up to an overall rescaling of the free energy. This allowed the phase-transition point in the two-dimensional model to be determined exactly (under the assumption that there is a unique critical point).

===Yang–Lee zeros===

After Onsager&#x27;s solution, Yang and Lee investigated the way in which the partition function becomes singular as the temperature approaches the critical temperature.

==Applications==

===Magnetism===
The original motivation for the model was the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. Iron is magnetic; once it is magnetized it stays magnetized for a long time compared to any atomic time.

In the 19th century, it was thought that magnetic fields are due to currents in matter, and Ampère postulated that permanent magnets are caused by permanent atomic currents. The motion of classical charged particles could not explain permanent currents though, as shown by Larmor. In order to have ferromagnetism, the atoms must have permanent magnetic moments which are not due to the motion of classical charges.

Once the electron&#x27;s spin was discovered, it was clear that the magnetism should be due to a large number of electron spins all oriented in the same direction. It was natural to ask how the electrons&#x27; spins all know which direction to point in, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don&#x27;t directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electron spins could be oriented in the same direction using only local forces.

===Lattice gas===
The Ising model can be reinterpreted as a statistical model for the motion of atoms. Since the kinetic energy depends only on momentum and not on position, while the statistics of the positions only depends on the potential energy, the thermodynamics of the gas only depends on the potential energy for each configuration of atoms.

A coarse model is to make space-time a lattice and imagine that each position either contains an atom or it doesn&#x27;t. The space of configuration is that of independent bits &quot;Bi&quot;, where each bit is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the position is occupied or not. An attractive interaction reduces the energy of two nearby atoms. If the attraction is only between nearest neighbors, the energy is reduced by −4&quot;JB&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot; for each occupied neighboring pair.

The density of the atoms can be controlled by adding a chemical potential, which is a multiplicative probability cost for adding one more atom. A multiplicative factor in probability can be reinterpreted as an additive term in the logarithm – the energy. The extra energy of a configuration with &quot;N&quot; atoms is changed by &quot;μN&quot;. The probability cost of one more atom is a factor of exp(−&quot;βμ&quot;).

So the energy of the lattice gas is:
formula_75

Rewriting the bits in terms of spins, formula_76
formula_77

For lattices where every site has an equal number of neighbors, this is the Ising model with a magnetic field &quot;h&quot; = (&quot;zJ&quot; − &quot;μ&quot;)/2, where &quot;z&quot; is the number of neighbors.

In biological systems, modified versions of the lattice gas model have been used to understand a range of binding behaviors. These include the binding of ligands to receptors in the cell surface, the binding of chemotaxis proteins to the flagellar motor, and the condensation of DNA.

===Neuroscience===
The activity of neurons in the brain can be modelled statistically. Each neuron at any time is either active + or inactive −. The active neurons are those that send an action potential down the axon in any given time window, and the inactive ones are those that do not.

Following the general approach of Jaynes, a later interpretation of Schneidman, Berry, Segev and Bialek,
is that the Ising model is useful for any model of neural function, because a statistical model for neural activity should be chosen using the principle of maximum entropy. Given a collection of neurons, a statistical model which can reproduce the average firing rate for each neuron introduces a Lagrange multiplier for each neuron:
formula_78
But the activity of each neuron in this model is statistically independent. To allow for pair correlations, when one neuron tends to fire (or not to fire) along with another, introduce pair-wise lagrange multipliers:
formula_79
where formula_8 are not restricted to neighbors. Note that this generalization of Ising model is sometimes called the quadratic exponential binary distribution in statistics.
This energy function only introduces probability biases for a spin having a value and for a pair of spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.

===Spin glasses===
With the Ising model the so-called spin glasses can also be described, by the usual Hamiltonian formula_81 where the &quot;S&quot;-variables describe the Ising spins, while the &quot;Ji,k&quot; are taken from a random distribution. For spin glasses a typical distribution chooses antiferromagnetic bonds with probability &quot;p&quot; and ferromagnetic bonds with probability 1 − &quot;p&quot; (also known as the random-bond Ising model). These bonds stay fixed or &quot;quenched&quot; even in the presence of thermal fluctuations. When &quot;p&quot; = 0 we have the original Ising model. This system deserves interest in its own; particularly one has &quot;non-ergodic&quot; properties leading to strange relaxation behaviour. Much attention has been also attracted by the related bond and site dilute Ising model, especially in two dimensions, leading to intriguing critical behavior.

=== Artificial neural network ===

Ising model was instrumental in the development of the Hopfield network. The original Ising model is a model for equilibrium. Roy J. Glauber in 1963 studied the Ising model evolving in time, as a process towards thermal equilibrium (Glauber dynamics), adding in the component of time. (Kaoru Nakano, 1971) and (Shun&#x27;ichi Amari, 1972), proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory. The same idea was published by (, 1974), who was cited by Hopfield in his 1982 paper.

The Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model of spin glass, published in 1975, is the Hopfield network with random initialization. Sherrington and Kirkpatrick found that it is highly likely for the energy function of the SK model to have many local minima. In the 1982 paper, Hopfield applied this recently developed theory to study the Hopfield network with binary activation functions. In a 1984 paper he extended this to continuous activation functions. It became a standard model for the study of neural networks through statistical mechanics.

===Sea ice===
The melt pond can be modelled by the Ising model; sea ice topography data bears rather heavily on the results. The state variable is binary for a simple 2D approximation, being either water or ice.

===Cayley tree topologies and large neural networks===

In order to investigate an Ising model with potential relevance for large (e.g. with formula_82 or formula_83 interactions per node) neural nets, at the suggestion of Krizan in 1979, obtained the exact analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the closed Cayley tree (with an arbitrarily large branching ratio) for a zero-external magnetic field (in the thermodynamic limit) by applying the methodologies of and 

formula_84

 where formula_85 is an arbitrary branching ratio (greater than or equal to 2), formula_86, formula_87, formula_88 (with formula_89 representing the nearest-neighbor interaction energy) and there are k (→ ∞ in the thermodynamic limit) generations in each of the tree branches (forming the closed tree architecture as shown in the given closed Cayley tree diagram.) The sum in the last term can be shown to converge uniformly and rapidly (i.e. for z → ∞, it remains finite) yielding a continuous and monotonous function, establishing that, for formula_85 greater than or equal to 2, the free energy is a continuous function of temperature T. Further analysis of the free energy indicates that it exhibits an unusual discontinuous first derivative at the critical temperature (, .)

The spin-spin correlation between sites (in general, m and n) on the tree was found to have a transition point when considered at the vertices (e.g. A and Ā, its reflection), their respective neighboring sites (such as B and its reflection), and between sites adjacent to the top and bottom extreme vertices of the two trees (e.g. A and B), as may be determined from
formula_91
where formula_92 is equal to the number of bonds, formula_93 is the number of graphs counted for odd vertices with even intermediate sites (see cited methodologies and references for detailed calculations), formula_94 is the multiplicity resulting from two-valued spin possibilities and the partition function formula_95 is derived from formula_96. (Note: formula_97 is consistent with the referenced literature in this section and is equivalent to formula_98 or formula_99 utilized above and in earlier sections; it is valued at formula_100.) The critical temperature formula_101 is given by
formula_102

The critical temperature for this model is only determined by the branching ratio formula_85 and the site-to-site interaction energy formula_89, a fact which may have direct implications associated with neural structure vs. its function (in that it relates the energies of interaction and branching ratio to its transitional behavior.) For example, a relationship between the transition behavior of activities of neural networks between sleeping and wakeful states (which may correlate with a spin-spin type of phase transition) in terms of changes in neural interconnectivity (formula_85) and/or neighbor-to-neighbor interactions (formula_89), over time, is just one possible avenue suggested for further experimental investigation into such a phenomenon. In any case, for this Ising model it was established, that “the stability of the long-range correlation increases with increasing formula_85 or increasing formula_89.”

For this topology, the spin-spin correlation was found to be zero between the extreme vertices and the central sites at which the two trees (or branches) are joined (i.e. between A and individually C, D, or E.) This behavior is explained to be due to the fact that, as k increases, the number of links increases exponentially (between the extreme vertices) and so even though the contribution to spin correlations decrease exponentially, the correlation between sites such as the extreme vertex (A) in one tree and the extreme vertex in the joined tree (Ā) remains finite (above the critical temperature.) In addition, A and B also exhibit a non-vanishing correlation (as do their reflections) thus lending itself to, for B level sites (with A level), being considered “clusters” which tend to exhibit synchronization of firing.

Based upon a review of other classical network models as a comparison, the Ising model on a closed Cayley tree was determined to be the first classical statistical mechanical model to demonstrate both local and long-range sites with non-vanishing spin-spin correlations, while at the same time exhibiting intermediate sites with zero correlation, which indeed was a relevant matter for large neural networks at the time of its consideration. The model&#x27;s behavior is also of relevance for any other divergent-convergent tree physical (or biological) system exhibiting a closed Cayley tree topology with an Ising-type of interaction. This topology should not be ignored since its behavior for Ising models has been solved exactly, and presumably nature will have found a way of taking advantage of such simple symmetries at many levels of its designs.

 early on noted the possibility of interrelationships between (1) the classical large neural network model (with similar coupled divergent-convergent topologies) with (2) an underlying statistical quantum mechanical model (independent of topology and with persistence in fundamental quantum states):

It was a natural and common belief among early neurophysicists (e.g. Umezawa, Krizan, Barth, etc.) that classical neural models (including those with statistical mechanical aspects) will one day have to be integrated with quantum physics (with quantum statistical aspects), similar perhaps to how the domain of chemistry has historically integrated itself into quantum physics via quantum chemistry.

Several additional statistical mechanical problems of interest remain to be solved for the closed Cayley tree, including the time-dependent case and the external field situation, as well as theoretical efforts aimed at understanding interrelationships with underlying quantum constituents and their physics.

== Numerical simulation ==
The Ising model can often be difficult to evaluate numerically if there are many states in the system. Consider an Ising model with
: &quot;L&quot; = |Λ|: the total number of sites on the lattice,
: σ&quot;j&quot; ∈ {−1, +1}: an individual spin site on the lattice, &quot;j&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;L&quot;,
: &quot;S&quot; ∈ {−1, +1}&quot;L&quot;: state of the system.

Since every spin site has ±1 spin, there are &quot;2&quot;&quot;L&quot; different states that are possible. This motivates the reason for the Ising model to be simulated using Monte Carlo methods.

The Hamiltonian that is commonly used to represent the energy of the model when using Monte Carlo methods is:

formula_109

Furthermore, the Hamiltonian is further simplified by assuming zero external field &quot;h&quot;, since many questions that are posed to be solved using the model can be answered in absence of an external field. This leads us to the following energy equation for state σ:

formula_28

Given this Hamiltonian, quantities of interest such as the specific heat or the magnetization of the magnet at a given temperature can be calculated.

=== Metropolis algorithm ===

The Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is the most commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations. The algorithm first chooses &quot;selection probabilities&quot; &quot;g&quot;(μ, ν), which represent the probability that state ν is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state μ. It then uses acceptance probabilities &quot;A&quot;(μ, ν) so that detailed balance is satisfied. If the new state ν is accepted, then we move to that state and repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If ν is not accepted then we stay in μ. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes ferromagnetic, meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.

When implementing the algorithm, one must ensure that &quot;g&quot;(μ, ν) is selected such that ergodicity is met. In thermal equilibrium a system&#x27;s energy only fluctuates within a small range. This is the motivation behind the concept of single-spin-flip dynamics, which states that in each transition, we will only change one of the spin sites on the lattice. Furthermore, by using single- spin-flip dynamics, one can get from any state to any other state by flipping each site that differs between the two states one at a time. The maximum amount of change between the energy of the present state, &quot;H&quot;μ and any possible new state&#x27;s energy &quot;H&quot;ν (using single-spin-flip dynamics) is 2&quot;J&quot; between the spin we choose to &quot;flip&quot; to move to the new state and that spin&#x27;s neighbor. Thus, in a 1D Ising model, where each site has two neighbors (left and right), the maximum difference in energy would be 4&quot;J&quot;. Let &quot;c&quot; represent the &quot;lattice coordination number&quot;; the number of nearest neighbors that any lattice site has. We assume that all sites have the same number of neighbors due to periodic boundary conditions. It is important to note that the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm does not perform well around the critical point due to critical slowing down. Other techniques such as multigrid methods, Niedermayer&#x27;s algorithm, Swendsen–Wang algorithm, or the Wolff algorithm are required in order to resolve the model near the critical point; a requirement for determining the critical exponents of the system.

Specifically for the Ising model and using single-spin-flip dynamics, one can establish the following. Since there are &quot;L&quot; total sites on the lattice, using single-spin-flip as the only way we transition to another state, we can see that there are a total of &quot;L&quot; new states ν from our present state μ. The algorithm assumes that the selection probabilities are equal to the &quot;L&quot; states: &quot;g&quot;(μ, ν) = 1/&quot;L&quot;. Detailed balance tells us that the following equation must hold:

formula_111

Thus, we want to select the acceptance probability for our algorithm to satisfy

formula_112

If &quot;H&quot;ν &gt; &quot;H&quot;μ, then &quot;A&quot;(ν, μ) &gt; &quot;A&quot;(μ, ν). Metropolis sets the larger of &quot;A&quot;(μ, ν) or &quot;A&quot;(ν, μ) to be 1. By this reasoning the acceptance algorithm is:

formula_113

The basic form of the algorithm is as follows:

# Pick a spin site using selection probability &quot;g&quot;(μ, ν) and calculate the contribution to the energy involving this spin.
# Flip the value of the spin and calculate the new contribution.
# If the new energy is less, keep the flipped value.
# If the new energy is more, only keep with probability formula_114
# Repeat.

The change in energy &quot;H&quot;ν − &quot;H&quot;μ only depends on the value of the spin and its nearest graph neighbors. So if the graph is not too connected, the algorithm is fast. This process will eventually produce a pick from the distribution.

=== As a Markov chain ===

It is possible to view the Ising model as a Markov chain, as the immediate probability &quot;P&quot;β(ν) of transitioning to a future state ν only depends on the present state μ. The Metropolis algorithm is actually a version of a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, and since we use single-spin-flip dynamics in the Metropolis algorithm, every state can be viewed as having links to exactly &quot;L&quot; other states, where each transition corresponds to flipping a single spin site to the opposite value. Furthermore, since the energy equation &quot;H&quot;σ change only depends on the nearest-neighbor interaction strength &quot;J&quot;, the Ising model and its variants such the Sznajd model can be seen as a form of a voter model for opinion dynamics.

== Solutions ==
=== One dimension ===

The thermodynamic limit exists as long as the interaction decay is formula_115 with α &gt; 1.

* In the case of &quot;ferromagnetic&quot; interaction formula_116 with 1 &lt; α &lt; 2, Dyson proved, by comparison with the hierarchical case, that there is phase transition at small enough temperature.
* In the case of &quot;ferromagnetic&quot; interaction formula_117, Fröhlich and Spencer proved that there is phase transition at small enough temperature (in contrast with the hierarchical case).
* In the case of interaction formula_115 with α &gt; 2 (which includes the case of finite-range interactions), there is no phase transition at any positive temperature (i.e. finite β), since the free energy is analytic in the thermodynamic parameters.
* In the case of &quot;nearest neighbor&quot; interactions, E. Ising provided an exact solution of the model. At any positive temperature (i.e. finite β) the free energy is analytic in the thermodynamics parameters, and the truncated two-point spin correlation decays exponentially fast. At zero temperature (i.e. infinite β), there is a second-order phase transition: the free energy is infinite, and the truncated two-point spin correlation does not decay (remains constant). Therefore, &quot;T&quot; = 0 is the critical temperature of this case. Scaling formulas are satisfied.

==== Ising&#x27;s exact solution ====

In the nearest neighbor case (with periodic or free boundary conditions) an exact solution is available. The Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional Ising model on a lattice of &quot;L&quot; sites with free boundary conditions is
formula_119
where &quot;J&quot; and &quot;h&quot; can be any number, since in this simplified case &quot;J&quot; is a constant representing the interaction strength between the nearest neighbors and &quot;h&quot; is the constant external magnetic field applied to lattice sites. Then the
free energy is
formula_120
and the spin-spin correlation (i.e. the covariance) is
formula_121
where &quot;C&quot;(β) and &quot;c&quot;(β) are positive functions for &quot;T&quot; &gt; 0. For &quot;T&quot; → 0, though, the inverse correlation length &quot;c&quot;(β) vanishes.

===== Proof =====

The proof of this result is a simple computation.

If &quot;h&quot; = 0, it is very easy to obtain the free energy in the case of free boundary condition, i.e. when
formula_122
Then the model factorizes under the change of variables
formula_123

This gives
formula_124

Therefore, the free energy is

formula_125

With the same change of variables

formula_126

hence it decays exponentially as soon as &quot;T&quot; ≠ 0; but for &quot;T&quot; = 0, i.e. in the limit β → ∞ there is no decay.

If &quot;h&quot; ≠ 0 we need the transfer matrix method. For the periodic boundary conditions case is the following. The partition function is
formula_127
The coefficients formula_128 can be seen as the entries of a matrix. There are different possible choices: a convenient one (because the matrix is symmetric) is
formula_129
or
formula_130
In matrix formalism
formula_131
where λ1 is the highest eigenvalue of &quot;V&quot;, while is the other eigenvalue:
formula_132
and . This gives the formula of the free energy above. In the thermodynamics limit for the non-interaction case (J = 0), we got
formula_133
as the answer for the open-boundary Ising model.

===== Comments =====

The energy of the lowest state is −&quot;JL&quot;, when all the spins are the same. For any other configuration, the extra energy is equal to 2&quot;J&quot; times the number of sign changes that are encountered when scanning the configuration from left to right.

If we designate the number of sign changes in a configuration as &quot;k&quot;, the difference in energy from the lowest energy state is 2&quot;k&quot;. Since the energy is additive in the number of flips, the probability &quot;p&quot; of having a spin-flip at each position is independent. The ratio of the probability of finding a flip to the probability of not finding one is the Boltzmann factor:

formula_134

The problem is reduced to independent biased coin tosses. This essentially completes the mathematical description.

From the description in terms of independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2β). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since there is a constant probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to &quot;p&quot;, so the correlations fall off exponentially.

formula_135

The partition function is the volume of configurations, each configuration weighted by its Boltzmann weight. Since each configuration is described by the sign-changes, the partition function factorizes:

formula_136

The logarithm divided by &quot;L&quot; is the free energy density:

formula_137

which is analytic away from β = ∞. A sign of a phase transition is a non-analytic free energy, so the one-dimensional model does not have a phase transition.

==== One-dimensional solution with transverse field ====

To express the Ising Hamiltonian using a quantum mechanical description of spins, we replace the spin variables with their respective Pauli matrices. However, depending on the direction of the magnetic field, we can create a transverse-field or longitudinal-field Hamiltonian. The transverse-field Hamiltonian is given by

formula_138

The transverse-field model experiences a phase transition between an ordered and disordered regime at &quot;J&quot; ~ &quot;h&quot;. This can be shown by a mapping of Pauli matrices

formula_139

formula_140

Upon rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of this change-of-basis matrices, we obtain

formula_141

Since the roles of &quot;h&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are switched, the Hamiltonian undergoes a transition at &quot;J&quot; = &quot;h&quot;.

==== Renormalization ====

When there is no external field, we can derive a functional equation that formula_142 satisfies using renormalization. Specifically, let formula_143 be the partition function with formula_144 sites. Now we have:formula_145where formula_146. We sum over each of formula_147, to obtainformula_148Now, since the cosh function is even, we can solve formula_149 as formula_150. Now we have a self-similarity relation:formula_151Taking the limit, we obtainformula_152where formula_153.

When formula_154 is small, we have formula_155, so we can numerically evaluate formula_156 by iterating the functional equation until formula_157 is small.

=== Two dimensions ===

* In the ferromagnetic case there is a phase transition. At low temperature, the Peierls argument proves positive magnetization for the nearest neighbor case and then, by the Griffiths inequality, also when longer range interactions are added. Meanwhile, at high temperature, the cluster expansion gives analyticity of the thermodynamic functions.
* In the nearest-neighbor case, the free energy was exactly computed by Onsager. The spin-spin correlation functions were computed by McCoy and Wu.

==== Onsager&#x27;s exact solution ====

 obtained the following analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the anisotropic square lattice when the magnetic field formula_158 in the thermodynamic limit as a function of temperature and the horizontal and vertical interaction energies formula_159 and formula_160, respectively

formula_161

From this expression for the free energy, all thermodynamic functions of the model can be calculated by using an appropriate derivative. The 2D Ising model was the first model to exhibit a continuous phase transition at a positive temperature. It occurs at the temperature formula_162 which solves the equation

formula_163

In the isotropic case when the horizontal and vertical interaction energies are equal formula_164, the critical temperature formula_162 occurs at the following point

formula_166

When the interaction energies formula_159, formula_160 are both negative, the Ising model becomes an antiferromagnet. Since the square lattice is bi-partite, it is invariant under this change when the magnetic field formula_158, so the free energy and critical temperature are the same for the antiferromagnetic case. For the triangular lattice, which is not bi-partite, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Ising model behave notably differently. Specifically, around a triangle, it is impossible to make all 3 spin-pairs antiparallel, so the antiferromagnetic Ising model cannot reach the minimal energy state. This is an example of geometric frustration.

===== Transfer matrix =====

Start with an analogy with quantum mechanics. The Ising model on a long periodic lattice has a partition function

formula_170

Think of the &quot;i&quot; direction as &quot;space&quot;, and the &quot;j&quot; direction as &quot;time&quot;. This is an independent sum over all the values that the spins can take at each time slice. This is a type of path integral, it is the sum over all spin histories.

A path integral can be rewritten as a Hamiltonian evolution. The Hamiltonian steps through time by performing a unitary rotation between time &quot;t&quot; and time &quot;t&quot; + Δ&quot;t&quot;:
formula_171

The product of the U matrices, one after the other, is the total time evolution operator, which is the path integral we started with.

formula_172

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of time slices. The sum over all paths is given by a product of matrices, each matrix element is the transition probability from one slice to the next.

Similarly, one can divide the sum over all partition function configurations into slices, where each slice is the one-dimensional configuration at time 1. This defines the transfer matrix:
formula_173

The configuration in each slice is a one-dimensional collection of spins. At each time slice, &quot;T&quot; has matrix elements between two configurations of spins, one in the immediate future and one in the immediate past. These two configurations are &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;2, and they are all one-dimensional spin configurations. We can think of the vector space that &quot;T&quot; acts on as all complex linear combinations of these. Using quantum mechanical notation:
formula_174

where each basis vector formula_175 is a spin configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model.

Like the Hamiltonian, the transfer matrix acts on all linear combinations of states. The partition function is a matrix function of T, which is defined by the sum over all histories which come back to the original configuration after &quot;N&quot; steps:
formula_176

Since this is a matrix equation, it can be evaluated in any basis. So if we can diagonalize the matrix &quot;T&quot;, we can find &quot;Z&quot;.

===== &quot;T&quot; in terms of Pauli matrices =====

The contribution to the partition function for each past/future pair of configurations on a slice is the sum of two terms. There is the number of spin flips in the past slice and there is the number of spin flips between the past and future slice. Define an operator on configurations which flips the spin at site i:

formula_177

In the usual Ising basis, acting on any linear combination of past configurations, it produces the same linear combination but with the spin at position i of each basis vector flipped.

Define a second operator which multiplies the basis vector by +1 and −1 according to the spin at position &quot;i&quot;:

formula_178

&quot;T&quot; can be written in terms of these:

formula_179

where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are constants which are to be determined so as to reproduce the partition function. The interpretation is that the statistical configuration at this slice contributes according to both the number of spin flips in the slice, and whether or not the spin at position &quot;i&quot; has flipped.

===== Spin flip creation and annihilation operators =====

Just as in the one-dimensional case, we will shift attention from the spins to the spin-flips. The σ&quot;z&quot; term in &quot;T&quot; counts the number of spin flips, which we can write in terms of spin-flip creation and annihilation operators:

formula_180

The first term flips a spin, so depending on the basis state it either:
#moves a spin-flip one unit to the right
#moves a spin-flip one unit to the left
#produces two spin-flips on neighboring sites
#destroys two spin-flips on neighboring sites.

Writing this out in terms of creation and annihilation operators:
formula_181

Ignore the constant coefficients, and focus attention on the form. They are all quadratic. Since the coefficients are constant, this means that the &quot;T&quot; matrix can be diagonalized by Fourier transforms.

Carrying out the diagonalization produces the Onsager free energy.

===== Onsager&#x27;s formula for spontaneous magnetization =====

Onsager famously announced the following expression for the spontaneous magnetization &quot;M&quot; of a two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet on the square lattice at two different conferences in 1948, though without proof

formula_182

where formula_159 and formula_160 are horizontal and vertical interaction energies.

A complete derivation was only given in 1951 by using a limiting process of transfer matrix eigenvalues. The proof was subsequently greatly simplified in 1963 by Montroll, Potts, and Ward using Szegő&#x27;s limit formula for Toeplitz determinants by treating the magnetization as the limit of correlation functions.

==== Minimal model ====
At the critical point, the two-dimensional Ising model is a two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spin and energy correlation functions are described by a minimal model, which has been exactly solved.

=== Three dimensions ===

In three as in two dimensions, the most studied case of the Ising model is the translation-invariant model on a cubic lattice with nearest-neighbor coupling in the zero magnetic field. Many theoreticians searched for an analytical three-dimensional solution for many decades, which would be analogous to Onsager&#x27;s solution in the two-dimensional case. Such a solution has not been found until now, although there is no proof that it may not exist. In three dimensions, the Ising model was shown to have a representation in terms of non-interacting fermionic strings by Alexander Polyakov and Vladimir Dotsenko. This construction has been carried on the lattice, and the continuum limit, conjecturally describing the critical point, is unknown.

In three as in two dimensions, Peierls&#x27; argument shows that there is a phase transition. This phase transition is rigorously known to be continuous (in the sense that correlation length diverges and the magnetization goes to zero), and is called the critical point. It is believed that the critical point can be described by a renormalization group fixed point of the Wilson-Kadanoff renormalization group transformation. It is also believed that the phase transition can be described by a three-dimensional unitary conformal field theory, as evidenced by Monte Carlo simulations, exact diagonalization results in quantum models, and quantum field theoretical arguments. Although it is an open problem to establish rigorously the renormalization group picture or the conformal field theory picture, theoretical physicists have used these two methods to compute the critical exponents of the phase transition, which agree with the experiments and with the Monte Carlo simulations. This conformal field theory describing the three-dimensional Ising critical point is under active investigation using the method of the conformal bootstrap. This method currently yields the most precise information about the structure of the critical theory (see Ising critical exponents).

In 2000, Sorin Istrail of Sandia National Laboratories proved that the spin glass Ising model on a nonplanar lattice is NP-complete. That is, assuming P ≠ NP, the general spin glass Ising model is exactly solvable only in planar cases, so solutions for dimensions higher than two are also intractable. Istrail&#x27;s result only concerns the spin glass model with spatially varying couplings, and tells nothing about Ising&#x27;s original ferromagnetic model with equal couplings.

=== Four dimensions and above ===

In any dimension, the Ising model can be productively described by a locally varying mean field. The field is defined as the average spin value over a large region, but not so large so as to include the entire system. The field still has slow variations from point to point, as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations in the field are described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.

==== Local field ====

The field &quot;H&quot; is defined as the long wavelength Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of &quot;H&quot; and not the spins. Once the correlations in &quot;H&quot; are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in &quot;H&quot;.

For any value of the slowly varying field &quot;H&quot;, the free energy (log-probability) is a local analytic function of &quot;H&quot; and its gradients. The free energy &quot;F&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is defined to be the sum over all Ising configurations which are consistent with the long wavelength field. Since &quot;H&quot; is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of &quot;H&quot;, so long as not too much exactness is required for the match.

Since the allowed range of values of the spin in any region only depends on the values of &quot;H&quot; within one averaging volume from that region, the free energy contribution from each region only depends on the value of &quot;H&quot; there and in the neighboring regions. So &quot;F&quot; is a sum over all regions of a local contribution, which only depends on &quot;H&quot; and its derivatives.

By symmetry in &quot;H&quot;, only even powers contribute. By reflection symmetry on a square lattice, only even powers of gradients contribute. Writing out the first few terms in the free energy:

formula_185

On a square lattice, symmetries guarantee that the coefficients &quot;Zi&quot; of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an anisotropic Ising model, where the &quot;Zi&quot;″s in different directions are different, the fluctuations in &quot;H&quot; are isotropic in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.

On any lattice, the derivative term
formula_186
is a positive definite quadratic form, and can be used to &quot;define&quot; the metric for space. So any translationally invariant Ising model is rotationally invariant at long distances, in coordinates that make &quot;Zij&quot; = δ&quot;ij&quot;. Rotational symmetry emerges spontaneously at large distances just because there aren&#x27;t very many low order terms. At higher order multicritical points, this accidental symmetry is lost.

Since β&quot;F&quot; is a function of a slowly spatially varying field, the probability of any field configuration is (omitting higher-order terms):

formula_187

The statistical average of any product of &quot;H&quot; terms is equal to:

formula_188

The denominator in this expression is called the &quot;partition function&quot;:formula_189and the integral over all possible values of &quot;H&quot; is a statistical path integral. It integrates exp(β&quot;F&quot;) over all values of &quot;H&quot;, over all the long wavelength fourier components of the spins. &quot;F&quot; is a &quot;Euclidean&quot; Lagrangian for the field &quot;H&quot;. It is similar to the Lagrangian in of a scalar field in quantum field theory, the difference being that all the derivative terms enter with a positive sign, and there is no overall factor of &quot;i&quot; (thus &quot;Euclidean&quot;).

==== Dimensional analysis ====

The form of &quot;F&quot; can be used to predict which terms are most important by dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis is not completely straightforward, because the scaling of &quot;H&quot; needs to be determined.

In the generic case, choosing the scaling law for &quot;H&quot; is easy, since the only term that contributes is the first one,

formula_190

This term is the most significant, but it gives trivial behavior. This form of the free energy is ultralocal, meaning that it is a sum of an independent contribution from each point. This is like the spin-flips in the one-dimensional Ising model. Every value of &quot;H&quot; at any point fluctuates completely independently of the value at any other point.

The scale of the field can be redefined to absorb the coefficient &quot;A&quot;, and then it is clear that &quot;A&quot; only determines the overall scale of fluctuations. The ultralocal model describes the long wavelength high temperature behavior of the Ising model, since in this limit the fluctuation averages are independent from point to point.

To find the critical point, lower the temperature. As the temperature goes down, the fluctuations in &quot;H&quot; go up because the fluctuations are more correlated. This means that the average of a large number of spins does not become small as quickly as if they were uncorrelated, because they tend to be the same. This corresponds to decreasing &quot;A&quot; in the system of units where &quot;H&quot; does not absorb &quot;A&quot;. The phase transition can only happen when the subleading terms in &quot;F&quot; can contribute, but since the first term dominates at long distances, the coefficient &quot;A&quot; must be tuned to zero. This is the location of the critical point:

formula_191

where &quot;t&quot; is a parameter which goes through zero at the transition.

Since &quot;t&quot; is vanishing, fixing the scale of the field using this term makes the other terms blow up. Once &quot;t&quot; is small, the scale of the field can either be set to fix the coefficient of the &quot;H&quot;4 term or the (∇&quot;H&quot;)2 term to 1.

==== Magnetization ====

To find the magnetization, fix the scaling of &quot;H&quot; so that λ is one. Now the field &quot;H&quot; has dimension −&quot;d&quot;/4, so that &quot;H&quot;4&quot;ddx&quot; is dimensionless, and &quot;Z&quot; has dimension 2 − &quot;d&quot;/2. In this scaling, the gradient term is only important at long distances for &quot;d&quot; ≤ 4. Above four dimensions, at long wavelengths, the overall magnetization is only affected by the ultralocal terms.

There is one subtle point. The field &quot;H&quot; is fluctuating statistically, and the fluctuations can shift the zero point of &quot;t&quot;. To see how, consider &quot;H&quot;4 split in the following way:

formula_192

The first term is a constant contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in &quot;t&quot;. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of &quot;t&quot; by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted &quot;t&quot; that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in &quot;t&quot; at any finite &quot;λ&quot; is finite, but near the transition &quot;t&quot; is very small. The fractional change in &quot;t&quot; is very large, and in units where &quot;t&quot; is fixed the shift looks infinite.

The magnetization is at the minimum of the free energy, and this is an analytic equation. In terms of the shifted &quot;t&quot;,

formula_193

For &quot;t&quot; &lt; 0, the minima are at &quot;H&quot; proportional to the square root of &quot;t&quot;. So Landau&#x27;s catastrophe argument is correct in dimensions larger than 5. The magnetization exponent in dimensions higher than 5 is equal to the mean-field value.

When &quot;t&quot; is negative, the fluctuations about the new minimum are described by a new positive quadratic coefficient. Since this term always dominates, at temperatures below the transition the fluctuations again become ultralocal at long distances.

==== Fluctuations ====

To find the behavior of fluctuations, rescale the field to fix the gradient term. Then the length scaling dimension of the field is 1 − &quot;d&quot;/2. Now the field has constant quadratic spatial fluctuations at all temperatures. The scale dimension of the &quot;H&quot;2 term is 2, while the scale dimension of the &quot;H&quot;4 term is 4 − &quot;d&quot;. For &quot;d&quot; &lt; 4, the &quot;H&quot;4 term has positive scale dimension. In dimensions higher than 4 it has negative scale dimensions.

This is an essential difference. In dimensions higher than 4, fixing the scale of the gradient term means that the coefficient of the &quot;H&quot;4 term is less and less important at longer and longer wavelengths. The dimension at which nonquadratic contributions begin to contribute is known as the critical dimension. In the Ising model, the critical dimension is 4.

In dimensions above 4, the critical fluctuations are described by a purely quadratic free energy at long wavelengths. This means that the correlation functions are all computable from as Gaussian averages:

formula_194

valid when &quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot; is large. The function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) is the analytic continuation to imaginary time of the Feynman propagator, since the free energy is the analytic continuation of the quantum field action for a free scalar field. For dimensions 5 and higher, all the other correlation functions at long distances are then determined by Wick&#x27;s theorem. All the odd moments are zero, by ± symmetry. The even moments are the sum over all partition into pairs of the product of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;) for each pair.

formula_195

where &quot;C&quot; is the proportionality constant. So knowing &quot;G&quot; is enough. It determines all the multipoint correlations of the field.

==== The critical two-point function ====

To determine the form of &quot;G&quot;, consider that the fields in a path integral obey the classical equations of motion derived by varying the free energy:

formula_196

This is valid at noncoincident points only, since the correlations of &quot;H&quot; are singular when points collide. &quot;H&quot; obeys classical equations of motion for the same reason that quantum mechanical operators obey them—its fluctuations are defined by a path integral.

At the critical point &quot;t&quot; = 0, this is Laplace&#x27;s equation, which can be solved by Gauss&#x27;s method from electrostatics. Define an electric field analog by

formula_197

Away from the origin:

formula_198

since &quot;G&quot; is spherically symmetric in &quot;d&quot; dimensions, and &quot;E&quot; is the radial gradient of &quot;G&quot;. Integrating over a large &quot;d&quot; − 1 dimensional sphere,

formula_199

This gives:

formula_200

and &quot;G&quot; can be found by integrating with respect to &quot;r&quot;.

formula_201

The constant &quot;C&quot; fixes the overall normalization of the field.

==== &quot;G&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) away from the critical point ====

When &quot;t&quot; does not equal zero, so that &quot;H&quot; is fluctuating at a temperature slightly away from critical, the two point function decays at long distances. The equation it obeys is altered:

formula_202

For &quot;r&quot; small compared with formula_203, the solution diverges exactly the same way as in the critical case, but the long distance behavior is modified.

To see how, it is convenient to represent the two point function as an integral, introduced by Schwinger in the quantum field theory context:

formula_204

This is &quot;G&quot;, since the Fourier transform of this integral is easy. Each fixed τ contribution is a Gaussian in &quot;x&quot;, whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in &quot;k&quot;.

formula_205

This is the inverse of the operator ∇2 − &quot;t&quot; in &quot;k&quot;-space, acting on the unit function in &quot;k&quot;-space, which is the Fourier transform of a delta function source localized at the origin. So it satisfies the same equation as &quot;G&quot; with the same boundary conditions that determine the strength of the divergence at 0.

The interpretation of the integral representation over the &quot;proper time&quot; τ is that the two point function is the sum over all random walk paths that link position 0 to position &quot;x&quot; over time τ. The density of these paths at time τ at position &quot;x&quot; is Gaussian, but the random walkers disappear at a steady rate proportional to &quot;t&quot; so that the Gaussian at time τ is diminished in height by a factor that decreases steadily exponentially. In the quantum field theory context, these are the paths of relativistically localized quanta in a formalism that follows the paths of individual particles. In the pure statistical context, these paths still appear by the mathematical correspondence with quantum fields, but their interpretation is less directly physical.

The integral representation immediately shows that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is positive, since it is represented as a weighted sum of positive Gaussians. It also gives the rate of decay at large r, since the proper time for a random walk to reach position τ is r2 and in this time, the Gaussian height has decayed by formula_206. The decay factor appropriate for position &quot;r&quot; is therefore formula_207.

A heuristic approximation for &quot;G&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is:

formula_208

This is not an exact form, except in three dimensions, where interactions between paths become important. The exact forms in high dimensions are variants of Bessel functions.

==== Symanzik polymer interpretation ====

The interpretation of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the critical dimension of the &quot;H&quot;4 interaction is 4. The term &quot;H&quot;4 can be thought of as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the &quot;H&quot;2 coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.

The fractal dimension of an ordinary random walk is 2. The number of balls of size ε required to cover the path increase as ε−2. Two objects of fractal dimension 2 will intersect with reasonable probability only in a space of dimension 4 or less, the same condition as for a generic pair of planes. Kurt Symanzik argued that this implies that the critical Ising fluctuations in dimensions higher than 4 should be described by a free field. This argument eventually became a mathematical proof.

==== 4 − &quot;ε&quot; dimensions – renormalization group ====

The Ising model in four dimensions is described by a fluctuating field, but now the fluctuations are interacting. In the polymer representation, intersections of random walks are marginally possible. In the quantum field continuation, the quanta interact.

The negative logarithm of the probability of any field configuration &quot;H&quot; is the free energy function

formula_209

The numerical factors are there to simplify the equations of motion. The goal is to understand the statistical fluctuations. Like any other non-quadratic path integral, the correlation functions have a Feynman expansion as particles travelling along random walks, splitting and rejoining at vertices. The interaction strength is parametrized by the classically dimensionless quantity λ.

Although dimensional analysis shows that both λ and &quot;Z&quot; are dimensionless, this is misleading. The long wavelength statistical fluctuations are not exactly scale invariant, and only become scale invariant when the interaction strength vanishes.

The reason is that there is a cutoff used to define &quot;H&quot;, and the cutoff defines the shortest wavelength. Fluctuations of &quot;H&quot; at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn&#x27;t compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.

===== Wilson renormalization =====

A quick heuristic way of studying the scaling is to cut off the &quot;H&quot; wavenumbers at a point λ. Fourier modes of &quot;H&quot; with wavenumbers larger than λ are not allowed to fluctuate. A rescaling of length that make the whole system smaller increases all wavenumbers, and moves some fluctuations above the cutoff.

To restore the old cutoff, perform a partial integration over all the wavenumbers which used to be forbidden, but are now fluctuating. In Feynman diagrams, integrating over a fluctuating mode at wavenumber &quot;k&quot; links up lines carrying momentum &quot;k&quot; in a correlation function in pairs, with a factor of the inverse propagator.

Under rescaling, when the system is shrunk by a factor of (1+&quot;b&quot;), the &quot;t&quot; coefficient scales up by a factor (1+&quot;b&quot;)2 by dimensional analysis. The change in &quot;t&quot; for infinitesimal &quot;b&quot; is 2&quot;bt&quot;. The other two coefficients are dimensionless and do not change at all.

The lowest order effect of integrating out can be calculated from the equations of motion:

formula_210

This equation is an identity inside any correlation function away from other insertions. After integrating out the modes with Λ &lt; &quot;k&quot; &lt; (1+&quot;b&quot;)Λ, it will be a slightly different identity.

Since the form of the equation will be preserved, to find the change in coefficients it is sufficient to analyze the change in the &quot;H&quot;3 term. In a Feynman diagram expansion, the &quot;H&quot;3 term in a correlation function inside a correlation has three dangling lines. Joining two of them at large wavenumber &quot;k&quot; gives a change &quot;H&quot;3 with one dangling line, so proportional to &quot;H&quot;:

formula_211

The factor of 3 comes from the fact that the loop can be closed in three different ways.

The integral should be split into two parts:

formula_212

The first part is not proportional to &quot;t&quot;, and in the equation of motion it can be absorbed by a constant shift in &quot;t&quot;. It is caused by the fact that the &quot;H&quot;3 term has a linear part. Only the second term, which varies from &quot;t&quot; to &quot;t&quot;, contributes to the critical scaling.

This new linear term adds to the first term on the left hand side, changing &quot;t&quot; by an amount proportional to &quot;t&quot;. The total change in &quot;t&quot; is the sum of the term from dimensional analysis and this second term from operator products:

formula_213

So &quot;t&quot; is rescaled, but its dimension is anomalous, it is changed by an amount proportional to the value of λ.

But λ also changes. The change in λ requires considering the lines splitting and then quickly rejoining. The lowest order process is one where one of the three lines from &quot;H&quot;3 splits into three, which quickly joins with one of the other lines from the same vertex. The correction to the vertex is

formula_214

The numerical factor is three times bigger because there is an extra factor of three in choosing which of the three new lines to contract. So

formula_215

These two equations together define the renormalization group equations in four dimensions:

formula_216

The coefficient &quot;B&quot; is determined by the formula
formula_217

and is proportional to the area of a three-dimensional sphere of radius λ, times the width of the integration region &quot;b&quot;Λ divided by Λ4:
formula_218

In other dimensions, the constant &quot;B&quot; changes, but the same constant appears both in the &quot;t&quot; flow and in the coupling flow. The reason is that the derivative with respect to &quot;t&quot; of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the &quot;t&quot; is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.

===== Wilson–Fisher fixed point =====

To investigate three dimensions starting from the four-dimensional theory should be possible, because the intersection probabilities of random walks depend continuously on the dimensionality of the space. In the language of Feynman graphs, the coupling does not change very much when the dimension is changed.

The process of continuing away from dimension 4 is not completely well defined without a prescription for how to do it. The prescription is only well defined on diagrams. It replaces the Schwinger representation in dimension 4 with the Schwinger representation in dimension 4 − ε defined by:
formula_219

The solutions to this equation are the possible consistent mean fields. For β&quot;J&quot; &lt; 1 there is only the one solution at &quot;H&quot; = 0. For bigger values of β there are three solutions, and the solution at &quot;H&quot; = 0 is unstable.

The instability means that increasing the mean field above zero a little bit produces a statistical fraction of spins which are + which is bigger than the value of the mean field. So a mean field which fluctuates above zero will produce an even greater mean field, and will eventually settle at the stable solution. This means that for temperatures below the critical value β&quot;J&quot; = 1 the mean-field Ising model undergoes a phase transition in the limit of large &quot;N&quot;.

Above the critical temperature, fluctuations in &quot;H&quot; are damped because the mean field restores the fluctuation to zero field. Below the critical temperature, the mean field is driven to a new equilibrium value, which is either the positive &quot;H&quot; or negative &quot;H&quot; solution to the equation.

For β&quot;J&quot; = 1 + ε, just below the critical temperature, the value of &quot;H&quot; can be calculated from the Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic tangent:
formula_220

Dividing by &quot;H&quot; to discard the unstable solution at &quot;H&quot; = 0, the stable solutions are:
formula_221

The spontaneous magnetization &quot;H&quot; grows near the critical point as the square root of the change in temperature. This is true whenever &quot;H&quot; can be calculated from the solution of an analytic equation which is symmetric between positive and negative values, which led Landau to suspect that all Ising type phase transitions in all dimensions should follow this law.

The mean-field exponent is universal because changes in the character of solutions of analytic equations are always described by catastrophes in the Taylor series, which is a polynomial equation. By symmetry, the equation for &quot;H&quot; must only have odd powers of &quot;H&quot; on the right hand side. Changing β should only smoothly change the coefficients. The transition happens when the coefficient of &quot;H&quot; on the right hand side is 1. Near the transition:
formula_222

Whatever &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are, so long as neither of them is tuned to zero, the spontaneous magnetization will grow as the square root of ε. This argument can only fail if the free energy β&quot;F&quot; is either non-analytic or non-generic at the exact β where the transition occurs.

But the spontaneous magnetization in magnetic systems and the density in gasses near the critical point are measured very accurately. The density and the magnetization in three dimensions have the same power-law dependence on the temperature near the critical point, but the behavior from experiments is:
formula_223

The exponent is also universal, since it is the same in the Ising model as in the experimental magnet and gas, but it is not equal to the mean-field value. This was a great surprise.

This is also true in two dimensions, where
formula_224

But there it was not a surprise, because it was predicted by Onsager.

==== Low dimensions – block spins ====

In three dimensions, the perturbative series from the field theory is an expansion in a coupling constant λ which is not particularly small. The effective size of the coupling at the fixed point is one over the branching factor of the particle paths, so the expansion parameter is about 1/3. In two dimensions, the perturbative expansion parameter is 2/3.

But renormalization can also be productively applied to the spins directly, without passing to an average field. Historically, this approach is due to Leo Kadanoff and predated the perturbative ε expansion.

The idea is to integrate out lattice spins iteratively, generating a flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The fact that a continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.

===== Migdal–Kadanoff renormalization =====

Write the two-dimensional Ising model with an infinite number of possible higher order interactions. To keep spin reflection symmetry, only even powers contribute:
formula_225

By translation invariance, &quot;Jij&quot; is only a function of i-j. By the accidental rotational symmetry, at large i and j its size only depends on the magnitude of the two-dimensional vector &quot;i&quot; − &quot;j&quot;. The higher order coefficients are also similarly restricted.

The renormalization iteration divides the lattice into two parts – even spins and odd spins. The odd spins live on the odd-checkerboard lattice positions, and the even ones on the even-checkerboard. When the spins are indexed by the position (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;), the odd sites are those with &quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; odd and the even sites those with &quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; even, and even sites are only connected to odd sites.

The two possible values of the odd spins will be integrated out, by summing over both possible values. This will produce a new free energy function for the remaining even spins, with new adjusted couplings. The even spins are again in a lattice, with axes tilted at 45 degrees to the old ones. Unrotating the system restores the old configuration, but with new parameters. These parameters describe the interaction between spins at distances formula_226 larger.

Starting from the Ising model and repeating this iteration eventually changes all the couplings. When the temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.

The simplest approximation is to keep only the usual &quot;J&quot; term, and discard everything else. This will generate a flow in &quot;J&quot;, analogous to the flow in &quot;t&quot; at the fixed point of λ in the ε expansion.

To find the change in &quot;J&quot;, consider the four neighbors of an odd site. These are the only spins which interact with it. The multiplicative contribution to the partition function from the sum over the two values of the spin at the odd site is:
formula_227

where &quot;N&quot;± is the number of neighbors which are ±. Ignoring the factor of 2, the free energy contribution from this odd site is:
formula_228

This includes nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor interactions, as expected, but also a four-spin interaction which is to be discarded. To truncate to nearest neighbor interactions, consider that the difference in energy between all spins the same and equal numbers + and – is:
formula_229

From nearest neighbor couplings, the difference in energy between all spins equal and staggered spins is 8&quot;J&quot;. The difference in energy between all spins equal and nonstaggered but net zero spin is 4&quot;J&quot;. Ignoring four-spin interactions, a reasonable truncation is the average of these two energies or 6&quot;J&quot;. Since each link will contribute to two odd spins, the right value to compare with the previous one is half that:
formula_230

For small &quot;J&quot;, this quickly flows to zero coupling. Large &quot;J&quot;&#x27;s flow to large couplings. The magnetization exponent is determined from the slope of the equation at the fixed point.

Variants of this method produce good numerical approximations for the critical exponents when many terms are included, in both two and three dimensions.

<doc id="292755" wikidata="Q507269" url="?curid=292755" title="Bandai">
<text>is a Japanese multinational toy manufacturer and distributor headquartered in Taitō, Tokyo. Its international branches, Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectables America and Bandai UK, are respectively headquartered in Irvine, California, and Richmond, London. Since 2005, Bandai is the toy production division of Bandai Namco Holdings, currently the world&#x27;s second largest toy company measured by total revenue. Between 1981 and 2001, Bandai was a manufacturer of video game consoles.

Bandai was founded by World War II veteran Naoharu Yamashina as Bandai-Ya on July 5, 1950, as the corporate spin-off of a textile wholesaler. The company began as a distributor of metallic toys and rubber swimming rings, before moving to metal cars and aircraft models. It was renamed Bandai Co., Ltd. in 1961 and achieved considerable success with its action figures based on the anime &quot;Astro Boy&quot;.

==History==
===Origins and success with toys (1947–1968)===
In 1947, Naoharu Yamashina began working for a Kanazawa-based textile wholesaler. The eldest son to a rice retailer, Yamashina had studied business in high school and was enlisted in World War II, where an impact from a grenade shrapnel blinded him in his right eye. The textile business, ran by his wife&#x27;s brother, was struggling financially as a result of Japan&#x27;s post-war economy. He made little money working, and as he was having a difficult time finding ways to allow the business to pick up, a neighbor told him about the potential of the toy industry and the financial success that could be generated from it. Intrigued, Yamashina convinced his wife to travel to Tokyo with him to begin studying the potentially lucrative market for toys. With little money or exposure in the field, the two worked long hours to establish a small toy distribution division within the textile business.
Yamashina assumed full control of the toy division on July 5, 1950, when it was spun-off as a separate company named in Taitō, Tokyo. The name was derived from Japanese reading of Chinese phrase &quot;bandai fueki&quot; (), meaning &quot;eternally unchanging&quot; or &quot;things that are eternal.&quot; Being assisted by Atsuko Tatsumi, publisher of the &quot;Weekly Toy News&quot; in Tokyo, Bandai-ya distributed and imported celluloid dolls, metallic toys, and rubber swimming rings. The company released its first original product the same year, the Rhythm Ball, a beach ball with a bell inside that suffered from numerous quality defects. Bandai-ya improved the quality of its products as it continued designing new kinds of toys, such as inexpensive metal cars and aircraft models. Several of these were exported to the United States and elsewhere as a result of their popularity, being among the earliest &quot;Made In Japan&quot; products exported outside the country.
As its revenue increased, Bandai-ya began expanding its operations. A new shipping and warehouse facility was constructed in spring 1953, followed by research and development (R&amp;D) and product inspection departments later that year. A manufacturing facility, Waraku Works, was opened in early 1955 to increase the production of toys. In the same year, it implemented the toy industry&#x27;s first quality assurance system; the first toy approved by this was the 1956 Toyopet Crown model car, which was also Bandai-ya&#x27;s first product with a guarantee. The growing company worked on creating a friendly corporate image for itself, introducing a new logo, slogan, and television commercials that emphasized its quality products. Bandai-ya was renamed Bandai in July 1961, the same time it started spreading its operations overseas, beginning with the establishment of Bandai Overseas Supply in New York City.

While its toys often sold well in Japan, Bandai didn&#x27;t achieve considerable success until 1963, when it began producing action figures based on the anime &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. The toy line&#x27;s success prompted Bandai to reorganize and rethink its business strategies, as the company transitioned from working on original products to funding the creation of new television series and acting as a sponsor during their run, with advertisements that showed off Bandai&#x27;s tie-in action figures and costumes. A similar blockbuster hit was found with action figures in the likenesses of &quot;Ultraman&quot; characters, largely due to the popularity of the television series at the time; the figures were later released in North America to little fanfare. In July 1966, it released Crazy Foam, a line of bubble blowing canisters that sold 2.4 million units in three months, thanks to the backing of an extensive marketing campaign. Bandai&#x27;s other products included the Thunderbird electrical vehicles, the Water Motor bath toys, and the Naughty Flipper, the last of which received a gold medal at the 1968 New York International Innovative productions Exhibition. An additional manufacturing plant was acquired in late 1969 to further increase the production of toys.

===Continuing expansion and Mobile Suit Gundam (1971–1983)===

Bandai continued its expansion throughout the 1970s. The company established a joint venture with model car manufacturer Tonka in 1970 and established Tonka Japan K.K., as part of Bandai&#x27;s continuing mission in establishing ties with foreign companies. A subsidiary named Popy was formed a year later that specialized in the manufacturing of toys based on popular children&#x27;s characters. Though Bandai became a major player in the Japanese toy industry, competing with companies such as Takara and Epoch, executives believed the company needed to further spread out into international territories to help increase worldwide brand awareness.

Bandai continued to expand in the 1970s with the creation of several subsidiaries; Tonka Japan in 1970 following a joint venture with Tonka, Bandai Models being established in 1971, and finally Popy, who specialized in the manufacturing of toy characters. Although not their most profitable range, Bandai&#x27;s 1/48 scale AFV models dominated that segment of the model kit market. Bandai America Inc. was established as local US sales/marketing operation in 1978. Spacewarp, a line of build-it-yourself toy rolling ball &quot;roller coasters&quot; was introduced by Bandai in the 1980s.

In May 1980, Makoto Yamashina, son of the founder, became president of Bandai. Naoharu Yamashina became chairman of the board. Upon his arrival, Makoto Yamashina completely changed the ageing staff of Bandai and replaced them with younger employees with the intent of not only bringing new ideas, but also revisiting the strategy of the group. The new president took a different commercial approach by selling directly to retailers rather than going through intermediates.

In July 1980, Bandai launched the &#x27;Gundam Plastic Model&#x27; based on the animated series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; which gave birth to the Gunpla range of scale model kits. In November, the subsidiary Celent was created.

===Entry into the video game market (1983–1989)===
Bandai became one of the first third-party developers for the Nintendo Family Computer in 1985. Among its first titles was &quot;Tag Team Match: MUSCLE&quot;, a video game adaptation of the &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; manga, which sold over one million copies. Bandai also produced the Family Trainer Pad, released outside Japan as the Power Pad, which also performed well commercially. A series of games was released both in the US and in Japan, including &quot;Athletic World&quot; and &quot;Stadium Events&quot; for the NES. Shortly after its release, Nintendo purchased the rights to the FFF mat in North America, replacing it with their own redesign, the Power Pad. In order to maintain branding continuity, &quot;Stadium Events&quot; was pulled from shelves after a short period of availability at Woolworth&#x27;s stores. Because the game was pulled from shelves and discontinued before many copies were sold, Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Stadium Events&quot; is universally accepted as the rarest licensed NES game released in North America. A shrink-wrapped copy of the game sold for $41,270 on eBay in February 2010. The sister game to &quot;Stadium Events&quot;, called &quot;Athletic World&quot; was initially released with a label that indicated compatibility with the Family Fun Fitness mat, but was later re-released with an updated label that mentions the Power Pad instead. Stadium Events was not released by name again, but instead was slightly modified and relaunched as the Power Pad pack-in game, &quot;World Class Track Meet&quot;.
Since the 1980s, Bandai has become the leading toy company of Japan, and to this day, has the main toy licenses in Japan to popular properties including &quot;Daikaiju&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Super Robot&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series (which it took part in creating), &quot;Gundam&quot;, and many others. In February 1989, it acquired arcade game developer Coreland and reorganized it into Banpresto, which became Bandai&#x27;s coin-operated entertainment division. In the early 1990s, Bandai published games for Nintendo in the United Kingdom, including &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

===Mainstream success and expansion (1989–1995)===
=== Financial decline and failed merger with Sega (1995–1999) ===

In January 1997, Bandai announced it would merge its operations with Japanese video game developer Sega. The merger, a $1 billion stock swap where Sega would acquire Bandai and dissolve the company, would have established a new entertainment conglomerate named Sega Bandai Ltd. with an estimated $6 billion in revenue. The announcement followed a 9 billion loss from Bandai the same month, attributed to declining game sales and the poor reception of the Apple Pippin console. Bandai felt Sega was an appropriate company to merge with, as it possessed an American management model and several international offices, in addition to owning several successful franchises like &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Opposition arose within Bandai&#x27;s employees and midlevel executives, as neither felt the company&#x27;s family-friendly work ethic meshed well with Sega&#x27;s top-down corporate culture. As a result, Bandai called off the merge in May before its finalization in October. President Makoto Yamashina took responsibility for its failure, publicly apologizing and resigning his position within the company. Bandai instead agreed to a business alliance with Sega.

===Namco takeover and restructuring (2005–present)===

After its merger with game developer and amusement facility operator Namco in 2005, Bandai Company is now under the management and a member of Bandai Namco Holdings (Bandai Namco Group). Following a group reorganisation in 2006, Bandai heads the group&#x27;s Toys and Hobby strategic business unit (SBU). Bandai Entertainment announced it would cease its distribution operations in January 2012. Beez Entertainment is no longer releasing new anime in Europe.

In February 2018, Saban Brands and Bandai&#x27;s US division jointly announced a mutual agreement to not renew their Power Rangers master toy license, effective Spring 2019, after which competing toy company Hasbro will inherit the license. This transition will not affect Bandai Japan&#x27;s Super Sentai (the series from which Power Rangers takes footage) master toy license with Toei.

A sister company, Bandai Spirits, was established on 15 February 2018. On 1 April 2018, the division of Bandai that dealt with products for adult customers (including figures and plastic models) as well as Banpresto&#x27;s prizes business were transferred over to Bandai Spirits.

==Corporate structure==
Bandai&#x27;s headquarters is in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. The company owns offices in the United States (Bandai America), Mexico (Bandai Corporación Mexico), the United Kingdom (Bandai UK), Indonesia (Bandai Namco Indonesia), France, Spain, Taiwan, and mainland China. In the past, it owned offices in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Germany, and East Asia, which acted as distributors for Bandai products in their respective countries. Bandai is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings and heads its parent&#x27;s Toy and Hobby Content Strategic Business Unit (CSBU).

Bandai is among the largest and most profitable toy companies worldwide, alongside Hasbro and Mattel. The company focuses on creating unique and innovative products for its consumers, and to bend established conventions within the industry; its slogan, &quot;Break out of the box&quot; was made in reference to this.

===Subsidiaries of Bandai===

Bandai Spirits Co., Ltd. produces figurines and plastic models targeted towards older demographics, utilizing popular licenses such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Kirby&quot;, Disney, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Hatsune Miku&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Demon Slayer&quot;, &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Super Sentai&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, and &quot;My Hero Academia&quot;. 

Bandai produces confectioneries, board games, and capsule toys through its subsidiary MegaHouse Corporation, which also releases toys and figurines under its MegaToy label. MegaHouse also holds the license for the Rubik&#x27;s Cube in Japan, and has created multiple variations of the toy specifically for Japanese audiences. Manga series, television shows, and character-themed products are created by the Plex subsidiary.

<doc id="292756" wikidata="Q3765011" url="?curid=292756" title="Shannon switching game">
<text>The Shannon switching game is a connection game for two players, invented by American mathematician and electrical engineer Claude Shannon, the &quot;father of information theory&quot;, some time before 1951. Two players take turns coloring the edges of an arbitrary graph. One player has the goal of connecting two distinguished vertices by a path of edges of their color. The other player aims to prevent this by using their color instead (or, equivalently, by erasing edges). The game is commonly played on a rectangular grid; this special case of the game was independently invented by American mathematician David Gale in the late 1950s and is known as Gale or Bridg-It.

== Rules ==

The game is played on a finite graph with two special nodes, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Each edge of the graph can be either colored or removed. The two players are called &quot;Short&quot; and &quot;Cut&quot;, and alternate moves. On Cut&#x27;s turn, Cut deletes from the graph a non-colored edge of their choice. On Short&#x27;s turn, Short colors any edge still in the graph. If Cut manages to turn the graph into one where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are no longer connected, Cut wins. If Short manages to create a colored path from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, Short wins. The game always terminates after a finite number of moves, and one of the two players has to win. Either Short, Cut, or the player moving first is guaranteed the existence of a winning strategy on any given graph.

The &quot;Short&quot; and &quot;Cut&quot; games are a duality; that is, the game can be restated so that both players have the same goal: to secure a certain edge set with distinguished edge &quot;e&quot;. Short tries to secure the edge set that with &quot;e&quot; makes up a circuit, while Cut tries to secure an edge set that with &quot;e&quot; makes up a cutset, the minimal set of edges that connect two subgraphs.

==Variants==

Versions of the Shannon switching game played on a directed graph and an oriented matroid have been described for theoretical purposes; but no corresponding commercial games have been published.

===Gale===

In this game invented by American mathematician David Gale and described in Martin Gardner&#x27;s column in &quot;Scientific American&quot; Oct. 1958, two grids of differently-colored dots are overlaid at an offset. One player links orthogonally adjacent dots on one grid, and the other player uses the other. One player attempts to link the top of their grid to the bottom, while the other tries to link their left side to the right. The game is equivalent to the Shannon switching game played on a rectangular grid. No draw can result; the first player can always win with correct play.

A commercial board game implementing the scheme was marketed in 1960 by Hassenfeld Brothers under the name Bridg-It. The game consisted of a plastic board with two interleaved 5x6 rectangular grids of pedestals (one set yellow, the other red), two sets of 20 each red and yellow plastic bridges, and matching pegs to mount them on. Players alternate placing a bridge across any two adjacent pedestals of matching color until one player connects the two opposite sides of the board marked in the player&#x27;s color. A variant of the game is described in the instructions: each player gets a limited number of bridges, say 10. If neither player has won when all the bridges are placed, a player in his turn, may reposition one of his bridges until a winner results. The game is long out of production.

An electronic implementation of the Game of Gale is available in the Ludii Games Portal.

==Relationship to other games==
The Shannon switching game can be seen as a special case of a Maker-Breaker game, in which the winning patterns for the Maker are connecting paths.

A weakly-related connection game Hex is played on a grid of hexagons, and has 6-connectivity. Generalized Hex is played on a graph, just like the Shannon game, but instead of coloring the edges, in Hex the players color the vertices. These games have completely different structure and properties.

Another connectivity game played with paper and pencil on a rectangular array of dots (or graph paper) is the children&#x27;s game of &quot;dots and boxes&quot;. Players alternate drawing in a vertical or horizontal line connecting any two adjacent dots. When a line completes a square, the player initials the square. After all the lines have been filled in, the player who has taken the most squares is the winner.

An extension of Gale, called Qua, is played by three players on a 3D game board cube composed of a grid of N3 cells. N is an odd number equal to the number of cells along the edges of the game board cube. The initial Qua Cube game board layout and rules are described at its Board Game Geek entry.

==Computational complexity==

An explicit solution for the undirected switching game was found in 1964 for any such game using matroid theory. &quot;Short&quot; should aim for a position in which there exists a set of vertices formula_1 including the two distinguished vertices, as well as two disjoint subsets of the remaining unchosen edges supported on formula_1, such that either of the two subsets (together with already chosen edges) would connect all vertices in formula_1. If &quot;Short&quot; can make a move that results in a position with this property, then &quot;Short&quot; can win regardless of what the other player does; otherwise, &quot;Cut&quot; can win.
Unlike some other connection games, which can be PSPACE hard, optimal moves for the undirected switching game can be found in polynomial time per move. After removing from the graph the edges chosen by &quot;Cut&quot;, and contracting the edges chosen by &quot;Short&quot;, the resulting graph is a minor of the starting graph. The problem of testing for the existence of two disjoint trees, each connecting the distinguished vertices, can be represented as a matroid partitioning problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. Alternatively, it is possible to solve the same problem using network flow algorithms.

<text>William Alfred Higinbotham (October 22, 1910 – November 10, 1994) was an American physicist. A member of the team that developed the first nuclear bomb, he later became a leader in the nonproliferation movement. He also has a place in the history of video games for his 1958 creation of &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, the first interactive analog computer game and one of the first electronic games to use a graphical display.

==Early life==
Higinbotham was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in Caledonia, New York. His father was a minister in the Presbyterian Church. He earned his undergraduate degree from Williams College in 1932 and his studies at Cornell University. He worked on the radar system at MIT from 1941 to 1943.

==Career==
During World War II, he was working at Los Alamos Laboratory and headed the lab&#x27;s electronics group in the later years of the war, where his team developed electronics for the first atomic bomb. His team created the bomb&#x27;s ignition mechanism as well as measuring instruments for the device. Higinbotham also created the radar display for the experimental B-28 bomber. Following his experience with nuclear weapons, Higinbotham helped found the nuclear nonproliferation group Federation of American Scientists, serving as its first chairman and executive secretary. From 1974 until his death in 1994, Higinbotham served as the technical editor of the &quot;Journal of Nuclear Materials Management&quot;, published by the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management. 

In 1947, Higinbotham took a position at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he worked until his retirement in 1984.
In 1958, as Head of the Instrumentation Division at Brookhaven, he created a computer game called &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; for the laboratory&#x27;s annual exposition. A tennis simulator displayed on an oscilloscope, the game is credited with being one of the first video games. The game took Higinbotham a few weeks to complete, and was a popular attraction at the show. It was such a hit that Higinbotham created an expanded version for the 1959 exposition; this version allowed the gravity level to be changed so players could simulate tennis on Jupiter and the Moon. Higinbotham never patented &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, though he obtained over 20 other patents during his career.

He recalled in 1983,
==Legacy==
In the 1980s, critics and historians began to recognize the significance of &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; in the development of video games. In 1983, David Ahl, who had played the game at the Brookhaven exhibition as a teenager, wrote a cover story for &quot;Creative Computing&quot; in which he dubbed Higinbotham the &quot;Grandfather of Video Games&quot;. Independently, Frank Lovece interviewed Higinbotham for a story on the history of video games in the June 1983 issue of &quot;Video Review&quot;.

In 2011, Stony Brook University founded the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection, managed by Head of Special Collections and University Archives Kristen Nyitray and Associate Professor of Digital Cultural Studies Raiford Guins. The Collection is explicitly dedicated to &quot;documenting the material culture of screen-based game media&quot;, and in specific relation to Higinbotham: &quot;collecting and preserving the texts, ephemera, and artifacts that document the history and work of early game innovator and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist William A. Higinbotham, who in 1958 invented the first interactive analog computer game, &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;.&quot; As part of preserving the history of &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, the Collection is producing a documentary on the history of the game and its reconstruction by Peter Takacs, physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Higinbotham remained little interested in video games, preferring to be remembered for his work in nuclear nonproliferation. After his death, as requests for information on &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; increased, his son William B. Higinbotham told Brookhaven: &quot;It is imperative that you include information on his nuclear nonproliferation work. That was what he wanted to be remembered for.&quot; For this work the Federation of American Scientists named their headquarters Higinbotham Hall in 1994.

<doc id="292760" wikidata="Q1977455" url="?curid=292760" title="Neo Geo Pocket Color">
<text>The (NGPC) is a 16-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured by SNK, released on March 19, 1999 in Japan with international markets following in August that year. It is an upgrade of the original Neo Geo Pocket, which was released in 1998 and mainly sold in Japan; the Color features a color display instead of a monochrome one, and is fully backward compatible. 

The Pocket and Pocket Color were SNK&#x27;s first handhelds; its library mainly consists of conversions from the company&#x27;s well-known arcade franchises from the Neo Geo, such as &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown!&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters R-1.&quot; The Neo Geo Pocket Color faced tough competition against Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color, leading to the system&#x27;s discontinuation in the West by mid-2000, and continued to be marketed in Japan until SNK&#x27;s bankruptcy in October 2001. Despite being a commercial failure, the platform has been well regarded for a number of highly-acclaimed exclusive games, as well as the device&#x27;s arcade-style microswitched joystick. 

==History==

=== Monochrome system ===
SNK, creators of the hugely successful Neo Geo and its franchises, announced the Neo Geo Pocket in 1998 as the company&#x27;s first foray in the handheld video gaming market, which had been dominated at the time by Nintendo and its Game Boy. An SNK spokesperson commented that the Pocket&#x27;s target audience was &quot;slightly different&quot; than Game Boy&#x27;s.

The monochrome Neo Geo Pocket debuted in Japan in late 1998 and was primarily sold in Japan and Hong Kong. It was sold with eight titles at launch. The system and all five English games saw limited distribution in the west, where it could be ordered directly from SNK USA.

SNK released the Neo Geo Pocket in eight color variations: Platinum Blue, Platinum Silver, Platinum White, Carbon Black, Maple Blue, Camouflage Blue, Camouflage Brown, and Crystal White. The Neo Geo Pocket received the Good Design Award in 1998.

=== Color model ===
The Neo Geo Pocket only managed lower-than-expected sales and after only a few months in the market was discontinued and replaced by the Neo Geo Pocket Color, an upgraded version featuring a non-backlit, full color display. The Color was announced in January 1999 and released in Japan in March 1999 with seven launch titles. It was conceived shortly after Nintendo released the color display capable Game Boy Color. In the domestic market it also competed against Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan, a system that retailed for significantly cheaper than SNK&#x27;s product.

===U.S. release and marketing===

The U.S. version of the Neo Geo Pocket Color had an exclusive launch on the website eToys in August 1999. eToys also sold the initial launch titles in the plastic snap lock cases. The system debuted in the United States with six launch titles (twenty promised by end of year) and retail price of $69.95. Six different unit colors were available: Camouflage Blue, Carbon Black, Crystal White, Platinum Blue, Platinum Silver, and Stone Blue. In its first two months, the NGPC sold a successful 25,000 units.

Prior to SNK&#x27;s acquisition by Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was being advertised on U.S. television and units were being sold nationwide at Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and other major retail chains. For the Christmas Holiday season in 1999, SNK spent $4 million on television advertisements that aired on channels including MTV, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.

By May 2000, the NGPC had a 2% market share in the U.S. handheld console market; although tiny compared to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, it was enough to turn a profit for SNK USA.

===New model===

On 21 October 1999, a redesigned, slimmer version called New Neo Geo Pocket Color was released in Japan, selling at ¥6800. It is 13% smaller than the original Neo Geo Pocket Color, with dimensions 125 x 73 x 27 mm, and also features improved sound output.

=== Financial troubles and Aruze ===
After a good sales start in both the U.S. and Japan with 14 launch titles (a record at the time), subsequent low retail support in the U.S., lack of communication with third-party developers by SNK&#x27;s American management, the popularity of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise and anticipation of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance, and strong competition from Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan in Japan, led to a sales decline in both regions.

Meanwhile, SNK had been in financial trouble for at least a year; the company soon collapsed, and was purchased by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze in January 2000. However, Aruze did not support SNK&#x27;s video game business enough, leading to SNK&#x27;s original founder and several other employees leaving to form a new company, BrezzaSoft. Eventually on June 13, 2000, Aruze decided to quit the North American and European markets, marking the end of SNK&#x27;s worldwide operations and the discontinuation of Neo Geo hardware and software there. The Neo Geo Pocket Color (and other SNK/Neo Geo products) did however, last until 2001 in Japan. It was SNK&#x27;s last video game console, as the company went bankrupt on October 30, 2001.

===Post-Western discontinuation===

In June 2000, Aruze (parent of SNK) decided to discontinue all SNK operations outside Japan. As a result, remaining stock was bought back by SNK for repackaging in Asia. SNK were recalling most of the back-stock of systems and games to be flashed and re-sold in Asia where the system would continue to be sold and supported. Some of the back-stock of American NGPC hardware and software began to resurface on the American and Asian markets in 2003. These units frequently appeared bundled with six games stripped of their cases and manuals. Two games often included, &quot;Faselei!&quot; and &quot;The Last Blade: Beyond the Destiny&quot; were never previously released in United States, meaning that they have no U.S.-localized box or manual; however, these titles did receive a European release, incorporating an English translation.

After the bankruptcy of SNK on October 30, 2001, the intellectual property rights were collectively transferred to the successor company SNK Playmore (later the second generation SNK), but the development of Neo Geo Pocket Color was discontinued after bankruptcy.

==Features==

The Neo Geo Pocket Color design sports two face buttons on the right hand side of the system, and an eight-direction microswitched digital D-pad on the left. It is horizontally designed like the Game Gear, as opposed to the Game Boy&#x27;s vertical setup and the WonderSwan&#x27;s hybrid of both. Upgraded from the Neo Geo Pocket, it has a color screen in the middle.

Similar to the Game Boy and its successors, the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, the Neo Geo Pocket Color does not have a back-lit screen, and games can only be played in a well-lit area. Like the Game.com before it, the Neo Geo Pocket Color uses a CR2032 battery to retain backup memory and keep the clock active, as well as the usual AA batteries to power the system during usage. The Neo Geo Pocket Color has no regional lockout.

The system has an on-board language setting, and games display text in the language selected (provided the cartridge supports that language). Other settings include time and date, and the system can provide customized horoscopes when one&#x27;s birth date is entered.

Cables for linking multiple systems were available, as well as a cable to connect the NGPC and the Dreamcast, as part of a partnership between SNK and Sega. Games that featured this option include &quot;King of Fighters R-2&quot; (links with &quot;King of Fighters &#x27;99 Dream Match&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters Evolution&quot;); &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium&quot; (links with &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot;); &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; (links with &quot;King of Fighters Evolution&quot;); &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters 2 Clash Expand Edition&quot; (links with &quot;Capcom vs SNK&quot;) and &quot;Cool Cool Jam&quot; (links with &quot;Cool Cool Toon&quot;).

At the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show, SNK presented a wireless adaptor for Neo Geo Pocket Color units to wirelessly communicate with one another.

==Technical specifications and Comparison table==

==Game library==
Only nine games were released for the original monochrome Neo Geo Pocket model, all of which are playable on the Neo Geo Pocket Color through backward compatibility. Six of these nine games later received updated color re-releases for the Pocket Color. A selection of Pocket Color games can also be played in monochrome on the original system.

A total of 73 games were released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Most of the system&#x27;s games were produced by SNK themselves, featuring well-received titles from franchises such as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Metal Slug&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. Several large third-party developers also contributed to the system; the most well known of these is Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure&quot;, a title heavily based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; that is often considered one of the greatest games produced for the system. Taito contributed a port of their successful arcade game &quot;Densha de Go! 2&quot; and &quot;Puzzle Bobble Mini&quot;, also known as &quot;Bust-A-Move Pocket&quot;. Capcom worked in conjunction with SNK on several crossover games featuring their characters, including &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium&quot; and the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot; series of games. Namco published a conversion of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, which came with a plastic cross ring that restricted the system&#x27;s clicky stick to four directions; this version is often seen as one of the best home ports of the game to be released. Compile, Data East and ADK also produced ports of &quot;Puyo Pop&quot;, &quot;Magical Drop&quot; and &quot;Crush Roller&quot; respectively. Success published &quot;&quot;, a successful port of the arcade game of the same name.

=== Cartridges ===
Similar to the Neo Geo AES console, Neo Geo Pocket Color games were packaged in large clamshell-like black cases, fitted with bright, colorful cover art on them. As a way to reduce costs, in North America the games were instead shipped in cardboard boxes, a move that has been negatively received due to their general poor quality. Japanese games were later released in the same cardboard boxes, while all European releases used the clamshell cases. Towards the end of the system&#x27;s short lifespan in North America, games were often bundled together in blister packs and sold in stores to clear out inventory, often including previously-unreleased titles such as &quot;Faselei!&quot;. Neo Geo Pocket cartridges are smaller than Game Boy cartridges.

=== Re-releases ===
Several Neo Geo Pocket Color games were re-released for the first time via emulation on Nintendo Switch, beginning with &quot;Samurai Shodown! 2&quot; in 2019 as a pre-order incentive for &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; (2019). These re-releases were later compiled into &quot;Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 1&quot; (2021) and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; (2022), which were also released for Windows.

==Reception==
SNK sold over 25,000 Neo Geo Pocket Color systems in Japan and over 100,000 in Europe by the end of 1999. By May of 2000, the Neo Geo Pocket Color retained a 2% market share in the North American handheld market; although minuscule compared to the Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color, it was enough to turn a profit for SNK America.

Retrospective feedback for the Neo Geo Pocket Color has been positive. &quot;USGamer&quot; writer Jeremy Parish considers it an important and influential handheld for being a &quot;technological bridge&quot; between the 8-bit portable era and the Game Boy Advance, and for its &quot;clicky stick&quot; having been used for modern video game consoles. He praised the game&#x27;s small library for its quality and wide selection of genres, specifically titles such as &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot;, &quot;Sonic Pocket Adventure&quot;, &quot;Magical Drop&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and for the system&#x27;s build quality being robust and well-built. Parish blamed the system&#x27;s commercial failure on both SNK&#x27;s large lack of retail presence and for Aruze acquiring the company in 2000, concluding the article with: &quot;Neo Geo Pocket Color&#x27;s life may have been painfully brief, but it was nevertheless memorable for those who experienced it. Perhaps all the more so for the system&#x27;s brevity, in fact.&quot; Ryan Lamble of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; felt that the Neo Geo Pocket Color was the best rival to Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color for its &quot;brilliant&quot; game library, design and overall quality. Lamble expressed somber towards the system&#x27;s early defeat in the handheld market, saying: &quot;It was a premature end for a system that, although doomed to remain a distant second to the Game Boy, could have forged a great little niche of its own.&quot; &quot;NintendoLife&quot;″s Damien McFerran said that both it and the WonderSwan served as some of the most &quot;interesting challengers&quot; towards Nintendo. He commended the system for its game library and clamshell boxes, hardware capabilities, battery life and lasting legacy on future systems, writing: &quot;Like the WonderSwan, the Neo Geo Pocket Color may not have succeeded in its goal of wrestling market share away from Nintendo, but that doesn&#x27;t automatically mean it was a failure. Many fans will argue that the quality of the software available was far in advance of that on the Game Boy Color, and the fantastic controls, amazing battery life, cool PDA features and excellent screen combine to make a system which is still hard to put down, even today.&quot;

<doc id="292764" wikidata="Q1185221" url="?curid=292764" title="List of Christian democratic parties">
<text>Christian democratic parties are political parties that seek to apply Christian principles to public policy. The underlying Christian democracy movement emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of Catholic social teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, though in a number of countries its Christian ethos has been diluted by secularisation. In practice, Christian democracy is often considered centre-right on cultural, social and moral issues, but centre-left &quot;with respect to economic and labor issues, civil rights, and foreign policy&quot; as well as the environment, generally supporting a social market economy. Christian democracy can be seen as either conservative, centrist, or liberal / left of, right of, or center of the mainstream political parties depending on the social and political atmosphere of a given country and the positions held by individual Christian democratic parties. In Europe, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist socialists, Christian democratic parties are moderately conservative overall, whereas in the very different cultural and political environment of Latin America they tend to lean to the left. It is the dominant centre-right political movement in Europe, but by contrast, Christian democratic parties in Latin America tend to be left-leaning. Christian democracy includes elements common to several other political ideologies, including conservatism, liberalism, and social democracy. In the United States, Christian democratic parties of Europe and Latin America, deemed conservative and liberal respectively in their geopolitical regions, are both generally regarded as farther left-wing of the mainstream.

<text>Diana Kennedy (; 3 March 1923 – 24 July 2022) was a British food writer. The preeminent English-language authority on Mexican cuisine, Kennedy was known for her nine books on the subject, including &quot;The Cuisines of Mexico&quot;, which changed how Americans view Mexican cuisine. Her cookbooks are based on her fifty years of travelling in Mexico, interviewing and learning from several types of cooks from virtually every region of the nation.

Her documentation of native edible plants has been digitized by National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity. Due to her style of work, Kennedy was called a &quot;culinary anthropologist&quot; and self-identified as an &quot;ethno-gastronomer&quot;. Kennedy received numerous awards for her work, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle from the Mexican government, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire.

==Life==
Kennedy was born Diana Southwood in Loughton, Essex, in the southeast of England, on 3 March 1923. Her father was a salesman, and her mother a teacher.

Kennedy attended South Hampstead High School. She did not go on to university because of World War II and instead, at age 19, joined the Women&#x27;s Timber Corps: a civilian organisation that took over forestry duties from men who had gone off to fight. Kennedy did not like cutting down trees, so she was assigned to measuring tree trunks instead.

In 1953, Kennedy emigrated to Canada, where she lived for three years while doing a number of jobs, including running a film library and selling Wedgewood china.

On a last-minute decision, Kennedy decided to visit Haiti in 1957. There she met Paul P. Kennedy, a correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The two moved to Mexico in 1957, and there they married some time later, remaining together until his death from cancer in 1967, aged 62. Kennedy had no children, but two step-daughters from Paul&#x27;s first marriage.

In Mexico, Kennedy fell in love with the food, and spent the rest of her career working for its preservation and promotion. When she was not teaching, she was either writing or working in the kitchen on recipes. She was noted for her brusque, no-nonsense demeanour, having pulled out tape recorders when police have tried to get bribes from her on her Mexican travels.

She visited every state in Mexico, and used diverse forms of transportation, from buses, to donkeys to her Nissan pickup truck with no power steering (and a shovel to dig it out of the mud). She travelled to isolated areas of Mexico to visit markets and cooks to ask about cooking ingredients and methods. In the 1970s, she decided to build her house near Zitácuaro, Michoacán, in an area with orchards. The land allowed her to grow many of her own ingredients. While she was not technophobic, she was against electronic forms of cookbooks, believing in the need to make notes over printed recipes.

Kennedy died at her home on 24 July 2022, at the age of 99. Loughton Town Council has installed a commemorative blue plaque at her former home, 19 York Hill, Loughton.

==First exposure to Mexican cuisine==
During her first years in Mexico City with her husband in the late 1950s, she learned quickly that the best food in Mexico was not in fancy restaurants but rather in markets, traditional family restaurants called &quot;fondas&quot; and in homes. In addition, she was impressed with what she saw in local, traditional markets. She also came to appreciate that recipes varied from region to region, travelling with her husband when he was on assignment, and he would collect recipes when she could not accompany him. In Mexico City, she asked her friends about cooking these dishes, and was referred to their maids. These maids then encouraged her to visit their villages, which she subsequently would. Kennedy also began researching documentation on Mexican cuisine, and credited the work of Josefina Velázquez de León for her having been a pioneer, who had done similar work collecting recipes by visiting church groups. Kennedy&#x27;s focus became the food that was not documented, such as that found in villages, markets and homes, eventually to preserve native ingredients and traditional recipes being lost as Mexicans move from rural areas to urban centers.

Kennedy began to share what she learned informally among expats and her husband&#x27;s colleagues when they came to Mexico. This included taking women on tours of traditional markets, including the stands with animal heads, which shocked Americans. When &quot;New York Times&quot; food writer Craig Claiborne was in town, she tried to give him a book of Mexican recipes, but he refused it, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll only read a Mexican cookbook once you have written one&quot;.&#x27; At the time, Kennedy thought this was a crazy idea.

==Cooking classes and cookbook writing==

At the end of 1965, Kennedy and her husband moved to New York City, where he died the following year from cancer. In 1969, Kennedy began to teach classes in Mexican cooking in her apartment in the Upper West Side, with the encouragement of Craig Claiborne. This was the beginning of a decades-long teaching career, which began as her own venture, then in collaboration with other institutions such as the Peter Kump Cooking School in New York, as well as offering Mexican cooking &quot;boot camps&quot; at her home in Michoacán. Her classes focused on the most traditional cooking techniques and ingredients. For example, while most Mexican cooks now use pre-ground corn or corn flour, she insisted on teaching students how to soak kernels with lime overnight, remove the skins and grind with lard to make corn dough (&quot;masa&quot;). She had the most success with this since the 1970s, when cooking schools grew in popularity.

The work with the cooking classes led to her first cookbook. From her time in Mexico City to her time in New York City, she had been supported in her work with Mexican cooking by Claiborne. She did not have experience writing, but after Fran McCullough, poetry editor at Harper and Row at the time, took one of her classes, she offered to help Kennedy put the book together and eventually collaborated on Kennedy&#x27;s first five books. To complete the first one, Kennedy decided to return to Mexico to do further research. This research, she believed, was what separated her from other cookbook writers in that she took the time and effort to explore Mexico and do field research on how the cuisine varies. Her inexperience led to rewriting the book several times but the result was &quot;The Cuisines of Mexico&quot;, published in 1972. This book became a best-seller and is still one of the most authoritative single volumes on Mexican cooking. It began to change Americans&#x27; understanding of Mexican food, expanding it beyond Tex-Mex into the various regional cuisines and dishes, and is the basis of establishing authentic food in the U.S. The 1986 revision of the book is still in print.

She later published eight other volumes on Mexican cooking, a number of which have been translated into Spanish. Her initial influence is the work of Josefina Velázquez de León, but she credited much of her writing style to the work of English cookbook author Elizabeth David. Kennedy did not consider herself a writer, but rather as someone who documented what she saw in about fifty years of travelling Mexico, including remote areas, to talk to cooks of all kinds. She financed her own book research and travels, often sleeping in her old Nissan truck. She preferred the food of central and southern Mexico, which is more complex and varied. She registered a wide variety of edible plants, and included more exotic recipes such as those using brains, iguanas, insects and even whole animals such as oxen. She regularly interviewed and cooked with a variety of cooks, but especially those from rural areas, cooking for family and friends. She even apprenticed in a bakery in Mexico City to learn the all-male trade. Her preference for traditional home cooking means that her books revolve around foods made with corn dough; she dedicated an entire book to tortillas. Her insistence on field research led to books full of picaresque stories. It also led to unconventional formats. Her book on Oaxaca is not divided by types of dishes but rather the eleven regions of the state.

Her work made her one of the foremost authorities on Mexican cuisine, not only in authentic ingredients and techniques, but the loss and disuse of various ingredients as Mexico shifts from a primarily rural to primarily urban society. One loss is the use of local and regional produce. &quot;As far as I can see,&quot; said Kennedy, &quot;I write oral history that is disappearing with climate change, agribusiness, and loss of cultivated lands. In the past people had a sense of taste and a sense of where they came from. They were conscious of what they were eating and what they consumed and about not wasting.&quot; In the introduction of &quot;Oaxaca al Gusto&quot;, Kennedy wrote ... &quot;Trying to record the ethnic foods as well as the more sophisticated recipes of the urban centers presented an enormous challenge and responsibility … I am sure that if I had known what it would entail to travel almost constantly through the year, and often uncomfortably, to research, record, photograph and then cook and eat over three hundred recipes, I might never have had the courage to start the project in the first place...&quot;

In addition to travelling in Mexico, Kennedy&#x27;s work required frequent travel abroad, especially to the United States, where she gave classes and spoke about Mexican cuisine. She starred in a 26-part television series on Mexican cooking for The Learning Channel. She was an influence in the development of Mexican cooking in the United States and on chefs such as Rick Bayless. She taught Paula Wolfert, who recommended her to her editor. Chefs in Texas and New Mexico who came to prominence in the mid 1980s credit her work as a base for their Southwestern U.S. cuisine. However, Kennedy dismissed most chefs doing Mexican food during her time because they had not done the travelling and research that she had and innovated rather than preserved original methods. She criticized chefs who waste food and who encourage the unnecessary use of plastic, foil, and other items that only get thrown in the trash. She also did not like culinary writers who do not live in Mexico, but question her authority because of her ethnicity. Some of her conflicts received significant press: she threw chef Rick Bayless out of her car for being &quot;brash&quot;; her criticisms of Maricel Presilla were pungent. She was careful to credit the people who have shared their understanding of Mexican regional foods with her, including, for example, anthropologist and restaurateur Raquel Torres Cerdán.

Her influence was not limited to the United States as her work was very well received in Mexico. She received numerous awards in this country including the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which is the highest honour awarded to foreigners in the country. The National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) has digitized her research including a vast collection of recipes, drawings and notes both on cooking and native edible plants, resulting in a section of their website dedicated to her.

==Quinta Diana/Diana Kennedy Center==
Kennedy permanently returned to Mexico in 1976, initially living in Mexico City. In 1980, she moved to eastern Michoacán, about three hours west of the capital, after a friend introduced her to the area. There she bought property which she initially called &quot;Quinta Diana&quot; near the small village of San Francisco Coatepec de Morelos (colloquially known as San Pancho), in the municipality of Zitácuaro.

Her homestead was on a forested hill at the end of a long dirt road, and could be reached only by pickup or four-wheel drive. However, this did not stop a steady stream of visitors from arriving at her cobblestone driveway.

Quinta Diana is an ecologically minded establishment. Kennedy stated in &quot;My Mexico&quot; (1998) that she wanted a house built of local materials and a lifestyle similar to that of her neighbors. The nearly three hectares are almost off the grid; the house is made of adobe. It was built by local architect, Armando Cuevas, and is centered on a large boulder, almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, which Kennedy decided not to remove from the site. Around the boulder is an atrium adjacent to the open living room, from which stairways lead to various parts of the house. In her home Kennedy tested recipes dictated by the seasons, working often with what grew on her property. Her cooking spaces consist of an outdoor space with wood-fired grills and adobe beehive-shaped ovens, and an indoor kitchen, which she called her &quot;laboratory&quot;. The latter centers on a long cement counter, which is covered in blue and white tiles, with inlaid gas burners. This kitchen is filled with various ingredients and implements including burnished copper and clay pots on the walls, herbs and vegetables in wicker baskets, various varieties of dried chili peppers, and her own condiments, including a pineapple vinegar similar to balsamic. For her table, she has authentic Talavera pottery from Puebla, and near the kitchen window, there are binoculars and a bird book.

Her bedroom is upstairs, which opens to her study, filled with books and papers about, and with windows on three sides to look out over the gardens towards the mountains.

Kennedy grew much of her own food organically. She had a greenhouse to grow various edible plants, such as herbs and even coffee. The gardens include grapefruit, apricot and fig trees, chayote vines from Veracruz, and a section dedicated to the corn she used for masa. Manure is the fertilizer. All the water used on the property is from tanks that collect wastewater, with a patch of land serving as a filter for wastewater. Much of the energy is solar.

Since 1980, money from her books and speaking engagements have funded the property and its operations. However, Kennedy established the Diana Kennedy Foundation to have tax-free status with the Mexican government, and to work on projects focusing on the environment as well as food. Her interest in the environment was related to food in the sense that when the environment is destroyed, foods disappear. It also had roots in her mother&#x27;s love for nature and experience with scarcity in wartime England. She argued against the use of genetically modified seeds, excessive use of packaging and use of bleach for white linens in hotels and restaurants. The Foundation is also geared toward preservation, not only of Mexico&#x27;s food heritage, but of Quinta Diana, with its immense collection of Mexican cookbooks, other publications and pottery, along with the gardens.

==Recognition==
Kennedy was called the &quot;grand dame of Mexican cooking&quot;, with comparisons to Julia Child in the United States and Elizabeth David in the UK, and a &quot;dogged, obsessive pop anthropologist.&quot; Her comparison to Julia Child comes from her promotion of Mexican cuisine, much the way that Child did for French cuisine; however, while flattered, she dismissed it. She was a common name among foodies in the United States for decades, but did not receive notice in her native England until Prince Charles came to Quinta Diana in 2002, to eat and to appoint her a Member of the Order of the British Empire.

<text>The Christian Democratic Party (, , , KrF; ) is a Christian-democratic political party in Norway founded in 1933. The party is an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). It currently holds three seats in the Parliament, having won 3.8% of the vote in the 2021 parliamentary election. The current leader of the party is Dag Inge Ulstein.

The Christian Democrats&#x27; leader from 1983 to 1995, Kjell Magne Bondevik, was one of the most prominent political figures in modern Norway, serving as Prime Minister from 1997 to 2000 and 2001 to 2005. Under the old leadership of Bondevik and Valgerd Svarstad Haugland, the party to some extent moved in a more liberal direction. Due largely to their poor showing in the 2009 elections, the party has seen a conflict between its conservative and liberal wings. Until 2019, the leader was Knut Arild Hareide, who led the party into a more liberal direction as part of a &quot;renewal&quot; process, and introduced climate change and environmentalism as the party&#x27;s most important issues. However, the liberal turn ended in 2019 and the party has since moved sharply to the right. Hareide wanted the party to cooperate with the social democrats, but narrowly lost an internal struggle to the faction that wanted to collaborate with the right-wing and anti-immigrant Progress Party.

== History ==
The Christian Democratic Party was founded as a reaction to the growing secularism in Norway in the 1930s. Cultural and spiritual values were proposed as an alternative to political parties focusing on material values. The immediate cause of its foundation was the failure of Nils Lavik, a popular figure in the religious community, to be nominated as a candidate for the Liberal Party, for the parliamentary elections in 1933. In reaction to this, Kristelig Folkeparti was set up, with Lavik as their top candidate in the county of Hordaland. He succeeded in being elected to Stortinget, the Norwegian parliament. No other counties were contested. At the next elections, in 1936, the party also ran a common list with the Liberal Party in Bergen, and succeeded in electing two representatives from Hordaland with 20.9% of the local votes. In 1945, at the first elections after the Nazi occupation of Norway, the party was organised on a nationwide basis, and won 8 seats.

The Christian Democrats became part of a short-lived non-socialist coalition government along with the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party and the Centre Party in 1963. At the elections of 1965, these four parties won a majority of seats in Stortinget and ruled in a coalition government from 1965 to 1971.

The Christian Democrats opposed Norwegian membership in the European Community ahead of the referendum in 1972. The referendum gave a no-vote, and when the pro-EC Labour government resigned, a coalition government was formed among the anti-EC parties, the Christian Democrats, the Liberal Party and the Centre Party. Lars Korvald became the Christian Democrats&#x27; first prime minister for a year, until the elections of 1973 restored the Labour government.

The party&#x27;s historic membership numbers peaked with 69,000 members in 1980.

The 1981 elections left the non-socialists with a majority in parliament, but negotiations for a coalition government failed because of disagreement over the abortion issue. However, this issue was later toned down, and from 1983 to 1986 and 1989 to 1990, the Christian Democrats were part of coalitions with the Conservative Party and the Centre Party.

In 1997, the Christian Democrats received 13.7% of the votes, and got 25 seats in the Storting. Kjell Magne Bondevik served as prime minister between 1997 and 2000, in coalition with the Liberal Party and the Centre Party, and then between 2001 and 2005 with the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party.

In the 2005 election, the Christian Democrats received only 6.8%, and the party became part of the opposition in the Storting. In 2013, the Conservative Party and the Progress Party formed a new government based on a political agreement with the Christian Democrats and the Liberal party with confidence and supply. In the 2017 election, the party got only 4.2% and did not sign a new agreement, but got a politically strategic position as the conservative minority government mainly depended on their votes to get a majority.

In late 2018, the Christian Democrats were split over the question of a potential government participation and the future direction of the party. At a party meeting in early November 2018, the delegates were asked whether to stay in opposition or to join either a &quot;red&quot; or a &quot;blue&quot; government coalition with party leader Knut Arild Hareide favouring a centre-left government with Labour and Centre parties, and deputy leaders Olaug Bollestad and Kjell Ingolf Ropstad wanting to join the existing right-leaning cabinet of Erna Solberg. The delegates decided with a narrow majority of eight votes to join the existing Solberg&#x27;s Cabinet with Conservatives, Liberals and the Progress Party. In January 2019, after successful negotiations with the coalition parties the Christian Democrats eventually joined the government and Hareide resigned as party leader. In April 2019, 33-year-old Minister of Children and Family Kjell Ingolf Ropstad was elected new party leader.

The Christian Democrats failed to pass the 4% election threshold for leveling seats in the 2021 election and won only three seats in parliament. The party leader Ropstad, facing controversy over his use of a parliamentary commuter home, resigned from the cabinet and as party leader on 24 September and Olaug Bollestad assumed leadership of the party.

== Ideology ==
The Christian Democratic Party has been described as centrist and centre-right. The party holds European Christian democratic positions, including family values. While founded on the basis of advocating moral-cultural Christian issues, the party has broadened its political profile over time, although Christian values remain its core distinction. It is considered an overall centrist party, combining socially conservative views with more left-leaning economic positions.

===Religion===
As a party centred on Christian values, the party draws support from the Christian population. Their policies that support Christian values and oppose same-sex marriage appeal to the more conservative, religious base.

Geographically, the Christian Democrats enjoy their strongest support in the so-called Bible Belt, especially Southern Norway. In the 2005 elections, their best results were in Vest-Agder with 18.9% of the vote, compared to a national average of 6.8%.

Since the party was established, a declaration of Christian faith had been required for a person to be a representative in the party. Membership had no such requirement. The increase of support for the party from other religious groups, such as Muslims, stimulated efforts to abolish this rule. At the 2013 convention the rule was modified. The new rules require that representatives work for Christian values but do not require them to declare a Christian faith. This latter point was considered the &quot;last drop&quot; for some conservative elements of the party, who as a result broke away and founded The Christians Party. It has been claimed that KrF have lost votes to the Christians.

===Social values===
The Christian Democratic Party is generally socially conservative.

The party opposes euthanasia and abortion, except in cases of rape or when the mother&#x27;s life is at risk. The party supports accessibility to contraception as a way of lowering abortion rates.

KrF wishes to ban research on human foetuses and has expressed scepticism of proposals to liberalise biotechnology laws in Norway. Bondevik&#x27;s second government made the biotechnology laws of Norway among the strictest in the world, with support from the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party, but a 2004 case involving a child with thalassemia brought the laws under fire.

====LGBT rights====
On LGBT issues, the party supports permitting same-sex couples to live together but opposes same-sex marriage and adoption rights. The party has criticized the Polish government&#x27;s policy towards LGBT people, and supported the Norwegian government&#x27;s decision to withdraw financial support to Polish municipalities that have declared themselves as LGBT-free zones. The party&#x27;s leader at the time, Kjell Ingolf Ropstad, stated: &quot;To not be discriminated against because of one&#x27;s sexual orientation is a fundamental human right. Therefore, it is important that the government now is clear about the terms of receiving financial support through the EEA funds. We want to support a policy that protects diversity and freedom.&quot; The party maintains neutrality on the issue of gay clergy, calling that an issue for the Church.

As of 2024, the party promotes anti-gender and anti-trans rhetoric, attacking what they refer to as &quot;gender ideology.&quot;

=== Foreign policy===
In foreign policy, the party marks itself as a supporter of NATO and the European Economic Area (EEA) but they oppose Norwegian membership in the European Union (EU). The party supports Norway&#x27;s signature and ratification of the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and want stricter rules for Norwegian arms sales abroad. The party is supportive of Israel and Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

====Development aid====
Since the turn of the millennium, the Christian Democratic Party has had a major influence on development aid policy in Norway. The first Minister of International Development was Reidun Brusletten (KrF) in 1983. Hilde Frafjord Johnson held the position from 1997 to 2000 and again from 2001 to 2005, during Bondevik&#x27;s First and Second Cabinet.

Dag Inge Ulstein, the third Christian Democrat to hold the position, addressed the need to take care of vulnerable minorities in foreign policy and by the use of humanitarian aid. He described these group as: women, children, people with disabilities and sexual and religious minorities.

The Christian Democratic Party is a strong supporter of increased development aid and more cooperation with developing countries. They want 1 percent of the GNI to be spent on development aid, and a larger share of the sum to be spent on poverty reduction and climate change adaptation.

====COVID-19====
Ulstein has played a prominent role in the global handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on fair distribution of vaccines to poor and middle income countries. As Minister of International Development, he has been the governments spokesperson regarding Norway&#x27;s contribution in the global fight against COVID-19, which involves the contribution of 2.2 billion Norwegian kroner to vaccine development through CEPI, in March 2020, and Norway&#x27;s entry in the global vaccine cooperation COVAX in August 2020, as one of the first European countries.

In March 2021, it became clear that the Norwegian government had donated 700,000 vaccine doses to low income countries in February the previous year. This created big reactions from other parties, who thought Norway instead should have given the doses to the Norwegian population. The Christian Democratic Party received a lot of criticism, from among others, the leaders of the Progress Party and the Centre Party, Sylvi Listhaug and Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, respectively. Party leader, Kjell Ingolf Ropstad, condemned the criticism and stated: &quot;The last thing the world needs now is more egoism and competition between countries. Instead we need to help each other. We will not succeed in the fight against COVID-19 if we only say &quot;Norway first&quot;.

=== Immigration and refugees ===
On questions surrounding immigration, integration and refugee policy, the party has a liberal stance. The Christian Democratic Party wants to base Norway&#x27;s intake of refugees on the UN High Commissioner for Refugees&#x27; recommendations. In 2021, they announced that they want Norway to take in 5,000 refugees annually, plus 500 extra from the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos, Greece.

They have also criticized what they believe is an unfair distribution of refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war due to the fact that Syria&#x27;s neighbouring countries (Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon) have received a higher number of refugees than many European countries. Therefore, they want Norway, and western European countries at large, to retrieve a larger amount of refugees from Syria.

=== Climate change ===
The Christian Democratic Party describes climate change and global warming as one of humanity&#x27;s greatest challenges. They base their climate policy on climate research and the UN&#x27;s sustainability goals.

The Christian Democratic Party support international climate goals and climate agreements, like the Paris agreement. They want to cut Norwegian emissions of carbon by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and they aim for a climate-neutral Norway by 2050. They have addressed the need for restructuring in the Norwegian petroleum industry and want to end oil and gas exploration in new areas.

Protection of the vulnerable areas of Lofoten, Vesterålen and Senja from oil drilling, has been an important matter for the Christian Democratic Party. After the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election, Knut Arild Hareide, party leader at the time, announced that the Christian Democratic Party would withdraw their support of Solberg&#x27;s Cabinet if they opened the areas for oil drilling. When the Christian Democratic Party became part of Solberg&#x27;s coalition government in January 2019, it was decided that the areas were to be protected until the next election.

At the national congress in 2021, the party proposed the creation of a Norwegian climate fund. The goal of the fund was to outcompete the use of coal power, by investing in renewable energy in developing countries. The Christian Democrats got the proposal through in the Storting, and a few months later the government decided to establish a climate fund consisting of 1.15 billion dollars. Experts estimated that the fund could result in more than 10 billion dollars in private investment in renewable energy. The deputy leader of the Norwegian environmental organisation ZERO, Dagfrid Froberg, described the fund as: &quot;Maybe the most important Norwegian measurement in order to fight climate change.&quot;

The Christian Democratic Party wants increased funding of public transport projects outside Oslo, like the Bergen Light Rail. They want to accomplish this by making the government finance a larger share of the cost of developing local public transport systems, in order to make public transport more accessible and efficient, especially for people with disabilities.

<doc id="292774" wikidata="Q3028289" url="?curid=292774" title="Connectix Virtual Game Station">
<text>The Virtual Game Station (VGS, code named Bonestorm) was an emulator by Connectix that allows Sony PlayStation games to be played on a desktop computer. It was first released for the Macintosh, in 1999, after being previewed at Macworld/iWorld the same year by Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller. VGS was created by Aaron Giles. The recompiling CPU emulator was written by Eric Traut.

Released at a time when the Sony PlayStation was at its peak of popularity, Virtual Game Station was the first PlayStation emulator, for any platform, that enabled games to run at full speed on modestly powerful computer hardware, and the first that supported the vast majority of PlayStation games. It was advertised as running at full speed on the original 233 MHz iMac G3 system (relying on its built-in ATi graphics hardware).

The impact of this product changed the available Macintosh game library from a very small, select group to nearly the entire collection of PlayStation games. Graphics could be run full screen, at full speed. Several PlayStation-type hand controllers became available with VGS in mind. The only lacking features were the ability to receive DualShock force-feedback or use light-guns.

VGS was initially released for NTSC based PlayStation games but later versions were made for PAL based games. Like the PS1, the system was region locked, and copied games would not work either, although it didn&#x27;t take too long for the hacker community to release a &quot;Mod Chipped&quot; version. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 of VGS attempted to make &quot;modding&quot; more difficult but were soon modified as well.

VGS proved to be extremely popular, as it cost less than half the price of a PlayStation and did not require any extra hardware. VGS was later ported to Microsoft Windows. It was slightly less popular there due to competition with other emulators such as bleem!, though it did have better compatibility.

Sony perceived VGS as a threat, and filed a lawsuit against Connectix for copyright infringement. The case was eventually closed in favor of Connectix, but Connectix was unable to sell the software in the meantime because Sony had been awarded a temporary injunction. Soon thereafter, Sony purchased VGS from Connectix and discontinued it.

<text>The Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) was a North American Protestant denomination from 1946 to 1968 with Arminian theology, roots in the Mennonite and German Reformed communities, and close ties to Methodism. It was formed by the merger of a majority of the congregations of the Evangelical Church founded by Jacob Albright (excluding those that became the Evangelical Church of North America, along with the Evangelical Congregational Church) and the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution) (as opposed to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution), still extant without the parenthetical). The United Brethren and the Evangelical Association had considered merging off and on since the early 19th century because of their common emphasis on holiness and evangelism and their common German heritage. 

In 1968, the United States section of the EUB merged with the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church, while the Canadian section joined the United Church of Canada.

==History==
United Brethren in Christ was an American religious denomination which originated in the last part of the 18th century. Though not formally organized until 1800, the roots of the church reach back to 1767. In May of that year, a &quot;Great Meeting&quot; (part of an interdenominational revival movement) was held at a barn belonging to Isaac Long in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, near the village of Oregon. Martin Boehm (1725–1812), a Mennonite preacher, spoke of his becoming a Christian through crying out to God while plowing in the field. Philip William Otterbein (1726–1813), a German Reformed pastor at York, Pennsylvania, (and later of Baltimore), left his seat, embraced Boehm and said to him, &quot;Wir sind Brüder!&quot; (we are brethren!). The followers of Boehm and Otterbein formed a loose movement for many years. It spread to include German-speaking churches supplemented later by English-speaking followers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and later spread west into Ohio.

Pastor Otterbein, returned to Baltimore to the newly organized German Reformed congregation and built a brick Georgian-styled church with a bell tower southwest of Baltimore Town at South Sharp and West Conway Streets, later named Old Otterbein United Methodist Church, which had continued for two centuries in the Brethren denomination before their 1968 merger with the Methodists and is now the oldest active church and building in the city, whose name was also given to the surrounding restored historic neighborhood.

By 1800, they began a yearly conference. Thirteen ministers attended the first conference at the home of Peter Kemp in Frederick, Maryland. At that conference in 1800, they adopted a name, the United Brethren in Christ, and elected Boehm and Otterbein as bishops of the conference. The United Brethren Church claims this organization in 1800 as the first denomination to actually begin in the United States. The first delegated general conference met at Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, in 1815, and adopted a confession of faith (similar to one written by Otterbein in 1789), rules of order and a book of discipline, which were revised in 1885–1889, when women were first admitted to ordination.

The ecclesiastical polity of the church was Wesleyan and its theology Arminian. It variously practised believer&#x27;s baptism or infant baptism. Bishops were elected for four years.

The United Brethren took a strong stand against slavery, beginning around 1820. After 1837, slave owners were no longer allowed to remain as members of the United Brethren Church. The Evangelical United Brethren churches sustained a strong fellowship with Nazarene (believing) Jews. In 1853, the Home, Frontier, and Foreign Missionary Society was organized. Expansion occurred into the western United States, but the church&#x27;s stance against slavery limited expansion to the south.

By 1889, the United Brethren had grown to over 200,000 members with six bishops. In that same year they experienced a division. Denominational leaders desired to make three changes: to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference; to allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference; and to allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies such as the Freemasons. The denominational leadership made these changes, but the minority felt the changes violated the constitution because they were not made by the majority vote of all United Brethren members. One of the bishops, Milton Wright (the father of aviation pioneers Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright), disagreed with the actions of the majority. Bishop Wright and other conference delegates left the meeting and resumed the session elsewhere. They believed that the other delegates had violated the constitution (and, in effect, withdrawn from the denomination), and deemed themselves to be the true United Brethren Church. Therefore, the body initially known as the United Brethren in Christ of the Old Constitution, now called the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.

The majority branch had 3,732 organizations in 1906 with a total membership of 274,649. The denomination merged with the Evangelical Church in 1946 to form a new denomination known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB). This in turn merged in 1968 with The Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church (UMC).

== Missionary and educational establishments ==

This body carried on missions in West Africa (since 1855), Japan, China, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. It had a publishing house (1834) and two seminaries Bonebrake Theological Seminary (1871) at Dayton, Ohio, and Evangelical Theological Seminary (1873) in Naperville, IL. The EUB supported several colleges and universities including Otterbein University (1847) at Westerville, Ohio; Plainfield College (now North Central College) (1861) at Naperville, IL; Westfield College (1865) at Westfield, Illinois; Leander Clark College (1857) at Toledo, Iowa; York College (1890) at York, Nebraska; Western Union College (1900), renamed Westmar College (1948) at Le Mars, Iowa; Philomath College (1867) at Philomath, Oregon; Lebanon Valley College (1867) at Annville, Pennsylvania; Campbell College (1864) at Holton, Kansas, and Indiana Central College (later Indiana Central University and now the University of Indianapolis) (1907) at Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1946, with cooperation of three other denominations, it formed the United Andean Indian Mission, an agency that sent missionaries to Ecuador.

== Outside the United States ==
The EUB congregations in Canada joined the United Church of Canada in 1968, the largest Protestant denomination in Canada formed in 1925 by Presbyterians (70% came in), Methodists, and Congregationalists. In the Philippines, the EUB congregations joined the Philippine Methodist Church, Christian Church (Disciples), Presbyterian Church, Congregational Church, Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo, Iglesia Evangelica Nacional and some segments of the Iglesia Evangelica Metodista En Las Islas Filipinas (IEMELIF) to form the United Church of Christ in the Philippines

<doc id="292781" wikidata="Q119267" url="?curid=292781" title="Tiger Electronics">
<text>Tiger Electronics Ltd. (also known as Tiger and Tiger Toys) is an American toy manufacturer best known for its handheld electronic games, the Furby, the Talkboy, Giga Pets, the 2-XL robot, and audio games such as &quot;Brain Warp&quot; and the Brain Shift. When it was an independent company, Tiger Electronics Inc., its headquarters were in Vernon Hills, Illinois. It has been a subsidiary of Hasbro since 1998.

==History==
Gerald Rissman, Randy Rissman and Arnold Rissman founded the company in June 1978. It started with low-tech items like phonographs, then began developing handheld electronic games and educational toys. Prominent among these was the 2-XL Robot in 1978, and K28, Tiger&#x27;s Talking Learning Computer (1984) which was sold worldwide by Kmart and other chain stores. Tiger also achieved success with many simple handheld electronics games like &quot;Electronic Bowling&quot; and titles based on licenses, such as &quot;RoboCop&quot;, &quot;Terminator&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. An early 1990s hit was the variable-speed portable cassette player and recorder, the Talkboy (first seen in the 1992 movie &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;), followed by the Brain family of games which include games like &quot;Brain Bash&quot;, &quot;Brain Warp&quot;, and &quot;Brain Shift&quot;. It also licensed the Lazer Tag brand from its inventors, Shoot the Moon Products, which was born from the remnants of the Worlds of Wonder company.

The company&#x27;s cash cow through much of the 1990s was their line of licensed handheld LCD games. In a 1993 feature on these games, &quot;GamePro&quot; attributed their success to the following three factors:
*Tiger&#x27;s effective licensing. Director of marketing Tamara Lebovitz stated, &quot;We read all the magazines and talk to all the studios to keep on the cutting edge of what&#x27;s hot with kids.&quot; As a fairly small company at the time, Tiger was able to pursue desirable licenses quickly and aggressively. This allowed them to release licensed games while the properties they were licensed from were still at the peak of their popularity.
*The low price per game. Tiger handheld games sold for roughly $20 each. By comparison, most handheld games of the time cost over $30, and required a separately sold system (an additional $50 or more) to play it on.
*The simplistic, addictive gameplay of the games. While older gamers tended to find Tiger handheld games one-dimensional and boring, for kids aged five to twelve years old, their simple and easy-to-learn mechanics were more appealing than other video games of the time, which were often frustratingly difficult and dauntingly complex for younger children.

In the fall of 1994, Tiger introduced a specialized line of their handheld LCD games, called Tiger Barcodzz. These were barcode games which read any barcode and used it to generate stats for the player character. The line was a major success in Japan, where there were even reality shows based around gamers competing to find the best barcodes to defeat other players. Tiger produced a version of &quot;Lights Out&quot; around 1995. In 1997 it produced a quaint fishing game called &quot;Fishing Championship&quot;, in the shape of a reduced fishing rod. Another 1990s creation was Skip-It.

In 1995, Tiger acquired the Texas Instruments toy division. Tiger agreed to manufacture and market electronic toys for Hasbro and Sega.

===Merging with Hasbro===
Tiger Electronics has been part of the Hasbro toy company since 1998. Hasbro paid approximately $335 million for the acquisition. In 2000, Tiger was licensed to provide a variety of electronics with the Yahoo! brand name, including digital cameras, webcams, and a &quot;Hits Downloader&quot; that made music from the Internet (mp3s, etc.) accessible through Tiger&#x27;s assorted &quot;HitClips&quot; players. Tiger also produces the long-lasting iDog Interactive Music Companion, the ZoomBox—a portable 3-in-1 home entertainment projector that will play DVDs, CDs and connects to most gaming systems—, the VideoNow personal video player, the VCamNow digital camcorder, the ChatNow line of kid-oriented two-way radios and the TVNow, a personal handheld DVR player. They released an electronic tabletop version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; with voice recordings by host Chris Tarrant. Tiger also released an electronic version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; with voice recordings by Anne Robinson.

==Products==
===Standalone handhelds===
Tiger is most well-known for their low-end handheld electronic game systems with LCD screens. Each unit contains a fixed image printed onto the handheld that can be seen through the screen. Static images then light up individually in front of the background that represent characters and objects, similar to numbers on a calculator or digital clock. In addition to putting out some of its own games, Tiger was able to secure licenses from many of the time&#x27;s top selling companies to sell their own versions of games such as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, and Konami&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania II: Simon&#x27;s Quest&quot;. Later, Tiger introduced what they called &quot;wrist games&quot;. These combined a digital watch with a scaled-down version of a Tiger handheld game.

In 1995, Tiger introduced Super Data Blasters, a line of sports-themed handhelds. Each featured the contemporary statistics for players in a specific sport, the ability to record new sports statistics, a built-in electronic game for the sport and typical electronic organizer features such as an address book and calculator.

In 1998, Tiger released &quot;99X Games&quot;, a series of handhelds fitted with a dot-matrix screen, allowing a wide variety of backgrounds and different gameplay for a single game. Although running a software program stored in ROM, those systems were dedicated consoles, similarly to the plug-and-play TV games of the 2000s decade. Two systems running the same game could be linked with the included cable to allow two players to challenge each other.

===Cartridge-based handhelds===
Tiger made three notable cartridge-based systems. The first was the Quiz Wiz, a highly popular interactive quiz game system. Players inserted a cartridge and played using the corresponding quiz book. The second was the R-Zone. It employed red LCD cartridges, much like Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Boy, which were projected via backlight onto a reflective screen that covered one of the player&#x27;s eyes. The third was the Game.com handheld system, which was meant to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy and Game Boy Color, as well as Sega&#x27;s Game Gear and Genesis Nomad, and boasted such novel features as a touchscreen and limited Internet connectivity. However, the R-Zone and Game.com were commercial failures and garnered a negative reception.

===Furby===
Hasbro, previously shy of high-tech toys, was interested in the development of the Furby. With Hasbro&#x27;s support, Tiger was able to rush through the development process and get the Furby on the shelves for the 1998 holiday season, during which it was a runaway hit — the &quot;it&quot; toy of the 1998 and 1999 seasons. The continuing development of Furby-type technology led to the release of the FurReal line of toys in 2003, the more modern iteration of the Furby toyline in 2012, and also the high-tech Furby Connect in 2016. In 2023, a new Furby with voice commands was released.

===Brain Family===

From 1994–1999, Tiger invented the Brain Family, which are a line of electronic handheld audio games. In 1994, Tiger released the &quot;Brain Bash&quot;. It has four inner purple buttons and four yellow buttons outside the unit. It features five game modes. Game One is called Touch Command, where the electronic voice issues a command like &quot;one touch one&quot; and the corresponding player has to press purple one and yellow one.

In 1996, Tiger released the &quot;Brain Warp&quot;. This game is a spherical unit that has six colored knobs sticking out. There were three different revisions of the circuit board of Brain Warp resulting in audio changes and pitch differences. Two revisions were made in a blue base. Revision 2.0 has a different hidden sound sampling mode to the first revision. When Hasbro re-released Brain Warp in 2002, they took the programming from Revision 2.0 and placed it on a new circuit board with an enhanced speaker which reduced the loudness of the device. This game is very similar to Bop It. A voice that was recorded for the game says a color or a number, or a sequence of colors or numbers, or both depending on the game selected, and the correct knob must be shown facing upwards. In 1997, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; version called Death Star Escape was released. The game order is different and comes with six Star Wars characters.

In 1998, Tiger released &quot;Brain Shift&quot;. This game has six colored LED lights. It is known for its distinctive low pitched &quot;Orange!&quot; voice which is heard on the last color of a pattern in Stick Shift and in Memory Shift and Who Shifts It? The player has to use the stick shift to follow the voice commands. There is a memory game, and both Brain Shift and Brain Warp have a code buster game where the player has to find a certain number of colors in sixty seconds. Some Brain Shift game units had a bad chip in the game which causes the game to mess up the audio on low batteries, and in rare cases, the voice in the game will start counting, going through a list of numbers and skipping a few.

===Making toys and games for other brands===
The company became one of the most prominent producers of electronic toys based on a wide variety of licenses, including &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, Neopets, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

In 1996, Tiger produced replicas of the Turbo Man doll, which was featured in the 1996 holiday comedy &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;. It retained most of the features of the film version, including the disk shooter, boomerang accessory, light and sound jetpack, and a voice box. Despite being advertised as having five phrases in the movie, the actual toy only possessed four.

===&quot;Boogey Ball&quot;===
In 1999, Tiger Electronics released an electronic LED light game called &quot;Boogey Ball&quot;. There were 2 versions of the game released. The first version was buggy and it had issues playing several games (games 2, 3, and 5). In games 2 and 3, the player failed automatically sometime after 20 seconds due to the speed of the red light being impossible to stay away from. In game 5, the light patterns went in different directions and it was harder to play. Also, the game had a loud voice but quiet background music. In version 2.0, all the issues were fixed in the audio and game modes. The gameplay is similar to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, in that the player maneuvers a green LED light through a maze of 30 LED lights and has to either avoid (ditch) the red light or catch (snag) the yellow light. The game was known for its Austin Powers and Melle Mel style voices; the electronic voice would often say &quot;baby&quot;. When the game was first turned on, it said &quot;Oh you turned me on baby, let&#x27;s boogey!&quot; When the player failed, the game said &quot;Oh drat!&quot;. This game was also published by Hasbro. The game also suffered from a glitch: it would become stuck, playing every sound from the game, and pressing the power button would not turn the game off. The loud crackling over the top of the rapidfire used to scare people. The cause for this glitch is unknown but it might be trying to go through an automatic test mode.

===Harry Potter Challenge Wand===
In 2001, Tiger Electronics released a memory game called the Harry Potter Magic Spell Challenge, simply known as the &#x27;Challenge Wand&#x27;, on which the game sees the player up against an Evil Wizard as he casts a spell on the wand unit which the player must memorize in order. The first game in the unit is called &#x27;Compete Against an Evil Wizard&#x27;. In this game, the Evil Wizard says &quot;Try and stop this!&quot; (or &quot;me&quot;) and starts to cast a spell on the wand. The game has 4 auditory command sounds and 2 vocal commands &quot;Wingardium&quot; which requires the player to tilt the wand down 90 degrees, and &quot;Leviosa!&quot; which requires the player to tilt it up 90 degrees. The game has 8 levels; at each level, the patterns get longer and longer. If the player makes a mistake trying to memorize the pattern, the Evil Wizard will say something like &quot;Now the pain begins!&quot; or &quot;No match for me!&quot; If the player makes 3 mistakes in a round, the game is over and the Evil Wizard will say, &quot;Your powers are now mine!&quot;. The announcer will announce how many rounds the player has completed. The game also includes a Simon-style game called &quot;2 Wizards are Better Than One&quot; which involves sticking with one pattern and adding an extra command on it each time. Game 3 has different music to the other 2 games on which requires 2 wands. One player makes a pattern and sends it to the other wand and then the other player has to repeat it back.

== Test modes/demo modes ==
Tiger Electronics and Hasbro are known to include a hidden test mode (also known as a demo mode) in all their electronic games. These test modes signal either a sine wave or a square wave tone usually at 1000hz as a way of testing the speaker and then play through all of the sounds that are pre-programmed in the device either manually (by pushing a button), or automatic (playing every sound by itself). Games like &quot;Brain Warp&quot;, &quot;Brain Shift&quot;, &quot;Boogey Ball&quot;, and &quot;Brain Bash&quot; have these test modes, as do tabletop games (such as &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;).

<doc id="292783" wikidata="Q2906381" url="?curid=292783" title="Bleem!">
<text>Bleem! (styled as bleem!) is a commercial PlayStation emulator released by the Bleem! Company in 1999 for IBM-compatible PCs using Microsoft Windows and the Dreamcast. It is notable for being one of the few commercial software emulators to be aggressively marketed during the emulated console&#x27;s lifetime, and was the center of multiple controversial lawsuits.

==History==
Bleem! was a PlayStation emulator designed to allow people to play original PlayStation games on Windows 95 or 98 or on the Dreamcast (the Dreamcast version was called Bleemcast!). It was released in March 1999. The company that developed and commercialized Bleem! initially consisted of just two people, David Herpolsheimer (president) and Randy Linden, but in the commercial phase included Will Kempe, Scott Karol, Sean Kauppinen, Bryan Stokes, James Sinclair, and Paul Chen, later of Rovio Entertainment.

===Context===
To allow for full-speed emulation on lower-end computers of what was at the time a current generation console, the authors coded Bleem! in assembly. This allowed them to create precise optimizations. Unlike Connectix&#x27;s commercial Virtual Game Station, it made use of a PC&#x27;s 3D graphics hardware for rendering, allowing for enhanced resolutions and filtered textures not possible in real-time software rendering of the time.

Bleem! used low-level memory emulation and other real-mode technology. It did not function on operating systems using the Windows NT kernel, including Windows 2000. In fact, Bleem!&#x27;s statement at the time was that Bleem! would never support running on Windows NT-based systems, as Windows 98 was the dominant operating system at the time.

Sony, despite having lost its case with Connectix, continued to pursue legal action against Bleem!. Bleem!, financially unable to defend itself, was forced to go out of business.

As of 2005, two members of the team were working for Sony: Randy Linden was working for SCEA on porting titles and looking at the possibility of emulation of previous generation titles for the next PlayStation, and Sean Kauppinen was promoting &quot;EverQuest II&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; for Sony Online Entertainment.

===Copy protection===
To combat redistribution of the small downloadable emulator, the user had to buy the Bleem!-CD, containing about 35 MB of data: a DirectX distributable and the actual version of Bleem! available at the time of the CD&#x27;s printing. The rest of the CD was only for copy protection and was impossible to copy by conventional means; nevertheless, the copy protection was cracked within two weeks of the release.

Further updates to the emulator were free until the company ceased operation several years later.

==Bleemcast! ==

Bleemcast! is an independently developed commercial emulator by Bleem! that allows one to load and play PlayStation discs on the Sega Dreamcast. It is compatible with most Dreamcast controllers and steering wheels, and leverages the Dreamcast&#x27;s superior processing power for enhanced graphics. It was created by using the MIL-CD security hole found in the Dreamcast BIOS.

===History===
Originally, Bleem! was planning to have the disc able to run any PlayStation game on the Dreamcast, but due to technical difficulties, they developed the concept of the &quot;Bleempak&quot;, in which the software would boot only 100 specific games each. New Bleempaks would have to be purchased if one game was not available to boot in a Bleempak. Due to the Dreamcast controller&#x27;s fewer buttons compared to the PlayStation, there were plans to release a Bleem! controller somewhat similarly designed to the PlayStation controller, and a PlayStation-to-Dreamcast controller adapter, which would allow one to use a PlayStation controller on the Dreamcast. As technical difficulties grew further, all these ideas were scrapped, with no &quot;Bleempak&quot; and no hardware releases.

However, they managed to release individual Bleemcast! bootdiscs for three popular games: &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot;, &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; was also being planned for a release, but was not completed, while a couple of screenshots of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; were surfacing during this time, but was never announced as a planned release. As promised from the beginning, the games ran in a 640×480 resolution, as opposed to the PS1&#x27;s 320×240 resolution, and featured anti-aliasing and bilinear filtering. This drastically improved the games&#x27; graphics, but also brought out some graphical imperfections that were originally hidden in the lower resolution.

==Sony lawsuit==
Two days after Bleem! started taking preorders for their emulator, Sony filed suit over violations of copyright. Sony had accused Bleem! of engaging in unfair competition by allowing PlayStation BIOSs to be used on a personal computer as this would ultimately damage Sony&#x27;s sales of the PlayStation. The Judge had rejected the notion, and issued a protective order to &quot;protect David from Goliath&quot;. Sony&#x27;s second copyright allegation regarded the use of screenshots on their advertisements comparing the native PlayStation and emulated Bleem! versions. The district court had held in favor of Sony regarding the allegation and issued a preliminary injunction against Bleem!; however, Bleem! later appealed the decision providing their use of copyrighted material was protected under fair use. The appeal was successful, with the court stating that the use of screenshots of Sony&#x27;s video games rather constituted comparative advertising.

In spite of the loss, the release of the Bleemcast! caused Sony to file another lawsuit accusing them of unfair competition and patent infringement regarding the use of PlayStation BIOSs on the Sega Dreamcast. This approach had become problematic for Bleem!, despite no actual court ruling against them. The main issue regarded the financial problems Bleem! had faced as they had to deal with defense costs of $1 million per patent. This had caused Bleem!&#x27;s work to decline, so that they had only managed to release three games: &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, for the Bleemcast!. At this point, Sony had obstructed Bleem! from developing further video games for the Bleemcast! and had even threatened retailers selling these products.

The legal fees forced the company out of business and eBay auctions of some of the company&#x27;s possessions were held soon after – including a huge library of worldwide game releases used for compatibility testing.

===Closure of Bleem!===
Although Sony ultimately did not win any of its lawsuits against them, Bleem! had to shut down when the huge court costs became too much for the small company to handle. Bleem! shut down in November 2001, the same year Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast in North America. Bleem! closed their website, with only an image on their front page showing Sonic the Hedgehog tearfully holding a flower next to a Bleem! gravestone. However, the image was later altered and Sonic was removed, ironically to avoid a lawsuit from Sega. Sega themselves had also been indirectly involved in the obstruction of Bleemcast! by the way of the removal of support for the unpopular (for Sega&#x27;s intended use) MIL-CD format on later Dreamcast models.

===Beta leak===
A beta build of Bleemcast! was eventually leaked. Even though it was buggy and incomplete, it would run some PlayStation games, though not all the games it ran would be playable. Using this beta, hackers were able to create &quot;Bleemed games&quot; – discs of a PlayStation title with the Bleemcast! emulator built in. ISO images of many of these discs were known to circulate on file-sharing networks.

After the leak, Rod Maher, one of the developers of Bleemcast!, made a public statement regarding the beta, providing some insight into the development process. He revealed that the leaked beta predated the beta that had been shown at E3 and that the leaked beta was 30% complete. The commercial Bleemcast! release was notable as the only release on the Dreamcast that had not been pirated, as it had a complex copy-protection scheme. All three Bleempaks were finally cracked and made available online in December 2009, eight years after their introduction.

==Bleem Powered==
On January 4, 2021, Piko Interactive announced that they had acquired the Bleem! brand name, with plans to start a retrogaming-focused online storefront titled Bleem Powered, which as of 2025 still seems to be under development. One of their current projects is a version of the game Glover for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a representation of a Lie group is a linear action of a Lie group on a vector space. Equivalently, a representation is a smooth homomorphism of the group into the group of invertible operators on the vector space. Representations play an important role in the study of continuous symmetry. A great deal is known about such representations, a basic tool in their study being the use of the corresponding &#x27;infinitesimal&#x27; representations of Lie algebras.

== Finite-dimensional representations ==
===Representations===

A complex representation of a group is an action by a group on a finite-dimensional vector space over the field formula_1. A representation of the Lie group &quot;G&quot;, acting on an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; over formula_1 is then a smooth group homomorphism 
:formula_3,
where formula_4 is the general linear group of all invertible linear transformations of formula_5 under their composition. Since all &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spaces are isomorphic, the group formula_4 can be identified with the group of the invertible, complex generally Smoothness of the map formula_7 can be regarded as a technicality, in that any continuous homomorphism will automatically be smooth.

We can alternatively describe a representation of a Lie group formula_8 as a &quot;linear action&quot; of formula_8 on a vector space formula_5. Notationally, we would then write formula_11 in place of formula_12 for the way a group element formula_13 acts on the vector formula_14.

A typical example in which representations arise in physics would be the study of a linear partial differential equation having symmetry group formula_8. Although the individual solutions of the equation may not be invariant under the action of formula_8, the &quot;space&quot; formula_5 of all solutions is invariant under the action of formula_8. Thus, formula_5 constitutes a representation of formula_8. See the example of SO(3), discussed below.

===Basic definitions===
If the homomorphism formula_7 is injective (i.e., a monomorphism), the representation is said to be faithful.

If a basis for the complex vector space &quot;V&quot; is chosen, the representation can be expressed as a homomorphism into general linear group formula_22. This is known as a &quot;matrix representation&quot;. Two representations of &quot;G&quot; on vector spaces &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; are &quot;equivalent&quot; if they have the same matrix representations with respect to some choices of bases 
for &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;.

Given a representation formula_3, we say that a subspace &quot;W&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is an invariant subspace if formula_24 for all formula_13 and formula_26. The representation is said to be irreducible if the only invariant subspaces of &quot;V&quot; are the zero space and &quot;V&quot; itself. For certain types of Lie groups, namely compact and semisimple groups, every finite-dimensional representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, a property known as complete reducibility. For such groups, a typical goal of representation theory is to classify all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the given group, up to isomorphism. (See the Classification section below.)

A unitary representation on a finite-dimensional inner product space is defined in the same way, except that formula_7 is required to map into the group of unitary operators. If &quot;G&quot; is a compact Lie group, every finite-dimensional representation is equivalent to a unitary one.

===Lie algebra representations===
Each representation of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; gives rise to a representation of its Lie algebra; this correspondence is discussed in detail in subsequent sections. See representation of Lie algebras for the Lie algebra theory.

==An example: The rotation group SO(3)==

In quantum mechanics, the time-independent Schrödinger equation, formula_28 plays an important role. In the three-dimensional case, if formula_29 has rotational symmetry, then the space formula_30 of solutions to formula_28 will be invariant under the action of SO(3). Thus, formula_30 will—for each fixed value of formula_33—constitute a representation of SO(3), which is typically finite dimensional. In trying to solve formula_28, it helps to know what all possible finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) look like. The representation theory of SO(3) plays a key role, for example, in the mathematical analysis of the hydrogen atom.

Every standard textbook on quantum mechanics contains an analysis which essentially classifies finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3), by means of its Lie algebra. (The commutation relations among the angular momentum operators are just the relations for the Lie algebra formula_35 of SO(3).) One subtlety of this analysis is that the representations of the group and the Lie algebra are not in one-to-one correspondence, a point that is critical in understanding the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin.

===Ordinary representations===
The rotation group SO(3) is a compact Lie group and thus every finite-dimensional representation of SO(3) decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The group SO(3) has one irreducible representation in each odd dimension. For each non-negative integer formula_36, the irreducible representation of dimension formula_37 can be realized as the space formula_38 of homogeneous harmonic polynomials on formula_39 of degree formula_36. Here, SO(3) acts on formula_38 in the usual way that rotations act on functions on formula_39:
:formula_43
The restriction to the unit sphere formula_44 of the elements of formula_38 are the spherical harmonics of degree formula_36.

If, say, formula_47, then all polynomials that are homogeneous of degree one are harmonic, and we obtain a three-dimensional space formula_48 spanned by the linear polynomials formula_49, formula_50, and formula_51. If formula_52, the space formula_53 is spanned by the polynomials formula_54, formula_55, formula_56, formula_57, and formula_58.

As noted above, the finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) arise naturally when studying the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a radial potential, such as the hydrogen atom, as a reflection of the rotational symmetry of the problem. (See the role played by the spherical harmonics in the mathematical analysis of hydrogen.)

===Projective representations===
If we look at the Lie algebra formula_35 of SO(3), this Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra formula_60 of SU(2). By the representation theory of formula_60, there is then one irreducible representation of formula_35 in &quot;every&quot; dimension. The even-dimensional representations, however, do not correspond to representations of the &quot;group&quot; SO(3). These so-called &quot;fractional spin&quot; representations do, however, correspond to &quot;projective&quot; representations of SO(3). These representations arise in the quantum mechanics of particles with fractional spin, such as an electron.

==Operations on representations==
In this section, we describe three basic operations on representations. See also the corresponding constructions for representations of a Lie algebra.

===Direct sums===
If we have two representations of a group formula_8, formula_64 and formula_65, then the direct sum would have formula_66 as the underlying vector space, with the action of the group given by
:formula_67
for all formula_68 formula_69, and formula_13.

Certain types of Lie groups—notably, compact Lie groups—have the property that &quot;every&quot; finite-dimensional representation is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible representations. In such cases, the classification of representations reduces to the classification of irreducible representations. See Weyl&#x27;s theorem on complete reducibility.

===Tensor products of representations===

If we have two representations of a group formula_8, formula_64 and formula_65, then the tensor product of the representations would have the tensor product vector space formula_74 as the underlying vector space, with the action of formula_8 uniquely determined by the assumption that

:formula_76
for all formula_77 and formula_69. That is to say, formula_79.

The Lie algebra representation formula_80 associated to the tensor product representation formula_7 is given by the formula:

:formula_82

The tensor product of two irreducible representations is usually not irreducible; a basic problem in representation theory is then to decompose tensor products of irreducible representations as a direct sum of irreducible subspaces. This problem goes under the name of &quot;addition of angular momentum&quot; or &quot;Clebsch–Gordan theory&quot; in the physics literature.

===Dual representations===

Let formula_8 be a Lie group and formula_84 be a representation of G. Let formula_85 be the dual space, that is, the space of linear functionals on formula_5. Then we can define a representation formula_87 by the formula
:formula_88
where for any operator formula_89, the transpose operator formula_90 is defined as the &quot;composition with formula_91&quot; operator:
:formula_92
(If we work in a basis, then formula_93 is just the usual matrix transpose of formula_91.) The inverse in the definition of formula_95 is needed to ensure that formula_95 is actually a representation of formula_8, in light of the identity formula_98.

The dual of an irreducible representation is always irreducible, but may or may not be isomorphic to the original representation. In the case of the group SU(3), for example, the irreducible representations are labeled by a pair formula_99 of non-negative integers. The dual of the representation associated to formula_99 is the representation associated to formula_101.

== Lie group versus Lie algebra representations ==
===Overview===
In many cases, it is convenient to study representations of a Lie group by studying representations of the associated Lie algebra. In general, however, not every representation of the Lie algebra comes from a representation of the group. This fact is, for example, lying behind the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin in quantum mechanics. On the other hand, if &quot;G&quot; is a simply connected group, then a theorem says that we do, in fact, get a one-to-one correspondence between the group and Lie algebra representations.

Let be a Lie group with Lie algebra formula_102, and assume that a representation formula_80 of formula_102 is at hand. The Lie correspondence may be employed for obtaining group representations of the connected component of the . Roughly speaking, this is effected by taking the matrix exponential of the matrices of the Lie algebra representation. A subtlety arises if is not simply connected. This may result in projective representations or, in physics parlance, multi-valued representations of . These are actually representations of the universal covering group of .

These results will be explained more fully below.

The Lie correspondence gives results only for the connected component of the groups, and thus the other components of the full group are treated separately by giving representatives for matrices representing these components, one for each component. These form (representatives of) the zeroth homotopy group of . For example, in the case of the four-component Lorentz group, representatives of space inversion and time reversal must be put in by hand. Further illustrations will be drawn from the representation theory of the Lorentz group below.

===The exponential mapping===
If formula_8 is a Lie group with Lie algebra formula_102, then we have the exponential map from formula_102 to formula_8, written as
:formula_109
If formula_8 is a matrix Lie group, the expression formula_111 can be computed by the usual power series for the exponential. In any Lie group, there exist neighborhoods formula_112 of the identity in formula_8 and formula_5 of the origin in formula_102 with the property that every formula_116 in formula_112 can be written uniquely as formula_118 with formula_119. That is, the exponential map has a &quot;local&quot; inverse. In most groups, this is only local; that is, the exponential map is typically neither one-to-one nor onto.

=== Lie algebra representations from group representations ===
It is always possible to pass from a representation of a Lie group to a representation of its Lie algebra formula_120 If is a group representation for some vector space , then its pushforward (differential) at the identity, or Lie map, formula_121 is a Lie algebra representation. It is explicitly computed using

A basic property relating formula_7 and formula_80 involves the exponential map:
:formula_124

The question we wish to investigate is whether every representation of formula_102 arises in this way from representations of the group formula_8. As we shall see, this is the case when formula_8 is simply connected.

=== Group representations from Lie algebra representations ===
The main result of this section is the following:
:Theorem: If formula_8 is simply connected, then every representation formula_80 of the Lie algebra formula_102 of formula_8 comes from a representation formula_7 of formula_8 itself.
From this we easily deduce the following:
:Corollary: If formula_8 is connected but not simply connected, every representation formula_80 of formula_102 comes from a representation formula_7 of formula_138, the universal cover of formula_8. If formula_80 is irreducible, then formula_7 descends to a &quot;projective representation&quot; of formula_8. 
A projective representation is one in which each formula_143 is defined only up to multiplication by a constant. In quantum physics, it is natural to allow projective representations in addition to ordinary ones, because states are really defined only up to a constant. (That is to say, if formula_144 is a vector in the quantum Hilbert space, then formula_145 represents the same physical state for any constant formula_146.) Every &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; projective representation of a connected Lie group formula_8 comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover formula_138 of formula_8. Conversely, as we will discuss below, every irreducible ordinary representation of formula_138 descends to a projective representation of formula_8. In the physics literature, projective representations are often described as multi-valued representations (i.e., each formula_152 does not have a single value but a whole family of values). This phenomenon is important to the study of fractional spin in quantum mechanics.

We now outline the proof of the main results above. Suppose formula_153 is a representation of formula_102 on a vector space . If there is going to be an associated Lie group representation formula_7, it must satisfy the exponential relation of the previous subsection. Now, in light of the local invertibility of the exponential, we can &quot;define&quot; a map formula_7 from a neighborhood formula_112 of the identity in formula_8 by this relation:
:formula_159
A key question is then this: Is this locally defined map a &quot;local homomorphism&quot;? (This question would apply even in the special case where the exponential mapping is globally one-to-one and onto; in that case, formula_7 would be a globally defined map, but it is not obvious why formula_7 would be a homomorphism.) The answer to this question is yes: formula_7 is a local homomorphism, and this can be established using the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.

If formula_8 is connected, then every element of formula_8 is at least a &quot;product&quot; of exponentials of elements of formula_102. Thus, we can tentatively define formula_7 globally as follows.
Note, however, that the representation of a given group element as a product of exponentials is very far from unique, so it is very far from clear that formula_7 is actually well defined.

To address the question of whether formula_7 is well defined, we connect each group element formula_13 to the identity using a continuous path. It is then possible to define formula_7 along the path, and to show that the value of formula_152 is unchanged under continuous deformation of the path with endpoints fixed. If formula_8 is simply connected, any path starting at the identity and ending at formula_116 can be continuously deformed into any other such path, showing that formula_152 is fully independent of the choice of path. Given that the initial definition of formula_7 near the identity was a local homomorphism, it is not difficult to show that the globally defined map is also a homomorphism satisfying .

If formula_8 is not simply connected, we may apply the above procedure to the universal cover formula_138 of formula_8. Let formula_179 be the covering map. If it should happen that the kernel of formula_180 contains the kernel of formula_181, then formula_7 descends to a representation of the original group formula_8. Even if this is not the case, note that the kernel of formula_181 is a discrete normal subgroup of formula_138, which is therefore in the center of formula_138. Thus, if formula_80 is irreducible, Schur&#x27;s lemma implies that the kernel of formula_181 will act by scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, formula_7 descends to a &quot;projective&quot; representation of formula_8, that is, one that is defined only modulo scalar multiples of the identity.

A pictorial view of how the universal covering group contains &quot;all&quot; such homotopy classes, and a technical definition of it (as a set and as a group) is given in geometric view.

For example, when this is specialized to the doubly connected , the universal covering group is formula_191, and whether its corresponding representation is faithful decides whether is projective.

== Classification in the compact case ==

If &quot;G&quot; is a connected compact Lie group, its finite-dimensional representations can be decomposed as direct sums of irreducible representations. The irreducibles are classified by a &quot;theorem of the highest weight.&quot; We give a brief description of this theory here; for more details, see the articles on representation theory of a connected compact Lie group and the parallel theory classifying representations of semisimple Lie algebras.

Let &quot;T&quot; be a maximal torus in &quot;G&quot;. By Schur&#x27;s lemma, the irreducible representations of &quot;T&quot; are one dimensional. These representations can be classified easily and are labeled by certain &quot;analytically integral elements&quot; or &quot;weights.&quot; If formula_192 is an irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot;, the restriction of formula_192 to &quot;T&quot; will usually not be irreducible, but it will decompose as a direct sum of irreducible representations of &quot;T&quot;, labeled by the associated weights. (The same weight can occur more than once.) For a fixed formula_192, one can identify one of the weights as &quot;highest&quot; and the representations are then classified by this highest weight.

An important aspect of the representation theory is the associated theory of characters. Here, for a representation formula_192 of &quot;G&quot;, the character is the function
:formula_196 
given by
:formula_197
Two representations with the same character turn out to be isomorphic. Furthermore, the Weyl character formula gives a remarkable formula for the character of a representation in terms of its highest weight. Not only does this formula gives a lot of useful information about the representation, but it plays a crucial role in the proof of the theorem of the highest weight.

== Unitary representations on Hilbert spaces ==
Let &quot;V&quot; be a complex Hilbert space, which may be infinite dimensional, and let formula_198 denote the group of unitary operators on &quot;V&quot;. A unitary representation of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; on &quot;V&quot; is a group homomorphism formula_199 with the property that for each fixed formula_14, the map
:formula_201 
is a continuous map of &quot;G&quot; into &quot;V&quot;.

=== Finite-dimensional unitary representations ===
If the Hilbert space &quot;V&quot; is finite-dimensional, there is an associated representation formula_80 of the Lie algebra formula_102 of formula_8. If formula_8 is connected, then the representation formula_7 of formula_8 is unitary if and only if formula_208 is skew-self-adjoint for each formula_209.

If formula_8 is compact, then every representation formula_7 of formula_8 on a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; is &quot;unitarizable,&quot; meaning that it is possible to choose an inner product on &quot;V&quot; so that each formula_213 is unitary.

=== Infinite-dimensional unitary representations ===
If the Hilbert space &quot;V&quot; is allowed to be infinite dimensional, the study of unitary representations involves a number of interesting features that are not present in the finite dimensional case. For example, the construction of an appropriate representation of the Lie algebra formula_102 becomes technically challenging. One setting in which the Lie algebra representation is well understood is that of semisimple (or reductive) Lie groups, where the associated Lie algebra representation forms a (g,K)-module.

Examples of unitary representations arise in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, but also in Fourier analysis as shown in the following example. Let formula_215, and let the complex Hilbert space &quot;V&quot; be formula_216. We define the representation formula_217 by
:formula_218

Here are some important examples in which unitary representations of a Lie group have been analyzed. 
* The Stone–von Neumann theorem can be understood as giving a classification of the irreducible unitary representations of the Heisenberg group. 
* Wigner&#x27;s classification for representations of the Poincaré group plays a major conceptual role in quantum field theory by showing how the mass and spin of particles can be understood in group-theoretic terms. 
* The representation theory of SL(2,R) was worked out by V. Bargmann and serves as the prototype for the study of unitary representations of noncompact semisimple Lie groups.

==Projective representations==

In quantum physics, one is often interested in &quot;projective&quot; unitary representations of a Lie group formula_8. The reason for this interest is that states of a quantum system are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space formula_220—but with the understanding that two states differing by a constant are actually the same physical state. The symmetries of the Hilbert space are then described by unitary operators, but a unitary operator that is a multiple of the identity does not change the physical state of the system. Thus, we are interested not in ordinary unitary representations—that is, homomorphisms of formula_8 into the unitary group formula_222—but rather in projective unitary representations—that is, homomorphisms of formula_8 into the projective unitary group 
:formula_224

To put it differently, for a projective representation, we construct a family of unitary operators formula_225, where it is understood that changing formula_226 by a constant of absolute value 1 is counted as &quot;the same&quot; operator. The operators formula_226 are then required to satisfy the homomorphism property &quot;up to a constant&quot;:
:formula_228

We have already discussed the irreducible projective unitary representations of the rotation group SO(3) above; considering projective representations allows for fractional spin in addition to integer spin.

Bargmann&#x27;s theorem states that for certain types of Lie groups formula_8, irreducible projective unitary representations of formula_8 are in one-to-one correspondence with ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover of formula_8. Important examples where Bargmann&#x27;s theorem applies are SO(3) (as just mentioned) and the Poincaré group. The latter case is important to Wigner&#x27;s classification of the projective representations of the Poincaré group, with applications to quantum field theory.

One example where Bargmann&#x27;s theorem does &quot;not&quot; apply is the group formula_232. The set of translations in position and momentum on formula_233 form a projective unitary representation of formula_232 but they do not come from an ordinary representation of the universal cover of formula_232—which is just formula_232 itself. In this case, to get an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the Heisenberg group, which is a one-dimensional central extension of formula_232. (See the discussion here.)

==The commutative case==

If formula_8 is a commutative Lie group, then every irreducible unitary representation of formula_8 on complex vector spaces is one dimensional. (This claim follows from Schur&#x27;s lemma and holds even if the representations are not assumed ahead of time to be finite dimensional.) Thus, the irreducible unitary representations of formula_8 are simply continuous homomorphisms of formula_8 into the unit circle group, U(1). For example, if formula_215, the irreducible unitary representations have the form 
:formula_243,
for some real number formula_244.

See also Pontryagin duality for this case.

<text>Josip Runjanin (8 December 1821 – 20 January 1878), born Josif Runjanin (), was an Austrian career military officer, politician and composer of Serb origin best known for composing the melody of the Croatian national anthem, &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; (&quot;Our Beautiful Homeland&quot;), in 1846.

Runjanin received his education in Vinkovci and later in Sremski Karlovci. As a young man, he served in the Imperial Austrian Army as a cadet in the town of Glina, along the Military Frontier with the Ottoman Empire. While serving in Glina, Runjanin attained the rank of captain and became proficient in playing the piano. He is known to have composed only a handful of works, most famously the musical accompaniment to Antun Mihanović&#x27;s patriotic poem &quot;Horvatska domovina&quot; (&quot;Croatian Homeland&quot;). The piece, under the title &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot;, was selected by popular acclaim as the anthem of the Croatian people at an economic exhibition in Zagreb in 1891. One of its stanzas was eventually integrated into the national anthem of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and the piece later served as the national anthem of several Croatian polities, including that of modern-day Croatia. 

A veteran of the Second and Third Italian War of Independence, Runjanin ultimately attained the rank of colonel, and served for two years in the Croatian Parliament beginning in 1865. Following his retirement from military service in 1876, he relocated to Novi Sad, where he died, penniless, two years later at the age of 56. Several schools in Croatia bear his name, including the Elementary Music School of Josip Runjanin in Vinkovci.

==Biography==

Runjanin was born in the town of Vinkovci, in what was then the Austrian Empire, on 8 December 1821 to Ignjatije and Sofija Runjanin. He was an ethnic Serb, and was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church of Pentecost in Vinkovci on . Runjanin&#x27;s baptismal record documents his given name as Josif, the Serb variant of Joseph. His name is often incorrectly spelled Josip, the Croat variant of the name. Runjanin&#x27;s family traced its origins to the village of Runjani, near Loznica, before fleeing to the Austrian Empire to escape the Ottomans. His father was a military engineer, and his grandfather was an Eastern Orthodox priest serving parishes in Kuzmin and Šid.

Runjanin completed most of his primary and secondary education in Vinkovci. In 1837, he relocated to Sremski Karlovci to complete his fifth and final year of secondary school. He was a diligent student and excelled academically. He entered the Imperial Austrian Army on 26 December 1838, as a recruit of the Third Border Infantry Regiment in Ogulin, on the Military Frontier with the Ottoman Empire. Runjanin&#x27;s relocation to Ogulin appears to have been motivated by his desire to join his father, who was then serving as an officer in the regiment. On 1 August 1839, the young Runjanin was promoted to the rank of regimental cadet, and on 1 May 1840, he was transferred to the Tenth Border Infantry Regiment in Glina; his brothers, Petar and Stefan, were also cadets. Runjanin&#x27;s father was transferred to Glina around the same time, and the scholar Igor Mrkalj speculates that he had taken his son with him. In Glina, Runjanin&#x27;s father became active in the Glina Illyrian Circle, a local branch of the Pan-Slavic cultural organization &quot;Matica ilirska&quot;, alongside the famed military commander Josip Jelačić, the poets Petar Preradović, Ivan Trnski and Ognjeslav Utješenović, and the cleric .

The next two years proved to be a very turbulent period in Runjanin&#x27;s life. His mother died on 22 November 1847, and the following year, he was mobilized to help quell the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states, serving with distinction. On 16 January 1848, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant; on 1 May, to first lieutenant; and on 16 September, senior lieutenant. On 1 September 1849, he was promoted to captain, second class, and on 8 April 1857, to captain, first class. Two years later, he was mobilized to fight for Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence. On 21 July 1861, a certain &quot;Captain Runjanin&quot; organized a torch-light procession through the town of Topusko to commemorate the visit of the Serbian linguistic reformer Vuk Karadžić. The event caused great consternation amongst local Habsburg officials, who regarded it as an act of subversion, and led to several of the officers who organized the event either being transferred or having their pay docked. It is unclear whether Runjanin was the &quot;Captain Runjanin&quot; in question.

In 1864, at the age of 43, Runjanin married Otilija Peraković, the daughter of retired captain Toma Peraković. On 27 May 1865, he was one of four representatives of the First Banate Regiment elected to the Croatian Parliament. Although none of the four are known to have delivered speeches in the legislature, they did cast votes on at least one occasion. Runjanin was promoted to the rank of major on 24 April 1866, and shortly thereafter, he was mobilized to take part in another military conflict in Italy, which would come to be known as the Third Italian War of Independence. His parliamentary mandate ended after the Parliament was dissolved in 1867. The following year, Runjanin&#x27;s wife gave birth to a daughter named Wilhelmina. 

On 16 July 1868, Runjanin was transferred to the Ninth Border Infantry Regiment in Sremska Mitrovica. Shortly thereafter, his wife fell ill and relocated to Graz to recover and be closer to her parents, taking their daughter with her. On 10 September 1870, Runjanin was transferred once again, this time to the 68th Infantry Regiment in Carlsburg. He served there until 26 April 1871, when he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and transferred to the 31st Infantry Regiment in Hermannstadt (modern-day Sibiu, Romania). On 1 November 1872, he requested a transfer and a leave of absence. After a year-long absence, he was transferred to the 16th Infantry Regiment in Bjelovar on 1 November 1873. On 20 April 1875, he was appointed reserve commander, and went into retirement the following year, on 1 April 1876. Over the course of his career, he had received the Military Long Service Crosses for Officers (1st Class) and the War Medal 1873. 

Runjanin&#x27;s father died on 10 November 1876, and he subsequently settled in Novi Sad, dying there of dropsy on 20 January 1878. Despite a generous military pension, Runjanin was impoverished at the time of his death. His funeral took place two days later at the Eastern Orthodox cemetery next to Novi Sad&#x27;s Church of the Dormition, and afterwards, his belongings were sold at auction for a little over 20 florin.

==Compositions==
Runjanin belonged to the group of so-called &quot;Illyrian composers&quot;, whom the scholars Robert A. Kann and Zdeněk V. David describe as &quot;gifted amateurs, at best trained by the choirmaster at the local cathedral.&quot; He was not a particularly prolific composer, leaving behind only a handful of works. In 1844, he composed the melody to the song &quot;Ljubimo te naša diko&quot; (&quot;We Love You, Our Pride&quot;), whose lyrics had been written by Ivan Trnski in honour of Josip Jelačić. 

Runjanin&#x27;s most famous composition was the melody of what would become the Croatian national anthem, &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; (&quot;Our Beautiful Homeland&quot;). He is traditionally reputed to have composed the melody in Glina, on the piano of a merchant named Petar Peleš, in 1846. Prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, this piano was kept at a branch of Zagreb&#x27;s Croatian History Museum called the Museum of Serbs in Croatia. It is now on permanent display at the Museum of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in Gornja Stubica. However, the fact that the piano was crafted in 1860—some fourteen years after Runjanin composed his melody—undermines the notion that it was composed using this particular instrument. The lyrics to the piece had originally been written more than a decade earlier by the lawyer Antun Mihanović, as part of a poem entitled &quot;Horvatska Domovina&quot; (&quot;Croatian Homeland&quot;). In composing the melody, Runjanin was heavily inspired by the aria &quot;O sole più ratto&quot; from Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. It is unclear whether Runjanin selected the four stanzas from the fourteen in Mihanović&#x27;s original poem, though according to the scholars Aleksandar Pavković and Christopher Kelen, &quot;it is certain that ... Mihanović ... did not make the selection.&quot; They continue, &quot;It is unlikely that he even knew the selection had been made or that his poem had been transformed into a song.&quot; A harmony based on Runjanin&#x27;s composition was developed by Josip Vendl later that year, and in 1861, it was arranged for choir by Vatroslav Lichtenegger.

Several sources also attribute to Runjanin the melody of the Serbian patriotic song &quot;Rado ide Srbin u vojnike&quot; (&quot;The Serb Gladly Joins the Army&quot;), whose lyrics had been written by a cleric from Pančevo named Vasa Živković. The piece&#x27;s fourth section later inspired a portion of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Slavonic March&quot;, which was composed amidst the Serbian–Ottoman Wars of 1876–1878 and drew heavy inspiration from Serbian folk music.

==Legacy==
In 1891, &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; was selected by popular acclamation as the national anthem of the Croatian people at an exhibition of the Croatian–Slavonian Economic Association in Zagreb, where it was performed by a choir of 700 singers. Other candidates at the time included &quot;Bože živi&quot; by Petar Preradović and &quot;Hrvatska himna&quot; by the librettist Hugo Badalić. In 1905, the Association of Croatian Singing Societies sent a proposal for the Parliament to proclaim it the national anthem, but they never considered the proposal. Following the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in December 1918, the first stanza of &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; was made the second stanza of the new state&#x27;s composite national anthem. After the creation of the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941, the fascist Ustaše regime selected &quot;Lijepa naša domovino&quot; as its national anthem. Conversely, the communist-led Croatian Partisans also used it as their own, unofficial anthem. In 1972, it was declared the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, and retained this status after Croatia&#x27;s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.

The music historian Catherine Baker cites Runjanin as &quot;one of the strongest connections between the Serb and Croat peoples&quot;. There are several schools in Croatia named after him, most notably the Elementary Music School of Josip Runjanin in Vinkovci. In April 2021, ahead of the 200th anniversary of Runjanin&#x27;s birth, the Institute for the Development of Relations Between Croatia and Serbia announced it would launch an initiative to restore and maintain Runjanin&#x27;s gravestone. A similar inter-governmental initiative had been launched by the City of Zagreb in 2002, but fell apart after the Croatian side failed to secure the cooperation of Novi Sad&#x27;s municipal government. In October 2024, a Serb cultural centre named after Runjanin was inaugurated in Glina by several members of the Croatian Parliament and a representative of Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.

<doc id="292788" wikidata="Q10359539" url="?curid=292788" title="Unitary representation">
<text>In mathematics, a unitary representation of a group &quot;G&quot; is a linear representation π of &quot;G&quot; on a complex Hilbert space &quot;V&quot; such that π(&quot;g&quot;) is a unitary operator for every &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. The general theory is well-developed in the case that &quot;G&quot; is a locally compact (Hausdorff) topological group and the representations are strongly continuous.

The theory has been widely applied in quantum mechanics since the 1920s, particularly influenced by Hermann Weyl&#x27;s 1928 book &quot;Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik&quot;. One of the pioneers in constructing a general theory of unitary representations, for any group &quot;G&quot; rather than just for particular groups useful in applications, was George Mackey.

==Context in harmonic analysis==

The theory of unitary representations of topological groups is closely connected with harmonic analysis. In the case of an abelian group &quot;G&quot;, a fairly complete picture of the representation theory of &quot;G&quot; is given by Pontryagin duality. In general, the unitary equivalence classes (see below) of irreducible unitary representations of &quot;G&quot; make up its unitary dual. This set can be identified with the spectrum of the C*-algebra associated with &quot;G&quot; by the group C*-algebra construction. This is a topological space.

The general form of the Plancherel theorem tries to describe the regular representation of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) using a measure on the unitary dual. For &quot;G&quot; abelian this is given by the Pontryagin duality theory. For &quot;G&quot; compact, this is done by the Peter–Weyl theorem; in that case, the unitary dual is a discrete space, and the measure attaches an atom to each point of mass equal to its degree.

==Formal definitions==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a topological group. A strongly continuous unitary representation of &quot;G&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; into the unitary group of &quot;H&quot;,

:formula_1

such that &quot;g&quot; → π(&quot;g&quot;) ξ is a norm continuous function for every ξ ∈ &quot;H&quot;.

Note that if G is a Lie group, the Hilbert space also admits underlying smooth and analytic structures. A vector ξ in &quot;H&quot; is said to be smooth or analytic if the map &quot;g&quot; → π(&quot;g&quot;) ξ is smooth or analytic (in the norm or weak topologies on &quot;H&quot;). Smooth vectors are dense in &quot;H&quot; by a classical argument of Lars Gårding, since convolution by smooth functions of compact support yields smooth vectors. Analytic vectors are dense by a classical argument of Edward Nelson, amplified by Roe Goodman, since vectors in the image of a heat operator &quot;e&quot;–tD, corresponding to an elliptic differential operator &quot;D&quot; in the universal enveloping algebra of &quot;G&quot;, are analytic. Not only do smooth or analytic vectors form dense subspaces; but they also form common cores for the unbounded skew-adjoint operators corresponding to the elements of the Lie algebra, in the sense of spectral theory.

Two unitary representations π1: &quot;G&quot; → U(&quot;H&quot;1), π2: &quot;G&quot; → U(&quot;H&quot;2) are said to be unitarily equivalent if there is a unitary transformation &quot;A&quot;:&quot;H&quot;1 → &quot;H&quot;2 such that π1(&quot;g&quot;) = &quot;A&quot;* ∘ π2(&quot;g&quot;) ∘ &quot;A&quot; for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. When this holds, &quot;A&quot; is said to be an intertwining operator for the representations formula_2.

If formula_3 is a representation of a connected Lie group formula_4 on a &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; Hilbert space formula_5, then formula_3 is unitary if and only if the associated Lie algebra representation formula_7 maps into the space of skew-self-adjoint operators on formula_5.

==Complete reducibility==

A unitary representation is completely reducible, in the sense that for any closed invariant subspace, the orthogonal complement is again a closed invariant subspace. This is at the level of an observation, but is a fundamental property. For example, it implies that finite-dimensional unitary representations are always a direct sum of irreducible representations, in the algebraic sense.

Since unitary representations are much easier to handle than the general case, it is natural to consider unitarizable representations, those that become unitary on the introduction of a suitable complex Hilbert space structure. This works very well for finite groups, and more generally for compact groups, by an averaging argument applied to an arbitrary hermitian structure (more specifically, a new inner product defined by an averaging argument over the old one, w.r.t which the representation is unitary). For example, a natural proof of Maschke&#x27;s theorem is by this route.

==Unitarizability and the unitary dual question==

In general, for non-compact groups, it is a more serious question which representations are unitarizable. One of the important unsolved problems in mathematics is the description of the unitary dual, the effective classification of irreducible unitary representations of all real reductive Lie groups. All irreducible unitary representations are admissible (or rather their Harish-Chandra modules are), and the admissible representations are given by the Langlands classification, and it is easy to tell which of them have a non-trivial invariant sesquilinear form. The problem is that it is in general hard to tell when the quadratic form is positive definite. For many reductive Lie groups this has been solved; see representation theory of SL2(R) and representation theory of the Lorentz group for examples.

<doc id="292795" wikidata="Q1134797" url="?curid=292795" title="Sidecar (cocktail)">
<text>The sidecar is a cocktail traditionally made with brandy (usually cognac), orange liqueur (Cointreau, Grand Marnier, dry curaçao, or a triple sec), and lemon juice. It became popular in Paris and London in the early 1920s. Common modifications of the original recipe are a sugar rim, added sugar syrup, and an orange twist or lemon twist.

==Similar drinks==
The sidecar is categorized as a daisy: a spirit, citrus juice, and a liqueur as sweetener. Other well-known daisies include the margarita (literally &quot;daisy&quot; in Spanish) and the White Lady. Daisies are variants of the older sour formula, which use sugar for sweetening; daisies are more complex and often drier. Daisies in general and the sidecar in particular are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness.

In its ingredients, the drink is perhaps most closely related to the older brandy crusta, which differs both in presentation and in proportions of its components.

==History==
===Origin===

The exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment, which was very commonly used at the time. 

The Ritz Hotel in Paris claims origin of the drink. The first recipes for the sidecar appear in 1922, in Robert Vermeire&#x27;s &quot;Cocktails and How to Mix Them&quot; and Harry MacElhone&#x27;s &quot;Harry&#x27;s ABC of Mixing Cocktails&quot;. It is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury&#x27;s &quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot; (1948).

In early editions of MacElhone&#x27;s book, he cites the inventor as Pat MacGarry, &quot;the popular bartender at Buck&#x27;s Club, London&quot;, but in later editions he cites himself. While Vermiere states that the drink was &quot;very popular in France. It was first introduced in London by MacGarry, the celebrated bartender of Buck&#x27;s Club.&quot; Embury credits the invention of the drink to an American army captain in Paris during World War I and named after the motorcycle sidecar that the captain used.

The earliest recipe in MacElhone is:
: 229. Side-Car Cocktail.
: ⅓ Cointreau (Triple sec), ⅓ Brandy, ⅓ Lemon Juice.
: &quot;(Recipe by MacGarry, the popular bar-tender at Buck&#x27;s Club, London.)&quot;

Journalist O.O. McIntyre reports in his 1937 summary of a visit to New York City that bartenders there attributed the drink to American expatriates Erskine Gywnne and Basil Woon.

===Ratios===
Both MacElhone and Vermiere state the recipe as equal parts cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice (1:1:1), now known as &quot;the French school&quot;. Later, an &quot;English school&quot; of sidecars emerged, as found in the &quot;Savoy Cocktail Book&quot; (1930), which calls for two parts cognac and one part each of Cointreau and lemon juice (2:1:1).

According to Embury, the original sidecar had several ingredients, which were &quot;refined away&quot; (there is no evidence for this). Embury also states the drink is simply a daiquiri with brandy as its base rather than rum, and with Cointreau as the sweetening agent rather than sugar syrup. He recommends the same proportions (8:2:1) for both, making a much-less-sweet sidecar. However, Simon Difford, in his book &quot;Encyclopedia of Cocktails&quot;, notes Harry Craddock&#x27;s ratio of 2:1:1 in &quot;The Savoy Cocktail Book&quot;, and then suggests a middle ground between Craddock&#x27;s recipe and the &quot;French school&quot; equal parts recipe of 3:2:2, calling Embury&#x27;s daiquiri formula &quot;overly dry&quot; for a sidecar.

===Modifications===
The earliest known mention of sugaring the rim on a sidecar glass is in the 1932 American cocktail book &quot;Wet Drinks for Dry People&quot;. This was popular by 1934, when it appeared in three books: Burke&#x27;s &quot;Complete Cocktail &amp; Drinking Recipes&quot;, Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Cocktail &amp; Food Recipes&quot;, and &quot;Drinks As They Are Mixed&quot; (a revised reprint of Paul E. Lowe&#x27;s 1904 book).

Common modifications of the original recipe are a sugar rim, added sugar syrup, and an orange twist or lemon twist. Recipes of the craft cocktail renaissance of the 2000s are closer to the British ratio of 2:1:1, but almost always add sugar syrup, as the drink is otherwise considered too dry and tart.

<doc id="292800" wikidata="Q688945" url="?curid=292800" title="Dirac spinor">
<text>In quantum field theory, the Dirac spinor is the spinor that describes all known fundamental particles that are fermions, with the possible exception of neutrinos. It appears in the plane-wave solution to the Dirac equation, and is a certain combination of two Weyl spinors, specifically, a bispinor that transforms &quot;spinorially&quot; under the action of the Lorentz group.

Dirac spinors are important and interesting in numerous ways. Foremost, they are important as they do describe all of the known fundamental particle fermions in nature; this includes the electron and the quarks. Algebraically they behave, in a certain sense, as the &quot;square root&quot; of a vector. This is not readily apparent from direct examination, but it has slowly become clear over the last 60 years that spinorial representations are fundamental to geometry. For example, effectively all Riemannian manifolds can have spinors and spin connections built upon them, via the Clifford algebra. The Dirac spinor is specific to that of Minkowski spacetime and Lorentz transformations; the general case is quite similar.

This article is devoted to the Dirac spinor in the Dirac representation. This corresponds to a specific representation of the gamma matrices, and is best suited for demonstrating the positive and negative energy solutions of the Dirac equation. There are other representations, most notably the chiral representation, which is better suited for demonstrating the chiral symmetry of the solutions to the Dirac equation. The chiral spinors may be written as linear combinations of the Dirac spinors presented below; thus, nothing is lost or gained, other than a change in perspective with regards to the discrete symmetries of the solutions.

The remainder of this article is laid out in a pedagogical fashion, using notations and conventions specific to the standard presentation of the Dirac spinor in textbooks on quantum field theory. It focuses primarily on the algebra of the plane-wave solutions. The manner in which the Dirac spinor transforms under the action of the Lorentz group is discussed in the article on bispinors.

== Definition==
The Dirac spinor is the bispinor formula_1 in the plane-wave ansatz
formula_2
of the free Dirac equation for a spinor with mass formula_3,
formula_4
which, in natural units becomes
formula_5
and with Feynman slash notation may be written
formula_6

An explanation of terms appearing in the ansatz is given below.
* The Dirac field is formula_7, a relativistic spin-1/2 field, or concretely a function on Minkowski space formula_8 valued in formula_9, a four-component complex vector function.
* The Dirac spinor related to a plane-wave with wave-vector formula_10 is formula_1, a formula_9 vector which is constant with respect to position in spacetime but dependent on momentum formula_10.
* The inner product on Minkowski space for vectors formula_14 and formula_15 is formula_16.
* The four-momentum of a plane wave is formula_17 where formula_10 is arbitrary,
* In a given inertial frame of reference, the coordinates are formula_19. These coordinates parametrize Minkowski space. In this article, when formula_19 appears in an argument, the index is sometimes omitted.

The Dirac spinor for the positive-frequency solution can be written as
formula_21
where
* formula_22 is an arbitrary two-spinor, concretely a formula_23 vector.
* formula_24 is the Pauli vector,
* formula_25 is the positive square root formula_26. For this article, the formula_10 subscript is sometimes omitted and the energy simply written formula_28.

In natural units, when is added to or when is added to formula_29, means in ordinary units; when is added to , means in ordinary units. When &quot;m&quot; is added to formula_30 or to formula_31 it means formula_32 (which is called the &quot;inverse reduced Compton wavelength&quot;) in ordinary units.

==Derivation from Dirac equation==
The Dirac equation has the form
formula_33

In order to derive an expression for the four-spinor , the matrices and must be given in concrete form. The precise form that they take is representation-dependent. For the entirety of this article, the Dirac representation is used. In this representation, the matrices are
formula_34

These two 4×4 matrices are related to the Dirac gamma matrices. Note that and are 2×2 matrices here.

The next step is to look for solutions of the form
formula_35
while at the same time splitting into two two-spinors:
formula_36

===Results===
Using all of the above information to plug into the Dirac equation results in
formula_37
This matrix equation is really two coupled equations:
formula_38

Solve the 2nd equation for and one obtains 
formula_39

Note that this solution needs to have formula_40 in order for the solution to be valid in a frame where the particle has formula_41.

Derivation of the sign of the energy in this case. We consider the potentially problematic term formula_42.

* If formula_43, clearly formula_44 as formula_45.
* On the other hand, let formula_46, formula_47 with formula_48 a unit vector, and let formula_49.

formula_50

Hence the negative solution clearly has to be omitted, and formula_43. End derivation.

Assembling these pieces, the full positive energy solution is conventionally written as
formula_52
The above introduces a normalization factor formula_53 derived in the next section.

Solving instead the 1st equation for formula_54 a different set of solutions are found:
formula_55

In this case, one needs to enforce that formula_56 for this solution to be valid in a frame where the particle has formula_41. The proof follows analogously to the previous case. This is the so-called negative energy solution. It can sometimes become confusing to carry around an explicitly negative energy, and so it is conventional to flip the sign on both the energy and the momentum, and to write this as
formula_58

In further development, the formula_59-type solutions are referred to as the particle solutions, describing a positive-mass spin-1/2 particle carrying positive energy, and the formula_60-type solutions are referred to as the antiparticle solutions, again describing a positive-mass spin-1/2 particle, again carrying positive energy. In the laboratory frame, both are considered to have positive mass and positive energy, although they are still very much dual to each other, with the flipped sign on the antiparticle plane-wave suggesting that it is &quot;travelling backwards in time&quot;. The interpretation of &quot;backwards-time&quot; is a bit subjective and imprecise, amounting to hand-waving when one&#x27;s only evidence are these solutions. It does gain stronger evidence when considering the quantized Dirac field. A more precise meaning for these two sets of solutions being &quot;opposite to each other&quot; is given in the section on charge conjugation, below.

== Chiral basis ==

In the chiral representation for formula_61, the solution space is parametrised by a formula_23 vector formula_63, with Dirac spinor solution
formula_64
where formula_65 are Pauli 4-vectors and formula_66 is the Hermitian matrix square-root.

== Spin orientation ==
=== Two-spinors ===
In the Dirac representation, the most convenient definitions for the two-spinors are:
formula_67
and
formula_68
since these form an orthonormal basis with respect to a (complex) inner product.

===Pauli matrices===
The Pauli matrices are
formula_69

Using these, one obtains what is sometimes called the Pauli vector:
formula_70

==Orthogonality==
The Dirac spinors provide a complete and orthogonal set of solutions to the Dirac equation. This is most easily demonstrated by writing the spinors in the rest frame, where this becomes obvious, and then boosting to an arbitrary Lorentz coordinate frame. In the rest frame, where the three-momentum vanishes: formula_71 one may define four spinors
formula_72

Introducing the Feynman slash notation
formula_73

the boosted spinors can be written as 
formula_74
and
formula_75

The conjugate spinors are defined as formula_76 which may be shown to solve the conjugate Dirac equation
formula_77

with the derivative understood to be acting towards the left. The conjugate spinors are then
formula_78
and
formula_79

The normalization chosen here is such that the scalar invariant formula_80 really is invariant in all Lorentz frames. Specifically, this means 
formula_81

==Completeness==
The four rest-frame spinors formula_82 formula_83 indicate that there are four distinct, real, linearly independent solutions to the Dirac equation. That they are indeed solutions can be made clear by observing that, when written in momentum space, the Dirac equation has the form
formula_84
and
formula_85

This follows because
formula_86
which in turn follows from the anti-commutation relations for the gamma matrices:
formula_87
with formula_88 the metric tensor in flat space (in curved space, the gamma matrices can be viewed as being a kind of vielbein, although this is beyond the scope of the current article). It is perhaps useful to note that the Dirac equation, written in the rest frame, takes the form
formula_89
and
formula_90
so that the rest-frame spinors can correctly be interpreted as solutions to the Dirac equation. There are four equations here, not eight. Although 4-spinors are written as four complex numbers, thus suggesting 8 real variables, only four of them have dynamical independence; the other four have no significance and can always be parameterized away. That is, one could take each of the four vectors formula_82 formula_83 and multiply each by a distinct global phase formula_93 This phase changes nothing; it can be interpreted as a kind of global gauge freedom. This is not to say that &quot;phases don&#x27;t matter&quot;, as of course they do; the Dirac equation must be written in complex form, and the phases couple to electromagnetism. Phases even have a physical significance, as the Aharonov–Bohm effect implies: the Dirac field, coupled to electromagnetism, is a U(1) fiber bundle (the circle bundle), and the Aharonov–Bohm effect demonstrates the holonomy of that bundle. All this has no direct impact on the counting of the number of distinct components of the Dirac field. In any setting, there are only four real, distinct components.

With an appropriate choice of the gamma matrices, it is possible to write the Dirac equation in a purely real form, having only real solutions: this is the Majorana equation. However, it has only two linearly independent solutions. These solutions do &quot;not&quot; couple to electromagnetism; they describe a massive, electrically neutral spin-1/2 particle. Apparently, coupling to electromagnetism doubles the number of solutions. But of course, this makes sense: coupling to electromagnetism requires taking a real field, and making it complex. With some effort, the Dirac equation can be interpreted as the &quot;complexified&quot; Majorana equation. This is most easily demonstrated in a generic geometrical setting, outside the scope of this article.

==Energy eigenstate projection matrices==
It is conventional to define a pair of projection matrices formula_94 and formula_95, that project out the positive and negative energy eigenstates. Given a fixed Lorentz coordinate frame (i.e. a fixed momentum), these are
formula_96
is carried to its charge conjugate
formula_97
Note the stray complex conjugates. These can be consolidated with the identity
formula_98
to obtain
formula_99
with the 2-spinor being
formula_100
As this has precisely the form of the negative energy solution, it becomes clear that charge conjugation exchanges the particle and anti-particle solutions. Note that not only is the energy reversed, but the momentum is reversed as well. Spin-up is transmuted to spin-down. It can be shown that the parity is also flipped. Charge conjugation is very much a pairing of Dirac spinor to its &quot;exact opposite&quot;.

<text>A sidecar is a one-wheeled device attached to the side of a motorcycle, scooter, or bicycle, making the whole a three-wheeled vehicle. The combination of a motorcycle with a sidecar is sometimes called a &quot;rig&quot;, &quot;outfit&quot;, or &quot;hack&quot;.

==History==
Jean Bertoux, a French army officer, secured a prize offered by a French newspaper in 1893 for the best method of carrying a passenger on a bicycle. The sidecar wheel was mounted on the same lateral plane as the bicycle&#x27;s rear and was supported by a triangulation of tubes from the bicycle. A sprung seat with back rest was mounted above the cross-member and a footboard hung below.
A sidecar appeared in a cartoon by George Moore in the January 7, 1903, issue of the British newspaper &quot;Motor Cycling&quot;. Three weeks later, a provisional patent was granted to Mr. W. J. Graham of Graham Brothers, Enfield, Middlesex. He partnered with Jonathan A. Kahn to begin production.

One of Britain&#x27;s oldest sidecar manufacturers, Watsonian, was founded in 1912. It is still trading as Watsonian Squire. Automobile producer Jaguar Cars was founded in 1922 as a sidecar manufacturer, the Swallow Sidecar Company.

In 1913, American inventor Hugo Young, of Loudonville, Ohio, designed a new sidecar which was not rigidly fixed to the motorcycle. Instead, his invention employed a flexible connection, which allowed the sidecar to turn, raise, and lower without affecting the balance of the motorcycle. This was a great improvement over the original design, allowing for much safer and more comfortable experiences for both the passenger and driver. Young opened up the Flxible Sidecar Company (the first &quot;e&quot; was dropped to allow for trademarking the name) in Loudonville, Ohio and soon became the largest sidecar manufacturer in the world (the company closed in 1996). When the motorcycle craze began to fade in the 1920s due to more affordable cars being marketed, as well as the banishment of sidecar racing in the United States, the Flxible Sidecar Company began producing transit buses, ambulances, and hearses.

Until the 1950s sidecars were quite popular, providing a cheap alternative to passenger cars; they have also been used by armed forces, police and the UK&#x27;s AA and RAC motoring organisations. 

== Design ==

A sidecar motorcycle is a three-wheeled vehicle with the side wheel not directly aligned with the rear motorcycle wheel, and is usually powered by the rear wheel only. This is different from a motor tricycle (trike), where both rear wheels are powered and share a common axle. However, either P.V. Mokharov of the Soviet Union or H.P. Baughn of Great Britain seem to have been the first to employ a driven sidecar wheel in 1929. Baughn two-wheel-drive outfits were so successful in trials events in the early 1930s that there were attempts to have the ACU ban them from competition. A great many companies experimented with two-wheel drive in sporting events and indeed many companies employed them in military vehicles prior to the commencement of World War II. Currently, the Russian manufacturer Ural produces several models with two-wheel drive that can be engaged as desired.

The sidecar consists of a frame and of a body. The frame may either be fixed to the bike, or it may be attached in a way which makes the bike able to lean in the same manner as bikes without sidecars. Also, Ural had a reversible sidecar for the European market.

The body typically provides one passenger seat and a small trunk compartment behind. In some cases the sidecar has a removable soft top. In some modifications, the sidecar&#x27;s body is used for carrying cargo or tools, like a truck&#x27;s platform. The sidecar is typically mounted so that the motorcycle is closer to the centre of the road, i.e. with the sidecar on the right for right-hand traffic.

== Handling ==

A sidecar makes the bike asymmetrical. A fixed mounted rig with right mounted sidecar can go faster in left turns than in right turns because the sidecar prevents it from tipping over. In right turns, they can tip over if curves are taken too fast. Some techniques can be used to take a right curve faster without tipping, like usage of the brake on the sidecar, if one is fitted.

While a sidecar pilot is described as driving rather than riding, the comparison to a car is weak with all but the heaviest rigs. Driver and passenger body position affect higher speed handling, especially on dirt or other uneven surfaces. If the sidecar and bike geometry are not coordinated the combination will be unstable, especially at speed, with shimmy upon acceleration or deceleration.

In rigid mounted rigs, leaning the motorcycle by clamping it rigidly a few degrees away from the sidecar is used along with a few degrees of &quot;toe-in&quot; of the sidecar wheel toward the centerline of the vehicle to allow for road camber and provide a balance resulting in comfortable, straight line travel. Most sidecars are also fitted with steering damping devices of either friction or hydraulic type to lessen the effects of sudden inputs, as encountered on rough roads, upon the vehicle&#x27;s handling.

== Sport ==
Sidecar racing events exist in motocross (see sidecarcross), enduro, grasstrack, trial, road racing and speedway with sidecar classes. The sport has followers in Europe, the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The sidecars are often classed by age or engine size, with historic sidecar racing often being more popular than its modern counterpart. Older classes in road racing generally resemble solo motorcycles with a platform attached, where modern racing sidecars are low and long and borrow much technology from open wheel race cars. In all types of sidecar racing there is a rider and a passenger who work in unison to make the machine perform, as they would be almost unrideable without the passenger in the correct position.

Road racing sidecars began to change away from normal motorcycle development in the 1950s with them becoming lower and using smaller diameter wheels and they kept the enclosed &quot;dustbin fairing&quot; banned in solo competition in 1957. By the 1970s, they were using wide slick tyres with a square car-like profile, the rider kneeled behind the engine instead of sitting on a seat and the motor of choice was generally a 500 cc two stroke. In the late 1970s sidecars began to appear with hub centre steering and later the engines moved to the rear of the rider, to lower the centre of gravity further still, making the sidecar very long. Sidecars raced in the Sidecar World Championship are all hub centre long monocoque framed machines, the most common being LCR, ART or Windle, with 1,000 cc four-cylinder four-stroke engines, the most popular being the Suzuki GSX-R1000.

These at club and national level are known as Formula One sidecars, as opposed to Formula Two. Formula Two sidecars are short front engined bikes, which must have a frame made of steel tube and have leading link forks as monocoques and hub centre steering is banned. Engines are 350 cc two strokes or 600 cc four strokes. F2 sidecars are raced in their own championship but are often on track at the same time as the F1s, but competing for their own points. Since 1990 at the Isle of Man TT, the Sidecar TT has been solely contested by Formula Two sidecars as Formula Ones were deemed too fast, then lapping at average. By 2006 however, F2s were faster than this lapping at .
==Military use==

During World War I, the British Army sought to increase the mobility of its Vickers machine guns. A gun and its tripod weighed between ; cooling water was also required and ammunition boxes weighted a further each; each gun required a six to eight man team to carry it.

A solution to this problem was to fit the guns to sidecar motorcycles. This would allow the guns to be moved rapidly between different sectors, and allow them to quickly pursue retreating enemy troops. Clyno motorcycles were initially adopted; these could carry the gun, tripod, water and spare parts, as well as seven ammunition boxes; they were supported by unarmed sidecar motorcycles that carried only ammunition. A number of different motorcycles were eventually used. A special unit, the Motor Machine Gun Service, was formed to operate them, but the static nature of trench warfare meant the unit was infrequently used.

During World War II, German troops used many BMW and Zündapp sidecar motorcycles. On German, Italian, French, Belgian, British and Soviet military sidecars, the side wheel was sometimes also driven, sometimes using a differential gear, to improve the vehicle&#x27;s all-terrain ability.

== Regulation ==
The sidecar is normally fitted to the right of the motorcycle in jurisdictions where traffic keeps to the right side of the road; the sidecar&#x27;s position is reversed in left-side jurisdictions. This matches the usual configuration of driver and front-seat passenger in cars. In the UK, sidecars fitted to the right side are prohibited on motorcycles registered after August 1981. In Italy, left-mounted sidecars were prohibited in 1924, though the ban was not enforced until 1959.

In the Republic of China (Taiwan), Article 39-2 of the Road Traffic Security Rules prohibits the registration of new motorcycles with sidecars but does not specifically restrict fitting them later.

==Flexible sidecars==
Several flexible sidecars, not rigidly attached to the motorcycle, have been developed. This can help deal with issues of uneven pavement and allow leaning the bike into turns.

==Bicycle sidecars==
Sidecars have sometimes been fitted on bicycles. The &quot;Watsonian&quot; brand was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s in the UK. The Philippine trisikad is a type in current use.

== Manufacturers ==
Although sidecars have become much less common since the mid-1950s, a number of manufacturers worldwide have continued to produce sidecars for many popular motorcycles and scooters.

<text>The Consolidated Model 28, more commonly known as the PBY Catalina (US Navy designation), is a flying boat and amphibious aircraft designed by Consolidated Aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s. In US Army service it was designated the OA-10, in Canadian service as the Canso and it later received the NATO reporting name Mop. It was one of the most widely used seaplanes of World War II. Catalinas served with every branch of the United States Armed Forces and in the air forces and navies of many other nations. The last military PBYs served until the 1980s. As of 2021, 86 years after its first flight, the aircraft continues to fly as a waterbomber (or airtanker) in aerial firefighting operations in some parts of the world.

== Design and development ==
=== Background ===
The PBY was originally designed to be a patrol bomber, an aircraft with a long operational range intended to locate and attack enemy transport ships at sea in order to disrupt enemy supply lines. With a mind to a potential conflict in the Pacific Ocean, where troops would require resupply over great distances, the U.S. Navy invested millions of dollars in the 1930s developing long-range flying boats, which had the advantage of being able to land in any suitable waters.

=== Initial development ===
As American dominance in the Pacific Ocean began to face competition from Japan in the 1930s, the U.S. Navy contracted Consolidated, Martin and Douglas in October 1933 to build competing prototypes for a patrol flying boat. Naval doctrine of the 1930s and 1940s used flying boats in a wide variety of roles that today are handled by multiple special-purpose aircraft. The U.S. Navy had adopted the Consolidated P2Y and Martin P3M models for this role in 1931, but both aircraft were underpowered and hampered by inadequate range and limited payloads.

Consolidated and Douglas both delivered single prototypes of their new designs, the XP3Y-1 and XP3D-1, respectively. Consolidated&#x27;s XP3Y-1 was an evolution of the XPY-1 design that had originally competed unsuccessfully for the P3M contract two years earlier and of the XP2Y design that the Navy had authorized for a limited production run. Although the Douglas aircraft was a good design, the Navy opted for Consolidated&#x27;s because the projected cost was only $90,000 per aircraft.
Consolidated&#x27;s XP3Y-1 design (company &quot;Model 28&quot;) had a parasol wing with external bracing struts, mounted on a pylon over the fuselage. Wingtip stabilizing floats were retractable in flight to form streamlined wingtips and had been licensed from the Saunders-Roe company. The two-step hull design was similar to that of the P2Y, but the Model 28 had a cantilever cruciform tail unit instead of a strut-braced twin tail. Cleaner aerodynamics gave the Model 28 better performance than earlier designs. Construction was all-metal, stressed-skin, of aluminum sheet, except the ailerons and wing trailing edge, which are fabric covered.
The prototype was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-54 &#x27;Twin Wasp&#x27; radial engines mounted on the wing&#x27;s leading edge. Armament comprised four Browning AN/M2 machine guns and up to of bombs.

The XP3Y-1 had its maiden flight on 21 March 1935, after which it was transferred to the U.S. Navy for service trials. The XP3Y-1 was a significant performance improvement over previous patrol flying boats. The Navy requested further development in order to bring the aircraft into the category of &quot;patrol bomber&quot;, and in October 1935, the prototype was returned to Consolidated for further work, including installation of R-1830-64 engines. For the redesignated XPBY-1, Consolidated introduced redesigned vertical tail surfaces which resolved a problem with the tail becoming submerged on takeoff, which had made lift-off impossible under some conditions. The XPBY-1 had its maiden flight on 19 May 1936, during which a record non-stop distance flight of was achieved.

The XPBY-1 was delivered to VP-11F in October 1936. The second squadron to be equipped was VP-12, which received the first of its aircraft in early 1937. The second production order was placed on 25 July 1936. Over the next three years, the design was gradually developed further and successive models introduced.

The aircraft eventually bore the name Catalina after Santa Catalina Island, California; the name was coined in November 1941, as Great Britain ordered their first 30 aircraft.

=== PBN Nomad ===
The Naval Aircraft Factory made significant modifications to the PBY design, many of which would have significantly interrupted deliveries had they been incorporated on the Consolidated production lines. The new aircraft, officially known as the PBN-1 Nomad, had several differences from the basic PBY. The most obvious upgrades were to the bow, which was sharpened and extended by two feet, and to the tail, which was enlarged and featured a new shape. Other improvements included larger fuel tanks, increasing range by 50%, and stronger wings permitting a 2,000 lb (908 kg) increase in gross takeoff weight. An auxiliary power unit was installed, along with an improved electrical system, and the weapons were upgraded with continuous-feed mechanisms.

138 of the 156 PBN-1s produced served with the Soviet Navy, after the NAF transferred ownership via Project Zebra (1944–1945). The remaining 18 were assigned to training units at NAS Whidbey Island and the Naval Air Facility in Newport, Rhode Island. Later, improvements found in the PBN such as the larger tail were incorporated into the amphibious PBY-6A.

=== Naming ===
The designation &quot;PBY&quot; was determined in accordance with the U.S. Navy aircraft designation system of 1922; &quot;PB&quot; representing &quot;Patrol Bomber&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; being the code assigned to Consolidated Aircraft as its manufacturer. Catalinas built by other manufacturers for the U.S. Navy were designated according to different manufacturer codes, thus Canadian Vickers-built examples were designated PBV, Boeing Canada examples PB2B (there already being a Boeing PBB), Consolidated Vultee examples PB4 and Naval Aircraft Factory examples were designated PBN. In accordance with contemporary British naming practice of giving seaplanes service names after coastal port towns, Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) examples were named Canso, for the town of that name in Nova Scotia. The Royal Air Force used the name Catalina and the U.S. Navy adopted this name in 1942. The United States Army Air Forces and later the United States Air Force used the designation OA-10. U.S. Navy Catalinas used in the Pacific against the Japanese for night operations were painted black overall; as a result these aircraft were sometimes referred to locally as &quot;Black Cats&quot;.

== Operational history ==
=== Roles in World War II ===
The PBY was the most numerous aircraft of its kind, with around 3,300 aircraft built. During World War II, PBYs were used in anti-submarine warfare, patrol bombing, convoy escort, search and rescue missions (especially air-sea rescue), and cargo transport. The type operated in nearly all operational theatres of World War II. The Catalina served with distinction and played a prominent and invaluable role in the war against Japan.

These patrol planes shared with land based patrol bombers the combat roles while the very long range Consolidated LB-30 Liberator and the Consolidated Coronado were pressed into service to increase the all important logistic strategic air lift capability in the vast Pacific theater. The pairings allowed the Catalina to take on the role of eyes of the fleets at longer ranges than the floatplane scouts.

Several different flying boats were adopted by the Navy, but the PBY was the most widely used and produced.
Although the Catalina was slow and ungainly, Allied forces used the aircraft in a wide variety of roles for which it was never intended. PBYs are remembered for their rescue role, in which they saved the lives of hundreds of aircrew downed over water. Catalina airmen called their aircraft the &quot;Cat&quot; on combat missions and &quot;Dumbo&quot; in air-sea rescue service.

The Catalina scored the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first credited air-to-air &quot;kill&quot; of a Japanese airplane in the Pacific War. On 10 December 1941, the Japanese attacked the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines. Numerous U.S. ships and submarines were damaged or destroyed by bombs and bomb fragments. While flying to safety during the raid on Cavite, Lieutenant Harmon T. Utter&#x27;s PBY was attacked by three Japanese Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero carrier fighters. Chief Boatswain Earl D. Payne, Utter&#x27;s bow gunner, shot down one, thus scoring the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first kill. Utter, as a commander, later coordinated the carrier air strikes that led to the destruction of the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;.

The Catalina performed one of the first offensive operations against the Japanese by the US. On 27 December 1941, six Catalinas of Patrol Squadron 101 bombed Japanese shipping at Jolo Island against heavy fighter opposition, with four Catalinas lost.

==== Anti-submarine warfare ====
Catalinas were the most extensively used anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of World War II, and were also used in the Indian Ocean, flying from the Seychelles and from Ceylon. Their duties included escorting the Arctic convoys to Murmansk. By 1943, U-boats were well-armed with anti-aircraft guns and two Victoria Crosses were won by Catalina pilots pressing home their attacks on U-boats in the face of heavy fire: Flying Officer John Cruickshank of the RAF, in 1944, received the award for sinking what was believed to be &quot;U-347&quot; (although now known to have been &quot;U-361&quot;) and in the same year RCAF Flight Lieutenant David Hornell received the decoration posthumously for the sinking of &quot;U-1225&quot;. Their aircraft was damaged in the fight before it sunk the U-boat and Hornell (with two other crew) died from exposure. Catalinas destroyed 40 U-boats, but not without losses of their own. A Brazilian Catalina attacked and sank &quot;U-199&quot; in Brazilian waters on 31 July 1943. Later, the aircraft was baptized as &quot;Arará&quot;, in memory of the merchant ship of that name which was sunk by another U-boat.

==== Maritime patrol ====

In their role as patrol aircraft, Catalinas participated in some of the most notable naval engagements of World War II. The aircraft&#x27;s parasol wing and large waist blisters provided excellent visibility and combined with its long range and endurance, made it well suited for the task.

An RAF Coastal Command Catalina flying from Castle Archdale Flying boat base, Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, located the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 26 May 1941, some northwest of Brest. Bismarck was attempting to evade Royal Navy forces as she sought to join other Kriegsmarine forces in Brest. This sighting eventually led to the destruction of the German battleship.

On 7 December 1941, before the Japanese amphibious landings on Kota Bharu, Malaya, their invasion force was approached by a Catalina flying boat of No. 205 Squadron RAF. The aircraft was shot down by five Nakajima Ki-27 fighters before it could radio its report to air headquarters in Singapore. Flying Officer Patrick Bedell, commanding the Catalina, and his seven crew members became the first Allied casualties in the war with Japan. Patrol Wing 10 of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet had 44 Catalinas under its command but lost 41 within 90 days. Patrol Wing 10 also lost its main seaplane tender, USS &quot;Langley&quot;, to Japanese aircraft during the Dutch East Indies Campaign while it was transporting 32 Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter planes.

A flight of Catalinas spotted the Japanese fleet approaching Midway Island, beginning the Battle of Midway.
A RCAF Canso flown by Squadron Leader L.J. Birchall foiled Japanese plans to destroy the Royal Navy&#x27;s Indian Ocean fleet on 4 April 1942 when it detected the Japanese carrier fleet approaching Ceylon.

==== Night attack and naval interdiction ====
During the Battle of Midway, four U.S. Navy PBYs of Patrol Squadrons 24 and 51 made a night torpedo attack on the Japanese fleet on the night of 3–4 June 1942, scoring one hit which damaged the fleet oiler &quot;Akebono Maru&quot;, the only successful American torpedo attack in the entire battle.

During the Guadalcanal campaign, some U.S. Navy PBYs were painted matte black and sent on night bombing, torpedoing, and strafing missions against Japanese supply vessels and warships, including conducting interdiction raids on the Tokyo Express. These PBYs were later called &quot;Black Cats&quot;. Subsequently, special squadrons of Black Cats were formed, commencing in December 1942 with VP-12, with an additional thirteen squadrons coming into service thereafter. Flying slowly at night, dipping to ship mast height, the Black Cats bombed, strafed, and torpedoed all kinds of Japanese vessels, sinking or damaging thousands of tons of shipping. The Black Cats also performed bombing, strafing and harassment regarding land based Japanese installations, as well as conducting reconnaissance and search and rescue operations. The Black Cat squadrons continued to be active into 1944 with the PB4Y-2 beginning to come in service in greater numbers and replacing the PBYs, the last Black Cat squadrons returning to the U.S. in early 1945.

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) also operated Catalinas as night raiders, with four squadrons Nos. 11, 20, 42, and 43 laying mines from 23 April 1943 until July 1945 in the southwest Pacific deep in Japanese-held waters, bottling up ports and shipping routes and forcing ships into deeper waters to become targets for U.S. submarines; they tied up the major strategic ports such as Balikpapan which shipped 80% of Japanese oil supplies. In late 1944, their mining missions sometimes exceeded 20 hours in duration and were carried out from as low as in the dark. Operations included trapping the Japanese fleet in Manila Bay in assistance of General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s landing at Mindoro in the Philippines. Australian Catalinas also operated out of Jinamoc in the Leyte Gulf, and mined ports on the Chinese coast from Hong Kong to as far north as Wenzhou. Both USN and RAAF Catalinas regularly mounted nuisance night bombing raids on Japanese bases, with the RAAF claiming the slogan &quot;The First and the Furthest&quot;. Targets of these raids included a major base at Rabaul. RAAF aircrews, like their U.S. Navy counterparts, employed &quot;terror bombs&quot;, ranging from scrap metal and rocks to empty beer bottles with razor blades inserted into the necks, to produce high-pitched screams as they fell, keeping Japanese soldiers awake and scrambling for cover. There was a Catalina base on Drimmie Head on the Gove Peninsula in the Northern Territory.

==== Search and rescue ====

Catalinas were employed by every branch of the U.S. military as rescue aircraft. A PBY piloted by LCDR Adrian Marks (USN) rescued 56 sailors in high seas from the heavy cruiser after the ship was sunk during World War II. When there was no more room inside, the crew tied sailors to the wings. The aircraft could not fly in this state; instead it acted as a lifeboat, protecting the sailors from exposure and the risk of shark attack, until rescue ships arrived. Catalinas continued to function in the search-and-rescue role for decades after the end of the war.

==== Early commercial use ====

Catalinas were also used for commercial air travel. For example, Qantas Empire Airways flew commercial passengers from Suva to Sydney, a journey of , which in 1949 took two days. The longest commercial flights (in terms of time aloft) ever made in aviation history were the Qantas flights flown weekly from 29 June 1943 through July 1945 over the Indian Ocean, dubbed the Double Sunrise. Qantas offered non-stop service between Perth and Colombo, a distance of . As the Catalina typically cruised at , this took from 28 to 32 hours and was called the &quot;flight of the double sunrise&quot;, since the passengers saw two sunrises during their non-stop journey. The flight was made in radio silence because of the possibility of Japanese attack and had a maximum payload of or three passengers plus of military and diplomatic mail.

=== Post-World War II employment ===
An Australian PBY named &quot;Frigate Bird II&quot;, an ex RAAF aircraft, registered VH-ASA, made the first trans-Pacific flight across the South Pacific between Australia and Chile in 1951 by (Sir) Gordon Taylor, making numerous stops at islands along the way for refueling, meals, and overnight sleep of its crew, flown from Sydney to Quintero in Chile after making initial landfall at Valparaiso via Tahiti and Easter Island. One of six ordered by the RAAF was used as part of the air route across the Pacific from Sydney to Valparaiso, is in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney.

With the end of the war, all of the flying boat versions of the Catalina were quickly retired from the U.S. Navy, but the amphibious versions remained in service for some years. The last Catalina in U.S. service was a PBY-6A operating with a Naval Reserve squadron, which was retired from use on 3 January 1957. The Catalina subsequently equipped the world&#x27;s smaller armed services into the late 1960s in fairly substantial numbers.

The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command used Catalinas (designated OA-10s) in service as scout aircraft from 1946 through 1947.

The Brazilian Air Force flew Catalinas in naval air patrol missions against German submarines starting in 1943. The flying boats also carried out air mail deliveries. In 1948, a transport squadron was formed and equipped with PBY-5As converted to the role of amphibious transports. The 1st Air Transport Squadron (ETA-1) was based in the port city of Belem and flew Catalinas and C-47s until 1982. Catalinas were convenient for supplying military detachments scattered along the Amazon. They reached places that were otherwise accessible only by helicopters. The ETA-1 insignia was a winged turtle with the motto &quot;Though slowly, I always get there&quot;. Today, the last Brazilian Catalina (a former RCAF one) is displayed at the Airspace Museum (MUSAL) in Rio de Janeiro.

Oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau used a PBY-6A (N101CS) to support his diving expeditions. His second son, Philippe, was killed in an accident in this aircraft that occurred on the Tagus River near Lisbon. The Catalina nosed over during a high-speed taxi run undertaken to check the hull for leakage following a water landing. The aircraft turned upside down, causing the fuselage to break behind the cockpit. The wing separated from the fuselage and the left engine broke off, penetrating the captain&#x27;s side of the cockpit.

Air race champion, stunt pilot, and airline operator Paul Mantz converted an unknown number of surplus Catalinas to flying yachts at his Orange County California hangar in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Steward-Davis converted several Catalinas to their Super Catalina standard (later known as Super Cat), which replaced the usual Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines with Wright R-2600 Cyclone 14 engines of . A larger, squared-off rudder was installed to compensate for the increased yaw which the more powerful engines could generate. The Super Catalina also had extra cabin windows and other alterations.

Of the few dozen remaining airworthy Catalinas, the majority are in use as aerial firefighting aircraft.
China Airlines, the official airline of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was founded with two Catalina amphibians.

===Possible revival===
In July 2023 a company called Catalina Aircraft, current holder of the Type Certificates for the Catalina, announced an intent to build the Catalina II, a new aircraft on the basic design principles of the original Catalina but using turboprop engines and other modern aviation tools. Deliveries are said to commence by 2029.

=== Catalina affair ===
The Catalina Affair is the name given to a Cold War incident in which a Swedish Air Force search and rescue/maritime patrol Catalina (Swedish designation &quot;TP 47&quot;) was shot down by Soviet MiG 15 fighters over the Baltic Sea in June 1952 while investigating the disappearance of a Swedish Douglas DC-3 (later found to have been shot down by Soviet MiG-15s while on a signals intelligence mission; it was found in 2003 and raised 2004–2005).

== Variants ==

<text>Blockbuster or Blockbuster Video was an American multimedia brand which was founded by David Cook in 1985 as a single home video rental shop, but later became a public store chain featuring video game rentals, DVD-by-mail, streaming, video on demand, and cinema theater. The company expanded internationally throughout the 1990s. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster employed 84,300 people worldwide and operated 9,094 stores.

Poor leadership and the impact of the Great Recession were major factors leading to Blockbuster&#x27;s decline, as was the growing competition from Netflix&#x27;s mail-order service, video on demand (including the Netflix streaming service), and Redbox automated kiosks. Significant loss of revenue occurred during the late 2000s, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010. The next year, its remaining 1,700 stores were bought by satellite television provider Dish Network, and by 2014, the last 300 company-owned stores were closed. Although corporate support for the brand ended, Dish retained a small number of franchise agreements, enabling some privately owned franchises to remain open. Following a series of further closures in 2019, only one franchised store remains open, located in Bend, Oregon.

==History==
===1985–1996: David Cook era and early growth===

Blockbuster&#x27;s beginnings can be traced back to another company, Cook Data Services, founded by David Cook in 1978. The company&#x27;s primary goal was to supply software services to the oil and gas industries throughout Texas, but it was very unsuccessful. Sandy Cook, David&#x27;s wife, wanted to get into the video business, and her husband would soon study the industry and future prospects. Using profit he made from the sale of David P. Cook &amp; Associates, the subsidiary of his company, he decided to buy into a video store franchise in Dallas known as Video Works. When Video Works would not allow him to decorate the interior of his store with a blue-and-yellow design, he departed the franchise and opened the first Blockbuster Video in 1985 under his own company Blockbuster Video Inc. When he realized the potential in video rentals, Cook abandoned the oil industry and began franchising the Blockbuster store.

The first Blockbuster store opened on October 19, 1985, in Dallas, Texas, with an inventory of 8,000 VHS and 2,000 Beta tapes. The chain&#x27;s name is derived from the term &quot;blockbuster&quot;, a Hollywood term for a successful film. Cook&#x27;s experience with managing huge databases proved helpful in driving innovation within the industry. Following early success from the company&#x27;s first stores, Cook built a $6-million warehouse in Garland, Texas, to help sustain and support future growth that allowed new stores to open quickly. Blockbuster would often custom-tailor a store&#x27;s inventory to its neighborhood, based on local demographics.

In 1987, Waste Management co-founder Wayne Huizenga, who originally had reservations about entering the video rental industry, agreed to acquire several Blockbuster stores. At that time, there were 19 stores, attracting Huizenga&#x27;s associate John Melk&#x27;s attention due to its efficiency, family-friendly no-pornography image and business model. Huizenga and Melk utilized techniques from their waste business and Ray Kroc&#x27;s model of expansion to rapidly expand Blockbuster, and soon they were opening a new store every 24 hours. They took over many of the existing Blockbuster franchise stores, and Huizenga spent much of the late 1980s acquiring several of Blockbuster&#x27;s rivals, including Major Video. In 1989, Nintendo attempted to halt Blockbuster&#x27;s ability to rent video games, filing multiple lawsuits and lobbying the U.S. Congress to ban the practice. Nintendo ultimately lost the battle, which paved the way for future video game rental.

Blockbuster sponsored the Blockbuster Bowl in American football, which began in 1990 and was played at Joe Robbie Stadium outside Miami. The first three editions were played under that name before Blockbuster withdrew its sponsorship.
In 1990, Blockbuster bought mid-Atlantic rival Erol&#x27;s which had more than 250 stores. In 1992, Blockbuster acquired the Sound Warehouse and Music Plus music retail chains and created Blockbuster Music. In October 1993, Blockbuster took a controlling interest in Spelling Entertainment Group, a media company run by television producer Aaron Spelling. Blockbuster purchased Super Club Retail Entertainment Corp. on November 22, 1993, from Philips Electronics, N.V. for 5.2 million shares of Blockbuster stock. This brought approximately 270 Record Bar, Tracks, Turtles and Rhythm and Views music stores and approximately 160 video retail superstores into the corporation. It also owned 35% of Republic Pictures; that company merged with Spelling in April 1994.

Blockbuster became a multibillion-dollar company, but Huizenga was worried about how new technology could threaten their business, such as video on demand and the growth of cable television. In 1991, just three days after Time Warner had announced it would upgrade its cable system, Blockbuster&#x27;s shares dropped more than 10 percent. In 1993, he made an attempt to expand into other areas by investing in Viacom. Huizenga also considered buying a cable company, but this was unknown territory for Blockbuster and he decided not to take the risk. He also had the idea of a 2,500-acre Blockbuster sports and amusement park in Florida, something Blockbuster was still considering as late as August 1994. Unable to come up with a proper solution about how to face the growing threats to the traditional videostore, he made the decision to sell Blockbuster to Viacom and pull out. Viacom acquired Blockbuster in 1994 for $8.4 billion to help finance its bid for Paramount in the bidding war with QVC Network Inc. Blockbuster&#x27;s stock trade had been dropping steadily the months before the merger, with a small rise after the deal was announced, and by the latter part of the decade, its worth was estimated to have fallen to just $4.6 billion.

The Blockbuster Block Party concept was test-marketed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1994. It was an &quot;entertainment complex&quot; aimed at adults, containing eight themed areas housing a restaurant, games, laser tag arena, and motion simulator rides, and was housed in a windowless building the size of a city block.

During the 1990s Blockbuster expanded in the United Kingdom, purchasing the country&#x27;s Ritz Video chain. The stores were rebranded to Blockbuster.

The original Blockbuster company, Blockbuster Video Inc., was merged into the parent company Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. which had earlier replaced the Blockbuster Entertainment Company. In 1996, Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. merged into a new Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation and the retail stores, then called Blockbuster Video, were renamed Blockbuster. The logo changed slightly, but retained the ITC Machine font. In November 1996 Blockbuster confirmed that it was moving its headquarters from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to the Renaissance Tower in downtown Dallas. Most of the workers at the Florida headquarters did not want to relocate, so Blockbuster planned to hire around 500 to 600 new employees for its Dallas headquarters. The company had offered various relocation packages to all of its Fort Lauderdale staff. The second Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation was later merged into Blockbuster, Inc.

===1997–2006: John Antioco era, Netflix sale turndown, and financial peak ===
In June 1997, Taco Bell president John Antioco resigned from the company to become CEO of Blockbuster. Also that year, Warner Bros. offered Antioco an exclusive rental deal, seeing as DVDs were emerging as the new home video medium. Blockbuster was to have rights to rent new DVD releases for a period of time before they went on sale to the general public. The studio was to receive 40% of rental revenues in return, which was the same deal already in place for VHS rentals. Blockbuster turned the offer down, and the studio responded by lowering its DVD wholesale price in order to compete with the rental industry. Walmart seized the opportunity and in a few years surpassed Blockbuster as the studios&#x27; single largest source of revenue. Other mass retailers soon followed suit, selling DVDs below wholesale price as a loss leader in hopes of drawing more customers to their stores and selling them more profitable items. Unable to match prices, Blockbuster&#x27;s business model was severely affected.

In 1998, Blockbuster created DEJ Productions, which acquired 225 films primarily to provide exclusive content to its Blockbuster stores prior to being sold off to First Look Studios in 2005. During that same year, Blockbuster bought the Irish video rental store Xtra-vision, with over 200 stores in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 2009, Blockbuster sold off its Irish operations to Birchall Investments, with the few Xtra-vision stores in the United Kingdom being rebranded as Blockbuster.
In late 1998, Blockbuster launched a loyalty program called Blockbuster Rewards that allowed customers to earn free rentals, including one older title each month from the category of Blockbuster Favorites. After a 1998 test launch, the chain went nationwide with the program in 1999.

In August the same year, Viacom sold the Blockbuster Music chain to Wherehouse Entertainment, which was subsequently purchased by Trans World Entertainment in 2003.

In mid-2000, the company partnered with Enron in an attempt to create a video-on-demand service. The agreement was supposed to last for 20 years; however, Enron terminated the deal in March 2001 over fears that Blockbuster would not be able to provide sufficient films for the service (Enron also filed for bankruptcy that year). Also in 2000, Blockbuster turned down a chance to purchase the fledgling Netflix for $50 million (~$ in ).

In 2002, Blockbuster acquired Movie Trading Company, a Dallas chain that buys, sells, and trades movies and games, to study potential business models for DVD and game trading. Also that year, it acquired Gamestation, a 64-store UK computer and console games retailer chain, and purchased DVD Rental Central for $1 million, an Arizona father-and-son online DVD-rental company with about ten thousand subscribers. DVD Rental Central would eventually become Blockbuster Online.

On or around October 14, 2004, Blockbuster was spun-off from Viacom. Online DVD subscriptions were introduced on Blockbuster.com, also known as Blockbuster Online. Blockbuster also rolled out its &quot;Game Rush&quot; store-in-store concept to approximately 450 domestic company-operated stores. Blockbuster began game and DVD trading in selected U.S. stores.

At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had more than 9,000 stores worldwide. In December 2004, Blockbuster announced its intention to pursue a hostile takeover of Hollywood Video, its major U.S. competitor. After several extensions of the tender offer, Blockbuster withdrew due to FTC opposition. To counter the Blockbuster offer, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout in January 2005 by a smaller competitor, the Dothan, Alabama-based Movie Gallery. Since then, Movie Gallery has filed for bankruptcy twice and its entire chain of stores has been liquidated.

In May 2005, financier Carl Icahn waged a successful proxy fight to add himself and two other members to the board. Icahn accused Blockbuster of overpaying chairman and CEO John F. Antioco, who had served in that capacity since 1997, receiving $51.6 million (~$ in ) in compensation for 2004. Icahn was also at odds with Antioco on how to revive profit at Blockbuster. Antioco scrapped late fees in January, started an internet service, and decided to keep the company independent, while Icahn wanted to sell out to a private equity firm. Also in 2005, Blockbuster began a campaign promoting its &quot;No more late fees&quot; policy. The campaign proved controversial, with Associated Press reporting that the new policy actually charged users the full price of the movie or game after eight days which they could cancel by returning the product in question and paying a fee. More than 40 states filed suit against the company for false advertising. Blockbuster later settled the suit by agreeing to refunds, as well as promising to better explain the policy.

Vintage Stock acquired the Movie Trading Company name from Blockbuster in 2006, and continues to use the name for Dallas-area stores.

===2007–2011: James Keyes era, financial decline, and bankruptcy===

A billion-dollar campaign called &quot;Total Access&quot; was introduced in 2007 as a strategy against Netflix. Through Blockbuster Online, customers could rent a DVD online and receive a new movie for free when they returned it to a Blockbuster store. While it was a major success every free movie cost the company two dollars, but the hope was that it would attract enough new subscribers to cover the loss. Netflix felt threatened, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings approached Antioco with a suggestion to buy Blockbuster&#x27;s online business. In return, a new system would be introduced where customers could return their movies to a Blockbuster store. Before the deal could be realized, board member Carl Icahn intervened, refusing to let the company lose more money through Total Access. Antioco was pushed out in July and replaced with James Keyes, who rejected Hastings&#x27; proposal, raised the price of online DVD rentals and put an end to the free movie deal. As a consequence, Blockbuster Online&#x27;s previously massive growth quickly stopped. Antioco&#x27;s departure reportedly also involved continued controversy over his compensation. He left with a $24.7 million (~$ in ) severance package.

On June 19, 2007, after a pilot program launched in late 2006, Blockbuster announced that it had chosen Blu-ray over HD DVD format to rent in a majority of its stores. In the pilot program, Blockbuster offered selected titles for rental and sale in 250 stores. Blockbuster stocked Blu-ray titles in almost 5,000 stores across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia.

On July 2, 2007, the company named James W. Keyes, former president and CEO of 7-Eleven, as the new chairman and CEO. He introduced a new business strategy that included enhancements to existing stores. The following month in August, Blockbuster acquired Movielink for $6.6 million (~$ in ), forecasting a shift to streaming video. Movielink was an online video service that allowed customers to download movie rentals from a library of over 6,000 films, created in 2002 by five major studios including Warner Bros, MGM Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, and Universal Studios. The move gave Blockbuster the opportunity to move away from the unprofitable Total Access (DVD-by-mail) service in favor of online streaming. Despite growing competition from Netflix and Redbox, the company downplayed the threat, choosing instead to focus on Apple and Walmart as their primary competition.

On September 14, 2007, Blockbuster GB Ltd bought a number of retail stores from ChoicesUK plc. ChoicesUK is an AIM-listed multi-channel distributor and retailer of DVDs, computer games, and CDs. The sale secured employment for approximately 450 employees across 59 stores in the UK. As part of the transaction, Blockbuster GB rebranded the stores as Blockbuster.

On February 17, 2008, Blockbuster proposed a buyout of struggling Circuit City. However, following a due diligence review of Circuit City&#x27;s financial books, Blockbuster withdrew its offer in July 2008. Analysts were not favorable to the proposed deal, viewing it as a desperate effort to save two struggling retailers rather than a bold turnaround initiative. Subsequently, Circuit City filed for bankruptcy on November 10, 2008, and, after liquidating all of its stores, ceased operations on March 8, 2009.

At the beginning of 2010, Blockbuster had over 6,500 stores, of which 4,000 were in the U.S.— a number that fell to 3,425 in late October the same year. In the United States it planned to close between 810 and 960 retail stores, and instead launch as many as 10,000 &quot;Blockbuster Express&quot; video rental kiosks by the middle of 2010. It has been claimed that more than 43 million U.S. households had Blockbuster memberships.

On February 10, 2010, Blockbuster announced that it would cease all its operations in Portugal, closing down 17 outlets and leaving over 100 workers unemployed. Blockbuster representatives in Portugal blamed internet piracy and the lack of government response to it as the key factors to the company&#x27;s failure in the country.

In March 2010, Blockbuster began &quot;Additional Daily Rates&quot;, or &quot;ADRs&quot;, for rentals not returned by their due date in the United States, having already used this procedure in other countries such as the UK for many years. An ADR was charged for each day a member kept the rental beyond the rental terms. On March 12, 2010, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Blockbuster&#x27;s independent registered public accounting firm, issued its audit opinion disclosing substantial doubt about Blockbuster&#x27;s ability to continue as a going concern. This report was included in Blockbusters&#x27;s 10-K SEC filing. On March 17, 2010, Blockbuster issued a bankruptcy warning after continued drops in revenue threatened its ability to service its nearly $1 billion (~$ in ) debt load. By April 1, 2010, Carl Icahn had resigned from Blockbuster&#x27;s board of directors and sold nearly all his remaining Blockbuster stock. Blockbuster paired up with Time Warner to have Warner Bros. movies made available in Blockbuster stores on the DVD release date and not be subject to a four-week delay. Similar agreements were also made with Universal and 20th Century Fox.

The liquidation of Movie Gallery began in May 2010, eliminating Blockbuster&#x27;s primary competitor. During the same month a dissident shareholder, Gregory S. Meyer, in an effort to be elected to Blockbuster&#x27;s board of directors, engaged in a proxy battle with Blockbuster&#x27;s board, alleging that the board had been responsible for significant destruction of value to shareholders. Meyer was elected to the board at Blockbuster&#x27;s shareholder meeting in Dallas on June 24, 2010.

On July 1, 2010, the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after its shareholders failed to pass a reverse stock split plan aimed at heading off involuntary delisting because of the stock&#x27;s trading at well below $1 per share. The stock was then traded on the OTCBB (over-the-counter bulletin board).
Blockbuster was unable to make a $42.4 million (~$ in ) interest payment to bondholders and was given until August 13, 2010, to pay off the debt. The company hired Jeff Stegenga to be its chief restructuring officer (CRO) in an effort to satisfy bondholder demands and recapitalize the company. After failing to pay on August 13, bondholders gave Blockbuster until September 30, 2010.

On August 26, 2010, news media reported that Blockbuster was planning to file a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-September. In light of this news, the company&#x27;s chief financial officer (CFO), Tom Casey, resigned on September 11. He was replaced by Dennis McGill, formerly CFO of Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. On September 23, 2010, Blockbuster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to challenging losses, $900 million (~$ in ) in debt, and strong competition from Netflix, Redbox, and video on-demand services. Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation earlier in 2010 for similar reasons.

At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, Blockbuster said it would keep its 3,300 stores open; however, that December it announced it would close an additional 182 stores by the end of April 2011 in attempts to emerge from bankruptcy. It was reported in February 2011 that Blockbuster and its creditors had not come up with a Chapter 11 exit plan and that the company would be sold for $300 million (~$ in ) or more, along with taking over debts and leases. Blockbuster admitted that it might not be able to meet financial obligations required under its Chapter 11 filing, a circumstance which could mandate conversion of the bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 (liquidation). On March 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a claim disclosing that Blockbuster did not have the funds to continue reorganizing and should liquidate.

On March 28, 2011, South Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom made a surprise bid to buy Blockbuster. Dish Network had also expressed interest in bidding, as did Carl Icahn, despite calling Blockbuster &quot;the worst investment I ever made&quot;. Dish eventually won the auction on April 6, 2011, agreeing to buy Blockbuster for $320 million (~$ in ) and the assumption of $87 million (~$ in ) in liabilities and other obligations. On April 19, 2011, it was announced that Dish would keep only 500 Blockbuster stores open. The acquisition was completed on April 26, 2011. In April 2011, Dish Network told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court that it needed more time to negotiate with landlords in an effort to keep more than 600 Blockbuster stores open.

In April 2011, Blockbuster&#x27;s landlords objected to its assumption of leases that it sought to assign to soon-to-be-owner Dish Network Corp., claiming that they did not have adequate assurance that the new owner would honor those leases. Blockbuster signed a deal with ITV Studios Global Entertainment to launch ITV Programmes released on DVDs, Blu-rays, etc. On May 6, 2011, Keyes resigned as Blockbuster&#x27;s CEO.

===2011–2015: Michael Kelly era===
Keyes was replaced by Michael Kelly under the new title of Blockbuster&#x27;s president. On August 31, 2011, the liquidators announced the closure of the remaining 253 Canadian stores and shutting of the entire Canadian unit. In September 2011, it was announced that Blockbuster and Dish Network would launch a new service called Blockbuster Movie Pass that would compete with Netflix. For $10 per month the members would have access to both a streaming service and movies and games-by-mail. The package was only available for subscribers of Dish Network&#x27;s pay-TV service, and it eventually folded.
On January 13, 2012, Dish CEO Joe Clayton announced that while Dish had planned to keep 90% of the stores in operation, meaning around 15,000 employees would remain employed, because of market factors &quot;there are ones that aren&#x27;t going to make it. We will close unprofitable stores. We will close additional stores.&quot; Clayton did not say when these additional closings would happen and only remarked that some stores were unprofitable. The Dish chief would not say which stores the company was planning to close, but that each potential closing was to be assessed on a &quot;case by case basis&quot;.

On October 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it was scrapping plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster UK entered into administration and Deloitte was appointed to run the business while trying to find a buyer while some of the stores remained open. Between November 6, 2013, and January 12, 2014, all 300 remaining corporate-owned Blockbuster stores in the U.S. were closed and the DVD-by-mail program was shut down. The Blockbuster official website identified 51 franchise locations remaining in operation in the U.S. in 2014. Dish maintained its video streaming services, Blockbuster on Demand and Blockbuster@Home, until they were replaced by a new subscription service in April 2015 called &quot;DISH Movie Pack&quot;. In May 2015, Michael Kelly retired from Dish.

Blockbuster&#x27;s decline was attributed to poor leadership according to others in the industry. Franchise owner Ken Tisher said in 2015, &quot;Blockbuster, if it isn&#x27;t already, is going to go into the Harvard Business Review for how not to run a business, or how to run a business into the ground.&quot; Keith Hoogland, owner of Family Video, attributed poor decision-making as a primary reason the company did not survive. Jonathan Salem Baskin, a former Blockbuster marketing communications executive, stated, &quot;Digital would have changed Blockbuster&#x27;s business, for sure, but it wasn&#x27;t its killer. That credit belongs to Blockbuster itself.&quot; Commentators view Blockbuster as a main example of failing to change with the times.

===2015–present: Post-Kelly era and continual decline===
Although Blockbuster stores had the option of remaining open by paying a licensing fee to Dish, a corporate entity was no longer available to provide supplies of branded products, forcing franchisees to design and produce their own. Additional store closures continued. By January 2018, the company&#x27;s website listed nine remaining franchise-owned stores in the United States, including six in Alaska, two in Oregon, and one in Texas. Eight of those nine had closed by August 2018, leaving only one store in Bend, Oregon.

In January 2020, the last remaining store outside of the United States, located in Dargaville, New Zealand, closed its doors. The Bend location became the last remaining Blockbuster in the world; it serves as a tourist destination, housing Blockbuster memorabilia and Russell Crowe film props which John Oliver had donated to an Alaska store. In August 2020, the location was listed as an Airbnb rental for a 1990s-themed sleepover on three separate nights in September; each were limited to guests from the area in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The entity that operated Blockbuster prior to the sale to Dish remains nominally active under the name BB Liquidating Inc., and trades as a penny stock. However, it no longer has any assets or ties to the Blockbuster brand or its remaining franchise location. In activity related to the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, the BB Liquidating stock surged, despite there being &quot;no value for the common shareholders in the bankruptcy liquidation process, even under the most optimistic of scenarios.&quot;

On September 21, 2022, the Blockbuster Twitter account revealed the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship 3. The event was held during the Portland Retro Gaming Expo 2022. On March 23, 2023, the Blockbuster web page was re-activated, with the message &quot;We are working on rewinding your movie&quot;.

==Business model==
The standard business model for video rental stores had traditionally been to pay a large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through the global media measurement and research company Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized on the fact that movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70–$100 per title.

===Quantity and selection of titles===
Blockbuster stores followed a strategy of emphasizing access to the most popular new releases, obtaining early access and stocking many copies of the new-release titles, with a relatively narrower range of selections than traditional independent video stores. Much of the shelf space in the stores was devoted to popular titles that were placed relatively sparsely on the shelves with the entire front cover visible, so customers could browse casually and quickly, rather than having a more diverse selection with fewer copies of each title. Blockbuster sometimes contracted with studios to obtain earlier access to new titles than other companies could achieve. Examples of such contracts were those in which Blockbuster became the exclusive rental chain for new releases from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly WWF, World Wrestling Federation), Funimation, Rhino, Paramount, DreamWorks, DWA, Universal, Lionsgate, Summit, Anchor Bay, Manga, The Weinstein Company, Dimension, Miramax, Hollywood, Touchstone, Disney, Buena Vista, 20th Century Fox, MGM/UA, Orion, Sony, Columbia, Tristar, Image, Shout! Factory, Warner Bros., HBO, New Line Cinema and Allumination FilmWorks. As one commentator complained: Blockbuster was once an unstoppable giant whose franchises swept across the country putting mom and pop video stores out of business left and right by offering a larger selection of new releases, pricing them at a lower point due to the volume they worked in... Gone were the fragmented, independently owned shops that were often unorganized treasure troves of VHS discoveries. In their place were walls of new releases: hundreds of copies of a small handful of films. Everyone watching the same thing, everyone developing the same limited set of expectations... They put focus entirely on what was new rather than on discovering film history ...

When a title was no longer a new release, each store would retain a few copies of it and typically sell off the rest as &quot;previously viewed&quot; for discounted prices. Older movies would be re-categorized as &quot;Blockbuster Favorite&quot; titles and placed in a different area of the store. Most Blockbuster locations also accepted trade-ins of used movies, TV shows, and games.

Since Blockbuster&#x27;s founding in 1985, the chain refused to stock adult films in order to portray the brand as family-friendly. However, the company did carry R-rated and unrated films.

==Other ventures==
===Blockbuster Entertainment Awards===

Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. ran an awards show annually from 1995 to 2001 called the &quot;Blockbuster Entertainment Awards&quot;. In November 2001, Blockbuster announced that it would cancel the 2002 award show following concerns about viewership and celebrity attendance following the September 11 attacks.

===Blockbuster Express===
Blockbuster Express was a movie-rental kiosk brand sublicensed for use by licensee NCR Corporation. In 2011, nearly 10,000 Blockbuster Express kiosks were in operation. Apart from the license to use the Blockbuster brand name, Blockbuster Express kiosks are unrelated to Blockbuster LLC, its stores, its DVD-by-mail service, or its online streaming service.

The names &quot;Blockbuster Express&quot; and &quot;Blockbuster Video Express&quot; had also been used for smaller Blockbuster retail stores in the United Kingdom.

===GameRush===

In 2004, Blockbuster opened store-within-a-store video game rental and sales stores called GameRush inside Blockbuster locations in limited markets. Blockbuster also acquired Rhino Video Games, a chain of video game stores in the Southwest, and operated it alongside GameRush. These stores sold and bought DVDs, games, game consoles, and accessories. GameRush was positioned as a direct competitor to stores such as GameStop and GameCrazy. Blockbuster used its location status to get instant coverage; it also promoted these stores by hosting video-game tournaments, special trade-in offers, and a more &#x27;hip&#x27; look to the selection and staff. However, when Blockbuster introduced the discontinuation of late fees, GameRush was put on the chopping block. In January 2007, Blockbuster sold Rhino Video Games to GameStop Corp. According to the Blockbuster Twitter account, GameRush was to be part of the &quot;new Blockbuster&quot; in 2016 and even had its own Twitter profile, however the GameRush Twitter account has not been active since January 2017.

===Discovery Zone===
In 1993, Blockbuster invested in the indoor kids&#x27; play restaurant Discovery Zone. In 1995, Blockbuster bought more stock to take control of the company. Discovery Zone filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 26, 1996, after changes in management &amp; aggressive expansion put them in heavy debt. DZ was emerged a year later under Wellspring Associates ownership, with Blockbuster no longer have control of the chain. Discovery Zone abruptly closed half of its locations in 1999 and sold thirteen others to the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s. The rest of the Discovery Zone locations closed in December 2001. The chain was revived as a single location in Cincinnati, Ohio, on February 7, 2020. It remains in operation, but it is not owned by Blockbuster.

==International operations==
===Australia===
In Australia, the first Blockbuster store was opened in 1991 in Melbourne. In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to set up Australia&#x27;s first Virgin Megastores in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. This lasted until Virgin sold its interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994, Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both Victoria and South Australia. In 1995, the growth continued with the opening of the 100th video store in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into franchising with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in Queensland, and the former Movieland group in Western Australia six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in Pitt Street, Sydney, and Chapel Street, Melbourne to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its Sanity Entertainment brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets.

In February 2007, Blockbuster sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide—29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. Video Ezy had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group&#x27;s market share to 40% of the country&#x27;s video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the master franchise agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy to Franchise Entertainment Group (FEG). In October 2010, FEG transferred control of the Video Ezy Australia and Blockbuster Australia online businesses to its newly acquired and reorganized company, Elan Media Partners, leaving FEG to manage the franchise relationships with individual Video Ezy and Blockbuster outlets.

Despite the two brands coming together, Video Ezy and Blockbuster franchises closed 270 stores across Australia in the four years to August 2011. Additional store closings would go on for several years, until all the stores in Australia had closed, although vending kiosks with the Blockbuster logo were still in operation until early 2021. Australia&#x27;s last Blockbuster store, in Morley, Western Australia, was closed at the end of March 2019.

===Brazil===
Blockbuster was the largest video rental chain in the country, but finances were not good enough due to high rental prices. Lojas Americanas, the largest Brazilian department store, acquired half of the shares and now it is named under &quot;Americanas Express Blockbuster&quot;. The store layout was similar to a regular American store with a Game Rush, but instead of games it offers electronics goods like computers and DVD players, groceries like candies and microwave popcorn, and even toys from Mattel and Hasbro&#x27;s board games. In January 2007, when Blockbuster had 127 stores across Brazil, it sold its Brazilian stake for $87.4 million (~$ in ) and gave Lojas Americanas exclusive rights to the Blockbuster brand in the country for 20 years. The average store has an interior of about 400 m, where 80-100 m is dedicated to movies.

===Canada===

In Canada, Blockbuster Canada (established in 1990) had operated independently, and it initially remained financially stable. It began a partnership with Wind Mobile in December 2009, selling mobile phones at all stores in cities where Wind&#x27;s service was available. Phone sales began in Toronto and Calgary, later expanding to other cities with Wind coverage. Some stores even featured a full Wind &quot;store-in-a-store&quot; for postpaid activations and a larger selection of devices. However, on May 3, 2011, it was announced that the company had gone into receivership. On May 25, 2011, it was announced that 146 stores, accounting for approximately 35% of the company&#x27;s stores in Canada, would be shut down effective June 18, 2011. On August 31, 2011, Blockbuster Canada announced that no buyer could be found for its remaining stores that were acceptable to the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, and that it would wind down operations and close all stores by December 31, 2011. The company had acted as a guarantor towards Blockbuster&#x27;s remaining debt.

===Denmark===
Blockbuster came to Denmark in 1996 with the acquisition of 29 Christianshavn video stores. In 2009 they were on its peak with 72 stores across the country. Blockbuster Video Denmark sold the rights for the Blockbuster brand to the Danish telecommunications corporation TDC in 2013, excluding the 46 remaining brick and mortar stores which continued as RecycleIT A/S, diversifying in refurbishing and reselling consumer electronics in addition sale and rental of games and movies. The original goal was to rename all the stores before July 1, 2014, when TDC would get the exclusive rights to the brand name in Denmark, but only 12 of them had been renamed at the end of June and RecycleIT A/S filed for bankruptcy the same year. The 12 RecycleIT stores were bought by the company Blue City. The new owners planned to gradually phase out game and movie sales and rental within 2016, but due to the fast changes in the market it happened almost immediately after the takeover, and seven of the stores, therefore, closed in 2015. In 2017, the five remaining ones had started to make some profit, and focus exclusively on second-hand consumer electronics

However, the Blockbuster On Demand service is still active in Nordic Countries, offering both unlimited streaming and 48-hour rental of films online. Several Smart TVs have the Blockbuster app pre-installed out-of-the-box, and it is available on a variety of streaming devices such as Google&#x27;s Chromecast. The rights to the Blockbuster brand are now in hands of Nuuday.

===Germany===
Blockbuster opened 20 stores in Berlin and Munich and announced plans to open 250 more. Blockbuster left the German market in 1997.

===Hong Kong===
In 1998, after the closure of KPS Video Express, Blockbuster saw an opportunity to enter into the Hong Kong market, and entered into negotiations with KPS&#x27;s receivers Ernst &amp; Young to buy the KPS operations. Blockbuster re-opened 15 of 38 former KPS stores by February 16, 1998,
 and re-employed 145 former KPS staff. KPS members were given special offers to join Blockbuster, but the video pre-paid coupon system was not retained.

Blockbuster pulled out of the market in 2004 after high operating costs and losses to copyright infringement.

===Ireland===

In March 2010, Blockbuster announced that it intended to sell all operations in Europe. The company once had an Irish subsidiary, Xtravision, which did not operate under the Blockbuster brand name. Blockbuster sold Xtravision at a loss in August 2009 to Birchhall Investments Limited. All remaining stores were closed in 2016, leaving only its online business and vending machines. In June 2021, Xtravision Xpress was placed into voluntary receivership.

===Israel===
In the late 2000s at its peak, Blockbuster Israel had 40 branches and more than 260 automated video rentals. In December 2011, Blockbuster closed off its last branch store, and had only 80 automated video rentals left.

===Japan===
In March 1991, Fujita Den Trading (which was the master franchise owner of McDonald&#x27;s in Japan) and Blockbuster Inc. entered into a joint venture to establish Japan&#x27;s first Blockbuster Video stores. By October 1992, Fujita and Blockbuster opened 15 stores in the country – four of them next to McDonald&#x27;s outlets and most being located in the greater Tokyo area. Unlike Blockbuster&#x27;s U.S. stores, each Japanese outlet only occupied about half the floor space at 5,000 square feet due to the country&#x27;s more limited available real estate. By June 1996, 32 stores were in operation with a public aim for 150 by 1998. Blockbuster Japan faced heavy competition from Osaka-based video rental chain, Tsutaya, with its 817 outlets, but the company saw opportunity in the population having high VCR ownership levels (at around 75%), low satellite TV penetration (at around 27%), and well-ordered store layouts (unique for most local video stores). However, Blockbuster&#x27;s business strategy of &quot;wholesome home entertainment&quot; saw it refuse to stock adult entertainment, which accounted for 35% of the Japanese video market, or the extreme horror films that were also popular. All of which meant Blockbuster was unable to fit adequately into the Japanese market, and was immediately put at a disadvantage compared to competitors that had no such ethical stance. Blockbuster handed its remaining shares over to Fujita Den Trading in 1999, and exited the Japanese market.

===Mexico===
In September 2015, all remaining Blockbuster retail stores (263 in total) in Mexico had been converted to &quot;The B Store&quot;, and the floor space dedicated to video rentals reduced from 70% to 20%, the remaining space being used for general technology and electronics sales. The re-branding occurred with the owners not renewing their license with Blockbuster and the imminent expiry of the existing license. All remaining B-stores closed by July 2016.

===New Zealand===
The chain also operated for many years in New Zealand, but over the years lost customers to other retailers like United Video and Video Ezy, as well as the rise of streaming services. While the store in Bend, Oregon was generally regarded as the last Blockbuster store, there was one in Dargaville, north of Auckland, that managed to stay open until finally closing at the end of January 2020.

===Norway===
In December 2002 the first Blockbuster store opened in Norway, and was followed by another store some months later in 2003, both located in Oslo. The hope was to acquire an already existing video chain. When that failed, it was made an attempt to build a Norwegian blockbuster chain from scratch. But both stores closed in the spring of 2004.

===Peru===
Blockbuster opened its first store in Peru in 1995, and by 2002 it had ten stores in Lima. However, in 2006, Blockbuster announced that it planned to shut down its stores in Peru due to poor revenues, which it blamed on the effect of movie piracy. The last store in Peru was closed on January 3, 2007. The company had already closed down its stores in Ecuador, Portugal and Costa Rica. El Salvador followed in 2010, and Argentina in 2011.

===United Kingdom===
In March 1989, Blockbuster opened their first store in the United Kingdom on Walworth Road, London. In February 1992, Blockbuster purchased Citivision PLC, the biggest home-video company in Britain, for $81 million (~$ in ). At the time, Citivision operated about 775 stores in Britain branded as Ritz.

Blockbuster UK operated trade functions in all their stores, buying and selling pre-owned DVDs, console games, and gaming accessories. Stores offered either store credit or cash for trade-ins, and would price-match with competitors. At its height in 2002, Blockbuster UK operated out of over 800 stores.

In early 2013, the company had 528 locations in the United Kingdom. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster placed its United Kingdom subsidiaries in administration, putting over 4,000 jobs at risk. Non-UK stores were unaffected by the administration, and continued to trade as normal. On February 1, 2013, a large number of Blockbuster stores in the UK were closed, and the UK business was purchased out of administration by restructuring firm Gordon Brothers Europe on March 23, 2013.

Blockbuster UK then traded as TS Operations, with only 264 branches retained. On October 29, 2013, Blockbuster UK announced it was to go into administration for a second time. On November 14, 2013, 72 store closures were announced, with another 62 made on December 5. A week later, with no success in finding a buyer, it was announced by Moorfields Corporate Recovery that all remaining stores in the country would cease operation on December 16, 2013, with stock to be cleared the day before this.

In September 2018, to coincide with the digital release of &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, a pop-up retail store in the style of an original 1989 Blockbuster outlet was opened for two days in Shoreditch in East London. The store gave away 1,989 copies of the film in reference to Blockbuster&#x27;s entry year into the UK market.

==Online rentals==
===Brazil===
In January 2006, Blockbuster Brazil also introduced an online rental service now featuring both DVD and Blu-ray plans. There were four Block plans available with prices ranging from R$34.90 to R$79.90. The 3-disc plan with unlimited exchanges was R$49.90/month. Unlike the U.S. service, there was no in-store disk exchange.

===Movielink acquisition===
On August 8, 2007, Blockbuster announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase Movielink. According to the 8-K filing by Blockbuster, the total purchase price was $6.6 million.

===The Nordics===
Blockbuster streaming service is still active in Nordic Countries, offering both unlimited streaming and 48-hour rental of films online. Several Smart TVs have the Blockbuster app pre-installed out-of-the-box, and it is available on a variety of streaming devices such as Google&#x27;s Chromecast. In 2020, the rights to the Blockbuster brand moved to Nuuday, and to SF Anytime AB in 2023.

===United Kingdom===
Rentals cost £3.50 to £4.50 and lasted for five nights, usually from Monday to Friday due to the postal service. Late fees of £0.70 to £0.90 per disc applied if a disc was not returned on time.

In May 2004, Blockbuster also introduced an online subscription service. The unlimited three-disc plan cost £14.99/month but did not allow in-store exchange, contrary to the U.S. service. Partial support for in-store exchange was added in April 2005 with the launch of an &quot;OnlineXtra&quot; service. This service cost £2 per month, required an online subscription to a disc plan, and added two extra discs sent by mail. The OnlineXtra discs could be exchanged in store, but the non-OnlineXtra discs could not. The program was discontinued in 2006 with no grandfathering, but an in-store-only variant of it resurfaced in early 2008. A &quot;Click &amp; Collect&quot; service launched in September 2010 allowed the reservation of Blockbuster movies in store, but the store&#x27;s regular rental fees applied until the company added in-store exchanges in May 2012. Support for game reservations was added in November 2011.

In 2008, Blockbuster UK&#x27;s website underwent an overhaul, with an online store; a retail store stock checker; improved search functionality; and a critically acclaimed layout. In-store pickup and exclusive titled were added in 2009. Some of the titles which had an exclusivity period at Blockbuster include Gran Torino, Changeling, Taken, and Knowing. Additionally, online rental downloads of Universal Pictures in the United Kingdom remains exclusive to Blockbuster. This provides an advantage to the rental company compared to its competitors HMV, Play, and LoveFilm.

In January 2010, Blockbuster UK launched an online blog. Improved search algorithms, product pages, and social network links were added to the site in April 2010. Blockbuster UK aired a monthly &quot;BB Insider&quot; online video show from May 2010 to January 2011 and launched an iPhone App in September 2010. Throughout the year 2011, Blockbuster UK announced several price cuts along with a new Blockbuster loyalty card program.

These price drops were followed by a price drop of the Blockbuster UK online pay per rent service. Although some Blockbuster UK advertisements claim that the company no longer charges late fees, the fine print and/or voiceover clarifies that rentals will be charged an extra pound for every additional night. A &quot;Top Ticket&quot; feature was added in April 2011, allowing monthly subscription customers to rent an additional movie at no extra charge and to receive it before other movies they request. Support for online sales of used movie and game discs was added in July 2011. The Blockbuster UK website was enhanced in September 2011. During the following month, a new TV section was added to the website.

3D Blu-rays were added to Blockbuster UK in February 2012. In May 2012, Blockbuster UK partnered with IGN to launch a new Blockbuster VIP Gamer loyalty program.

On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster UK entered administration, appointing Deloitte as company administrators, casting doubt over the future of their 528 stores in the country. An announcement was then made by Deloitte that 160 UK stores would close.

On February 13, 2013, Deloitte announced a further 164 store closures, leaving 204 stores trading in the UK. The business was sold to restructuring firm the Gordon Brothers Group on March 23, 2013. On October 29, 2013, Gordon Brothers filed notice of intention to appoint an administrator. On November 28, 2013, Blockbuster UK officially entered administration for the second time, and by December 2013, all stores were closed, as no buyer for the chain was found.

===United States===
In 1997, Enron Corporation had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber optic cables throughout the United States. In 2001, Enron and Blockbuster Inc. attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream movies on demand over Enron&#x27;s fiber optic network. However, the &quot;heavily promoted&quot; deal fell through, with Enron&#x27;s shares dropping following the announcement.

On August 11, 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD-by-mail service in the US to compete with the established market leader, Netflix.

Blockbuster&#x27;s US online operation started with around 10 warehouses; further expansions every year brought that number to 41, plus more than 1400 stores in the Blockbuster Online network. Most Blockbuster independent franchises did not honor the Total Access program. The company had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2006. Blockbuster&#x27;s move to follow the business pattern with its online rentals as was established by Netflix prompted Netflix to sue Blockbuster for patent infringement. Blockbuster counter sued with a counterclaim alleging deceptive practices with its patent which it alleged was designed to maintain an illegal monopoly. The suits were eventually settled, and while the terms were not disclosed it was later reported that Netflix recorded a settlement payment from Blockbuster of $4.1 million (~$ in ) in the second quarter of 2007.

Blockbuster offered several online movie rental plans. In some cities customers could add games to their movie rental queue as if they were included in their plan, but game rentals resulted in a separate additional fee which was not displayed or charged until the end of the billing cycle. Until July 26, 2007, Blockbuster offered and advertised unlimited free in-store exchanges of online rentals with all plans. Since then there were several changes back and forth with regard to this policy; in March 2010 customers were allowed a limited number of in-store exchanges.

At the end of 2006, Blockbuster Total Access had 2.2 million customers, exceeding their original goal of 2 million, according to its website. After an aggressive media campaign that accounted for much of Blockbuster&#x27;s $46.4 million (~$ in ) net loss in the first quarter of 2007, the Total Access subscriber base surpassed 3 million customers in total, marking the company&#x27;s highest subscriber growth quarter ever. By 2009, however, the company was declining to provide figures when asked by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

On January 5, 2007, Southern Stores Inc., one of Blockbuster&#x27;s largest franchise operators in the United States, filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that, by introducing Blockbuster Online and Blockbuster Total Access, the rental chain has undercut the group&#x27;s franchise agreement.

On August 6, 2010, Blockbuster By Mail subscribers gained access to Blockbuster&#x27;s library of console games, in addition to movies and television shows.

On March 31, 2012, Blockbuster On Demand removed support from set-top box media players, including Vudu, WDTV, and Roku. Supported devices now only included computers, Blu-ray players, select television sets, and cellular phones.

On February 26, 2013, Roku, Inc. announced that Blockbuster On Demand was being launched on Roku&#x27;s channel store. Supported devices now included computers, Blu-ray players, select television sets, cellular phones, and the Roku set-top box.

In November 2013, Dish Network said its DVD-by-mail service would shut down by mid-December.

==Advertising==
===Super Bowl===
One of Blockbuster&#x27;s most well-known advertising campaigns was launched in 2002 during Super Bowl XXXVI. It starred the voices of James Woods and Jim Belushi as Carl and Ray, a rabbit and a guinea pig in a pet shop located across the road from a Blockbuster store. The first campaign ended in 2003. The Carl and Ray campaign started again in 2007 starting with a commercial in the first quarter of Super Bowl XLI.

===Misleading advertising===
In 2005, Blockbuster launched a marketing campaign describing changes in its late fees policy and offering &quot;No Late Fees&quot; on rentals. The program sparked investigations and charges of misrepresentation in 48 states and the District of Columbia: state attorneys general including Bill Lockyer of California, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Eliot Spitzer of New York argued that customers were being automatically charged the full purchase price of late rentals and a restocking fee for rentals returned after 30 days. In a settlement, Blockbuster agreed to reimburse the states the cost of their investigation, clarify communication to customers on the terms of the program, and offer reimbursement to customers charged fees prior to the clarification. New Jersey filed a separate lawsuit and was not a party to the settlement.

The 2005 controversy came after a related lawsuit settled in 2002 in Texas. That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; an attorney for the plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on a similar case in Michigan).

Such corrections were also sent to international stores such as those in Canada to prevent further lawsuits.

Blockbuster reintroduced late fees in the United States in 2010 under the name of &quot;Additional Daily Rates&quot;. With this pricing scheme, rentals were once again limited to a certain number of days and accrued pay-per-day rates after the days allocated are exceeded.

<doc id="292807" wikidata="Q1886954" url="?curid=292807" title="Malcolm Alexander MacLean">
<text>Malcolm Alexander MacLean (August 14, 1844 – April 4, 1895) was the first mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, serving from 1886 to 1887.

==Early life==
MacLean was born in 1844 to Allan and Jane McPhadden married 8 Mar 1820 [GROS Data OPR 551/1 -2] in Cornaigbeg Tiree, Scotland. Around 1848, the family relocated to Victoria County in Ops Township, Upper Canada, where MacLean was educated and later became a teacher. As he taught over three years, MacLean saved money with the goal of becoming a doctor; instead, after his brother&#x27;s lumber company failed, his money ended up paying off business debts. MacLean then attended Eastman&#x27;s National Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and after graduating worked in New York City for Cunard Steamship Company.

In the 1860s, MacLean returned to Canada, opening a general store in Oshawa, Ontario. He married Margaret Anne Cattanach on 5 January 1869, and the couple soon moved to Dundas, where MacLean ran another general store. His marriage into the Cattanach family quickly expanded MacLean&#x27;s horizons; after his sister-in-law, Jessie and her husband Arthur Ross relocated to Winnipeg, MacLean followed suit in 1878.

There in Winnipeg, MacLean first began working as a commission-merchant, then soon joined Ross in the real estate business, amassing a fortune after the 1881–82 real estate boom. Unfortunately, a depression soon followed, causing MacLean to quit his business and move his family further west to a farm in the Qu&#x27;Appelle valley.

It is possible that MacLean served in the North-West Rebellion in 1885.

Later the same year, MacLean travelled to San Francisco. Originally en route to Honolulu with plans to enter Hawaii&#x27;s sugar beet industry, he instead continued to Granville, today known as Vancouver. (Arthur Ross already was familiar with Granville, having recommended the town to serve as the western end of the Canadian Pacific Railway.) MacLean arrived in Granville at the start of 1886; within a month, MacLean found himself with a job running Ross&#x27; real estate office while Ross was away in Ottawa serving as an MP for Lisgar, and within half a year MacLean was operating his own real estate firm.

==Politics==
In addition to his real estate business, MacLean began to pursue politics almost immediately after arriving in Granville. In February 1886, he worked to petition the provincial legislature to incorporate and rename the town, and as a result, on April 6, the city of Vancouver was formed.

===Mayoralty===
A mayoral election for the newly formed city was held on 3 May 1886. The race was extremely close: MacLean&#x27;s opponent, Richard H. Alexander, was favored to win due to his support from the long-established elite, as Alexander had arrived in British Columbia during the colonial days. MacLean, though, pulled support largely from three groups: other newly arrived Manitobans and Ontarians (whom Alexander had dismissed as &quot;North American Chinamen&quot;); workers at Hastings sawmill involved in a labour dispute against Alexander, the mill&#x27;s owner, who had pledged to hire Chinese workers to replace striking white workers; and the Knights of Labor, also driven by anti-Chinese sentiment. MacLean won the election with 242 votes against Alexander&#x27;s 225—a difference of just seventeen votes—and on 25 May, MacLean was made Justice of the Peace.

Days later, supporters of Alexander (including later mayor David Oppenheimer) officially petitioned Victoria, claiming that at least 100 ballots had been cast illegally; fifty years later, backers of MacLean confirmed in interviews that many had voted illegally, including &quot;houseboat tenants&quot; and &quot;itinerant hotel guests.&quot;

The voting scandal was quickly forgotten in the wake of the Great Vancouver Fire on 13 June 1886. Following the inferno, MacLean and his council members successfully convinced Governor General Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne to give the military reserve in Burrard Inlet to the city, which became Stanley Park. In December 1886, MacLean was re-elected mayor, having run on a platform to extend the franchise and to restrict the property rights of the city&#x27;s ethnic Chinese residents.

MacLean was greatly focused on the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, calling it &quot;the placing of the keystone in the arch of confederation;&quot; after three months of unofficial use, the first official train arrived in Vancouver on 23 May 1887. Later that year, the Vancouver Board of Trade was formed, and MacLean presided over its inaugural meeting. By 1888, MacLean claimed credit for improvements around Vancouver such as the clearing and grading of streets and the construction of vital infrastructure.

==Post-mayoralty==
After his service as mayor, MacLean was appointed police magistrate of the city and continued in that position until 1890. In 1893, he was appointed a special commissioner of immigration in the United States by the Canadian government; while abroad he presented lectures on the opportunities presented in western Canada. In 1895, he was appointed stipendary magistrate for the district of Vancouver.

==Personal life==
Due to his early white hair and personality, MacLean was sometimes known as &quot;Squire MacLean.&quot; He was fluent in Scottish Gaelic and organised the St Andrew&#x27;s and Caledonian Society of Vancouver in 1886. He was an avid promoter of British Columbia and Canada, penning articles praising them for the &quot;Scottish American&quot; and British periodicals.

==Death==
MacLean died in 1895 at the age of 50. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver, where several other past mayors are also at rest.

<text>David Oppenheimer (January 1, 1834 – December 31, 1897) was a Canadian businessman, investor, philanthropist, politician, and writer. He was the second mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, and a National Historic Person of Canada.

==Early life==
Oppenheimer was born in Blieskastel, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria, as one of ten children. His father, Salomon, was a merchant and vintner. David&#x27;s mother, Johanna (Johanette) Kahn, died when he was four years old. His family was Jewish. He was educated at the Collegiate School of Frankfurt am Main.

In 1848, after political upheaval and bad harvests, David Oppenheimer immigrated to New Orleans with his sister Caroline Oppenheimer Stern and four brothers: Charles (Carl), Meyer, Isaac and Godfrey (Gottfried). He studied bookkeeping and worked in a general store. Upon hearing of the California Gold Rush, the Oppenheimers became traders in Placer County, California, in 1851 and later Sacramento, California. David then worked in real estate and the restaurant business in Columbia, California. Here he married his first wife, Sarah (Christine), in 1857.

Following the decline of the California rush, the Oppenheimer brothers relocated to Victoria, British Columbia, in the late 1858 to establish the Charles Oppenheimer and Company supply business. As the Fraser River and Cariboo Gold rushes took off in 1858–61 the Oppenheimers established stores catering to the prospectors and settlers in the Interior of the Colony of British Columbia at Yale, Hope, and Lytton in the Fraser Canyon, Barkerville in the Cariboo, and Fisherville at the Wild Horse Creek goldfield in the East Kootenay. They would later invest in real estate in Lytton and the Cariboo. With such a far-flung business, the Oppenheimers soon realized the importance of improving transportation and joined a group which successfully lobbied the colonial government in 1862 to build the Cariboo Road to Barkerville.

Despite business setbacks in 1866 and 1867, David was running the Oppenheimer Brothers warehouse in Yale by 1868 and was a partner in the firm by 1871. The wholesale provisioners company he started with his brothers in 1858 exists to this day as The Oppenheimer Group. David Oppenheimer was active in the Yale business community and entertained visiting dignitaries such as Governor-General Lord Dufferin. After over twenty years of marriage, with no children, David&#x27;s wife Sarah died on October 15, 1880, and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery on Cedar Hill Road in Victoria, British Columbia. Fire destroyed much of Yale in 1881, including the Oppenheimers&#x27; store. Since the gold rush had declined and railway construction had moved on, David moved back to Victoria, British Columbia, and opened an import wholesale business with his brother Isaac in 1882. The following year David married his second wife, Julia Walters of New York, in San Francisco. Their daughter, Flora Jeanetta, was born in 1884 in Victoria.

==Vancouver businessman==

David did extensive business with the Canadian Pacific Railway during its construction through the mountains of British Columbia in the 1880s, such as participating in a syndicate with Andrew Onderdonk to construct sections near Yale. Realizing the railway&#x27;s importance, the Oppenheimer Brothers firm had joined the Vancouver Land and Improvement Company in 1878 to purchase land near its western terminus. David and Isaac Oppenheimer moved to Granville (now Vancouver) in 1885. They were both acclaimed as aldermen of city council in December 1886, and David became chairman of the city Finance Committee. In 1887, Oppenheimer Brothers opened the first wholesale grocery business in the fledgling city, which still exists as The Oppenheimer Group. After the Great Vancouver Fire, David helped found the Vancouver Board of Trade and was its first Chairman from 1887 to 1888.

==Mayor==
In 1888, David Oppenheimer was acclaimed the second Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, serving until 1891. During his four one-year terms as mayor, many city services were established: the fire department, a ferry across Burrard Inlet, the streetcar system and a water connection from the Capilano River. David advocated city control of utilities and financed these projects by selling city bonds in London. He also lobbied for more parkland, playgrounds, completion of a city hospital and a Jewish section in the city&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery. Stanley Park was opened in 1888 while David Oppenheimer was Vancouver&#x27;s mayor. David focused on transportation improvement again by helping to establish the British Columbia Electric Railway plus encouraging steamboat links to Australia and the northern British Columbia Coast. He promoted the British Columbia mining industry by publishing a pamphlet in England and the United States, as well as sending product samples to eastern Canada. David also attracted investment from Europe and industries such as the B.C.Sugar Refinery and the Vancouver City Foundry. David did not collect a salary for mayoral duties and entertained official guests at his own expense. However, opponents like William Templeton criticized the overlap between his business and civic ventures.

As a philanthropist, David Oppenheimer donated land to the city for parks and helped found charities such as the Alexandra Orphanage and the Vancouver branch of the YMCA. After fire destroyed Barkerville in 1868, Oppenheimer donated a fire engine to the local fire brigade. The Oppenheimer family also offered land to the Vancouver Jewish community for a synagogue, the Congregation B&#x27;nai Yehuda, which was located at Pender and Heatley Streets in the Strathcona neighbourhood, then the focus of the city&#x27;s Jewish community (soon after renamed Congregation Schara Tzedeck and since relocated to Oak Street).

After four mayoral terms, David Oppenheimer decided not to run again because of poor health in 1891. He died on December 31, 1897, of heart failure at the age of 63 (just one day before his 64th birthday). David was buried next to his second wife, Julia, in the Salem Fields Cemetery of Brooklyn, New York.

Though his material wealth had declined in the Long Depression, Oppenheimer was rich in recognition of his civic contributions. Even the Vancouver &quot;Daily News-Advertiser&quot; (today&#x27;s &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;), which had been critical of his political career, praised David Oppenheimer as &quot;the best friend Vancouver ever had.&quot;

==Legacy==
His monument at the entrance of Stanley Park, in Vancouver, was built with public donations and dedicated on December 14, 1911. After nomination by the Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada approved the designation of David Oppenheimer as a National Historic Person on April 11, 2008.

On July 12, 2008, Vancouver&#x27;s Mayor Sam Sullivan proclaimed &quot;David Oppenheimer Day&quot; in the city of Vancouver, to honour this innovative founding father who built much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure. At a ceremony in Stanley Park, Mayor Oppenheimer&#x27;s life was remembered during speeches by city officials, local historians, members of his family, and John Anderson, CEO of The Oppenheimer Group.

<text>Frederick Cope (August 27, 1849 – September 19, 1897) was the third Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, serving from 1892 to 1893.

Cope was born in Simcoe, Canada West in 1849. He was the second son of Frederick Manuel Cope &amp; Eliza Catherine Myers. He was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business.

Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city&#x27;s history, winning with an 11-vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 42 at the time of his election. During the election, he garnered support of the city&#x27;s business class, and the &quot;Vancouver World&quot; newspaper. His council however would consist of &quot;reformers&quot; of the working class, in opposition to Cope&#x27;s representation of the business class. During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks. He also advocated for the Canada-Australia Steam Line, with the inaugural ship arriving in June 1893.

Cope was a Freemason. He drowned during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897 in Shallow Lake, Yukon, when his horse fell while crossing the body of water. He tried unsuccessfully to rescue the horse and was pulled away by the undercurrents. His body was later transported back to Vancouver, and after sorting out a mixup of the remains, was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.

<text>Maraschino ( , ) is a liqueur obtained from the distillation of Marasca cherries. The small, slightly sour fruit of the Marasca cherry tree (&quot;Prunus cerasus&quot; var. &quot;marasca&quot;), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, lends the liqueur its unique aroma.

== History ==
In 1759, Francesco Drioli, a Venetian merchant, began industrial-scale production of maraschino in Zadar, Croatia, which was then part of the Republic of Venice. Drioli demonstrated the same brand of Venetian entrepreneurial spirit as other businessmen in the Veneto region who transformed grappa-distillation from household tradition into formal industry: in either case, the businesses strictly conformed to the rules and restrictions set down by the regional Distillers&#x27; Guild ().

Francesco Drioli developed and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga&#x27;s earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of Marasca cherries and in 1759 he founded the Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory). By the end of the 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed &quot;the nobility and gentry&quot; of having &quot;just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour&quot; and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corfù and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. In fact in 1877 the Duke of York (the future George V) and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the factory and accepted &quot;with great pleasure a choice buffet&quot; in the Salghetti-Drioli family home and purchased &quot;more cases of rosolio and several jars of maraschino cherries&quot; (, a. XXII, no.77, 28 September 1877). From the outset, however, Drioli Maraschino was subject to counterfeiting, a scourge which would plague the factory even after it closed in 1980, forcing its owners to take repeated legal action. In his Via Facti, Nicolò Tommaseo noted how widespread Drioli Maraschino was (in Italy... and in all five parts of the world) and he wrote, &quot;...&quot; (it is drunk everywhere and faked/copied everywhere).

The square greenish bottles were supplied by Murano glass factories and in the early 19th century the straw cover (known as a &quot;fiasco&quot;) was introduced. This was a typical Venetian method for transporting bottles on long sea voyages and would come to define the brand over the years. Following the restoration of Italian sovereignty in the Veneto, Giuseppe&#x27;s son Francesco Salghetti-Drioli was instrumental in founding a glass factory in Zadar, bringing skilled workers from Murano and becoming its first president.

As the reputation of Maraschino grew, so did the name of Zadar, which prompted other factories to emerge and become established, particularly those of Girolamo Luxardo (1821) and Romano Vlahov (1861). Together they formed (the maraschino industry of Zadar) of which the acknowledged founder is Francesco Drioli.

The Second World War, the persecution of the Tito partisans against the Italian community (some of the Luxardo family, including Pietro and Nicolò Luxardo, were killed by partisans), the bombing of Zadar and its transition to Yugoslav sovereignty, marked the end of an era. In the immediate post-war period the owners of the three most important distilleries, Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, Giorgio Luxardo and Romano Vlahov, sought refuge in Italy and rebuilt their businesses in Mira, near Venice, Torreglia near Padua and Bologna respectively. By 1946 Vittorio had already resumed production and soon recaptured the company&#x27;s traditional markets worldwide, in particular the English and English-speaking areas. He expertly reconciled his factory&#x27;s long-standing and prestigious tradition with the demands for modernisation which such a radically altered post-war period called for. The death of Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, sixth and last heir of the Dalmatian branch of the historic founding family of the maraschino industry of Zadar, not only saw the extinction of this branch of the family, but also the end of the 200-year history of the Francesco Drioli factory, the oldest Italian liqueur company. After his death in 1974, his heirs set up Distillerie Venete Mira Spa (DI. VE. MI) with the Società Finanziaria Europea. The company was transferred to this new group while ownership of the factory, the brands, and the recipes was retained, and the use of the latter was authorised. In 1980 the Board of Directors decided to cease production and the company went into liquidation.

The valuable Salghetti-Drioli archive, which dates from the second half of the 18th century up to 1943, stands as testimony to the history of the maraschino of Zadar. The section preserved by the family in Vicenza was designated of &quot;great historical interest&quot; by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage in 1991, and has been catalogued by Prof. Georgetta Bonfiglio-Dosio. The section remaining in Zadar, which was confiscated after the war and the transition of Zadar to Yugoslavia, is preserved in the State Archives in Zadar (Drzavni Arhiv u Zadru) in the Tvornica F. Drioli Fund, and has been catalogued by the archivist Marijan Maroja. The archive as a whole not only documents the history of the factory, its development over seven generations of entrepreneurs and their considerable contribution to the history of Zadar, but lends an insight into historical events that shook the area around the Adriatic. The archive provides an unprecedented resource for historians and archivists from the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797 up until the transition of Zadar to Yugoslav sovereignty in 1947, covering the various periods of Austrian, French and Italian domination.
The maraschino industry had played a major role in the history of the city of Zadar and in the aftermath of the war, production activities were resumed. Assets which had been confiscated from the historic factories, including all usable equipment, were unified into a single enterprise which eventually gave rise to a new factory called Maraska, located in the former Luxardo premises, and now operating as &quot;Maraska Company Zadar&quot;. This company has continued the traditional business, widening its range of liqueurs and syrups to become the most important liqueur producer in
Croatia.

==Cocktails containing maraschino liqueur==
Maraschino is a very special and notable ingredient in cocktails. Many recipes before prohibition called for Maraschino; it was one of the most used and most important ingredients. In the past few years, the growth of the craft cocktail movement has helped Maraschino regain its former status.

<text>William Templeton (March 27, 1853 – January 16, 1898) was the sixth Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, serving only one term in 1897.

A butcher and grocer, he operated a grocery store in the first brick building in Vancouver. Templeton also was a member of the Vancouver City Council and school board and had once run unsuccessfully for the mayor&#x27;s seat before being elected in 1897. He was defeated in the next election in January 1898 and died shortly after. He is commemorated with a street and school named in his honour.

==Early life and business==
Templeton was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1853. He came to Vancouver in January 1886, when the settlement was named Granville. Later that year, he entered the grocery business, building a store on the corner of Hastings and Carrall Streets. After the building was destroyed in a fire, also the same year, Templeton and his partner Joseph Northcott commissioned a new brick building to be built on the corner lot that they had just purchased for $1800. It would be the first brick building in the city&#x27;s history. He was also involved in railroad affairs, a member of a Canadian Pacific Railway group that benefitted from a land grant from the city in order to make it the terminus of the railway. On the occasion of the announcement in 1884, he ordered of turkeys to be shipped to Vancouver from Ontario to celebrate. In 1896, Templeton chartered the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway.

==Local government==
In 1891, Templeton was elected to the Vancouver City Council as an alderman. He also served on the School Board as a trustee from 1892 to 1897. In 1890, Templeton ran unsuccessfully for the mayoralty of Vancouver, losing to David Oppenheimer. During the time leading up to the election, Templeton accused Oppenheimer of devoting &quot;too much time [to] building castles in the sky&quot; and not enough time to his official duties and to law enforcement. It was also said that Templeton was running to serve the &quot;working and middle class&quot;, himself being a member of the working class, with Oppenheimer a higher class businessman. He is also said to have mocked Oppenheimer&#x27;s German accent and to have lost supporters as a result. Templeton lost the election to Oppenheimer by 434 to 585 votes. This particular election has been said to have changed the politics of the city, initiating a divide in ideology and interests between the upper-class and middle-class citizens of the city.

He ran once again for mayor in 1897 and this time won by a majority of 319 votes, and served for the year. When in office, he advocated for a smelter to be built in the city, for the extension of voting hours to suit the workers, and for the removal of a requirement that civic election candidates own property in the city. Templeton was also noted for an aggressive personality. He was defeated for re-election by James Garden in the next election on January 13, 1898, by 1260 to 950 votes. The prominent issue of the election was the granting of licenses to music halls in the city, which Templeton opposed and Garden supported.

==Death and legacy==
Templeton died suddenly during the afternoon of Sunday, January 16, 1898, three days after his defeat, at his home in Vancouver. He left a wife and children. At the time of his death, he was in the butchery business, as a pork packer. The cause of Templeton&#x27;s death is unclear: some sources state that he committed suicide due to the distress of his defeat by overdosing on sleep medication, while newspaper reports at the time stated that he died from heart disease, a cerebral hemorrhage or apoplexy. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. A newspaper at the time reported:

The Templeton Building still stands today, at 1 East Hastings Street. Templeton Street and Templeton Secondary School in Vancouver are both also named after him.
