<text>Marblehead is a coastal New England town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, along the North Shore. Its population was 20,441 at the 2020 census. The town lies on a small peninsula that extends into the northern part of Massachusetts Bay. Attached to the town is a near island, known as Marblehead Neck, connected to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. Marblehead Harbor, protected by shallow shoals and rocks from the open sea, lies between the mainland and the Neck. Beside the Marblehead town center, two other villages lie within the town: the Old Town, which was the original town center, and Clifton, which lies along the border with the neighboring town of Swampscott.

A town with roots in commercial fishing and yachting, Marblehead was a major shipyard and is often referred to as the birthplace of the American Navy, a title sometimes disputed with nearby Beverly. Marblehead was once the fishing capital of Massachusetts. It is also the origin of Marine Corps Aviation. Three US Navy ships have been named USS &quot;Marblehead&quot;. A center of recreational boating, Marblehead has long been a popular sailing, kayaking and fishing destination, with several yacht clubs established in the late 19th century.

It is home to the Marblehead Light, Fort Sewall, Little Harbor, Mass Audubon&#x27;s Marblehead Neck Wildlife Sanctuary, Crocker Park, and Devereux Beach. Archibald Willard&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; currently resides in Abbot Hall. Much of the Old Town is protected by the Marblehead Historic District.

Marblehead is also home of the Marblehead Men&#x27;s Softball League, which was established in 1939 and is the oldest and longest standing adult softball league in the world.

== History ==

=== Massebequash ===
Marblehead was originally called &quot;Massebequash&quot; after the river which ran between it and Salem. The land was inhabited by the Naumkeag tribe of the Pawtucket confederation under the overall sachem Nanepashemet. Epidemics in 1615–1619 and 1633, believed to be smallpox, devastated the tribe. Numerous shell mounds and burial sites have been found throughout the town&#x27;s history, along with foundations of multiple villages and forts. On September 16, 1684, heirs of Nanepashemet sold their ; the deed is preserved today at Abbot Hall in the town.

=== European settlers and fishing ===
Marblehead&#x27;s first European settler was Joseph Doliber or John Peach (highly disputed) in 1629, who set up on the shore near what is now the end of Bradlee Road. Three years earlier, Isaac Allerton, a Pilgrim from the &quot;Mayflower,&quot; had arrived in the area and established a fishing village at Marblehead Little Harbor. In May 1635, the General Court of Massachusetts Bay established the town of Marblehead on land that belonged to Salem. Marblehead residents, who never saw eye-to-eye with their more devout and conservative neighbors, were delighted, but less than a year later, the lawmakers reversed themselves. Marblehead finally became independent of Salem in 1649.At times called &quot;Marvell Head&quot;, &quot;Marble Harbour&quot; (by Captain John Smith) and &quot;Foy&quot; (by immigrants from Fowey, Cornwall), the town would be named &quot;Marblehead&quot; by settlers who mistook its granite ledges for marble. It began as a fishing village with narrow crooked streets, and developed inland from the harbor. The shoreline smelled of drying fish, typically cod. These were exported abroad and to Salem.

The town had one accused individual during the Salem Witch Trials, Wilmot Redd. She was found guilty of witchcraft and executed by hanging on September 22, 1692.

The town peaked economically just before the American Revolution, as locally financed privateering vessels sought bounty from large European ships. Much early architecture survives from the era, including the Jeremiah Lee Mansion.

=== Revolutionary War ===
A large percentage of residents became involved early in the Revolutionary War, and the sailors of Marblehead are generally recognized by scholars as forerunners of the United States Navy. The first vessel commissioned for the army, &quot;Hannah,&quot; was equipped with cannons, rope, provisions (including the indigenous molasses/sea water cookie known as &quot;Joe Frogger&quot; ), and a crew from Marblehead. With their nautical backgrounds, soldiers from Marblehead under General John Glover were instrumental in the escape of the Continental Army after the Battle of Long Island.The Marblehead militia had become the 14th Continental Regiment of George Washington&#x27;s army—and one of the few integrated regiments in the entire army. Marblehead men ferried George Washington across the Delaware River for his attack on Trenton. Many who set out for war, however, did not return, leaving the town with 459 widows and 865 orphaned children in a population of less than 5,000.

The community lost a substantial portion of its population and economy, although it was still the tenth-largest inhabited location in the United States at the first census, in 1790.

When George Washington visited the town during his presidential tour of 1789, he knew the sailors of Marblehead well; they had served him honorably in the war. He observed that the town &quot;had the appearance of antiquity.&quot;

=== Fishing industry ===
In the 75 years from the American Revolution to the middle of the nineteenth century, Marblehead experienced a golden age of fishing. The War of 1812 brought disruption similar to during the American Revolution, with fishing grounds being blockaded, and fisherman heading off to war, with over 500 Marbleheaders being imprisoned by the British. After the war, and later into the 19th century, wealthier citizens wanted a new bank to finance vessels, and to serve the town&#x27;s fishermen and merchants. On March 17, 1831, with a capital of US$100,000, they founded the Grand Bank. The name was changed to National Grand Bank on October 3, 1864.
The town&#x27;s fishermen had 98 vessels (95 of which exceeded 50 tons) putting to sea in 1837, where they often harvested fish off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. However, a gale or hurricane in that area on September 19, 1846, sank 11 vessels and damaged others. With 65 men and boys lost in the storm, the town&#x27;s fishing industry began a decline. The storm is depicted in &quot;Fireboard: The Great Gale of 1846,&quot; c. 1850 by William Thompson Bartoll. A copy of the book is held by the Peabody Essex Museum.

=== American Civil War ===
During the Civil War, 1,048 Marblehead men went to war, joining both the Army and Navy. One hundred ten died; 87 were wounded, many of whom died later of their injuries. During the war, Marblehead would raise almost $100,000 to supplement the war effort, an incredible effort for a town of 8,000 that relied mainly on fishing for income. Marblehead would be the first regiment in the state to answer the call for troops. A Grand Army of the Republic veterans organization was formed after the war, and established headquarters in the old town house, where it still displays artifacts from the Marblehead regiments that served.

=== Shoemaking, airplanes, and yachting ===
During the late 19th century, Marblehead had a short-term industrial boom from shoe-making factories. At the same time, the exceptional harbor attracted yachting by wealthy boat owners, and some yacht clubs established centers there. It would become home to the Boston Yacht Club, Corinthian Yacht Club, Eastern Yacht Club, Marblehead Yacht Club, Dolphin Yacht Club, and the oldest junior yacht club in America, the Pleon Yacht Club. This also caused numerous &quot;summer homes&quot; of wealthy Boston residents to be built on Marblehead Neck. The building boom would cause Marblehead Light to be replaced in 1896 with a new iron structure since the light of shorter tower was becoming blocked by the large new homes.

Marblehead was also the site of the Burgess &amp; Curtis Aircraft Factory, where it was the first licensed aircraft manufacturer in the United States. William Starling Burgess designed and flight-tested most of the aircraft that were manufactured at the two plant sites in town. On August 20, 1912, Alfred Austell Cunningham became the first Marine aviator, taking off from Marblehead Harbor in a Burgess Model H seaplane given to him by the Burgess Company. His flight was the start of United States Marine Corps Aviation.

=== Post-war suburban community ===

After World War II, the town enjoyed a population boom, developing as a bedroom community for nearby Boston, Lynn, and Salem. This boom ended around 1970, when the town became built out. Marblehead today continues to be a sailing and small-town tourism destination in the summer months.

== Town government ==
The Town of Marblehead has an open town meeting, and is led by a Board of Selectmen. A board of seven selectmen first met on Friday, December 22, 1648.

=== Town hall ===

The seat of the first town government used the existing Meeting House on what is now the site of Old Burial Hill. The meeting house served as a place for the town to meet and the main church in town; a dual use that was typical during this time period. The second meeting house was built around 1696 on Franklin Street, which would become known as the &quot;Old Meeting House&quot;, also serving the dual use of a town meeting location and church. In 1726, it was decided by the town to construct a separate Town House, which was completed in 1727 (Old Town House). However, the Old Meeting House would continue to occasionally be used for large town meetings, before it was demolished around 1825 after the new First Congregational Church was built (Old North Church). The Town House would serve as the town hall until the construction of Abbot Hall in 1876, where the town clerk and board of selectmen still meet today.

==Geography and transportation==
Marblehead is comprised by a total of of land and , or 77.61%, of water.

Marblehead is situated on the North Shore of Massachusetts along Massachusetts Bay and Salem Harbor. The town consists of a rocky peninsula that extends into the bay, with an additional neck to the east connected by a long sandbar, now a causeway. This ring of land defines Marblehead&#x27;s deep, sheltered harbor. Marblehead Neck is home to a bird sanctuary, as well as Castle Rock and Chandler Hovey Park at its northern tip, where Marblehead Light is located.
Fountain Park and Fort Sewall are located at the western edge of the mouth of Marblehead Harbor. The town land also includes several small islands in Massachusetts Bay and Dolliber Cove, the area between Peaches Point and Fort Sewall. The town is partially divided from Salem by the Forest River, and is also home to several small ponds. In keeping with the town&#x27;s location, there are four beaches (one in Dolliber Cove, one in Marblehead Harbor, and two along the southern shore of town), as well as six yacht clubs, one public kayaking center and several boat ramps.

Besides Marblehead Neck, there are two other villages within town, the Old Town to the northeast and Clifton to the southwest. Given its small area, most of the residential land in town is densely settled. Marblehead&#x27;s town center is located approximately from the center of Salem, northeast of Boston and southwest of Cape Ann. It is bordered by Swampscott to the south and Salem to the northwest. (As Salem&#x27;s water rights extend into Massachusetts Bay, there is no connection between Marblehead and the city of Beverly across Beverly Harbor.)

Marblehead is home to the eastern termini of Massachusetts Route 114 and Route 129, which both terminate at the intersection of Pleasant Street and Ocean Avenue. Route 114 heads west into Salem, while Route 129 heads south along Atlantic Avenue into Swampscott towards Lynn. There are no freeways within town, with the nearest access being to Massachusetts Route 128 in Peabody and Beverly.

Two MBTA bus routes—the and —originate in town regularly with service to Boston, with weekend service to Wonderland station in Revere. The former Eastern Railroad began service in 1839 and had lines connecting through Swampscott and Salem was discontinued in the late 1950s. The track routes were converted to bike trails and the three train depots were torn down. The Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail passes through neighboring Swampscott and Salem, with service between the North Shore and Boston&#x27;s North Station. The nearest air service is located at Beverly Municipal Airport, with the nearest national and international service at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport. Seasonal ferry service to Boston can also be found in Salem.

==== Literature influenced by Marblehead ====

*&quot;Rabbi Small&quot;, by Harry Kemelman, takes place in the fictional town of Barnard&#x27;s Crossing, a place based on Marblehead. Kemelman lived in Marblehead for 50 years.
* The Jesse Stone novels: Robert B. Parker supposedly based the fictional town of Paradise, in which the novels take place, on Marblehead. Both Paradise and Marblehead are on the coast in Essex County, Cape Ann is visible from them, and each has an annual Race Week yachting event.
* Kingsport – Horror and fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft derived great inspiration from Marblehead. Following his first visit in December 1922, he retroactively reconfigured his fictional Kingsport in its own image. As of 1920, Kingsport was an unspecified location on Rhode Island, only mentioned in passing. Lovecraft likely based the name on that of Kingstown, R.I. Lovecraft regarded his experience of visiting Marblehead in 1922, however, as life-changing. Thereafter, he based his Kingsport on Marblehead.

<doc id="275293" wikidata="Q639796" url="?curid=275293" title="Baron Baltimore">
<text>Baron Baltimore, of Baltimore, County Longford, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1625 and ended in 1771, upon the death of its sixth-generation male heir, aged 40. Holders of the title were usually known as Lord Baltimore for short.

==History==
The title was granted in 1625 to Sir George Calvert (1580–1632), and it became extinct in 1771 on the death of Frederick, 6th Baron Baltimore. The title was held by six members/generations of the Calvert family, who were Lord proprietors of the palatinates Province of Avalon in Newfoundland and Maryland Palatinate (later the Province of Maryland and subsequent American State of Maryland).

A reference to &quot;Lord Baltimore&quot; is to any one of the six barons and most frequently in U.S. history to Cecil, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1600–1675, ruled 1632–1675), after whom the port city of Baltimore, Maryland (1729/1797) and surrounding Baltimore County (1659) were named, which took place in his lifetime due to his family&#x27;s holdings. His father Sir George had supported English colonization of the North American territories, and his younger brother, Leonard Calvert (1606–1647, ruled 1634–1647), traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to become the first colonial Governor of Maryland.

==Barons Baltimore (1625–1771)==
* Sir George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632)
* Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675)
* Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore (1637–1715)
* Benedict Leonard Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore (1679–1715)
* Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore (1699–1751)
* Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771)

==Political power==
As holders of an Irish peerage, the Lords Baltimore had a seat, if they wished to take it up, in the medieval-founded Irish House of Lords (upper chamber of the Parliament of Ireland in , which was abolished in 1801 when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922) came into being with the merger / takeover between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British-dominated former Kingdom of Ireland. Irish peerages (titles of nobility) were usually awarded to major landowners likely to support the status quo of British / Protestant domination in Ireland, others involved in the various economic, social, and military campaigns in Ireland, such as the Plantations of Ireland, and finally also as a way of giving people in Great Britain the honour of a peerage which did not also grant a seat in the English, (later British), House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament in London, thereby excluding them from sitting in the more powerful lower chamber of the House of Commons at Westminster. Irish peers ranged between people owning little or no property in Ireland to those having their main homes and large estates there.

==Family seats and abodes==

In the British Isles, the family&#x27;s main home was a landscaped mansion and estate (&quot;park&quot;) in the Home Counties. In 1705, the 4th Baron sold to the Crown a house and gardens (owned by virtue of his wife) known as Woodstock Park, which was promptly demolished and replaced by Blenheim Palace, a site regally granted to the victorious Duke of Marlborough as a gift. It swiftly became the only private mansion termed a palace in England; however, this loss was partially recouped when the 4th Baron inherited an additional manor house and farm in Epsom, Surrey, on the death of his distant cousin Lady Ann(s) Lewknor (née Mynne), his father having already owned, since 1692, from the death of Elizabeth Evelyn (née Mynne), a mid-17th century-built neighbouring fine house known as Woodcote Park. Its ownership in the family passed down to the heirs of the 6th Baron. His latter-day home in London itself was on Russell Square:


==Other notable Calverts==
The Lords Baltimore had notable early siblings and descendants:

* Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), the first Governor of the Province of Maryland. He was the second/younger son of The 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632), to which the colony and province of Maryland were originally granted by King Charles I of England in 1632, and with the first Baron&#x27;s eldest son and heir Cecilius, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), to which the Maryland grant was extended, and who continued and planned to send the first group of settlers supervised by younger brother Leonard, on the ships &quot;The Ark&quot; and &quot;The Dove&quot; across the North Atlantic Ocean in late 1633 and early 1634.
* Phillip Calvert (1626–1682), proprietary/colonial fifth Governor of Maryland from 1660 to 1682. He was appointed by the royally chartered proprietor of the Province of Maryland, The 3rd Baron Baltimore, as a caretaker to replace insurgent leader Josias Fendall (1628–1687), who had assumed the governorship.
* Charles Calvert (1680–1734), provincial/colonial fourteenth (14th) Governor of Maryland in 1720, at a time when the Calvert family had recently regained control of their proprietary colony. He was appointed Governor by his cousin, The 5th Baron Baltimore.
* Benedict Leonard Calvert (1700–1732), the proprietary/colonial fifteenth (15th) Governor of Maryland from 1727 through 1731, appointed by his brother, The 5th Baron Baltimore.
* Benedict Swingate Calvert (c. 1730–1788), the illegitimate son of The 5th Baron Baltimore, (the third Proprietor/Colonial Governor of Maryland). He was a Loyalist and Judge of the Land Office prior to the American Revolution (1775–1783).
* Eleanor Calvert (1758–1811), daughter-in-law of Martha Dandridge Washington and the stepdaughter-in-law of the General of the Continental Army and first President of the United States, George Washington (1732–1799).
* Henry Harford (1758–1834), 5th and last Proprietor of Maryland (1771–1776). He was the illegitimate son of The 6th Baron Baltimore, the last holder of the family peerage. Harford County, Maryland, split off and formed to the northeast from part of Baltimore County in 1774, is named for him.
* Rosalie Stier Calvert (1778–1821), Riversdale plantation owner with her husband George.
* George Henry Calvert (1803–1889), essayist, dramatist, poet, and biographer.
* Charles Benedict Calvert (1808–1864), U.S. Representative from Maryland&#x27;s 6th congressional district, serving one term from 1861 to 1863, and the founder of the Maryland Agricultural College in 1856 (now the University of Maryland at College Park).

==Legacy==

There are many locations in Maryland named after the Barons Baltimore (&quot;Lords Baltimore&quot;), including Baltimore County, Baltimore City, Calvert County, Cecil County, Charles County, Frederick County, Leonardtown, St. Leonard, and Calvert Cliffs. There are also Charles Street and Calvert Street in Baltimore.

Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore is the namesake of Cecil County, Maryland, Cecil Avenue, Cecil Elementary School and Calvert Street in Baltimore, along with another Calvert Street (alley) in Brooklyn (a South Baltimore city neighbourhood bordering suburban Anne Arundel County) and Calvert Street in Washington, D.C. His wife, Anne Arundell, is the namesake of Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Harford County is named for Henry Harford (1758/1760–1835), the illegitimate son of Frederick, 6th and last Baron Baltimore (1731–1771). Leonardtown, Maryland, now county seat of St. Mary&#x27;s, is named for the younger brother of the Cecil, 2nd Lord Baltimore, the 28-year-old Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), who arrived in the Colonial settling expedition of 1634 and set up the provincial government in the new capital of St. Mary&#x27;s City.

The main downtown street in Cumberland, Maryland, is named Baltimore Street, along with Baltimore Avenue, the main north–south highway of commercial business along the Atlantic coast to the resort town of Ocean City. The Baltimore Road, which runs through the town of Bladensburg was made famous due to its role in the Battle of Bladensburg and the subsequent &quot;Burning of Washington&quot; during the War of 1812.

On the Avalon Peninsula in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador of the northeastern Dominion of Canada, there is a settlement named Calvert, and in nearby Ferryland there is a &quot;Baltimore School&quot;. There are also several other towns and villages across North America in the several states with the name of &quot;Baltimore&quot;, &quot;New Baltimore&quot; or &quot;Old Baltimore&quot;.

A life-sized bronze statue on a granite pedestal of Cecil, 2nd Lord Baltimore (1605–1675), is located on the steps of the western end at the St. Paul Street entrance of the Baltimore City Circuit Court House, the third courts structure on the nearby colonial-era Courthouse Square site (located to the east along North Calvert Street), constructed 1896–1900 (now renamed the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse since 1985 for a noted local and Civil Rights Movement leader, Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. [1911–1984], known as &quot;The 101st Senator&quot;) in Baltimore, Maryland. The statue of Cecil, Lord Baltimore, sponsored by the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Maryland, was dedicated November 21, 1908, and now faces a fountain and tree-shaded small plaza/park across the street, developed/laid out in 1964, between East Fayette and East Lexington Streets.

Before the American Revolution, a common flag used by military units of the colonial militia of the Province of Maryland was known as the Calvert Arms Flag. This flag had the original Union Jack from the Acts of Union 1707 as a canton in the upper corner, with a St. George&#x27;s Cross and a St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross to represent the patron saint of England and Scotland, respectively.

This Union Jack canton is in the upper corner of the banner over the black and gold (yellow) chevrons depicted on the Calvert family&#x27;s shield and coats-of-arms. Today, this historical colonial/provincial flag is often displayed throughout the state, especially at historical, heritage and festival events such as for the French and Indian War era, (1754–1763) at colonial Fort Frederick in Washington County in the mountainous western panhandle of the state.

The modern flag of the State of Maryland still bears the Calvert-Crossland family / Lord Baltimore coats-of-arms and shield, and has been used since the 1880s with the four quarters reunited after the tragic splits in the border states of the American Civil War, with the Northern Union Army regiments using the black and gold chevrons and the Southern Confederate States Army units using the red/white trefoil cross botonee.

<text>Polish people, or Poles, are a West Slavic ethnic group and nation who share a common history, culture, the Polish language and are identified with the country of Poland in Central Europe. The preamble to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland defines the Polish nation as comprising all the citizens of Poland, regardless of heritage or ethnicity. The majority of Poles adhere to Roman Catholicism.

The population of self-declared Poles in Poland is estimated at 37,394,000 out of an overall population of 38,512,000 (based on the 2011 census), of whom 36,522,000 declared Polish alone. A wide-ranging Polish diaspora (the &quot;Polonia&quot;) exists throughout Eurasia, the Americas, and Australasia. Today, the largest urban concentrations of Poles are within the Warsaw metropolitan area and the Katowice urban area.

Ethnic Poles are considered to be the descendants of the ancient West Slavic Lechites and other tribes that inhabited the Polish territories during the late antiquity period. Poland&#x27;s recorded history dates back over a thousand years to 930–960 AD, when the Western Polans – an influential tribe in the Greater Poland region – united various Lechitic clans under what became the Piast dynasty, thus creating the first Polish state. The subsequent Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church, in 966 CE, marked Poland&#x27;s advent to the community of Western Christendom. However, throughout its existence, the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles, such as Polish Jews.

== Exonyms ==
The Polish endonym &quot;Polacy&quot; is derived from the Western Polans, a Lechitic tribe which inhabited lands around the River Warta in Greater Poland region from the mid-6th century onward. The tribe&#x27;s name stems from the Proto-Indo European &quot;*pleh₂-&quot;, which means flat or flatland and corresponds to the topography of a region that the Western Polans initially settled. The prefix &quot;pol-&quot; is used in most world languages when referring to Poles (Spanish &quot;polaco&quot;, Italian &quot;polacche&quot;, French &quot;polonais&quot;, German &quot;Pole&quot;).

Among other foreign exonyms for the Polish people are Lithuanian &quot;Lenkai&quot;; Hungarian &quot;Lengyelek&quot;; Turkish &quot;Leh&quot;; &quot;Lehastan&quot;; and (&quot;Lahestān&quot;). These stem from Lechia, the ancient name for Poland, or from the tribal Lendians. Their names are equally derived from the Old Polish term &quot;lęda&quot;, meaning plain or field.

==Ethnogenesis==

Slavs have been in the territory of modern-day Poland for over 1500 years. During the Migration Period, central Europe was becoming increasingly settled by the early Slavs (500–700 AD). They organized into tribal units, of which the larger ones further west were later known as the Polish tribes (Lechites); the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer in the 9th century. In the 9th and 10th centuries the tribes gave rise to developed regions along the upper Vistula (the Vistulans), the Baltic Sea coast and in Greater Poland. The ultimate tribal undertaking (10th century) resulted in a lasting political structure and the creation of a Polish state.

== Language ==

Polish is the native language of most Poles. It is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group and the sole official language in the Republic of Poland. Its written form uses the Polish alphabet, which is the basic Latin alphabet with the addition of six diacritic marks, totalling 32 letters. Bearing relation to Czech and Slovak, it has been profoundly influenced by Latin, German and other languages over the course of history. Poland is linguistically homogeneous – nearly 97% of Poland&#x27;s citizens declare Polish as their mother tongue.

Polish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner throughout most of Poland, though numerous dialects and a vernacular language in certain regions coexist alongside standard Polish. The most common lects in Poland are Silesian, spoken in Upper Silesia, and Kashubian, widely spoken in historic Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia), today in the northwestern part of Poland. Kashubian possesses its own status as a separate language. The Goral people in the mountainous south use their own nonstandard dialect, accenting and different intonation.

The geographical distribution of the Polish language was greatly affected by the border changes and population transfers that followed the Second World War – forced expulsions and resettlement during that period contributed to the country&#x27;s current linguistic homogeneity.

== Culture ==

The culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1,000-year history, and forms an important constituent in the Western civilisation. Strong ties with the Latinate world and the Roman Catholic faith also shaped Poland&#x27;s cultural identity.

Officially, the national and state symbol is the white-tailed eagle (&quot;bielik&quot;) embedded on the Coat of arms of Poland (&quot;godło&quot;). The national colours are white and red, which appropriately appear on the flag of Poland (&quot;flaga&quot;), banners, cockades and memorabilia.

Personal achievement and education plays an important role in Polish society today. In 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment ranked Poland 11th in the world for mathematics, science and reading. Education has been of prime interest to Poland since the early 12th century, particularly for its noble classes. In 1364, King Casimir the Great founded the Kraków Academy, which would become Jagiellonian University, the second-oldest institution of higher learning in Central Europe. People of Polish birth have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics both in Poland and abroad, among them Vitello, Marie Skłodowska–Curie, Rudolf Modrzejewski, Rudolf Weigl, Bronisław Malinowski, Stefan Banach, Stanisław Ulam, Leonid Hurwicz, Benoit Mandelbrot and Alfred Tarski.

Poland&#x27;s folk music, especially the mazurka, krakowiak and polonaise, were popularized by Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere. Latin songs and religious hymns such as Gaude Mater Polonia and Bogurodzica were once chanted in churches and during patriotic festivities, but the tradition has faded.

According to a 2020 study, Poland ranks 12th globally on a list of countries which read the most, and approximately 79% of Poles read the news more than once a day, placing it 2nd behind Sweden. As of 2021, six Poles received the Nobel Prize in Literature. The national epic is &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; (English: Master Thaddeus), written by Adam Mickiewicz. Renowned novelists who gained much recognition abroad include Joseph Conrad (wrote in English; &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Lord Jim&quot;), Stanisław Lem (science-fiction; &quot;Solaris&quot;) and Andrzej Sapkowski (fantasy; &quot;The Witcher&quot;).

Various regions in Poland such as Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Silesia, and Pomerania developed their own distinct cultures, cuisines, folk costumes and dialects. Also, Poland for centuries was a refuge to many Jews and to Armenians, who became an important part of Polish society and similarly developed their own unique cultures.

Popular everyday foods in Poland include pork cutlets (kotlet schabowy), schnitzels, kielbasa sausage, potatoes, coleslaw and salads, soups (barszcz, tomato or meat broth), pierogi dumplings, and bread rolls. Traditional Polish cuisine is hearty and Poles are one of the more obese nations in Europe – approximately 58% of the adult population was overweight in 2019, above the EU average. According to data from 2017, meat consumption per capita in Poland was one of the highest in the world, with pork being the most in demand. Alcohol consumption is relatively moderate compared to other European states; popular alcoholic beverages include Polish-produced beer, vodka and ciders.

== Religion ==

Poles have traditionally adhered to the Christian faith; an overwhelming majority belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, with 87.5% of Poles in 2011 identifying as Roman Catholic. According to Poland&#x27;s Constitution, freedom of religion is ensured to everyone. It also allows for national and ethnic minorities to have the right to establish educational and cultural institutions, institutions designed to protect religious identity, as well as to participate in the resolution of matters connected with their cultural identity.

There are smaller communities primarily comprising Protestants (especially Lutherans), Orthodox Christians (migrants), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, those irreligious, and Judaism (mostly from the Jewish populations in Poland who have lived in Poland prior to World War II) and Sunni Muslims (Polish Tatars). Roman Catholics live all over the country, while Orthodox Christians can be found mostly in the far north-eastern corner, in the area of Białystok, and Protestants in Cieszyn Silesia and Warmia-Masuria regions. A growing Jewish population exists in major cities, especially in Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław. Over two million Jews of Polish origin reside in the United States, Brazil, and Israel.

Religious organizations in the Republic of Poland can register their institution with the Ministry of Interior and Administration creating a record of churches and other religious organizations who operate under separate Polish laws. This registration is not necessary; however, it is beneficial when it comes to serving the freedom of religious practice laws.

Slavic Native Faith (&quot;Rodzimowiercy&quot;) groups, registered with the Polish authorities in 1995, are the Native Polish Church (&quot;Rodzimy Kościół Polski&quot;), which represents a pagan tradition going back to Władysław Kołodziej&#x27;s 1921 Holy Circle of Worshippers of Światowid (&quot;Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida&quot;), and the Polish Slavic Church (&quot;Polski Kościół Słowiański&quot;). There is also the Native Faith Association (&quot;Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary&quot;, &quot;ZRW&quot;), founded in 1996.

== Geographic distribution ==


Polish people are the sixth-largest national group in the European Union (EU). Estimates vary depending on source, though available data suggest a total number of around 60 million people worldwide (with roughly 18-20 million living outside of Poland, many of whom are not of Polish descent, but are Polish nationals). There are almost 38 million Poles in Poland alone. There are also strong Polish communities in neighbouring countries, whose territories were once occupied or part of Poland – Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, western Ukraine, and western Belarus.

The term &quot;Polonia&quot; is usually used in Poland to refer to people of Polish origin who live outside Polish borders. There is a notable Polish diaspora in the United States, Brazil, and Canada. France has a historic relationship with Poland and has a relatively large Polish-descendant population. Poles have lived in France since the 18th century. In the early 20th century, over a million Polish people settled in France, mostly during world wars, among them Polish émigrés fleeing either Nazi occupation (1939–1945) or Communism (1945/1947–1989).

In the United States, a significant number of Polish immigrants settled in Chicago (billed as the world&#x27;s most Polish city outside of Poland), Milwaukee, Ohio, Detroit, New Jersey, New York City, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and New England. The highest concentration of Polish Americans in a single New England municipality is in New Britain, Connecticut. The majority of Polish Canadians have arrived in Canada since World War II. The number of Polish immigrants increased between 1945 and 1970, and again after the end of Communism in Poland in 1989. In Brazil, the majority of Polish immigrants settled in Paraná State. Smaller, but significant numbers settled in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Espírito Santo and São Paulo (state). The city of Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world (after Chicago) and Polish music, dishes and culture are quite common in the region.

A recent large migration of Poles took place following Poland&#x27;s accession to the European Union in 2004 and with the opening of the EU&#x27;s labor market; an approximate number of 2 million, primarily young, Poles taking up jobs abroad. It is estimated that over half a million Polish people went to work in the United Kingdom from Poland. Since 2011, Poles have been able to work freely throughout the EU where they have had full working rights since Poland&#x27;s EU accession in 2004. The Polish community in Norway has increased substantially and has grown to a total number of 120,000, making Poles the largest immigrant group in Norway. Only in recent years has the population abroad decreased, specifically in the UK with 116.000 leaving the UK in 2018 alone. There is a large minority of Polish people in Ireland that makes up approximately 2.57% of the population.

<text>The Matter of Britain (; ; ; ) is the body of medieval literature and legendary material associated with Great Britain and Brittany and the legendary kings and heroes associated with it, particularly King Arthur. The 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain)&quot; is a central component of the Matter of Britain.

It was one of the three great Western story cycles recalled repeatedly in medieval literature, together with the Matter of France, which concerned the legends of Charlemagne and his companions, as well as the Matter of Rome, which included material derived from or inspired by classical mythology and classical history. Its pseudo-chronicle and chivalric romance works, written both in prose and verse, flourished from the 12th to the 16th century.

==Name==
The three &quot;matters&quot; were first described in the 12th century by French poet Jean Bodel, whose epic &quot;&quot; (&quot;Song of the Saxons&quot;) contains the lines:
The name distinguishes and relates the Matter of Britain from the mythological themes taken from classical antiquity, the &quot;Matter of Rome&quot;, and the tales of the Paladins of Charlemagne and their wars with the Moors and Saracens, which constituted the &quot;Matter of France&quot;.

==Themes and subjects==
King Arthur is the chief subject of the Matter of Britain, along with stories related to the legendary kings of Britain, as well as lesser-known topics related to the history of Great Britain and Brittany, such as the stories of Brutus of Troy, Coel Hen, Leir of Britain (King Lear), and Gogmagog.

===Legendary history===
The legendary history of Britain was created partly to form a body of patriotic myth for the country. Several agendas thus can be seen in this body of literature. According to John J. Davenport, the question of Britain&#x27;s identity and significance in the world &quot;was a theme of special importance for writers trying to find unity in the mixture of their land&#x27;s Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, Roman and Norse inheritance.&quot;

Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s is a central component of the Matter of Britain. Geoffrey drew on a number of ancient British texts, including the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is the earliest known source of the story of Brutus of Troy. Traditionally attributed to Nennius, its actual compiler is unknown; it exists in several recensions. This tale went on to achieve greater currency because its inventor linked Brutus to the diaspora of heroes that followed the Trojan War. As such, this material could be used for patriotic myth-making just as Virgil linked the founding of Rome to the Trojan War in &quot;The Æneid&quot;. Geoffrey lists Coel Hen as a King of the Britons, whose daughter, Helena marries Constantius Chlorus and gives birth to a son who becomes the Emperor Constantine the Great, tracing the Roman imperial line to British ancestors.

It has been suggested that Leir of Britain, who later became King Lear, was originally the Welsh sea-god Llŷr, related to the Irish Ler. Various Celtic deities have been identified with characters from Arthurian literature as well: for example Morgan le Fay was often thought to have originally been the Welsh goddess Modron or Irish the Morrígan. Many of these identifications come from the speculative comparative religion of the late 19th century and have been questioned in more recent years.

William Shakespeare was interested in the legendary history of Britain, and was familiar with some of its more obscure byways. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays contain several tales relating to these legendary kings, such as &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. It has been suggested that Shakespeare&#x27;s Welsh schoolmaster Thomas Jenkins introduced him to this material. These tales also figure in Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;, which also appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s sources for &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

Other early authors also drew from the early Arthurian and pseudo-historical sources of the Matter of Britain. The Scots, for instance, formulated a mythical history in the Pictish and the Dál Riata royal lines. While they do eventually become factual lines, unlike those of Geoffrey, their origins are vague and often incorporate both aspects of mythical British history and mythical Irish history. The story of Gabrán mac Domangairt especially incorporates elements of both those histories.

===Arthurian cycle===
The Arthurian literary cycle is the best-known part of the Matter of Britain. It has succeeded largely because it tells two interlocking stories that have intrigued many later authors. One concerns Camelot, usually envisioned as a doomed utopia of chivalric virtue, undone by the fatal flaws of the heroes like Arthur, Gawain and Lancelot. The other concerns the quests of the various knights to achieve the Holy Grail; some succeed (Galahad, Percival), and others fail.

The Arthurian tales have been changed throughout time, and other characters have been added to add backstory and expand on other Knights of the Round Table. The medieval legend of Arthur and his knights is full of Christian themes; those themes involve the destruction of human plans for virtue by the moral failures of their characters, and the quest for an important Christian relic. Finally, the relationships between the characters invited treatment in the tradition of courtly love, such as Lancelot and Guinevere, or Tristan and Iseult.

In more recent years, the trend has been to attempt to link the tales of King Arthur and his knights with Celtic mythology, usually in highly romanticized, 20th-century reconstructed versions. The work of Jessie Weston, in particular &quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot;, traced Arthurian imagery through Christianity to roots in early nature worship and vegetation rites, though this interpretation is no longer fashionable. It is also possible to read the Arthurian literature, particularly the Grail tradition, as an allegory of human development and spiritual growth, a theme explored by mythologist Joseph Campbell amongst others.

<doc id="275302" wikidata="Q555029" url="?curid=275302" title="James Thomson (poet, born 1700)">
<text>James Thomson (c. 11 September 1700 – 27 August 1748) was a Scottish poet and playwright, known for his poems &quot;The Seasons&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot;, and for the lyrics of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;

== Scotland, 1700–1725 ==
James Thomson was born in Ednam in Roxburghshire around 11 September 1700 and baptised on 15 September. He was the fourth of nine children of Thomas Thomson and Beatrix Thomson (née Trotter). Beatrix Thomson was born in Fogo, Berwickshire and was a distant relation of the house of Hume. Thomas Thomson was the Presbyterian minister of Ednam until eight weeks after Thomson&#x27;s birth, when he was admitted as minister of Southdean, where Thomson spent most of his early years.

Thomson may have attended the parish school of Southdean before going to the grammar school in Jedburgh in 1712. He failed to distinguish himself there. Shiels, his earliest biographer, writes: &#x27;far from appearing to possess a sprightly genius, [Thomson] was considered by his schoolmaster, and those which directed his education, as being really without a common share of parts&#x27;. He was, however, encouraged to write poetry by (1691–1769), a farmer, poet and Presbyterian minister; and Sir William Bennet (d. 1729), a whig laird who was a patron of Allan Ramsay. While some early poems by Thomson survive, he burned most of them on New Year&#x27;s Day each year.

Thomson entered the College of Edinburgh in autumn 1715, destined for the Presbyterian ministry. At Edinburgh he studied metaphysics, Logic, Ethics, Greek, Latin and Natural Philosophy. He completed his arts course in 1719 but chose not to graduate, instead entering Divinity Hall to become a minister. In 1716 Thomas Thomson died, with local legend saying that he was killed while performing an exorcism. At Edinburgh Thomson became a member of the Grotesque Club, a literary group, and he met his lifelong friend David Mallet. After the successful publication of some of his poems in the &quot;Edinburgh Miscellany&quot; Thomson followed Mallet to London in February 1725 in an effort to publish his verse.

== London, 1725–1727 ==
In London, Thomson became a tutor to the son of Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning, through connections on his mother&#x27;s side of the family. Through David Mallet, by 1724 a published poet, Thomson met the great English poets of the day including Richard Savage, Aaron Hill and Alexander Pope. Thomson&#x27;s mother died on 12 May 1725, around the time of his writing ‘Winter’, the first poem of &quot;The Seasons&quot;. &quot;Winter&quot; was first published in 1726 by John Millian, with a second edition being released (with revisions, additions and a preface) later the same year.

By 1727, Thomson was working on &quot;Summer&quot;, published in February, and was working at Watt&#x27;s Academy, a school for young gentlemen and a bastion of Newtonian science. In the same year Millian published a poem by Thomson titled &quot;A Poem to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton&quot; (who had died in March). Leaving Watt&#x27;s Academy, Thomson hoped to earn a living through his poetry, helped by his acquiring several wealthy patrons including Thomas Rundle, the countess of Hertford and Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot.

== Later life, 1728–1748 ==

He wrote &quot;Spring&quot; in 1728 and finally &quot;Autumn&quot; in 1730, when the set of four was published together as &quot;The Seasons&quot;. During this period he also wrote other poems, such as &quot;To the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton&quot;, and his first play, &quot;Sophonisba&quot; (1730). The latter is best known today for its mention in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the English Poets&quot;, where Johnson records that one &#x27;feeble&#x27; line of the poem – &quot;O, Sophonisba, Sophonisba, O!&quot; was parodied by the wags of the theatre as, &quot;O, Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, O!&quot;

In 1730, he became tutor to the son of Sir Charles Talbot, then Solicitor-General, and spent nearly two years in the company of the young man on a tour of Europe.
On his return Talbot arranged for him to become a secretary in chancery, which gave him financial security until Talbot&#x27;s death in 1737. Meanwhile, there appeared his next major work, &quot;Liberty&quot; (1734). This is a lengthy monologue by the &quot;Goddess of Liberty&quot;, describing her travels through the ancient world, and then English and British history, before the resolution of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In 1738 his tragedy &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was played at Drury Lane and the following year he wrote a prologue when Mallet&#x27;s &quot;Mustapha&quot; was performed there.

In 1740, he collaborated with Mallet on the masque &quot;Alfred&quot; which was first performed at Cliveden, the country home of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Thomson&#x27;s words for &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, written as part of that masque and set to music by Thomas Arne, became one of the best-known British patriotic songs – quite distinct from the masque which is now virtually forgotten. The Prince gave him a pension of £100 per annum. He had also introduced him to George Lyttelton, who became his friend and patron.

In later years, Thomson lived in Richmond upon Thames, and it was there that he wrote his final work &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot;, which was published just before his untimely death on 27 August 1748. Johnson writes about Thomson&#x27;s death, &quot;by taking cold on the water between London and Kew, he caught a disorder, which, with some careless exasperation, ended in a fever that put end to his life&quot;. Thomson died indebted and intestate. To discharge his debts an auction of his goods was held.

A dispute over the publishing rights to one of his works, &quot;The Seasons&quot;, gave rise to two important legal decisions (&quot;Millar v. Taylor&quot;; &quot;Donaldson v. Beckett&quot;) in the history of copyright.

Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; was translated into German by Barthold Heinrich Brockes (1745). This translation formed the basis for a work with the same title by Gottfried van Swieten, which became the libretto for Haydn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Some recordings of Haydn’s oratorio use Thomson’s original lyrics as well.

== Memorials ==

Thomson is one of the sixteen Scottish poets and writers appearing on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears on the right side of the east face.

Thomson has a large memorial in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poets&#x27; Corner, next to William Shakespeare and underneath Thomson&#x27;s countryman, Robert Burns.

Thomson is the poet memorialised at Poets&#x27; Corner in Richmond Park&#x27;s Pembroke Lodge Gardens. A bench sculpted by Richard Farrington, and known as &quot;Poet&#x27;s seat&quot;, is inscribed with lines by Thomson, who was living in Richmond at the time of his death. A wooden memorial plaque with an ode to Thomson by the writer and historian John Heneage Jesse was installed in 1851. The plaque was replaced by the Selborne Society in 1895 and by a re-gilded board in 2014.

King Henry&#x27;s Mound, which is also in Richmond Park, has a seat inscribed with a few lines from &quot;The Seasons&quot;.

<text>Pamela Ann Smart (née Wojas; born August 16, 1967) is an American woman who was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and witness tampering in the death of her husband, Greggory Smart, in 1990. Smart, then aged 22, had conspired with her underaged boyfriend, then 15-year-old William &quot;Billy&quot; Flynn, and three of his friends to have Greggory murdered in Derry, New Hampshire. She is currently serving a life sentence at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, a maximum security prison in Westchester County, New York.

==Early life==
Pamela Smart was born Pamela Wojas in Coral Gables, Florida, on August 16, 1967, the daughter of John and Linda Wojas. She grew up in Miami before her family moved to Derry, New Hampshire, when she was in the eighth grade. Pamela attended secondary school at Derry&#x27;s Pinkerton Academy, where she was a cheerleader, and graduated from Florida State University (FSU) with a degree in communications, in the track entitled &quot;Media Performance.&quot; At FSU, she was the host of a college radio program, where she called herself the &quot;Maiden of Metal.&quot;

Pamela met Greggory Smart while she visited New Hampshire over Christmas break in 1986. They formed a relationship in February 1987 and married two years later, with Greggory moving to Florida to live with Pamela during her senior year at FSU. Seven months into their marriage, the couple began having difficulties in their relationship. Pamela took a job as a media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, New Hampshire, where she met sophomore student William &quot;Billy&quot; Flynn at Project Self-Esteem, a school drug awareness program where both were volunteers. Pamela also met another intern named Cecelia Pierce, who was friends with Flynn.

==Murder of Gregg Smart==
On May 1, 1990, Pamela came home from a meeting at work to find her condominium ransacked and her husband Greggory murdered. Police officials said the crime scene looked like a disrupted burglary. Pamela was later accused of seducing 15-year-old Flynn and threatening to withhold sex from him unless he killed her husband. Flynn did so with the help of friends Patrick &quot;Pete&quot; Randall, Vance &quot;J.R.&quot; Lattime, Jr., and Raymond Fowler.

During the investigation, Lattime&#x27;s father brought a .38 caliber pistol he had found in his house to the police, believing it might have been the murder weapon. On May 14, an anonymous tip also indicated that Pamela&#x27;s friend Cecelia Pierce was aware of the plan. Police talked to Pierce, who agreed to wear a wire and record conversations with Pamela in hopes that she would say something incriminating, which she did.

On August 1, 1990, Detective Daniel Pelletier approached Pamela in her school&#x27;s parking lot. Smart recognized him, having spoken to him on at least six other occasions. Taken by surprise, she asked, &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot; &quot;Well, Pam,&quot; Pelletier said in the recording, &quot;I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that we&#x27;ve solved the murder of your husband. The bad news is you&#x27;re under arrest.&quot; &quot;What for?&quot; Smart asked. &quot;First-degree murder.&quot; Smart was then handcuffed and arraigned at the Derry District Court and jailed at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women, which was in Goffstown at the time.

==Trial==
Smart&#x27;s trial was widely watched and garnered considerable media attention, partly because it was one of the first in the U.S. to allow TV cameras in the courtroom. She faced life in prison if convicted. The prosecution&#x27;s case relied heavily on testimony from Smart&#x27;s teenaged co-conspirators, who had secured their own plea bargains before her trial began.

When oral arguments began March 4, 1991, Assistant Attorney General Diane Nicolosi portrayed the teenagers as naïve victims of an &quot;evil woman bent on murder.&quot; The prosecution portrayed Pamela Smart as the cold-blooded mastermind who controlled her underaged sex partner. Nicolosi claimed that Smart seduced Flynn to get him to murder her husband, so that she could avoid an expensive divorce and benefit from a $140,000 life insurance policy. In her testimony, Smart acknowledged that she had what she termed an affair with the underaged boy, but claimed that the murder of her husband was solely the doing of Flynn and his friends as a reaction to her telling Flynn that she wished to end their relationship and repair her marriage. She insisted that she neither participated in the murder plot nor had any foreknowledge of it. Though Flynn claimed he had fallen in love with Smart when he first met her, Cecelia Pierce testified at trial that Smart and Flynn were originally just friends. Pierce first noticed a change about February, when Smart confessed to her that she &quot;loved Bill.&quot; Flynn testified at trial that he was a virgin before he had sex with Pamela Smart.

After a 14-day trial that culminated on March 22, 1991, in the Rockingham County Superior Court, Smart was found guilty of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and witness tampering. The tampering stemmed from Smart&#x27;s coercing Pierce to lie to authorities or not to say anything to them. The conviction was largely the result of the testimony of her co-conspirators and secretly taped conversations in which Smart appeared to contradict her claims of having wanted to reconcile with her husband and of having no knowledge of the boys&#x27; plot. She could have been charged with capital murder, but the prosecution decided against it. Later that day, she was given a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole.

Smart argued that the media had influenced her trial and conviction, as she explained in the 2014 HBO documentary &quot;&quot;.

In March 2023, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed Pamela Smart&#x27;s chance of freedom. This came after asking the Supreme Court to reverse Gov. Chris Sununu&#x27;s decision to deny her a commutation hearing.

==Imprisonment==
Smart is serving her life sentence at the maximum-security Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women in Westchester County, New York, where she was transferred in 1993 from the New Hampshire State Prison for Women in Goffstown. At the time, New Hampshire officials said the transfer was for unspecified &quot;security reasons.&quot; Co-defendants William Flynn and Patrick Randall were also transferred out-of-state, in both cases to the Maine State Prison in Warren, Maine.

The specific reasons for Smart&#x27;s transfer are unclear. In 2007, a senior assistant in the state attorney general&#x27;s office told the &quot;Keene State Equinox&quot; that Smart was transferred due to discipline problems. While she had accrued 22 disciplinary reports, all but two of them were for minor offenses. Deputy Compact Administrator Denise Heath claimed that at the time, there were fears that the State Prison for Women was not suitable for a high-profile inmate like Smart, and that it would be too easy for someone to break her out. However, New Hampshire has never had a formal transfer agreement with New York; Heath believed the transfer was a &quot;commissioner to commissioner&quot; arrangement. Smart&#x27;s family maintains they were never informed of the transfer.

Although she maintained her innocence, Smart conceded that her husband would still be alive if she had not had an affair with Flynn, a minor. While in prison, Smart has tutored other inmates and has completed two master&#x27;s degrees with concentrations in literature and legal studies from Mercy College, which were paid for with private funds from Mercy College. Smart became a member of the National Organization for Women, campaigning for rights for women in prison.

In October 1996, Smart was severely beaten by two fellow inmates. She sustained a fractured nose and a broken eye socket, which resulted in the insertion of a plastic plate in the left side of her face. The two inmates beat Smart after they accused her of snitching on them about their prison relationship. They were both convicted of second-degree assault in the attack on Smart at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility and were subsequently transferred to separate prisons. As a result of the beating, Smart takes medication for chronic pain and sometimes thinks of suicide. Her counselor, Eleanor Pam, says that &quot;she has many, many, many dark days.&quot;

Smart says she still keeps track of Flynn because she regards him as being the key to her freedom, before the 2023 ruling. &quot;He is one of the few people that could actually get me out of here, by coming forward and telling the truth, but he&#x27;s never gonna do that,&quot; said Smart.

In 2003, photos of a scantily clad Smart were published in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. She filed a complaint against the prison and was placed in solitary confinement for two months. Smart sued in relation to her placement in solitary, but the lawsuit was dismissed. In 2004, Smart and fellow inmate Carolyn Warmus sued officials of Bedford Hills, claiming sexual harassment, and sexual assault by a corrections officer, who they said coerced them into posing for the suggestive pictures published in 2003. On November 5, 2009, a U.S. District Court Judge approved a $23,875 judgment to Smart from the State of New York. Smart received $8,750, while her attorney received the remaining balance for attorney fees.

While serving her sentence, Smart took part in a writer&#x27;s workshop, which was facilitated by playwright Eve Ensler. The workshop and Smart&#x27;s writing were exhibited in the 2003 PBS documentary &quot;What I Want My Words to Do to You&quot;.

In April 2004, the First U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a 2002 ruling by a federal judge who rejected her federal habeas petition. Prior to her federal appeal, Smart had exhausted all judicial appeals at the state level. In July 2005, the New Hampshire Executive Council unanimously denied a pardon request for &quot;any conditions the governor may seek to impose.&quot; In an interview with ABC News, Smart indicated she is afraid of growing old and dying in prison and would rather have been given the death penalty.

On March 29, 2023, it was reported that Smart lost her final appeal.

On June 11, 2024, as part of an effort to get a sentence reduction, a videotaped statement was released where for the first time ever, Smart accepted responsibility for her husband&#x27;s death by asserting that she should have &quot;seen the signs&quot;, in regards to her allegation that Flynn&#x27;s actions were of his own volition. She claimed it was done as part of some inner work she was doing on herself.

==Conspirators==
In 1992, Bill Flynn was sentenced to life in prison for second degree murder; not eligible for parole for 40 years with 12 years of the minimum sentence deferred if he maintains good behavior. Flynn was incarcerated at the Maine State Prison in Warren, where he earned his GED, has been active in charity work and worked as an electrician at the prison. In 2007, Flynn sought a sentence reduction after serving 16 years, stating that he had vowed not to do so until he had spent as many years behind bars as he had spent free. He also apologized to Gregg Smart&#x27;s family for murdering him. The Smart family opposed the request. On February 12, 2008, the request was denied, although Flynn&#x27;s earliest parole eligibility date was reduced by three years to 25 years, making him eligible for parole in 2015. In July 2014, Flynn was moved to a minimum security facility in Warren, Maine; the transfer allowed him to participate in a work release program.

Flynn was granted parole by the state parole board on March 12, 2015, and was released from prison with lifetime parole on June 4, 2015, a few days past the 25th anniversary of Gregg Smart&#x27;s death.

Like Flynn, Patrick Randall was also sentenced to life in prison for second degree murder, eligible for parole after 40 years with 12 years deferred, making him eligible as early as 2018. He too served his sentence at the Maine State Prison in Warren, Maine. In March 2009, a judge reduced Randall&#x27;s minimum sentence by three years to 25 years, making him eligible for release as early as June 2015. Randall was granted parole by the New Hampshire Parole Board after a hearing on April 9, 2015. He was released on June 4, 2015, on lifetime parole, the same day as co-conspirator Flynn&#x27;s release and a few days past the 25th anniversary of Gregg Smart&#x27;s death.

Conspirator and driver Vance Lattime was sentenced to life in prison as an accomplice to second-degree murder, eligible for parole after 30 years with 12 years suspended. In 2005, his minimum sentence was reduced by three years, and he was released on lifetime parole that same year, 15 years after Gregg Smart&#x27;s death. In 2023, Lattime was denied a sentence reduction that would have seen his parole end.

Conspirator Raymond Fowler (who waited in the car during the killing) was sentenced to 30 years for conspiracy to murder and attempted burglary, and parole eligibility after 15 years. Fowler was paroled in 2003, 13 years after Gregg Smart&#x27;s death, but was sent back to prison in 2004 for violating his parole terms. He was paroled again in June 2005.

<doc id="275312" wikidata="Q1543791" url="?curid=275312" title="Illinois Confederation">
<text>The Illinois Confederation, also referred to as the Illiniwek or Illini, were made up of a loosely organized group of 12 to 13 tribes who lived in the Mississippi River Valley. Eventually member tribes occupied an area reaching from Lake Michicigao (Michigan) to Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. The five main tribes were the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Peoria, and Tamaroa. Other related tribes are described as the Maroa (which may have been the same as Tamaroa), Tapourao, Coiracoentanon, Espeminka, Moingwena, Chinkoa, and Chepoussa. By 1700 only the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Peoria, and Tamaroa remained. Over time, these tribes would continue to merge, with the Tamaroa joining the Kaskaskia, the Cahokia joining the Peoria, and with a portion of the Michigamea merging with the Kaskaskia and the remainder merging with the Quapaw. 

The spelling &quot;Illinois&quot; was derived from the transliteration by French explorers of to the orthography of their own language. The tribes are estimated to have had tens of thousands of members, before the advancement of European contact in the 17th century that inhibited their growth and resulted in a marked decline in population.

The Illinois, like many Native American groups, sustained themselves through agriculture, hunting, and fishing. A partially nomadic group, the Illinois often lived in longhouses and wigwams, according to the season and resources that were available to them in the surrounding land. While the men usually hunted, traded, or participated in war, the women cultivated and processed their crops, created tools and clothing from game, and preserved food in various ways for storage and travel. Not officially a Confederation, the villages were led by one Great Chief. The villages had several chiefs who led each individual clan. The Illinois people eventually declined because of losses to infectious disease and war, mostly brought through the arrival of French colonists.

In 1832 the last of the Illinois homelands were being ceded, and survivors were removed to Kansas. In 1840 there were two hundred Peoria and 8 Kaskaskia reported. In 1851, an Indian agent reported that the Peoria and the Kaskaskia, along with their allies, had intermarried among themselves and among white people to such an extent that they had practically lost their tribal identities. An 1854 treaty recognized this as a factual union and classified these groups as the Confederated Peoria. The treaty also provided for opening the Peoria-Kaskaskia and the Wea-Piankashaw reserves in Kansas to settlement by non-Indians Eventually, the remnants of these tribal groups reorganized under the name of the Confederated Peoria. They are now known as the federally recognized &quot;Peoria Tribe of Indians&quot; and reside in present-day Oklahoma.

==Name==
French missionaries who documented their interactions with the tribes note that the people referred to themselves as the &quot;Inoka&quot;. The meaning of this word is unknown. Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary, claimed that &quot;Illinois&quot; was derived from &quot;Illini&quot; in their Algonquian language, meaning &#x27;the men&#x27;. Louis Hennepin claimed the aforementioned men were a symbol of maturity and strength, and representative of the prime of a man&#x27;s age.

In the 21st century, however, linguistic research demonstrates that &quot;ilinois&quot; derives indirectly from &quot;irenweewa&quot;, meaning &#x27;he speaks in the ordinary way&#x27;. When the French encountered the Ojibwa, who occupied neighboring areas around the eastern Great Lakes, their pronunciation for this concept sounded to the French like &quot;ilinwe&quot;. &quot;Ilinwe&quot; is the singular form of &quot;ilinwek&quot;. The French explorers who first heard it recorded it in various transliterated forms, such as &quot;liniouek&quot;, &quot;Aliniouek&quot;, &quot;Iliniouek&quot;, and &quot;Abimiouec&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The Illinois Confederation comprised 12 separate tribes who shared common language and culture. These tribes are the Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Peoria, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Michigamea, Chepoussa, Chinkoa, Coiracoentanon, Espeminkia, Maroa, and Tapouara. Of these 12, only the Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Peoria, Tamaora, and Michigamea remain; others were lost as distinct tribes to disease and warfare. When the Illinois were first documented by Europeans in the 17th century, they were said to be a population of about 10,000 people. Although the number has significantly reduced, many of their descendants are today part of the Peoria Tribe of Miami, Oklahoma, as part of the merged Confederated Peoria Tribe.

===Interactions with Europeans===

It is thought that when the French first encountered the Illiniwek tribes, there were as many as 10,000 members living in a vast area stretching from Lake Michigan out to the heart of Iowa and as far south as Arkansas. In the 1670s, the French found a village of the Kaskaskia, in the Illinois River valley (the later site of present-day Utica), a village of Peoria in present-day Iowa (near the later site of Keokuk), and a village of the Michigamea in northeast Arkansas.

The Kaskaskia village, also known as the Grand Village of the Illinois, was the largest and best-known village of the Illinois tribes. In 1675 the French established a Catholic mission, called the Mission of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, and a fur trading post near the village. The population increased to about 6,000 people in about 460 houses. Before long, however, Eurasian infectious diseases and the ongoing Beaver Wars brought high mortality to the Illiniwek, causing their population to plummet over the coming decades.

The French named the area &quot;Pays des Illinois&quot; (meaning &quot;country of the Illinois [plural&quot;), which came to be a common name in referring to the homeland of the Illinois. The early French explorers, including Louis Jolliet, Jacques Marquette and René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, produced accounts that documented the first discovery of the Illinois. Because of these developments, the Illinois tribes became well known to European explorers. European colonization, values, and religion began to affect the tribes.

In the late 17th century, the Iroquois, to expand their region and control the fur trade, forced the Kaskaskia and other Illinois out of their villages. They relocated to the south. Although the Illinois fought back against their primary enemy at the time, the wars scattered and killed many of their members. Eventually they reclaimed some of their lands.

In the early 1700s, the Illinois became involved in the conflict between the Meskwaki, also known as &quot;Fox&quot;, and the French, known as the Fox Wars. In 1722, the Meskwaki attacked the Peoria for having killed the nephew of one of their chiefs, and forced them onto Starved Rock. The Peoria sent out messengers asking for help from the French, but by the time they reached the site, many of the Peoria warriors had been killed. The French and their Illini, Miami, Potawatomi and Sac allies continued to battle the Meskwaki, but were unsuccessful until 1730. That year they besieged a Fox village on the Sangamon River and conducted a brutal attack.

By the mid 1700s, the 12 or 13 tribes of the Confederation had dwindled to five: the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Peoria, and Tamaroa. European diseases drastically reduced the numbers of the Illinois. The wars had arisen due to the conflicts between tribes for resources and trade goods, or were initiated by European explorers looking to expand their land. The remaining descendants of the Illinois Confederation have merged with the Peoria and are known as the Peoria Tribe of Indians and reside in Ottawa County, Oklahoma.

===Dissolution===
Some of the Illinois people&#x27;s prominent enemies were the Lakota (Sioux), Osage, Pawnee, Sac and Fox Nation and Arikara to the west and the Quapaw, Shawnee, and Chickasaw to the south. Although these tribes were consistent threats, the Iroquois became the most pressing enemy of the Illinois beginning in the late 1600s. The Iroquois, hoping to replace deceased kin through adoption and looking for new hunting grounds after exhausting their own resources, killed or captured many Illinois people through their war parties. Other than the internal conflict among the tribes themselves, the Illinois also faced threat from European forces that stirred conflict with them and started wars, some of in which the Illinois were recruited as allies.

Additionally, with the expansion of European and Iroquois contact, the Illinois were exposed to a variety of new diseases that caused high mortality among them. Through war and foreign disease, the Illinois population drastically declined to a village of about 300 people by 1778. Pushed out by the Iroquois and Shawnee and facing more numerous European settlers, the Illinois accepted a reservation in 1832 at the Big Muddy River south of Kaskaskia. But within a few months, they ceded the rest of their territory and migrated in order to settle on a reservation in Eastern Kansas.

In 1854, the Illinois merged with the Wea and Piankashaw nations, renaming themselves as the Confederated Peoria Tribe. In 1867, they resettled in a new reservation in Northeast Oklahoma and were eventually joined by members of the Miami Tribe, who became an official part of their new confederation in 1873. Lasting about 50 years, the United Peoria and Miami Tribe dissolved in the 1920s. The remaining members of the Peoria Confederation reorganized, seeking federal recognition by the U.S. government, and were officially acknowledged by 1978. The remaining descendants of the Illinois Confederation are today found within the Peoria in Ottawa County, Oklahoma.

==Culture==
===Language===
Miami and Illinois are dialects of the same Algonquian language, spoken in Indiana and later Oklahoma. Though no native speakers of the language remain, language revival efforts are ongoing, and children from both the Miami and Peoria nations are learning to speak their ancestral language again. Miami–Illinois is a polysynthetic language with complex verb morphology and fairly free word order.

The Algonquian language is a North American Indian language family that was spoken in Canada, New England, the Atlantic coastal region, and the Great Lakes region, moving towards the Rocky Mountains. Although there are numerous Algonquian languages, such as Cree, Ojibwa, Blackfoot, and Cheyenne, the term &quot;Algonquin&quot; is employed to refer to the dialect of Ojibwa, which is used by the Illinois. Today, there are no native speakers of the language, although revival movements are making efforts to keep the language alive.

===Gender===
Like most Native American tribes, the men of the Illinois were mainly hunters and warriors while the women had domestic and agricultural roles. However, records show that some women also had positions of leadership, including those for ritualistic purposes. Amidst a polygamous society, the first wives held superiority in their families, and held leadership roles in the household. Additionally, some women were shamans and priests, thus holding great power in the community. They enacted powers that could lead to death, and were thus both revered and feared by both men and women. Women were sometimes granted hunting tasks upon communal hunts, but were denied the use of any weapons, thus making it difficult to participate in this activity. Outside of religion, women could achieve status in the village through domestic activities and through harvest. Growing bountiful produce, raising many children, and being a faithful wife were signs that led to an elevated status as well as respect among the natives. Men, on the other hand, could receive status through their achievements in battle and demonstrating courage and bravery. The capacity of their hunting skills led to a greater number of wives, which also promised respect in the villages. Within these polygamous marriages, wives who were unfaithful were punished severely, sometimes by having parts of their face cut off.

Outside of stereotypical social roles, some Illinois men played out the roles of women, likening their appearance to them. These people were called the Ikoneta, and referred to by the French as berdache. Current ethnographers considers the Ikoneta to have been bisexual. While these roles were more deliberate, young boys that demonstrated feminine tendencies were brought up as girls in both outerwear and domestic roles. As according to culture, they were tattooed and taught the language patterns that were specific to women.

===Religion===
People of all social roles and positions were very religious, relying on spiritual guidance to dictate every aspect of their lives. Hunters depended on spirits in catching wild animals, warriors asked the spirits for guidance before warfare, and shamans were regularly employed to absolve matters concerning physical and mental health. However, with the arrival of the European missionaries in the late 1600s, Jesuit missions were established as a means to convert the Illinois to Christianity. While a great portion of the tribes eventually converted, some tribal elders rejected the religions and worked to retain their beliefs in the spirit world.

===Traditions===
The Illinois men and women practiced dream seeking, a ritual in which young boys and girls of about fifteen years of age would paint their face and isolate themselves to fast and pray as a means to reveal to them a specific spirit guardian upon which they would depend on to guide them for the rest of their lives. Called manitou, this vision quest was an important part of becoming an adult in the lives of the Illinois.

The Illinois had two burial procedures. One is the burial of bodies that were intact, and the other for burials of skeletons that were placed on scaffolds prior to the ceremony. Only people of the same gender and age of the dead person could participate as a part of their burial crew. For bodies that were intact, the cadavers were ceremonially dressed and placed in their grave along with funeral objects that would accompany them into the afterlife. A wooden cover is placed over their graves in order to prevent animals and environmental factors from disturbing the grave.

== Society ==
===Economy===
The economy of the Illinois people was based on agriculture, hunting, and fishing. They depended heavily on agriculture, and generally had villages located near rivers where the soil was most fertile. Maize was the primary crop, but the Illinois also planted beans, squash, pumpkins, and watermelons, and gathered wild foods in the forests. Maize was planted in late spring and harvested prematurely in July, at which point most was preserved in order to prepare for the coming winter. The second harvest collected ripened maize, which were eaten during warmer months. Fish was plentiful in the Illinois river, but the Illinois generally did not rely on fishing as sustenance. Hunters primarily sought bison, which were also numerous in the northern Illinois prairies. Hunting expeditions set out as individuals or groups, although sometimes in communal groups in which even women were able to participate. Annual bison hunts often necessitated groups of up to 300 people. In bison hunts, groups would split into several groups and surround the bison on foot. When in close proximity, the hunters would shoot their arrows and spears and force the animal in the opposite direction, towards the rest of the hunting party. The women had the task of butchering the bison and would preserve the meat by drying and heating it in order to prepare for the winter, when hunting was not possible.

At the time of European contact, the Illinois economy was largely self-sufficient. In the course of their yearly activities, the Illinois people produced virtually all of the foodstuffs and other material products they needed to maintain their way of life. However, the Illinois also participated in an extensive trading network. In exchange for hides, furs, and human slaves obtained from tribes living to their south and west, the Illinois traded with Great Lakes tribes and French traders for guns and other European goods. As time passed, traders and missionaries began to settle among the Illinois and their formerly self-sufficient economy became increasingly dependent upon their French allies.

The Illinois seasonally lived in wigwams and longhouses, depending on the weather and the resources available to them. Like most other tribes, they lived in villages with dwellings that were occupied by a number of different families.

===Warfare===
In the beginning of February, war chiefs of each tribes organized raids against enemies, who included the Pawnee and the Quapaw, and later on, the five tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy. Prior to each battle, 20 warriors were invited by the war chief to a feast, in which the men would pray to their manitou for strengths such as speed and endurance when fighting in battle. For campaigns involving larger numbers of enemies, war parties involving both men and women were organized in the villages. To the Illinois, capturing of prisoners was preferred over death, although some prisoners were eventually killed or forced into slavery. The Illinois preferred arrows and spears over guns, finding them slower than the use of their own weapons. The noise of guns was sometimes employed against other tribal nations that had never before seen or heard such a weapon to frighten them before battle.

=== Government ===
Although specific dates are unknown, the Illinois Confederation had at one time been one large nation without any divisions of smaller tribes. They were divided into smaller groups once their population proved to be too large to meet effective hunting and agricultural needs. But even after the split, all the tribes maintained a strong sense of unification as one nation of the Illini. The structures of authority are set out to have one central authority, called the Great Chief, and Chiefs under him that lead each individual tribe. One such Great Chief that is noteworthy in European history is Mamantouensa, who even traveled to France. Direct political leadership was established and maintained by peace chiefs, who were in charge of organizing communal hunting expeditions and communicating with leaders of other tribes. Although highly respected, peace chiefs did not have the authority of village chiefs, and made decisions that were enforced through persuasion over force. War chiefs had the power to plan and lead raids on other tribes. These roles were not inherited, but could be achieved through a demonstration of great battle skills, as well as through convincing the other warriors that his manitou could guide them into a successful raid. For those who died in the battle, it was the war chief&#x27;s role to compensate the families of the deceased through gifts and lead another raid against those who killed the warrior as a means to enact vengeance. Primarily only men were allowed to be chiefs, although women sometimes had leadership roles in the community as village chiefs.

Though chiefs had the authority of political power and were widely respected by the people, the egalitarian society of the Illinois presented a more democratic environment in which important decisions that effected the community were made by tribal consensus. It was only through the expansion of European ideals and direct contact with French officials that influenced the chiefs to wield greater power over their people. By the 1760s, the rise of a new chief had to be approved by colonial authorities.

Because a true confederation refers to different groups of people who, although linked as one nation, are culturally distinct, the Illinois, in the direct definition of the word, are more a segmented tribe rather than a confederation. They share a common language and are culturally similar throughout their tribes. Instead of having multiple individual tribe leaders that assume full authority, the Illinois also had one Grand Chief that centralized power over all of the tribes.

===Settlements===
There are conflicting reports as to the number of villages and populations of the Illinois, both among the tribes and as a whole. When Europeans first documented the nation, the Illinois had villages along the Mississippi and Illinois River and a population of about eight or nine thousand. However, another report counts only five villages and about two thousand people. The former is considered to be a more accurate representation, and the Illinois are said to number 10,500 people at the time of European contact.

<doc id="275319" wikidata="Q2941518" url="?curid=275319" title="Castro Theatre">
<text>The Castro Theatre is a historic movie palace in the Castro District of San Francisco, California. The venue became San Francisco Historic Landmark #100 in September 1976. Located at 429 Castro Street, it was built in 1922 with a California Churrigueresque façade that pays homage—in its great arched central window surmounted by a scrolling pediment framing a niche—to the basilica of Mission Dolores nearby. Its designer, Timothy L. Pflueger, also designed Oakland&#x27;s Paramount Theater and other movie theaters in California during that period. The theater has more than 1,400 seats (approx. 800 downstairs and 600 in the balcony).

==Location and history==
The Castro Theatre originally opened at 479 Castro Street in 1910. It was subsequently remodeled into a retail store (currently occupied by Cliff&#x27;s Variety, since 1971) in the mid-1920s after the larger Castro Theatre was built at 429 Castro Street, its current location, only a few doors up from the original theatre.

The Castro Theatre is located on Castro Street near the intersection of Market and 17th streets, across from the Castro Street Station on the Muni Metro subway.

The new Castro Theatre opened on June 22, 1922, for an invitation-only screening, with Mayor James &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Rolph in attendance, of the Paramount Pictures release &quot;Across the Continent&quot; (1922), starring Wallace Reid. The new Castro Theatre opened the following day to the general public.

The Nasser brothers, who built the theatre and whose family members still own it, also owned several other movie houses in the San Francisco area. The interior is luxurious and ornate, with subtly convex and concave walls and ceilings, and a dramatic &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; pipe organ that is played before films and events. The large neon &quot;Castro&quot; sign is emblematic of both the theatre and the Castro District.
==Current events==
Until the COVID pandemic lockdown early in 2020, the Castro Theatre hosted repertory movies, film festivals, and special events, often with an LGBT and multicultural focus, such as the San Francisco International Film Festival, Frameline: the SF International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, Noir City: The Film Noir Festival, the SF International Asian American Film Festival, the SF International South Asian Film Festival, Berlin and Beyond: German Film Festival, the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, SF Indiefest, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, Midnites For Maniacs, and the Shock It To Me! Classic Horror Film Festival. 

In recent years, the Castro Theatre also was the site for gala tributes to many legendary Hollywood stars including Tony Curtis, Ann-Margret, Debbie Reynolds, Mitzi Gaynor, Ann Miller, Kim Novak, Jane Russell, and Sandra Dee—many of the events produced by local impresario Marc Huestis.

In January 2008, for the filming of the Gus Van Sant biopic &quot;Milk&quot;, restorations were made to the neon on the theater&#x27;s marquee and blade sign, and the facade was repainted. The movie about the life and times of Harvey Milk, the San Francisco city Supervisor who was California&#x27;s first openly gay elected official (portrayed by actor Sean Penn, who won an Academy Award for his performance), had its world premiere at the theater in November 2008. 

The theater can project modern digital formats such as 4K DCP with 5.1 Dolby sound and can accurately reproduce the classic silent film experience by projecting custom frame rates anywhere between 12 and 30 frames per second, including the ability to speed up or slow down during a film. The Castro is capable of showing 70mm films and is one of the few theaters in the world that can show a 70mm film with separate DTS soundtrack. 

=== APE partnership and historic restoration ===
In January 2022, during an extended closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Berkeley-based concert promoter Another Planet Entertainment announced that it had leased the Castro Theater from Bay Properties, the theater&#x27;s owner, to reopen in January 2023, refocusing on presenting live music, in addition to film, comedy, and other events. APE also announced plans to update the theater by implementing significant improvements to the sound, lighting, production, HVAC, and the theatre&#x27;s trademark marquee.

APE&#x27;s management of the space raised questions about the hosting of movies at the theatre, as the local film community was anxious that the change could mean the end of the theatre&#x27;s legacy as a repertory movie house. Complaints also arose over the future of the organ located there.

===Historic preservation campaign===

Plans for the Castro Theatre announced by APE also have produced sustained opposition from historic preservation advocates and promoters of LGBTQ intangible cultural heritage. APE has proposed destroying the historic configuration of the orchestra (the main floor of the auditorium) by demolishing or building over the historic raked floor and aisles to install flat terraces for standing-room music shows with optional temporary chairs. Although APE has offered various modifications to the plan since its initial proposal, none involve preserving the classic movie-palace seating. 

A &quot;Save the Seats&quot; campaign bringing together members of the international film community and the LGBTQ community has argued that the movie-palace seating is integral to the historic integrity of the Castro Theatre and that the venue can be run successfully without destroying the form of the orchestra which reflects its original configuration from 1922. Among the groups leading the campaign are the Castro Theatre Conservancy, an independent nonprofit; the Castro LGBTQ Cultural District, a City-recognized organization devoted to preserving and promoting the intangible LGBTQ cultural heritage of the Castro District; and the Friends of the Castro Theatre Coalition, an unincorporated association of community organizations and individuals.

== Castro Symphonic Theatre Organ ==
The organ was originally a Robert Morton, but it was removed in 1962. The Wurlitzer that became a symbol of the theatre was added in the 1980s, but was removed in 2015 after its owner decided to move to Sacramento, taking a quarter of the pipework with him. A 3-manual Allen was used as a temporary instrument while a major new installation was being undertaken. 

The new instrument is considered the largest hybrid organ ever built, with 7 manuals and over 400 registers available. The organ has just 1,200 physical pipes, borrowed from a Wurlitzer/Kimball instrument, as the 16 ranks that were meant to be installed proved too complex and expensive to restore. The size was meant to achieve a near-infinite tonal palette, and in addition to organ tone, the sixth manual is capable of controlling a virtual orchestra, with technology provided by Audio Impressions. The bottom manual was extended to 88 notes to be able to play a full compass piano.

Despite the larger instrument, the basic stops found on a theatre organ are being maintained. The theatre portion of the instrument will reflect the 37-rank Fox Specials that were offered by Wurlitzer in the 1920s.

The console of the instrument was designed with ergonomics in mind, so that every tab can be reached during a performance, while the manuals are based on a mock-up design to ensure the best ergonomics for the performer.

<doc id="275328" wikidata="Q129727" url="?curid=275328" title="Iberian lynx">
<text>The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is one of the four species within &quot;Lynx&quot;, a genus of medium-sized wild cats. The Iberian lynx is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In the 20th century, the Iberian lynx population had declined because of overhunting, poaching, fragmentation of suitable habitats, and the population decline of its main prey species, the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), caused by myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. Fossils suggest the species has been present in Iberia since the end of the Early Pleistocene, around one million years ago.

By the turn of the 21st century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only 94 individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in Andalusia in 2002. Conservation measures have been implemented since then, which included improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, translocating, reintroducing and monitoring Iberian lynxes. Between 2012 and 2024, the population had increased from a low of 326 individuals to some 2,021, leading to its reclassification as vulnerable. It is a monotypic species, and is thought to have evolved from &quot;Lynx issiodorensis&quot;.

&quot;Felis pardina&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1827 who described skins of Iberian lynxes that were killed in the area of the Tagus river in Portugal and were traded in Paris and London. It is a monotypic species.

=== Phylogeny ===
The Iberian lynx is suggested to have evolved from &quot;Lynx issiodorensis&quot;. Its earliest known fossil remains date to the end of the Early Pleistocene, around one million years ago.

The Iberian lynx genetically diverged as a unique species 1.98 to 0.7 million years ago. Its closest living relative is the Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) with which it coexisted to a certain degree until the 20th century.

== Characteristics ==
The Iberian lynx has a short bright yellowish to tawny coloured spotted fur. The spots vary in shape and size from small round to elongate. They are arranged in lines and decrease in size from the back toward the sides. Its head is small with tufted ears and a ruff. Its body is short with long legs and a short tail. Head and body length of males is with a long tail and a weight of . Females are smaller with a head-to-body-length of approximately and a weight of .

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Iberian lynx was once present throughout the Iberian Peninsula. In the 1950s, the northern population extended from the Mediterranean to Galicia and parts of northern Portugal, and the southern population from central to southern Spain. Populations declined from 15 subpopulations in the 1940s to only two subpopulations in the early 1990s, most noticeably in Montes de Toledo and Sierra Morena. Before 1973, it was present in Sierra de Gata, Montes de Toledo, eastern Sierra Morena, Sierra de Relumbrar and coastal plains in the Doñana area. Between the early 1960s and 2000, it has lost about 80% of its former range. In 2012, it was restricted to very limited areas in southern Spain, with breeding only confirmed in Sierra Morena and Doñana coastal plains. As of 2014, its range included the Sierra Morena and Montes de Toledo of Castilla-La Mancha and the Matachel Valley of Extremadura in Spain, and the Guadiana Valley in Portugal.

Fossil remains indicate that the Iberian lynx had a wider range during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Five lynx remains found in Arene Candide in Northern Italy date to about 24,820–18,620 years before present. One specimen found in Cabias cave in southern France was radiocarbon dated to 3780±90 years before present. In 2021, a large concentration of Iberian lynxes dating to 40,000 years ago were identified for the first time in Southern Italy, at the fossil site of Ingarano in Apulia.

The Iberian lynx prefers heterogeneous environments of open grassland mixed with dense shrubs such as strawberry tree, mastic, and juniper, and trees such as holm oak and cork oak. It is now largely restricted to mountainous areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Iberian lynx marks its territory with its urine, scratch marks on the barks of trees, and scat. The home ranges of adults are stable over many years. Camera trapping surveys in the eastern Sierra Morena Mountains between 1999 and 2008 revealed that six females had home ranges of . Four males in the area had home ranges of .

=== Diet and hunting ===

The Iberian lynx preys foremost on the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) for the bulk of its diet, supplemented by red-legged partridge (&quot;Alectoris rufa&quot;), rodents and to a smaller degree also on wild ungulates. It sometimes preys on young fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama&quot;), European roe deer (&quot;Capreolus capreolus&quot;), European mouflon (&quot;Ovis aries musimon&quot;), and ducks. A male requires one rabbit per day, while a female raising kittens eats three per day.

The Iberian lynx has low adaptability and continued to rely heavily on rabbits, which account for 75% of its food intake, despite the latter&#x27;s repeated population crashes due to myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. Fecal samples of Iberian lynx contained anaerobic bacteria of the genus &quot;Anaeroplasma&quot; that suggest gut microbiome helps it digest its rabbit prey and may also aid in the degradation of plant material from the rabbits&#x27; guts. Antibiotic resistant bacteria were also found within the digestive tract of wild Iberian lynx.

The Iberian lynx competes for prey with the Iberian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus signatus&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), the Egyptian mongoose (&quot;Herpestes ichneumon&quot;), and the European wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;). Also, it often kills other smaller carnivores such as the aforementioned red fox, Egyptian mongoose and common genet (&quot;Genetta genetta&quot;). Fossil leporid accumulations from the Late Pleistocene show that Iberian lynxes in Spain retreated to caves to rest and consume their meals.

=== Reproduction ===
The kittens become independent at 7 to 10 months old, but remain with the mother until around 20 months old. Survival of the young depends heavily on the availability of prey species. In the wild, both males and females reach sexual maturity at the age of one year, though in practice they rarely breed until a territory becomes vacant; one female was known not to breed until five years old when her mother died. The maximum longevity in the wild is 13 years.

Difficulty in finding mates has led to more inbreeding, which results in fewer kittens and a greater rate of non-traumatic death. Inbreeding leads to lower semen quality and greater rates of infertility in males, hindering efforts to increase the species&#x27; fitness.

== Threats ==
The Iberian lynx is threatened by habitat loss, road accidents, and illegal hunting. Habitat loss is due mainly to infrastructure improvement, urban and resort development and tree mono cultivation, which fragments the lynx&#x27;s distribution. In the 20th century, rabbit diseases such as myxomatosis and hemorrhagic disease resulted in a dramatic decline of its main prey. Further, the lynx was hunted as &quot;vermin&quot; under a law passed under Francisco Franco, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, when the hunting of lynx was prohibited. Secret hunting of lynxes still occurs today and is becoming a serious problem. Illegal traps set for rabbits and foxes were the leading causes for lynx mortality in the 1990s.
In addition, every year, several Iberian lynxes die when trying to cross highways with heavy traffic, representing the majority of lynx deaths. In 2013, 14 Iberian lynxes died on roads, and 21 in 2014. In 2023, 144 lynxes were killed on roads.

In 2007, several individuals died of feline leukemia.

Increasing interactions with humans and spread of antibiotic resistant genes between lynx populations could pose a significant threat not only to lynx but also to humans.

== Conservation ==

The Iberian lynx is fully protected and listed on CITES Appendix I, on Appendix II of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and on Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive of the European Union. It was listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List from 2014 through 2024. In 2024, it was reclassified to Vulnerable after young and mature Iberian lynx numbers increased to more than 2,000.

Conservation measures include restoring its native habitat, maintaining the wild rabbit population, reducing unnatural causes of death, and releasing captive bred individuals.
The Spanish National Commission for the Protection of Nature endorsed the Iberian Lynx Ex Situ Conservation Breeding Program to serve as a &quot;safety net&quot; by managing the captive population and also to &quot;help establish new Iberian lynx free-ranging populations through reintroduction programmes.&quot; Before release of captive-bred cats, their natural habit may be simulated to prepare them for life in the wild. A 2006 study used a non-intrusive monitoring system involving cameras to monitor the demographics of both lynxes and rabbits residing in Sierra Morena. Supplemental food sources could be provided if wild rabbits suffered a decline.

Management efforts have been developed to conserve and restore the animal&#x27;s native range. Officials intending to release captive-bred lynx look for areas of appropriate habitat, rabbit abundance, and acceptance by the local human population. About 90 million euros was spent on various conservation measures between 1994 and 2013. The European Union contributes up to 61% of funding.

=== Reintroduction programme ===

Beginning in 2009, the Iberian lynx was reintroduced into Guadalmellato, resulting in a population of 23 in 2013. Since 2010, the species has also been released in Guarrizas. Discussions were held with the Ministry of Environment on plans for releases in the Campanarios de Azaba area near Salamanca. In April 2013, it was reported that Andalusia&#x27;s total wild population—only 94 in 2002—had tripled to 309 individuals. In July 2013, environmental groups confirmed the presence of a wild-born litter in the Province of Cáceres (Extremadura). A study published in July 2013 in &quot;Nature Climate Change&quot; advised that reintroduction programs take place in northern Iberia, suggesting that climate change would threaten rabbits in the south.

In November 2014, three Iberian lynxes were released in the Montes de Toledo; one of them later traveled near Aranjuez, in the Madrid region, the first time in 40 years.

The presence of Iberian lynxes in Portugal, particularly in the south, has been verified. In 2014, the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests signed contracts securing 2,000 hectares of land for Portugal&#x27;s reintroduction project.
In 2015, 10 captive-bred Iberian lynxes were released into Guadiana Valley Natural Park and surrounding areas in southeastern Portugal&#x27;s Guadiana Valley. By the end of 2015, there were 400 lynx on the Iberian peninsula, the vast majority in Andalusia, in southern Spain, but with smaller new populations in the hills near Toledo, in Extremadura (south-western Spain) and in southern Portugal.

The reintroduction of Iberian lynx in Portugal has been a success; from 17 animals that were reintroduced, 12 have already established territories.

Since a 2007 outbreak of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), wild lynxes are tested periodically for possible disease. September–December 2013 samples were negative for FeLV but one male became the first of his species to test positive for feline immunodeficiency virus and was placed into quarantine.

=== Captive breeding ===

In 2002, the Jerez Zoo confirmed it had three females and was developing a plan for a captive breeding program. One of those females was Saliega, captured as a kitten in April 2002. She became the first Iberian lynx to breed in captivity, giving birth to three healthy kittens on 29 March 2005 at the El Acebuche Breeding Center, in the Doñana National Park in Huelva, Spain. Over the following years, the number of births grew and additional breeding centers were opened. In March 2009, it was reported that 27 kittens had been born since the beginning of the program. In 2009, the Spanish government planned to build a €5.5 million breeding center in Zarza de Granadilla.

In Portugal, the Centro Nacional de Reprodução do Lince-Ibérico established a breeding center near Silves, Portugal, and has since nurtured 122 individuals all born in the breeding center, of which 89 survived. 73 of them were reintroduced in the wild. Reintroduction takes place in Mértola and Serpa in the Guadiana Valley. As of 2020, there are around 140 individuals in the wild in Portugal spread through an area of approximately 50,000 hectares, 50 of them are cubs.

There were 14 surviving kittens in 2008 and 15 in 2009. In 2010, intense rain and health issues resulted in lower reproductive success, i.e. 14 born, eight surviving. But the next year, breeding centers recorded 45 births with 26 surviving kittens. In 2012, breeding centers in Portugal and Spain reported a total of 44 survivors from 59 births, while 2013 saw a total of 44 survivors out of 53 born. In 2017, the total population of Iberian lynx reached 475 specimens. In February 2019, the total population was estimated to grow to around 650 individuals.

In March 2013, it was reported that Iberian lynx embryos and oocytes had been collected and preserved for the first time. They were collected from Saliega and another female—both sterilized and retired from the breeding program—by Berlin&#x27;s Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research and stored in liquid nitrogen at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid for possible future breeding. In July 2014, the MNCN-CSIC announced they had produced sperm cells from the testicular tissue of sexually immature lynx.

Iberian lynxes are kept at Jerez Zoo, at Lisbon Zoo since December 2014, and since July 2016 at the Madrid Zoo.

==Genetic research==
The genetic diversity of the Iberian lynx is lower than in any other genetically impoverished felid, which is a consequence of fragmentation, a population bottleneck, and isolation of population units. Iberian lynxes in Doñana and Andujar differ genetically at microsatellite markers. Samples collected in Doñana exhibited a high degree of inbreeding as this unit was isolated for a long time.

==In popular culture==
Portuguese street artist Bordalo II creates installations made of garbage to highlight over-consumption. His works consisting of animals are created to highlight the destruction of species by waste caused by humans. One of his public sculptures is a huge Iberian lynx in the Parque das Nações, Lisbon, Portugal, made for the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth in 2019 and Youth Forum Lisboa+21.

<text>An ethical calculus is the application of mathematics to calculate issues in ethics. 

==Scope==
Generally, ethical calculus refers to any method of determining a course of action in a circumstance that is not explicitly evaluated in one&#x27;s ethical code.

A formal philosophy of ethical calculus is a development in the study of ethics, combining elements of natural selection, self-organizing systems, emergence, and algorithm theory. According to ethical calculus, the most ethical course of action in a situation is an absolute, but rather than being based on a static ethical code, the ethical code itself is a function of circumstances. The optimal ethic is the best possible course of action taken by an individual with the given limitations. 

While ethical calculus is, in some ways, similar to moral relativism, the former finds its grounds in the circumstance while the latter depends on social and cultural context for moral judgment. Ethical calculus would most accurately be regarded as a form of dynamic moral absolutism.

Ethical calculus is not to be confused with ethics in mathematics or ethics of quantification which study the moral questions coming from mathematical practice and quantification in society. 

==Examples==
Francis Hutcheson devoted a section of his 1725 work &quot;Inquiry into the Original of our ideas and Beauty and Virtue&quot; to &quot;an attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation in subjects of Morality&quot;. Formulas included:
* M = B × A
where,
*M is the moral importance of any agent
*B is the of the agent
*A is the ability of the agent

Another example is the felicific calculus formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to cause. Bentham, an ethical hedonist, believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced. The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act.

<doc id="275334" wikidata="Q273291" url="?curid=275334" title="Hermit crab">
<text>Hermit crabs are anomuran decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea that have adapted to occupy empty scavenged mollusc shells to protect their fragile exoskeletons. There are over 800 species of hermit crab, most of which possess an asymmetric abdomen concealed by a snug-fitting shell. Hermit crabs&#x27; soft (non-calcified) abdominal exoskeleton means they must occupy shelter produced by other organisms or risk being defenseless.

The strong association between hermit crabs and their shelters has significantly influenced their biology. Almost 800 species carry mobile shelters (most often calcified snail shells); this protective mobility contributes to the diversity and multitude of these crustaceans which are found in almost all marine environments. In most species, development involves metamorphosis from symmetric, free-swimming larvae to morphologically asymmetric, benthic-dwelling, shell-seeking crabs. Such physiological and behavioral extremes facilitate a transition to a sheltered lifestyle, revealing the extensive evolutionary lengths that led to their superfamily success.

==Classification==
The hermit crabs of Paguroidea are more closely related to squat lobsters and porcelain crabs than they are to true crabs (Brachyura). Together with the squat lobsters and porcelain crabs, they all belong to the infraorder Anomura, the sister taxon to Brachyura.

However, the relationship of king crabs to the rest of Paguroidea has been a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on their physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data demonstrate the longstanding hypothesis that the king crabs in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs descended from pagurids and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea. The molecular data has disproven an alternate view based on morphological arguments that the Lithodidae (king crabs) nest with the Hapalogastridae in a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. As such, in 2023, the family Lithodidae was placed back into Paguroidea after having been moved out of it in 2007.

Nine families are formally recognized in the superfamily Paguroidea, containing around 1200 species in total in 135 genera.

* Calcinidae – seven genera
* Coenobitidae – two genera: terrestrial hermit crabs and the coconut crab
* Diogenidae – 20 genera of &quot;left-handed hermit crabs&quot;
* Lithodidae – 15 genera of &quot;king crabs&quot;
* Paguridae – 76 genera of &quot;true hermit crabs&quot;
* Parapaguridae – 10 genera of &quot;anemone hermit crabs&quot;
* Parapylochelidae – two genera
* Pylochelidae – 9 genera of &quot;symmetrical hermit crabs&quot;
* Pylojacquesidae – two genera

===Phylogeny===
The placement of Paguroidea within Anomura can be shown in the cladogram below, which also shows the king crabs of Lithodidae as sister taxon to the hermit crabs of Paguridae:
===Fossil record===
The fossil record of &quot;in situ&quot; hermit crabs using gastropod shells stretches back to the Late Cretaceous. Before that time, at least some hermit crabs used ammonite shells instead, as shown by a specimen of &quot;Palaeopagurus vandenengeli&quot; from the Speeton Clay Formation, Yorkshire, UK, from the Lower Cretaceous, as well as a specimen of a diogenid hermit crab from the Upper Jurassic of Russia. The earliest record of the superfamily extends back to the earliest part of the Jurassic, with the oldest known species being &quot;Schobertella hoelderi&quot; from the late Hettangian of Germany.

===Aquatic and terrestrial hermit crabs===
Hermit crabs can be informally divided into two groups: aquatic hermit crabs and terrestrial hermit crabs.

The land hermit crabs belong to the family Coenobitidae. They spend most of their life on land in tropical areas, though they require access to water to keep their gills damp or wet to survive and to reproduce.

==Description==
Hermit crab species range in size and shape, from species only a few millimeters long to &quot;Coenobita brevimanus&quot; (Indos Crab), which can approach the size of a coconut and live 12–70 years. The shell-less hermit crab &quot;Birgus latro&quot; (coconut crab) is the world&#x27;s largest terrestrial invertebrate.

Most species have long, spirally curved abdomens, which are soft, unlike the hard, calcified abdomens seen in related crustaceans. The abdomen is protected from predators by a salvaged empty seashell carried by the hermit crab, into which its whole body can retract. Most frequently, hermit crabs use the shells of sea snails (although the shells of bivalves and scaphopods and even hollow pieces of wood and stone are used by some species). The tip of the hermit crab&#x27;s abdomen is adapted to clasp strongly onto the columella of the snail shell.

== Development and reproduction ==
Hermit Crab young develop in stages, with the first two (the nauplius and protozoea) occurring inside the egg. Most hermit crab larvae hatch at the third stage, the zoea. In this larval stage, the crab has several long spines, a long, narrow abdomen, and large fringed antennae. Several zoeal moults are followed by the final larval stage, the megalopa.

The sexual behavior exhibited by hermit crabs varies from species to species. But a broad description is as follows, if the female possesses any larvae from a previous mating, she moults and lets them go. Female hermit crabs are ready to mate shortly before moulting. In certain species the male grabs the pre-moult female for sometimes hours to days. During the time in which the female molts the male may engage in movements such as jerking or shaking the female towards the male before reproduction.

The female will then put her claws in her mouth signaling the male she is ready to mate. Then they both move their bodies mostly out of their shells, and mate. Both crabs then go back inside their shells, and they may mate again. In some species the male performs post-copulatory behavior until the female has the eggs on her legs (pleopods).

Hermit crabs molt as they develop and grow. In doing so they shed an exoskeleton that resembles a limp crab. The molting process is long and can take up to 60 days to complete. There are 4 stages to molting: Intermolt, Proecdysis, ecdysis, and postedysis. Intermolt is the time between molts where a hermit crab will store energy. Proecdysis is the premolt stage where the old exoskeleton starts to shed and the new one forms. Ecdysis is the main phase of the molt where the crab will be able to crawl out of the old exoskeleton and is left with a new, soft one. Lastly postedysis (post molt) is where the new exoskeleton hardens and the hermit crab will eat the old exoskeleton.

In some larger species of hermit crab they have exhibited burying the exoskeleton and leaving it.

== Behavior ==
Hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers, and mostly nocturnal.

=== Shells and shell remodeling ===
As hermit crabs grow, they require larger shells. Since suitable intact gastropod shells are sometimes a limited resource, competition often occurs between hermit crabs for shells. The availability of empty shells at any given place depends on the relative abundance of gastropods and hermit crabs, matched for size. An equally important issue is the population of organisms that prey upon gastropods and leave the shells intact. Hermit crabs kept together may fight or kill a competitor to gain access to the shell they favour. However, if the crabs vary significantly in size, fights over empty shells are rare. Hermit crabs with undersized shells cannot grow as fast as those with well-fitting shells, and are more likely to be eaten if they cannot retract completely into the shell.

Shells used by hermit crabs have usually been remodeled by previous hermit crab owners. This involves a hermit crab hollowing out the shell, making it lighter. Only small hermit crabs are able to live without remodelled shells. Most big hermit crabs that have been transferred to a normal shell die. Even if they were able to survive, hollowing out a shell takes precious energy, making it undesirable to any hermit crab. They achieve this remodeling by both chemically and physically carving out the interiors of their shell. These shells can last for generations, explaining why some hermit crabs are able to live in areas where snails have become locally extinct.

There are cases when seashells are not available and hermit crabs will use alternatives such as tin cans, custom-made shells, or any other types of debris, which often proves fatal to the hermit crabs (as they can climb into, but not out of, slippery plastic debris). This can even create a chain reaction of fatality, because a dead hermit crab will release a signal to tell others that a shell is available, luring more hermit crabs to their deaths. More specifically, they are attracted to the scent of dead hermit crab flesh.

For some larger marine species, supporting one or more sea anemones on the shell can scare away predators. The sea anemone also benefits, because it is in a prime position to consume fragments of the hermit crab&#x27;s meals. Other very close symbiotic relationships are known from encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs forming bryoliths.

In February 2024, Polish researchers reported that 10 of 16 terrestrial hermit crab species were observed using artificial shells, including discarded plastic waste, broken glass bottles and light bulbs, in lieu of natural shells.

=== Shell fighting ===
Shell fighting is a behavior observed in all hermit crabs. It is a process in which the attacker hermit crab attempts to steal the shell of the victim, using a fairly intricate process. It usually only occurs if there is no empty shell suitable for the growing hermit crab. These fights are usually between the same species, though they can also occur between two separate species.

If the defending crab does not retreat to the inside of its shell, an aggressive interaction will usually take place, until the defending crab retreats, or the attacker flees. After the defender has retreated, the attacker will usually turn the shell over multiple times, holding it with its legs. It then places its chelipeds into the shell&#x27;s opening.

Then the crabs start the &quot;positioning&quot; behavior, this consists of the attacker moving side to side, over the opening of the defender&#x27;s shell. This movement usually forms a figure 8. The attacker then goes into the aptly named &quot;rapping&quot; behavior. The attacker holds its legs and chepelothorax stationary, while it moves its shell down on the defender&#x27;s shell. It is done quite rapidly, and is usually enough to produce an audible sound. It seems like little to no contact happens directly between the two crabs.

After a number of &quot;raps&quot;, the defender may come out of its shell completely, usually positioning itself of one of the shells. The attacker then checks the now free shell, and then changes shell rapidly. As the crab tries its new shell, it usually holds its old shell, as it may decide to come back to the old one. The defeated crab then runs to the empty shell. If the defeated crab does not stay close to the shells, it is usually eaten.

Several hermit crab species, both terrestrial and marine, have been observed forming a vacancy chain to exchange shells. When an individual crab finds a new empty shell, or steals one from another, it will leave its own shell and inspect the vacant shell for size. If the shell is found to be too large, the crab goes back to its own shell and then waits by the vacant shell for up to 8 hours. As new crabs arrive they also inspect the shell and, if it is too big, wait with the others, forming a group of up to 20 individuals, holding onto each other in a line from the largest to the smallest crab. As soon as a crab that is the right size for the vacant shell arrives and claims it—leaving its old shell vacant—all the crabs in the queue swiftly exchange shells in sequence, each one moving up to the next size. If the original shell was taken from another hermit crab, the victim is usually left without a shell, and gets eaten. Hermit crabs often &quot;gang up&quot; on one of their species with what they perceive to be a better shell, and pry its shell away from it before competing for it until one takes it over.

=== Aggressive behaviors ===

Aggressive behaviors for hermit crabs are quite similar to one another, with some variations present between species. It usually consists of moving or positioning the legs and the chelipeds, also known as the claw or pincer. Usually these displays are enough to avoid confrontation. Sometimes two opposing crabs will do multiple actions, with no apparent pattern. These confrontations usually last a few seconds, though some may last a few minutes, for those especially stubborn crabs.

They can also raise a leg which is sometimes referred to as an &quot;ambulatory raise&quot;. This can happen with multiple legs such as with the first two walking legs, or both the first and second pair. This is referred to as &quot;double ambulatory raise&quot;, and &quot;quadruple ambulatory raise&quot;, respectively. The exact form of this movement is variable between species. In some other species there is another distinct movement, where they move their leg away and upwards from the body, while it moves forwards, this same movement continues as the limb is brought down. This movement is sometimes called an &quot;ambulatory poke&quot;.

They also use their chelipeds as a warning display, usually used in two distinct variations. The first one consists of the crab lifting its whole body (shell included), and spreading its legs, then moving its cheliped forward until the dactylus (top part of the claw) is perpendicular with the ground. This movement is usually called an &quot;cheliped presentation&quot; This position may be more distinct in some species, such as those in the genus &quot;Pagurus.&quot; The second variation called the &quot;cheliped extension&quot;, is usually a purely visual movement, though it may sometimes be used to strike a crab. The chelipeds move forward and upwards, until the limb is parallel with the ground, usually used to push another crab out of the way. If a larger crab pushes a smaller one, the smaller one may be moved multiple centimeters.

The crabs of the family Paguridae, have another distinct type of movement. Individuals may crawl upon another&#x27;s crab shell. If the size is just right the crab climbed upon may move rapidly up and down or sideways, usually causing the other crab to fall off.

=== Grouping behavior ===

Some species such as &quot;Clibanarius tricolor, Calcinus tibicen&quot; and &quot;Pagurus miamensis&quot; are semi gregarious, showing unique behaviors in groups. While these three species all show gregarious behavior, C. tricolor, forms the densest and bigger groups. The crabs of &quot;Clibanarius tricolor&quot; congregate during the day, and usually stay with their same respective group, day after day. At 4:00 p.m. the crabs would start moving in their groups, and by 5:00 p.m. they had left their congregation. The congregations usually move in one general direction, and may be close to other crabs. This behavior seems to be lost under controlled conditions, however.

=== Associations with other animals ===
The shells of hermit crabs have multiple &quot;associates&quot; whose exact roles have not been well described. These associates are usually categorized into two groups, those who live in the interior of the shell and those who live on the exterior. Some of the interior associates include nereid worms which have a commensal relation, the worms help the hermit crabs keep their shell clean along with the crabs of the family Porcellanidae. It is not rare to see both the worms and crabs in the same shell.

There are also associations with Amphipods, such as the relationship between the hermit crab species &quot;Pagurus hemphilli&quot; and the amphipod genus &quot;Liljeborgia.&quot; The coloration of this amphipod matches the coloration of the hermit crab and the &quot;Crustose rhodophycean&quot; algae which commonly grows in their shells. Specimens of &quot;P. hemphilli&quot; tolerated the presence of their guest, while other hermit crab species attempted eating them.

Some of the exterior associates are the epifauna, such as barnacles and Crepidula, which may be a hindrance to the crabs, as they may ruin the stability or just add weight to the shell. Some species of hermit crabs have live colonies of Hydractina, while others rejected them. Some species just keep the colony in their shells, while others are actively detaching and re-attaching the sea anemone. Most hermit crabs attempt to place the most anemones as possible, while some others steal the anemone another hermit crab is carrying. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between the two, as they help defend against predators.

== Hermit crabs as pets ==

Several marine species of hermit crabs are common in the marine aquarium trade. They are commonly kept in reef fish tanks.

Two of the most common terrestrial hermit crabs kept as pets are the Caribbean hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita clypeatus&quot;), and the Ecuadorian hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita compressus&quot;). Despite their reputation as &#x27;throwaway&#x27; and &#x27;low maintenance&#x27; pets, hermit crabs can actually live for up to 15 or more years with proper care. The oldest known pet hermit crab lived for 45 years. Hermit crabs need a proper tank set up that will provide all of their needs in order to thrive. Hermit crabs should not be regularly handled, they are prey animals and typically panic while being handled, which can cause injury to the crab or the owner. Hermit crabs will try to hide when scared. They will also pinch, which can break skin. A drop or a fall onto hard surfaces can be lethal to a hermit crab.

Hermit crabs need a consistent temperature of 75–85 °F, and a consistent humidity of 75–85% humidity. Low humidity will result in a hermit crab slowly suffocating. Hermit crabs breathe using modified gills. These modified gills need to be moist in order to function. Hermit crabs should be kept in glass tanks of an appropriate size in order to maintain the humidity and temperature needed. At least 10 gallons of tank space should be provided per hermit crab. Overcrowding a tank can result in aggressiveness and cannibalism between crabs.

Hermit crabs also require both salt water and freshwater sources deep enough for the crab to fully submerge. All water should be treated to remove chemicals, and saltwater should be prepared using a marine grade salt mix. Further, like many pets, hermit crabs need enrichment and need opportunities for hiding and climbing. Huts, wood, and artificial plants can be used to fill this need. In the wild hermit crabs may walk several miles a night for purposes of foraging or migration. Hermit crabs are nocturnal and are most active during the night.

<text>The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, commonly known as Cooper Union, is a private college on Cooper Square in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Peter Cooper founded the institution in 1859 after learning about the government-supported in France. The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on Cooper&#x27;s belief that an education &quot;equal to the best technology schools established&quot; should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be &quot;open and free to all&quot;.

The college is divided into three schools: the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, the School of Art, and the Albert Nerken School of Engineering. It offers undergraduate and master&#x27;s degree programs exclusively in the fields of architecture, fine arts (undergraduate only), and engineering as well as a shared core curriculum in the humanities and social sciences.

The Cooper Union was one of very few American institutions of higher learning to offer a full-tuition scholarship to every admitted student, a practice it discontinued in 2014, instead offering a half-tuition scholarship to each admitted student. , nearly half of its undergraduate students were attending on a tuition-free basis. In September 2024 the school announced that for the next four years, all students (including current students) would not pay tuition for their senior year.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
The Cooper Union was founded in 1859 by American industrialist Peter Cooper, one of the richest businessmen in the United States. Cooper was a workingman&#x27;s son who had less than a year of formal schooling. Cooper designed and built America&#x27;s first steam railroad engine and made a fortune with a glue factory and iron foundry. He was a principal investor and first president of the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, which laid the first transatlantic telegraph cable, and once ran for President under the Greenback Party, becoming the oldest person ever nominated for the office by a political party.

Cooper&#x27;s dream was to give talented young people the one privilege he lacked: a good education from an institution which was &quot;open and free to all&quot;. To achieve these goals, Cooper designated the bulk of his wealth to The Cooper Union. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1863, &quot;It was rare that those of limited means, however eager they might be to acquire a knowledge of some of the higher branches of education, could obtain tuition in studies not named in the regular course taught in our public schools.&quot; Discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, or sex was expressly prohibited.

===Development after founding===
Originally intended to be named simply &quot;the Union&quot;, the Cooper Union began with adult education in night classes on the subjects of applied sciences and architectural drawing, as well as day classes primarily intended for women on the subjects of photography, telegraphy, typewriting and shorthand in what was called the college&#x27;s Female School of Design. The early institution also had a free reading room open day and night, the first in New York City (predating the New York Public Library system), and a new four-year nighttime engineering college for men and a few women. In 1883, a five-year curriculum in chemistry was added as an alternative to the applied science (engineering) program. A daytime engineering college was added in 1902, thanks to funds contributed by Andrew Carnegie. Initial board members included Daniel F. Tiemann, John E. Parsons, Horace Greeley and William Cullen Bryant, and those who availed themselves of the institute&#x27;s courses in its early days included Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Thomas Alva Edison and William Francis Deegan.

The Cooper Union&#x27;s free classes have evolved into three schools: the School of Art, the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, and the Albert Nerken School of Engineering. Since 1859, the Cooper Union has educated thousands of artists, architects, and engineers, many of them leaders in their fields.

After 1864 there were a few attempts to merge Cooper Union and Columbia University, but these were never realized.

The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, was founded in 1897 as part of Cooper Union by Sarah, Eleanor, and Amy Hewitt, granddaughters of Peter Cooper.

===Structure-building era===
====The Foundation Building====
Cooper Union&#x27;s Foundation Building is an Italianate brownstone building designed by architect Fred A. Petersen, one of the founders of the American Institute of Architects. It was the first structure in New York City to feature rolled-iron I-beams for structural support; Peter Cooper himself invented and produced these beams. Petersen patented a fire-resistant hollow brick tile he used in the building&#x27;s construction. The building was the first in the world to be built with an elevator shaft, because Cooper, in 1853, was confident an elevator would soon be invented. However, he expected them to be cylindrical, so he designed the shaft in the shape of a circle. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and a New York City Landmark in 1965, and added to the Historic American Engineering Record in 1971.

====The Foundation Building&#x27;s Great Hall====
On February 27, 1860, the school&#x27;s Great Hall, located in the basement level of the Foundation Building, became the site of a historic address by Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Lincoln made his address on a snowy night before about 1,500 persons.&quot;

Widely reported in the press and reprinted throughout the North in pamphlet form, the speech galvanized support for Lincoln and contributed to his gaining the Party&#x27;s nomination for the presidency. It is now referred to as the Cooper Union Address.

Since then, the Great Hall has served as a platform for historic addresses by American Presidents Grant, Cleveland, Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Bill Clinton. Clinton spoke on May 12, 1993, about reducing the federal deficit and again on May 23, 2006, as the Keynote Speaker at The Cooper Union&#x27;s 147th Commencement, along with Anna Deavere Smith. He appeared a third time on April 23, 2007, along with Senator Edward Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, and others, at the memorial service for historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Most recently, Barack Obama delivered an economic policy speech at Cooper Union&#x27;s Great Hall on April 22, 2010. On September 22, 2014, President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas delivered his first formal speech in English.

Other historic speakers in the Great Hall have included Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mark Twain.
The Great Hall continues to serve as an important metropolitan art space and has hosted lectures and performances by such key figures as Joseph Campbell, Steve Reich, Salman Rushdie, Ralph Nader, Hamza Yusuf, Richard Stallman, Rudolph Giuliani, Pema Chodron, Michael Bloomberg, Evo Morales, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez. When not occupied by external or hosted events, the Great Hall is made accessible to students and faculty for large lectures and recreational activities, including the school&#x27;s annual Culture Show. In 1994, the Cooper Union Forum of Public Programs was honored with a Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. 

In late 2008, the Great Hall was closed to students and outside events for the first major renovation of the hall since 1978.

===Modern changes===
The Cooper Union has schools in architecture, fine art, and engineering. At present, these three fields represent Cooper Union&#x27;s degree programs. The Faculty of Humanities and Social Studies provides classes and faculty to all three programs.

In 2002, the school decided to generate revenue by razing its engineering building and having it replaced with a commercial building, and replacing its Hewitt Building with a new building called 41 Cooper Square.

====41 Cooper Square====


A new classroom, laboratory, and studio facility designed by Thom Mayne replaced the aging Hewitt Academic Building at 41 Cooper Square. In contrast to the Foundation Building, 41 Cooper Square is of modern, environmentally &quot;green&quot; design, housing nine above-ground floors and two basements. The structure features unconventional architectural features, including a full-height Grand Atrium, prevalent interior windows, a four-story linear central staircase, and upper-level skyways, which reflect the design intention of inspiring, socially interactive space for students and faculty. In addition, the building&#x27;s design allows for up to 75% natural lighting, further reducing energy costs. In 2010, 41 Cooper Square became the first academic and laboratory structure in New York City to meet Platinum-level LEED standards for energy efficiency. The building was funded in part by alumni donations, materialized in nameplates and other textual recognition throughout the building.

Primarily designed to house the Cooper Union&#x27;s School of Engineering and School of Art, the new building&#x27;s first eight above-ground floors are populated by classrooms, small engineering laboratories, study lounges, art studio space, and faculty offices. The ninth, top floor is dedicated completely to School of Art studio and classroom space in addition to the art studio spaces located throughout the building. The lowest basement level consists almost completely of the school&#x27;s large machine shops and design laboratories, as well as much of the HVAC and supply infrastructure. The building&#x27;s first basement level houses primarily the Frederick P. Rose Auditorium, a 198-capacity lecture hall and event space designed as a smaller, more modern alternative to the Great Hall.

==Financial support==

A substantial portion of the annual budget, which supports the full-tuition scholarships in addition to the school&#x27;s costs, is generated through revenues from real estate. Its endowment is over $600 million. The land under the Chrysler Building is owned by the endowment, and as of 2009, Cooper Union received $7 million per year from this parcel. Further, under a very unusual arrangement, New York City real-estate taxes assessed against the Chrysler lease, held by Aby Rosen, are paid to Cooper Union, not the city. This arrangement would be voided if Cooper Union sold the real estate. In 2006, Tishman Speyer signed a deal with the school to pay rent that has escalated to $32.5 million in 2018.

===Financial crisis and tuition controversy===
Around October 29, 2011, rumors circulated the school was in serious financial trouble. On October 31, a series of open forums were held with students, faculty, and alumni to address a financial crisis.

Current and past students voiced opposition to charging tuition. The then-president of the school, Jamshed Bharucha, indicated depletion of the school&#x27;s endowment required additional sources of funding. In 2012, the college announced approval from its board of trustees to attempt to establish a new tuition-based cross-disciplinary graduate program, expand its fee-based continuing education programs, and impose tuition on some students in its existing graduate programs.

In December 2012, as a protest against the possibility of undergraduate tuition being charged, 11 students occupied a suite in the Foundation Building for a week. Charging high tuition was complicated by the school&#x27;s lack of customary amenities offered by other high-tuition schools.

The college ended its free tuition policy for undergraduates in 2014, but offers need-based tuition remission to incoming undergraduates on a sliding scale. On May 8, 2013, a group of students occupied President Bharucha&#x27;s office in protest over news reports about ending free tuition. The administration, board of trustees, and those members of the Cooper Union community who had been occupying the Office of the President since early May reached an agreement that ended the occupation on July 12.

Throughout 2013, 2014, and 2015, the Committee to Save Cooper Union (CSCU) — a coalition of former and current students, alumni and faculty — campaigned to reverse this decision, urging the president and the board of trustees to return Cooper Union to &quot;its tuition-free and merit-based mission, ensure the school’s fiscal recovery, and establish better governance structures.&quot;

On September 1, 2015, the school and the CSCU announced the CSCU&#x27;s lawsuit against the school&#x27;s administration was resolved in the form of a consent decree signed by Cooper Union, then-New York State&#x27;s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, and the CSCU. The decree includes provisions for returning to a sustainable, tuition-free policy, increased board transparency, additional student, faculty and alumni trustees, an independent financial monitor appointed by the Attorney General, and a search committee to identify the next full-term president.

On January 15, 2018, the Free Education Committee (FEC) of the school&#x27;s Board of Trustees released their recommended plan to return to full-tuition scholarships for undergraduates only by the academic year starting in the fall of 2028. In March 2018, the board released its approved, updated version with the same milestone. In 2024, the school announced that approximately 83% of undergraduate tuition costs would be covered by scholarships in the 2024-2025 academic year and that they were proceeding as planned towards their goal of 100% coverage in the 2029 fiscal year.

==Academics==
Admission to Cooper Union is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 12% across the three schools.

===The Albert Nerken School of Engineering===
The Cooper Union&#x27;s School of Engineering is named in honor of Albert Nerken, a chemical engineering alumnus of the school. Its enrollment includes about 550 students, and is the largest of the three schools by a significant margin. The school offers ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree programs in core engineering fields and an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) degree. Opportunities are also available for engineering students to pursue minors in bioengineering, chemistry, computer science, humanities and social sciences, and mathematics.

Specialized facilities for teaching and research include the Maurice Kanbar Center for Biomedical Engineering established in 2002 and the interdisciplinary Maker Space Lab, established in 2020 for the use of engineering, art, and architecture students.

====Master&#x27;s in Engineering====
The School of Engineering offers master&#x27;s degrees in chemical, civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering. Cooper Union undergraduate engineering students may earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree in as little as five years.

===The School of Art===
Consisting of roughly 200 students and 70 faculty members, the Cooper Union School of Art offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree and a Certificate of Fine Arts. As a member school of AICAD, School of Art students may participate in exchange programs with the other colleges in the association, including California Institute of the Arts and Otis College of Art and Design.

The Cooper Union Art program is often referred to as &quot;generalist&quot; or &quot;versatile&quot; when compared to other Fine Arts colleges; incoming students do not choose an academic major within the Fine Arts field, but instead are permitted and encouraged to select courses from any of the School of Art&#x27;s departments. The curriculum place heavy emphasis on each student&#x27;s creative and imaginative abilities, rather than technical precision in a specific medium.

====Galleries====
Located in both public spaces and specialized rooms, Cooper Union&#x27;s galleries provide space for installations and showcases by students, faculty, and guest artists. Popular gallery locations include the Great Hall lobby in the Foundation Building and newly opened 41 Cooper Gallery in 41 Cooper Square, which provides a two-story high space for large, three-dimensional exhibitions and works visible from both the building lobby and 7th street through large plate-glass windows.

In addition, numerous smaller exhibition spaces exist throughout both buildings on campus. Larger spaces on the upper floors of the Foundation Building are used primarily for interdisciplinary exhibitions with the School of Architecture. For presentations of video and digital media, the Great Hall and 41 Cooper Square&#x27;s Rose Auditorium are used.

===Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture===
The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at The Cooper Union offers a five-year NAAB accredited program established by John Hejduk. The philosophical foundation of the school was directly committed to the &quot;Social Contract&quot; and dedicated to education as &quot;one of the last places that protects freedom, and teaching as a sociopolitical act, among other things.&quot; Among those other things were principles of free debate and theoretical discourse which drew source from deep wellsprings of lost histories such as the Bauhaus school of Architecture founded by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

The faculty includes architects, design and construction managers such as Peter Eisenman, Samuel Anderson, Nader Tehrani, and Diana Agrest. Former faculty members include the architects Michael Webb, Peter Eisenman, Raimund Abraham, Lebbeus Woods, Diane Lewis and John Hejduk.

====Master of Architecture II====
The post-professional degree program in architecture was launched in 2009. Concentrations in one or a combination of three areas are offered: theory, history and criticism of architecture, urban studies and technologies.

==Athletics==
Cooper Union has developed an athletic program which fields teams in basketball, volleyball, and soccer.

==Notable alumni==
Awards received by Cooper Union alumni include a Nobel Prize in Physics, a Pritzker Prize, 3 National Medal of Arts Awards, 15 Rome Prizes, 26 Guggenheim Fellowships, 3 MacArthur Fellowships, 9 Chrysler Design Awards, 3 Emmy Awards, a Tony, a Grammy, a Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, and 3 Thomas Jefferson Awards for Public Architecture.

<doc id="275355" wikidata="Q204299" url="?curid=275355" title="Frances McDormand">
<text>Frances Louise McDormand (born Cynthia Ann Smith; June 23, 1957) is an American actress and producer. In a career spanning over four decades, she has gained acclaim for her roles in small-budget independent films. McDormand has received numerous accolades, including four Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and one Tony Award, making her one of the few performers to achieve the &quot;Triple Crown of Acting&quot;. Additionally, she has received three BAFTA Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. McDormand&#x27;s worldwide box office gross exceeds $2.2 billion.

McDormand has been married to Joel Coen of the Coen brothers since 1984. She has appeared in a number of their films, including &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984), &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001), &quot;Burn After Reading&quot; (2008), and &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; (2016). McDormand won three Academy Awards for Best Actress for playing a pregnant police chief in &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), a grieving mother seeking vengeance in &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; (2017), and a widowed nomad in &quot;Nomadland&quot; (2020). For producing the latter, she was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Picture, making her the first person to win Academy Awards both as producer and performer for the same film. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her roles in &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000), and &quot;North Country&quot; (2005). McDormand is the second woman to win Best Actress three times (after Katharine Hepburn), and the seventh performer to win three acting Oscars.

On television, McDormand produced and starred as the titular protagonist in the HBO miniseries &quot;Olive Kitteridge&quot; (2014), which won her the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. She had previously been nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Television Movie for her work in the Showtime film &quot;Hidden in America&quot; (1996). On stage, McDormand made her Broadway debut in a revival of &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; (1984). She went on to win the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as a troubled single mother in &quot;Good People&quot; (2011). She was previously nominated for her performance as Stella Kowalski in the 1988 revival of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

==Early life==
McDormand was born Cynthia Ann Smith on June 23, 1957, in Gibson City, Illinois. She was adopted at one and a half years of age by Noreen (Nickelson) and Vernon McDormand and renamed Frances Louise McDormand. Her adoptive mother was a nurse and receptionist while her adoptive father was a Disciples of Christ pastor; both were originally from Canada. McDormand has said that her biological mother—whom she has proudly described, along with herself, as &quot;white trash&quot;—may have been one of the parishioners at Vernon&#x27;s church. She has a sister, Dorothy A. &quot;Dot&quot; McDormand, who is an ordained Disciples of Christ minister and chaplain, as well as a brother, Kenneth, both of whom also were adopted by the McDormands, who had no biological children.

Because McDormand&#x27;s father specialized in restoring congregations, he frequently moved their family, and they lived in several small towns in Illinois, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, before settling in Monessen, Pennsylvania, where McDormand graduated from Monessen High School in 1975. She attended Bethany College in West Virginia, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater in 1979. In 1982, she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Yale School of Drama. She was a roommate of actress Holly Hunter while living in New York City.

==Career==

McDormand is ascendant.&quot; In his review of &quot;Nomadland&quot; (2020), film critic Leonard Maltin refers to McDormand as &quot;one of the finest actresses on the planet,&quot; stating &quot;because [Fern] is played by McDormand, there is no better way to establish a connection between her and us in the audience.

<text>The Peshtigo fire was a large forest fire on October 8, 1871, in northeastern Wisconsin, United States, including much of the southern half of the Door Peninsula and adjacent parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The largest community in the affected area was Peshtigo, Wisconsin, which had a population of approximately 1,700 residents. The fire burned about and is the deadliest wildfire in recorded history, with the number of deaths estimated between 1,500 and 2,500. The exact number of deaths is debated. Data from mass graves, both those already exhumed and those still being discovered, show that the death toll of the blaze was most likely greater than the 1889 Johnstown flood death toll of 2,200 people or more.

Occurring on the same day as the more famous Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo fire has been largely forgotten, even though it killed five times as many people.

Nonetheless, several cities in Michigan, including Holland and Manistee (across Lake Michigan from Peshtigo) and Port Huron (at the southern end of Lake Huron), also had major fires on the same day. These fires, along with many other fires of the 19th century had the same basic causes: small fires coupled with unusually dry weather.
==Firestorm==
Slash-and-burn land management was a common way to clear forest for farming and railroad construction. On the day of the Peshtigo fire, an eastward-moving cold front increased the wind speed and several slash-and-burn fires merged.

A firestorm ensued. In the words of Gess and Lutz, in a firestorm &quot;superheated flames of at least 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit ... advance on winds of 110 miles per hour or stronger. The diameter of such a fire ranges from one thousand to ten thousand feet ... When a firestorm erupts in a forest, it is a blowup, nature&#x27;s nuclear explosion ... &quot;

By the time it was over, between 1.2 and 1.5 million acres of land had been burned. In addition to Peshtigo, 16 other communities were destroyed in the fire.

The value of the property and forest that was destroyed in the fire was estimated to be about $5 million US (about $ in 2025 dollars). Additionally, 2,000,000 trees, saplings, and animals perished in the fire; this had a devastating economic impact on the area as well.

An accurate death toll has never been determined because all local records were destroyed in the fire. Estimates vary from 1,200 to 2,400 deaths.

The 1873 Report to the Wisconsin Legislature listed 1,182 names of dead or missing residents. In 1870, the Town of Peshtigo had 1,749 residents. More than 350 bodies were buried in a mass grave, as there was no one left to identify them. 

The Rev. Peter Pernin, in his eyewitness account, states that the prolonged drought at that time combined with the factor of human carelessness were omens of the horrible disaster. He also notes how the fire seemed to jump across the Peshtigo River using the bridges and upward air drafts and burn both sides of the town.

Other survivors reported that the firestorm generated a fire whirl (described as a tornado) that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many citizens escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water. Some drowned while others succumbed to hypothermia in the frigid river. In one account, a man slit the throats of all his children to spare them from an agonizing death.

At the same time, another fire burned parts of the Door Peninsula; because of the coincidence, some incorrectly assumed that the Peshtigo fire had jumped across the waters of Green Bay into the Door County regions. However, the fire did not jump across the bay. Most likely, the firestorm spread and created a new ground fire in New Franken which then spread and burned everything northward up until Sturgeon Bay.

==Comet hypothesis==
Speculation since 1883 has suggested that the start of the Peshtigo and Chicago fires on the same day was not coincidental, but that all the major fires in Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin that day were caused by impact of fragments from Biela&#x27;s Comet. This hypothesis was revived in a 1985 book, reviewed in a 1997 documentary, and investigated in a 2004 paper published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Certain behaviors of the Chicago and Peshtigo fires were cited to support the idea of an extraterrestrial cause, such as blue flames (thought to be cometary gases burning) in the basements of houses. However, modern fire theory indicates that the blue color was most likely a product of burning carbon monoxide in the poorly ventilated basements. Additionally, scientists with expertise in the field pointed out that there has never been a credible report of a fire being started by a meteorite.

In any event, no external source of ignition was needed. There were already numerous small fires burning in the area as part of land-clearing operations and similar activities after a tinder-dry summer. All that was necessary to trigger the firestorm, plus the other large fires in the Midwest, was a strong wind from the weather front which had moved in that evening.

==Legacy and aftermath ==
The wildfire remains the deadliest in the history of the United States.

William B. Ogden, a politician and owner of the factories in Peshtigo, returned to rebuild the town. However, progress was slow and many buildings, including the woodenware factory, never reopened. Today, Peshtigo has roughly 3,500 residents.

The Peshtigo Fire Museum, just west of U.S. Highway 41, has a small collection of fire artifacts, first-person accounts, and a graveyard dedicated to victims of the tragedy. A memorial commemorating the fire was dedicated on October 8, 2012, at the bridge over the Peshtigo River.

The Peshtigo Fire Cemetery was entered into the National Register of Historic Places.

The National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, a Marian shrine in Champion, was established at the site of a chapel where Sister Adele Brise and others sheltered from the fire and survived. According to Sister Adele, in October 1859, she had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary with a warning, saying &quot;If they do not convert and do penance, my Son will be obliged to punish them.&quot; Twelve years later, the fire erupted and many people flocked to the church for safety. The people prayed the rosary, and hours later rain came, which put out the fire. Some of the very few things that survived the Peshtigo Fire were the convent, school, and chapel and five acres of land that had been consecrated to the Virgin Mary. The only animals that survived were those that were brought to the chapel grounds. Following the fire, people had great faith in the chapel and the Virgin Mary because they believe that she had saved them. In the following years, it was claimed that miracles occurred at the chapel. In one account, a blind girl went to the chapel to pray and came out able to see; however, none of these stories have ever been reliably documented.

Tornado Memorial County Park is located on the site of the former community of Williamsonville, a small village in Door County, and is named for the fire whirl which occurred there. Out of 76 residents, only 19 survived, and Williamsonville was never rebuilt.

The combination of topography, geography, wind conditions,and ignition sources that led to the fire is known as the &quot;Peshtigo paradigm&quot;. The American and British militaries studied the fire during World War II to learn how to recreate firestorms during bombing campaigns against cities in Germany and Japan. Denise Gess, co-author of &quot;Firestorm at Peshtigo&quot;, said, &quot;They actually made a &#x27;demo&#x27; first, a little scale model of wooden buildings, and studied how you would drop bombs until it created a firestorm. Something that devastating and that hot.&quot;

Rutkow (2012) writes that the event prompted almost no change to the practices of the lumber industry or the way settlers approached life in forests. He notes that in the following decades, the rate of industrial logging increased and the amount of forest fires increased throughout the country, with Wisconsin itself experiencing major fires in 1880, 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931, and 1936. The loss of half a million acres a year was not uncommon.

==Depiction in media ==
The Peshtigo Fire is discussed in Season 1, Episode 8, of the television series &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; when downstairs character Jack is discovered putting flowers on the grave of his mother, who died in the tragedy.

<text>The Common Open Policy Service (COPS) Protocol is part of the internet protocol suite as defined by the . COPS specifies a simple client/server model for supporting policy control over quality of service (QoS) signaling protocols (e.g. RSVP). Policies are stored on servers, and acted upon by Policy Decision Points (PDP), and are enforced on clients, also known as Policy Enforcement Points (PEP). There are two models of COPS: The Outsourcing Model and the Provisioning Model, considered from the view of the client or PEP.

The Outsourcing Model is the simplest COPS implementation. In this model, all policies are stored at the PDP. Whenever the PEP needs to make a decision, it sends all relevant information to the PDP. The PDP analyzes the information, makes the decision, and relays it to the PEP. The PEP then simply enforces the decision.

In the Provisioning Model, see COPS Usage for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), the PEP reports its decision-making capabilities to the PDP. The PDP then downloads relevant policies on to the PEP. The PEP can then make its own decisions based on these policies. The Provisioning Model uses the Policy Information Base as a repository of the policies.

<text>The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women is a polemical work by the Scottish reformer John Knox, published in 1558. It attacks female monarchs, arguing that rule by women is contrary to the Bible.

==Title==
The title employs certain words in spellings and senses that are now archaic. &quot;Monstruous&quot; (from Latin &quot;&quot;) means &quot;unnatural&quot;; &quot;regiment&quot; (Late Latin &quot;regimentum&quot; or &quot;regimen&quot;) means &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;government&quot;. The title is frequently found with the spelling slightly modernised, e.g. &quot;monstrous regiment&quot; or &quot;monstrous regimen&quot;. It is clear however that the use of &quot;regimen[t]&quot; meant &quot;rule&quot; and should not be confused with &quot;regiment&quot; as in a section of an armed force.

The title appears in all capitals, except for the last four words; in accordance with 16th-century orthographical norms, capitalized &quot;trumpet&quot; and &quot;monstruous&quot; are written TRVMPET and MONSTRVOVS.

== Historical context ==
John Knox was a Scottish Protestant preacher and notary born in 1514 who was involved in some of the most contentious religious and political debates of the day. Exiled from Scotland for his evangelism by the Catholic government of Mary of Guise (mother of and regent for the child monarch Mary, Queen of Scots), he was allowed to preach in Northern England starting in 1549, which at the time was under the Protestant regime of King Edward VI. His preaching built Knox a congregation of followers who stayed loyal to him even after he had to flee to the Continent after the accession of the Catholic Mary Tudor to the English throne. Knox believed that he was an authority on religious doctrine and frequently described himself as &quot;watchman&quot; , drawing similarities between his life and that of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Jehu and Daniel. He saw his duty as to &quot;blow his master&#x27;s trumpet&quot;. But his views were not popular with Mary Tudor, the new Catholic monarch, so in 1554 Knox fled to mainland Europe.

At the time, both Scotland and England were governed by female leaders, both of whom were Catholic. While in Europe, Knox discussed this question of gynarchy with John Calvin and Heinrich Bullinger. Knox believed that gynarchy was contrary to the natural order of things, although Calvin and Bullinger believed it was acceptable for women to be rulers when the situation demanded.

While in Europe, Knox was summoned back to Scotland to a hearing to be tried for heresy. However Mary, Queen of Scots cancelled the hearing and in 1557, he was invited back to Scotland to resume his preaching. Upon his arrival at Dieppe he learned that the invitation had been cancelled. While waiting in Dieppe, the frustrated Knox anonymously wrote &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;. Unlike his other publications, Knox published the final version of &quot;The First Blast&quot; without consulting his exiled congregation and in 1558 he published it with the help of Jean Crespin.

==Content==
The bulk of &quot;The First Blast&quot; contained Knox&#x27;s counterarguments to Calvin&#x27;s viewpoints on gynarchy that they had discussed previously. While discussing gynarchy in general, Knox&#x27;s target was mainly Queen Mary I.

Knox, a staunch Protestant Reformer, opposed the Catholic queens on religious grounds, and used them as examples to argue against female rule over men generally. Building on his premise that, according to Knox&#x27;s understanding of the Bible, &quot;God, by the order of his creation, has [deprived] woman of authority and dominion&quot; and from history that &quot;man has seen, proved, and pronounced just causes why it should be&quot;, he argued the following with regard to the specific role of women bearing authority:

Knox had three primary sections in &quot;The First Blast&quot;. First, that gynarchy was repugnant to Nature&#x27;; second, &#x27;a contumlie to God&#x27;; and finally, &#x27;the subversion of good order.

Knox believed that when a female ruled in society, it went against the natural order of things. He further went on to say that it was a virtue from God for women to serve men. Knox thought that civil obedience was a prerequisite for heaven and Mary was not in line with the civil obedience. Although there were exceptions to this order, Knox believed that God was the only one who could make those exceptions.

Knox appealed to the common belief that women were supposed to come after men because Eve came after (and from) Adam. Furthermore, God&#x27;s anger against Eve for taking the forbidden fruit had continued and all women were therefore punished by being subjected to men.

In his analysis of the Creation, Knox furthered his argument by stating that women were created in the image of God &quot;only with respect to creatures, not with respect to man&quot;. Knox believed that men were a superior reflection of God and women were an inferior reflection.

&quot;The First Blast&quot; contained four main counterarguments to John Calvin&#x27;s arguments. First, Knox argued that while God had given authority to biblical female leaders, Deborah and Huldah, God had not given that authority to any female in the 16th century. Elaborating, Knox stated that the only similarity Queen Mary had with Deborah and Huldah was their gender. This was not sufficient to Knox. Furthermore, Deborah and Huldah did not claim the right to pass on their authority, but the queens did.

One of Calvin&#x27;s arguments was that gynarchy was acceptable since Moses had sanctioned the daughters of Zelophehad to receive an inheritance. Knox refuted this second point in &quot;The First Blast&quot; by pointing out that receiving an inheritance was not equivalent to gaining a civil office. The daughters were also required to marry within their tribe while Mary I had married Philip II of Spain.

Calvin had told Knox that Mary I&#x27;s rule was sanctioned because parliament and the general public had agreed to it. Knox countered this in &quot;The First Blast&quot; by stating that it did not matter if man agreed to the rule if God did not agree to it as well.

The fourth point that Knox disagreed with Calvin on was accepting of gynarchy because it was a national custom. Knox conversely believed that Biblical authority and God&#x27;s will made Calvin&#x27;s argument invalid.

&quot;The First Blast&quot; concluded by using a biblical metaphor to call the nobility to action and remove the queen from the throne. In the Bible, Jehoiada, representing Knox, had instructed the rulers of the people to depose Athaliah, who represented Mary I. The Jews then executed the high priest of Baal, who represented Stephen Gardiner. It was clear that Knox was calling for the removal of Queen Mary I. He may have even been demanding that she be executed.

While many Christians in the 16th century believed it was their Christian duty to always follow their monarch, Knox believed it was worse for a Christian to follow a ruler that was evil. He claimed that, if needed, a rebellion should take place to dethrone her. Many people in Scotland agreed with Knox that it was not natural for women to rule but they did not agree with his belief that the queens should be replaced. Because of Knox&#x27;s bold call to action, his contemporaries began to consider Knox as a revolutionary.

== Aftereffects ==
Soon after publishing &quot;The First Blast,&quot; Knox continued to write fervently. Prior to August 1558, he wrote three items which supplemented &quot;The First Blast.&quot; He wrote to Mary of Guise to compel her to support Protestantism and to convince her to let him regain his right to preach. He wrote to the nobility to convince them of their duty to rise up against the queen. And he wrote to the people of Scotland to convince them of the need for reform.

Knox intended to write a &quot;Second Blast&quot; and a &quot;Third Blast&quot;, but after seeing how people responded to the &quot;First&quot;, neither ever became reality.

His polemic against female rulers had negative consequences for him when Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as Queen of England; Elizabeth was a supporter of the Protestant cause, but took offence at Knox&#x27;s words about female sovereigns. Her opposition to him personally became an obstacle to Knox&#x27;s direct involvement with the Protestant cause in England after 1559. She blamed him and the city of Geneva for permitting &quot;The First Blast&quot; to be published. Members of the Genevan congregation were searched, persecuted, and exiled. In 1558, the queen prohibited &quot;importing of heretical and seditious books&quot; into England. After Knox revealed himself as the author of &quot;The First Blast&quot;, through a letter to the queen, he was refused entrance to England. Despite Knox&#x27;s efforts to keep the blame for &quot;The First Blast&quot; on himself, his followers and other Protestants were punished.

In a letter to Anna Locke on 6 April 1569, John Knox said, &quot;To me it is written that my First Blast hath blown from me all my friends in England.&quot; Knox ended his letter, though, by saying that he stood by what he had said. Through it all, Knox continued to see himself as a prophet and believe that he needed to still declare God&#x27;s words.

When Mary of Guise died in 1560, Knox wrote that Mary&#x27;s unpleasant death and the deaths of her sons and husband were a divine judgement that would have been prevented if she had listened to the words in &quot;The First Blast&quot;.

== Knox&#x27;s contemporaries ==
Knox was not the only person to write against gynarchy. Two other main publications were also written, one by Christopher Goodman and the other by Anthony Gilby. Unlike Knox whose argument hinged on the premise of gender, Gilby and Goodman&#x27;s arguments were rooted in Mary I being a Catholic. Others individuals including Jean Bodin, George Buchanan, Francois Hotman, and Montaigne also agreed with Knox, but their works were less known.

Goodman relied on some of Knox&#x27;s ideas in his publication &quot;How Superior Powers Oght to be Obeyd&quot;. He agreed that female rule was against God&#x27;s will and natural law. After the publication of Goodman&#x27;s and Knox works, their friendship increased. But, while Goodman eventually rescinded his words about women rulers, Knox never did.

On the other hand, many of Knox&#x27;s contemporaries disagreed with his stance. In response to &quot;The First Blast,&quot; John Aylmer, an exiled English Protestant, wrote then published &quot;An Harborowe for Faithful and Trewe Subjectes Agaynst the Late Blowne Blaste, Concerninge the Government of Wemen&quot; on 26 April 1559. While Knox believed that the Bible held absolute authority on everything, including politics, Alymer disagreed. He believed that the narratives in the Bible were not always God&#x27;s way of explaining right and wrong but were sometimes historical expositions only. Aylmer also argued that what Knox called &quot;monstrous&quot; was actually just &quot;uncommon&quot;. This was portrayed by pointing out that although it was uncommon for a woman to give birth to twins, it was not monstrous.

Matthew Parker, John Foxe, Laurence Humphrey, Edmund Spenser, and John Lesley also opposed Knox&#x27;s views in &quot;The First Blast&quot; and John Calvin and Theodore Beza banned it from being sold.

== Later academic assessment ==
Despite his polemic against gynarchy in &quot;The First Blast&quot;, modern scholars of Knox have defended him against accusations of misogyny.

As Richard Lee Greaves, a professor of History at Florida State University, said, &quot;John Knox has gained a certain degree of notoriety in the popular mind as an antifeminist because of his attack on female sovereigns in &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot; (1558). Yet his attack was by no means original, for similar views were propounded in the sixteenth century by diverse writers.&quot;

Susan M. Felch, director of Calvin Center for Christian Scholarship and a Professor of English, believed that Knox was not misogynistic but just passionate about maintaining the natural order of things. Felch further stated that while Knox was writing &quot;The First Blast&quot; he was writing letters to women which were &quot;remarkably free of gendered rhetoric&quot;. Knox addressed his female friends as partners in the fight against sin. Accompanied with expressions of non-romantic love, Knox gave spiritual advice to them but also believed that women could make their own spiritual decisions and encouraged them to do so. Felch believed that Knox did not think of Mary I as a lesser being, but believed that her &quot;decision&quot; to take the throne was sinful.

Richard G. Kyle also agreed that Knox could not have been misogynistic because, besides &quot;The First Blast&quot;, Knox&#x27;s writing did not deride or ridicule women.

A. Daniel Frankforter, a history professor at Penn State, pointed to times when Knox complimented women as evidence for Knox&#x27;s non-misogynistic beliefs. He cited, for example, the time when Knox told his mother-in-law that she was a mirror to his soul. Frankforter also believed that while Knox&#x27;s rhetoric appears &quot;virulent&quot; and &quot;misogynistic&quot;, it was likely no worse than everyone else in his time.

Rosalind K. Marshall, a historian and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, believed that the tone in &quot;The First Blast&quot; was defensive not aggressive. She further claimed that &quot;The First Blast&quot; was not meant as an accusation against all women but just the female monarchs. Additionally, Marshall believed that Knox was in a &quot;religious fervour&quot; when he wrote &quot;The First Blast&quot; and would not have normally written such cruel things when he held women in such high esteem.

Jane E. Dawson, a professor of Reformation History at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out that Knox did not always have antagonism toward Mary Queen of Scots since they previously worked well together. She also agreed that the high majority of Knox&#x27;s writings were uplifting instead of condemning. She contests that Knox lashed out at Mary I because he felt isolated and persecuted.

==Legacy==
Around the 20th century, the work&#x27;s title became a popular ironic cliché in feminist literature and art. Examples include the novels &quot;Regiment of Women&quot; (1917), &quot;A Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot; (1995), and &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; (2003), as well as the feminist British theatre troupe, the Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company.

<doc id="275376" wikidata="Q3500081" url="?curid=275376" title="Strata (novel)">
<text>Strata is a 1981 science fiction comedy novel by English writer Sir Terry Pratchett. It is one of Pratchett&#x27;s first novels and among the few science fiction novels he wrote, along with &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;, &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot;, &quot;The Nome Trilogy&quot; and the co-authored The Long Earth.

Although &quot;Strata&quot; may take place in a different fictional universe and is classed more science fiction than fantasy, it could be said to be a kind of precursor to the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, as it also features a flat Earth similar to the Discworld. It has been called a &quot;pre-consideration&quot; of Discworld, though the plot and characters are modelled on a parody of the novel &quot;Ringworld&quot; by Larry Niven.

==Plot summary==

Kin Arad is a human planetary engineer working for &quot;the Company&quot;, a human organisation that manufactures habitable planets using techniques and equipment salvaged from an extinct alien race, the &quot;Spindle Kings&quot;, who excelled at terraforming.

The express purpose of the Company&#x27;s planet-manufacturing business is to create dispersed branches of humanity, diverse enough to ensure the whole species&#x27; survival for eternity. The Earth&#x27;s population in the past has been decimated due to the lethal &quot;Mindquakes&quot;, epidemic mass deaths caused by too much homogeneity among the populace.

All planets built by the Company are carefully crafted with artificial strata containing synthetic fossils, indistinguishable from the real thing. On occasion, however, mischievous Company employees attempt to place anomalous objects in the strata as practical jokes, like running shoes and other out-of-place artifacts, hoping to raise confusion among future archaeologists when the planets&#x27; beginnings have been long forgotten. However the Company forbids this, and secretly monitors the generated strata in order to detect embedded jokes, fearing such actions may cause the collapse of entire civilizations when the artifacts are eventually unearthed.

Kin and two aliens are recruited by the mysterious Jago Jalo to join an expedition. One alien is a paranoid, four-armed, frog-like, muscular &quot;kung&quot; named Marco. The other alien is a bear-like &quot;shand&quot;, historian and linguist nicknamed Silver. Jago Jalo is a human who returned from a relativistic journey he embarked on more than a thousand years ago, where he made a stunning discovery: A flat Earth.

When the team rendezvous with Jago Jalo on the kung homeworld, the violent Jalo unexpectedly has a heart attack and dies. Kin Arad is shocked by the large store of weapons on-board Jalo&#x27;s spaceship, and has misgivings about the expedition; Silver and Marco, however, see the possibility of reaping great technological rewards and launch the vessel on autopilot.

When the expedition arrives at Jalo&#x27;s pre-programmed coordinates, they find a flattened version of the medieval Eastern hemisphere of the Earth they had originally departed from, before their disturbing rendezvous with Jalo. Clearly artificial, the disc rotates around its hub, and is contained inside a gigantic hollow sphere with tiny artificial &quot;stars&quot; affixed to the interior, augmented with a small meandering artificial sun, moon, and fake planets revolving around it.

Their ship is hit by one of the &quot;planets&quot; wandering on the interior of the sphere, so Kin, Marco, and Silver are forced to abandon ship. They land on the flat planet with the help of their &quot;lift-belt&quot; equipped suits, while their ship crashes. A return from the flat world now seems impossible, but hoping for assistance from the disc&#x27;s mysterious builders, Kin, Marco, and Silver set off towards a structure they had spotted at the disc&#x27;s hub. It is the only thing on the flat &quot;Earth&quot; which does not match the geography of the spherical Earth they left.

En route, the team encounter the superstitious Medieval inhabitants of the disc, who believe the end of the world is near, due to increasingly chaotic climate (caused by the disc&#x27;s machinery breaking down), the recent disappearance of one of their planets, and the general devastation caused by the ship&#x27;s crash. The three travelers also discover a number of other differences.

What Kin Arad knows as &quot;Reme&quot; is called &quot;Rome&quot; on the disc, and there is a strange &quot;Christos cult&quot; that is completely unfamiliar to Kin. Also, Venus is conspicuously lacking its giant (lunar-sized) moon &quot;Adonis&quot;, which dominates the sunset sky on the Earth Kin Arad came from, which was formative in leading humanity to an early heliocentric world view.

Since only the Eastern hemisphere of Earth is represented, the continent of America is completely missing, so Kin, Marco, and Silver rescue a party of Vikings in the process of searching for Vinland, when their ship is about to sail over the edge of the world.

The flat world is apparently an extremely old and sophisticated automated system. In addition, there are real magical creatures and objects on the disc – Demons, and magic purses, and flying carpets – all of which, the travelers deduce, are themselves highly advanced, sophisticated technological constructs, just like the disc.

The travelers eventually reach the structure at the hub and make contact with the disc’s automated control-systems. They are told that (aside from the recent damage) the sheer build-up of entropy in the old machinery has exceeded the capacity of its advanced robotic maintenance. Catastrophic failure threatens the disc’s further existence. The machines offer to exchange their advanced technology for the construction of a real (spherical) planet as a refuge for the disc &quot;Earth&quot; inhabitants. Kin, the planetary engineer, agrees. She is excited about the massive task at hand; just like the parallel character Louis Wu in &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Kin is over two hundred years old, and in danger of becoming tired of life.

The implication of the denouement is that the conventional planet Kin Arad will build is in fact the readers&#x27; own &quot;Earth&quot;. By the end of the story, Kin comes to the further suspicion that the builders of the flat world constructed the whole universe. The evidence of previous races would then be hoaxes, and the flat world itself would be a prank by the universe’s construction crew – analogous to the artificial strata Kin and the Company manufacture, and the occasional prankster employees inserting hoaxes in the artificial strata.

==Interpretation==
The history of the protagonists&#x27; home-planet &quot;Earth&quot; in &quot;Strata&quot; unfolded very differently from the readers&#x27; Earth:
* North America is named Valhalla, and was colonised in the first millennium A.D. by Vikings, led by Leif Ericson.
* The Roman Empire is known as Reme instead, after the other twin in the story of Romulus and Remus.
* Venus is orbited by a moon similar to Earth&#x27;s.
* None of the Abrahamic religions ever developed in its history (a mixture of Buddhism and folk religion seems to have predominated, punctuated by an assortment of flash-in-the-pan religious cults).
* Humans are much more developed in the field of space travel and have met several other intelligent species, such as the tall, frog-like kungs, and the bear-like shandi.

The book implies that the reason for the historical discrepancies is that the readers&#x27; &quot;Earth&quot; is actually the replacement world created by Kin Arad for the inhabitants of the malfunctioning disc &quot;Earth&quot;, to which the protagonists of the book travel early in the story. While the history and features of the flat &quot;Earth&quot; in &quot;Strata&quot; clearly is not the one we are familiar with, the history of the flat Earth is consistent with our own, up to the point where the expedition arrives.

Humanity appears to be merely the latest of a long series of intelligent species who have evolved, altered the universe to better suit themselves, and then died out before the next species arose and started the cycle all over again. Before humans, there were the &quot;Great Spindle Kings&quot;, a race of acutely claustrophobic telepaths, who could live only a few hundred per planet and therefore built entire worlds from scratch to accommodate their population. Before them were the Wheelers, who were themselves preceded by increasingly alien races extending all the way back to the Big Bang.

All of what is known about the intelligent species who have lived before humans is revealed to be incorrect near the end of the book, when the Disc&#x27;s computer system (built by the universe&#x27;s actual creators) reveals to Kin that the entire universe is only and that evidence and remains of long dead civilizations were fabricated by the universe&#x27;s creators to make the universe appear older than it is (much like the Company-fabricated prehistoric fossils on their created worlds to make them appear older than they really were). Finally, the fact that the computer systems on the disc &quot;Earth&quot; need humans, implies that the universe was itself created by humans as a place for themselves to live.

<text>The Dark Side of the Sun is a science fiction novel by Terry Pratchett, first published in 1976.

It is similar to the work of Isaac Asimov. According to Don D&#x27;Ammassa, both this and Pratchett&#x27;s 1981 sci-fi novel &quot;Strata&quot; spoof parts of Larry Niven&#x27;s Ringworld. The holiday of Hogswatch, which appears in the Discworld books, is celebrated by the characters in &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;.

== Overview ==
The story is set in a portion of the galaxy populated by fifty-two different sentient species. All of these species, humanity among them, have evolved in the last five million years, and all of them have evolved in a spherical volume of space less than two hundred light-years across centred on Wolf 429. The rest of the galaxy is sterile as far as anybody can tell.

Scattered irregularly across this &quot;life-bubble&quot; are ancient artefacts of a mysterious race called the Jokers, who apparently became extinct long before any of the current races arose. These artefacts are usually astounding feats of engineering (such as a pair of stars shaped into rings and joined like links in a chain), but leave no hints about the Jokers&#x27; physical form or day-to-day life. The only piece of translatable Joker text is a poem, which cryptically states that they have gone to their new home, which &quot;lies at the dark side of the sun&quot;.

== Plot ==
Dominickdaniel &quot;Dom&quot; Sabalos IV is the son of a prodigy of probability math, a science able to predict anything apart from anything to do with the Jokers, and the first person to have had his life fully quantified using p-math. His father, before being mysteriously assassinated, predicted that Dom too would be killed, on the day of his investiture as chairman of his home planet of Widdershins.

However, not having been told of his father&#x27;s prediction, and against incalculably distant odds, Dom survives the assassination attempt. When the recording of his father&#x27;s prediction is played back, a time delay added specifically for this unlikely eventuality plays a little more of the recording, in which his father makes a further prediction: that Dom will discover the Jokers&#x27; homeworld.

Dom sets out, with Hrsh-Hgn (his tutor, a swamp-dwelling &quot;phnobe&quot;), Isaac (his robot, equipped with &quot;Man-Friday subcircuitry&quot;) and Ig (his pet swamp &quot;ig&quot;) in tow, on a picaresque adventure to find the Jokers&#x27; world. He visits many corners of the &quot;life-bubble&quot;, encountering Joker artifacts, his god-father, who is a sentient planet, and the sexless, octopoid &quot;Creapii&quot;, among many other weird and diverse aliens and planets. At the same time he finds himself surviving – at increasingly improbable odds – numerous assassination attempts by a mysterious conspiracy which has long worked to prevent anybody from locating the Jokers, assassinating anybody deemed by p-math having a chance of doing so.

==Characters==

*Dom Sabalos - chairman of the Board of Directors of Widdershins.
*Joan Sabalos - Dom&#x27;s grandmother.
*Vian Sabalos - Dom&#x27;s mother, widow of

The book is set in the far future. No current date is given, although the dating system is &quot;A.S.&quot; (After Sadhim).

Widdershins is a planet orbiting the star CY Acquirii (a parody of CY Aquarii) settled by a joint party of phnobes and earth-humans. The planet is mostly water and marsh. Their wealth derives from both the chance discovery of &quot;pilac&quot;, a safe death-immunity drug and &quot;googoo&quot;, a fungal copier and regenerator of human tissue. The vegetation is blue.

<text>is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It is also known as . The origin of ikebana can be traced back to the ancient Japanese custom of erecting evergreen trees and decorating them with flowers as yorishiro () to invite the gods.

Later, flower arrangements were instead used to adorn the (alcove) of a traditional Japanese home.

 is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with for incense appreciation and for tea and the tea ceremony.

== Etymology ==
The term comes from the combination of the Japanese and . Possible translations include and .

== History ==


The pastime of viewing plants and appreciating flowers throughout the four seasons was established in Japan early on from the aristocracy. poetry anthologies such as the and from the Heian period (794–1185) included many poems on the topic of flowers. With the introduction of Buddhism, offering flowers at Buddhist altars became common. Although the lotus is widely used in India where Buddhism originated, in Japan other native flowers for each season were selected for this purpose.

For a long time the art of flower arranging had no meaning, and functioned as merely the placing in vases the flowers to be used as temple offerings and before ancestral shrines, without system or meaningful structure. The first flower arrangements were composed using a system were known as , meaning . A huge branch of pine or cryptomeria stood in the middle, with three or five seasonable flowers placed around it. These branches and stems were put in vases in upright positions without attempting artificial curves. Generally symmetrical in form, these arrangements appeared in religious pictures in the 14thcentury, as the first attempt to represent natural scenery. The large tree in the centre represented distant scenery, plum or cherry blossoms middle distance, and little flowering plants the foreground. The lines of these arrangements were known as centre and sub-centre.

Later on, among other types of Buddhist offerings, placing became popular in the Kamakura (1185–1333) and Nanboku-chō periods (1336–1392). Various Buddhist scriptures have been named after flowers such as the (Flower Garland Sutra) and (Lotus Sutra). The () depicts lotus being offered by a monkey in front of a frog mimicking the Buddha.

With the development of the architectural style starting in the Muromachi period (1336–1573), (scroll pictures) and containers could be suitable displayed as art objects in the , a precursor to the alcove, and the , two-levelled shelves. Also displayed in these spaces were flower arrangements in vases that influenced the interior decorations, which became simpler and more exquisite over time. This style of decoration was called . The set of three ceremonial objects at the Buddhist altar called consisted of candles lit in holders, a censer, and flowers in a vase. The flowers in the vase were arranged in the earliest style called or , and were composed of and . Recent historical research now indicates that the practice of derived from a combination of belief systems, including Buddhist, and the Shinto belief is most likely the origin of the Japanese practice of modern . Together, they form the basis for the original, purely Japanese derivation of the practice of .

The art of flower arranging developed with many schools only coming into existence at the end of the 15thcentury following a period of the civil war. The eighth , Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436–1490), was a patron of the arts and the greatest promoter of – tea ceremony – and , flower arrangement. Yoshimasa would later abdicate his position to devote his time to the arts, and developed concepts that would then go on to contribute to the formulation of rules in ; one of the most important being that flowers offered on all ceremonial occasions, and placed as offerings before the gods, should not be offered loosely, but should represent time and thought.

Yoshimasa&#x27;s contemporaries also contributed heavily to the development of flower arranging; the celebrated painter Sōami, a friend of Yoshimasa, conceived of the idea of representing the three elements of heaven, humans, and earth, from which grew the principles of arrangements used today in some ikebana schools. It was at Yoshimasa&#x27;s Silver Pavilion in Kyoto that received its greatest development, alongside the art of tea ceremony and , the incense ceremony.

Artists of the Kanō school, such as Sesshū Tōyō (1420–1506), Sesson, Kanō Masanobu, Kanō Motonobu (1476–1559), and Shugetsu of the 16thcentury, were lovers of nature, and advanced a step further in this period beyond a form of temple and room decoration, with greater consideration given to the natural beauty of a floral arrangement. At this time, was known as .

During the same time period, another form of flower arranging known as was developed; and are the two branches into which has been divided. Popularity of the two styles vacillated between these two for centuries. In the beginning, was stiff, formal, and more decorative style, while was simpler and more natural.

Although began to come into favour in the Higashiyama period, was still preferred, and did not truly gain popularity until the Momoyama period, about a hundred years after Ashikaga Yoshimasa. It was at this period that tea ceremony reached its highest development and strongly influenced , as a practitioner of tea was most probably also a follower of .

As a dependent of , branched off, gaining its independence and its own popularity in the 16thcentury for its freedom of line and natural beauty. Both styles, despite having originated in the Higashiyama period, reflect the time periods in which they gained popularity, with displaying the tastes of the Higashiyama period, and the tastes of the Momoyama period. lost some of its popularity during the Momoyama period, but in the first part of the Edo period (1603–1668) was revived, and became more popular than ever before. In the Higashiyama period, had been used only as room decorations on ceremonial occasions, but now was followed as a fine art and looked upon as an accomplishment and pastime of the upper classes. reached its greatest popularity during the Genroku era.

 has always been considered a dignified accomplishment. All of Japan&#x27;s most celebrated generals notably practised flower arranging, finding that it calmed their minds and made their decisions on the field of action clearer; notable military practitioners include Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan&#x27;s most famous generals.

Many works of various schools on were published in the centuries from the Ken&#x27;ei (1206–1207) to the Genroku (1668–1704) eras, all founded on Sōami&#x27;s idea of the three elements. A number of texts documenting also existed, though few contained directly instructional content; however, these books were fully illustrated, thus documenting the gradual progress of the art.

During the early Edo period (17th century), publications in Japan developed rapidly. Books about were published in succession. During this time, the was published, the oldest published manual. The was published in Kanbun 1 (1661). This was carefully written and instructive text, with rules and principles detailed in full, and was the second publication of texts in the Edo period after the . Although the text is similar to the contents of commentaries of the Muromachi period, the illustrations showed how to enjoy , which had spread from monks to warriors and further on to townspeople. The was the oldest published work on in Kanbun 12 (1672). The , published in Tenna 3 (1683), was the most famous manual. The came out Jōkyō 5 (1688).

In the Ken&#x27;ei era, was simple and natural, with no extreme curves in the arrangement, but in the Genroku era, the lines became complicated and the forms pattern-like, following general trends of high artistic development and expression within that period; during the Genroku period, all the fine arts were highly developed, above all pattern-printing for fabrics and decoration. In the latter part of the 17thcentury, Korin, the famous lacquer artist known for his exquisite designs, strongly influenced . In this period, the combination of a pattern or design with lines that followed the natural growth of the plant produced the most pleasing and graceful results.

It was in the latter part of the 17thcentury that was most practised and reached its highest degree of perfection as an art. Still, there were occasional departures into unnatural curves and artificial presentation styles that caused a shift, and the more naturalistic style of was again revived. Until then, only one branch of had been taught at a time, following the taste of the day, but now rival teachers in both and existed.

 reached its greatest popularity in the Genroku era. From this time on took the name of . In the Tenmei era (1781–1789), , or , advanced rapidly in favour and developed great beauty of line. The exponents of the art not only studied nature freely, but combined this knowledge with that of , developing the results of even further.

After the Tenmei era, a formal form of arrangement developed. This form has a fixed rule or model known as &quot;heaven, human, and earth&quot;. Is it known as .In the Mishō-ryū school, the form is called .

The most popular schools of today, including Ikenobō, Enshū-ryū, and Mishō-ryū, amongst others, adhere to some principles, but there are in Tokyo and Kyoto many masters of who teach the simpler forms of Ko-ryū, and Ko-Shin-ryū of the Genroku and Tenmei eras.

The oldest international organisation, Ikebana International, was founded in 1956; Princess Takamado is the honorary president.

== Practitioners ==

Followers and practitioners of ikebana, also referred to as , are known as . A teacher is called .

Noted Japanese practitioners include Junichi Kakizaki, Mokichi Okada, and Yuki Tsuji. At a March 2015 TEDx in Shimizu, Shizuoka, Tsuji elaborated on the relationship of to beauty.

After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan, noted practitioner Toshiro Kawase began posting images of his arrangements online every day in a project called &quot;One Day, One Flower.&quot;

Another practitioner is the Hollywood actress Marcia Gay Harden, who started when she was living in Japan as a child, and has published a book on with her own works. Her mother, Beverly Harden, was a practitioner of the Sōgetsu school. She later became also president of the Ikebana International Washington, DC chapter.

== Schools ==
Mary Averill (1913) gives an overview of the numerous schools of . A school is normally headed by an , oftentimes passed down within a family from one generation to the next. The oldest of these schools, Ikenobō goes back to the 8th century (Heian period). This school marks its beginnings from the construction of the Rokkaku-dō in Kyoto, the second oldest Buddhist temple in Japan, built in 587 by Prince Shōtoku, who had camped near a pond in what is now central Kyoto, and enshrined a small statue of her.

During the 13thcentury, Ono-no-Imoko, an official state emissary, brought the practice of placing Buddhist flowers on an altar from China. He became a priest at the temple and spent the rest of his days practising flower arranging. The original priests of the temple lived by the side of the pond, for which the Japanese word is , and the word , meaning priest, connected by the possessive particle , gives the word . The name &#x27;Ikenobō&#x27;, granted by the emperor, became attached to the priests there who specialised in altar arrangements.

Ikenobō is the only school that does not have the ending in its name, as it is considered the original school. The first systematised classical styles, including , started in the middle of the 15thcentury. The first students and teachers were Ikenobō Buddhist priests and members of the Buddhist community. As time passed, other schools emerged, styles changed, and became a custom among the whole of Japanese society.

== Theory ==

Since flower arrangement became popular with Buddhism, it was naturally imbued with Buddhist philosophy. The Buddhist desire to preserve life lies at the root of much of practice, and has created most of the rules of flower arrangement, controlling also the shapes of the flower vases, formed as to help to prolong the life of the flowers. Consideration of the vase as being something more than a mere holder of the flowers is also an important consideration. The surface of the water is always exposed, alongside the surface of the earth from which the grouping of flowers springs. This aids in creating the effect of representing a complete plant growing as nearly as possible in its natural conditions.

More than simply putting flowers in a container, is a disciplined art form in which nature and humanity are brought together. Contrary to the idea of a particoloured or multicoloured arrangement of blossoms, often emphasises other areas of the plant, such as its stems and leaves, and puts emphasis on shape, line, and form. Though is an expression of creativity, certain rules govern its form, such as the idea of good and evil fortune in the selection of material and form of the arrangement.

The concept of is the Japanese form of the language of flowers, wherein plants are given specific coded meanings, varying based on the colour of the flowers, the presence of thorns within the height of tall plants, the combination of flowers used in garlands and the different types of flowers themselves, amongst other factors. For instance, the colours of some flowers are considered unlucky. Red flowers, which are used at funerals, are undesirable for their morbid connotations, but also because red is supposed to suggest the red flames of a fire. An odd number of flowers is lucky, while even numbers are unlucky and therefore undesirable, and never used in flower arrangements. With odd numbers, symmetry and equal balance is avoided, a feature actually seldom found in nature, and which from the Japanese standpoint is never attractive in art of any description. These create a specific impression of nature, and convey the artist&#x27;s intention behind each arrangement is shown through a piece&#x27;s colour combinations, natural shapes, graceful lines, and the implied emotional meaning of the arrangement without the use of words. All flower arrangements given as gifts are given with the flowers in bud, so that the person to whom they are sent may have the pleasure of seeing them open, in contrast to the Western idea of flower arrangements, where the flowers are already in bloom before being given.

There is no occasion which cannot be suggested by the manner in which the flowers are arranged. For instance, leaving home can be announced by an unusual arrangement of flowers; auspicious materials, such as willow branches, are used to indicate hopes for a long and happy life, and are particularly used for arrangements used to mark a parting, with the length of the branch signifying a safe return from a long journey, particularly if a branch is made to form a complete circle. For a house-warming, white flowers are used, as they suggest water to quench a fire; traditional Japanese homes, being made almost exclusively of wood, were particularly susceptible to fire, with everything but the roof being flammable. To celebrate an inheritance, all kinds of evergreen plants or chrysanthemums may be used, or any flowers which are long-lived, to convey the idea that the wealth or possessions may remain forever. There are also appropriate arrangements for sad occasions. A flower arrangement made to mark a death is typically constructed of white flowers, with some dead leaves and branches, arranged to express peace.

Another common but not exclusive aspect present in is the employment of minimalism. Some arrangements may consist of only a minimal number of blooms interspersed among stalks and leaves. The structure of some Japanese flower arrangements is based on a scalene triangle delineated by three main points, usually twigs, considered in some schools to symbolise heaven, human, and earth, or sun, moon, and earth. Use of these terms is limited to certain schools and is not customary in more traditional schools. A notable exception is the traditional form, which follows other precepts. The container can be a key element of the composition, and various styles of pottery may be used in their construction. In some schools, the container is only regarded as a vessel to hold water, and should be subordinate to the arrangement.

The seasons are also expressed in flower arrangements, with flowers grouped differently according to the time of the year. For example, in March, when high winds prevail, the unusual curves of the branches convey the impression of strong winds. In summer, low, broad flower receptacles are used, where the visually predominant water produces a cooler and more refreshing arrangement than those of upright vases.

The spiritual aspect of is considered very important to its practitioners. Some practitioners feel silence is needed while constructing a flower arrangement, while others feel this is not necessary, though both sides commonly agree that flower arranging is a time to appreciate aspects of nature commonly overlooked in daily life. It is believed that practice of flower arranging leads a person to become more patient and tolerant of differences in nature and in life, providing relaxation in mind, body, and soul, and allowing a person to identify with beauty in all art forms.

Plants play an important role in the Japanese Shinto religion. are objects that divine spirits are summoned to. Evergreen plants such as are a traditional decoration of the New Year placed in pairs in front of homes to welcome ancestral spirits or of the harvest.

== Styles ==
 in the beginning was very simple, constructed from only a very few stems of flowers and evergreen branches. This first form of was called . Patterns and styles evolved, and by the late 15thcentury arrangements were common enough to be appreciated by ordinary people and not only by the imperial family and its retainers, styles of having changed during that time, transforming the practice into an art form with fixed instructions. Books were written about the art, being the oldest of these, covering the years 1443 to 1536. became a major part of traditional festivals, and exhibitions were occasionally held.

The first styles were characterised by a tall, upright central stem accompanied by two shorter stems. During the Momoyama period, 1560–1600, a number of splendid castles were constructed, with noblemen and royal retainers making large, decorative floral arrangements that were considered appropriate decoration for castles. Many beautiful arrangements were used as decoration for castles during the Momoyama period, and were also used for celebratory reasons.
* The ; style was developed as a Buddhist expression of the beauty of landscapes in nature. Key to this style are nine branches that represent elements of nature. One of arrangement styles is called .

When the tea ceremony emerged, another style was introduced for tea ceremony rooms called . This style is the opposite of the Momoyama style and emphasises rustic simplicity. is not considered a style of but is separate. The simplicity of in turn helped create the or style.
* is a non-structured design which led to the development of the or style. It is characterised by a tight bundle of stems that form a triangular three-branched asymmetrical arrangement that was considered classic. It is also known by the short form .
* style consists of only three main parts, known in some schools as (), (), and (). It is a simple style that is designed to show the beauty and uniqueness of the plant itself. Formalisation of the style for use in the Japanese alcove resulted in the formal style.
* In , flowers are arranged in a shallow vase or , compote vessel, or basket, and secured on a or pointed needle holders, also known as metal frogs.
* In the style, creative design of flower arranging is emphasised, with any material permissible for use, including non-flower materials. In the 20th century, with the advent of modernism, the three schools of partially gave way to what is commonly known in Japan as &quot;Free Style&quot;.
* Kyoto Ikebana artist Hayato Nishiyama says he enjoys designs with just a single flower, &quot;to help people concentrate, to help them focus on seeing the beauty of an individual.&quot;

== Vessels ==

The receptacles used in flower arranging come in a large variety. They are traditionally considered not only beautiful in form, material, and design but are made to suit the use to which they will be put, so that a flower can always be placed in an appropriate receptacle, and probably in one especially designed for that particular sort of flower.

The thing the Japanese most seek in a vase&#x27;s shape is what will best prolong the life of flowers. For this reason, vases are wide open at the mouth, for, unlike in Western flower arranging, they do not depend upon the vase itself to hold flowers in position, believing that the oxygen entering through the neck opening is as necessary to the plant as the oxygen it receives directly from the water; thus, the water remains sweet much longer than in small-necked vases.

There are many ideas connected with these receptacles. For instance, hanging vases came into use through the idea that flowers presented by an esteemed friend should not be placed where they could be looked down upon, so they were raised and hung. In hanging bamboo vases, the large, round surface on top is supposed to represent the moon, and the hole for the nail a star. The cut, or opening, below the top is called , the .

Besides offering variety in the form of receptacles, the low, flat vases, more used in summer than winter, make it possible to arrange plants of bulbous and water growth in natural positions.

As for the colour of the vases, the soft pastel shades are common, and bronze vases are especially popular. To the Japanese, the colour bronze seems most like mother earth, and therefore best suited to enhance the beauty of flowers.

Bamboo, in its simplicity of line and neutral colour, makes a charming vase, but one of solid bamboo is not practical in some countries outside of Japan, where the dryness of the weather causes it to split. Baskets made from bamboo reeds, with their soft brown shades, provide a pleasing contrast to the varied tints of the flowers, and are practical in any climate.

Not to be overlooked is the tiny hanging vase found in the simple peasant homesome curious root picked up at no cost and fashioned into a shape suitable to hold a single flower or vine. Such vases can be made with little effort by anyone and can find place nearly anywhere.

== In popular culture ==

* is taught in schools. It has also featured in manga, anime and been shown on television.
* In &quot;Magic-kyun! Renaissance&quot;, the main character Aigasaki Kohana practices , just like her mother before her.
* The manga &quot;Zig Zag&quot; focuses on a boy named Takaaki Asakura (nicknamed &quot;Taiyou&quot; (the sun)) and his affection for flowers.

<text>Soul Music is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the sixteenth book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, first published in 1994. Like many of Pratchett&#x27;s novels it introduces an element of modern society into the magical and vaguely late medieval, early modern world of the Discworld, in this case Rock and Roll music and stardom, with near disastrous consequences. It also introduces Susan Sto Helit, daughter of Mort and Ysabell and granddaughter of Death.

==Plot summary==
A young harpist, Imp Y Celyn from Llamedos (&quot;sod &#x27;em all&quot; spelled backwards, a reference to Dylan Thomas&#x27; &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;), comes to Ankh-Morpork in hopes of becoming famous. Unable to afford the Musicians Guild fees, he and fellow unlicensed musicians Lias Bluestone (a troll percussionist) and Glod Glodsson (a dwarf hornblower) form &quot;The Band with Rocks In&quot;, named after Lias&#x27; tuned rocks. When Imp&#x27;s harp is destroyed, he acquires a guitar from a mysterious shop, unaware that it contains the awareness of a primordial music that was responsible for bringing the universe into existence. Imp takes the new name &quot;Buddy&quot; (&quot;Imp Y Celyn&quot; literally means &quot;bud of holly&quot;), and Lias starts calling himself &quot;Cliff&quot;.

Meanwhile, Death is upset over the deaths of his adopted daughter Ysabell and her husband, his former apprentice Mort. Their daughter, Susan Sto Helit, was initially raised with an awareness of Death as her grandfather, but they later withheld the truth from her and she forgot about it. She attends boarding school in Quirm, and is content to avoid unpleasant conversations by using her unexplained ability to fade from others&#x27; awareness. When Death abandons his post for an impromptu sabbatical in an effort to forget the painful memories, the fabric of reality forces Susan to take on his duties and she begins to remember her past. She becomes aware of Buddy when he is scheduled to die in a riot while performing at the Mended Drum, but instead the crowd is overcome by the spirit of &quot;Music with Rocks In&quot;, which apparently has no musical merit for objective listeners not themselves possessed by it. After this, Buddy&#x27;s life is powered by the music instead of by his natural life force.

Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler becomes the Band&#x27;s manager. He hires the troll Asphalt as a roadie to accompany the band on its tour as he books them to play to increasingly larger crowds, all the while keeping them unaware of the large profits he is earning. Buddy becomes less and less like himself, and barely seems aware of his surroundings when he is not playing the guitar. Susan tries to protect him from the influence of the music; though she does not acknowledge it, she has developed feelings for him. Meanwhile, the music is affecting many of the people who have heard it, causing them to form their own bands and adopt behaviours associated with the fans of various musical movements on 20th Century Earth. The wizards of Unseen University are particularly affected by this phenomenon, though not Archchancellor Ridcully, who uses the newly invented device Hex and works with Susan in an effort to understand these events. Mr Clete, the murderous secretary of the Musicians Guild, becomes increasingly unhinged by his inability to stop the Band&#x27;s unauthorized activities (as they are protected by the music).

Buddy wants to perform a free concert at the music&#x27;s behest, and Dibbler agrees after realizing how much of a profit he can earn through merchandising and concessions. A large number of the copycat bands participate in the largest concert of all time, culminating in the Band with Rocks In&#x27;s performance. Buddy performs his own folk song on his harp, which Glod has had repaired, which briefly restores Imp&#x27;s natural personality. Afterwards, the band flees from their crazed fans, pursued by the Musicians Guild, Dibbler, Susan, and Death (who has been brought back to his senses by his servant Albert). The music intends to create an immortal legend by crashing the band&#x27;s coach into a gorge, with no survivors. Susan rescues them, but the music begins to alter the timeline so the band will have died. Death arrives and plays an &quot;empty chord&quot; on the guitar to stop the music, explaining that while he can stop it, only a musician like Buddy can restart it. The music agrees to allow Buddy to live in return for his playing a chord to restart it. Death then destroys the guitar.

A new timeline is created in which Clete was the only fatality, although Susan remains aware of the original course of events. She returns to school with a new self-assurance. The next day, she runs to reunite with Imp upon realizing that, in the new version of events, he came to Quirm instead of Ankh-Morpork and is working nearby.

==Appearance in other media==
An animated adaptation was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films for Channel 4 in 1996. It takes the association of the &quot;Band with Rocks In&quot; with the Beatles even further than the book does, evolving their style from 1950s rock and early 1960s beat music (and mixing-bowl haircuts) in Ankh-Morpork, to acid rock in Scrote, to spiritual hippie rock in Quirm. In Sto Lat, they sound like the Jimi Hendrix Experience or Bad Company, but are dressed in clothes similar to the Beatles on the cover of the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album. Also in Quirm, Buddy says that the band is &#x27;more popular than cheeses&#x27;, referring to John Lennon&#x27;s famous quote proclaiming the Beatles to be more popular than Jesus. In Pseudopolis, their outfits and style resemble the Blues Brothers. Crash&#x27;s band is also given the name &quot;Socks Pastels&quot;.

The soundtrack was released on CD, mp3 and streaming.

In August 2014, an adaptation was performed at the Rose Theatre, Kingston by Youth Music Theatre UK. The musical has been adapted by stand-up comedian Andrew Doyle with original music by Craig Adams. &quot;Soul Music&quot; will be directed by Luke Sheppard (associate director of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; and director of &quot;In the Heights&quot;) at the Southwark Playhouse and choreographed by Cressida Carré.

In February 2016, a stage adaption was performed at the Durham Student Theatre by Ooook! Productions. The production was adapted by Imogen Eddleston and directed by Mikey Bicarregui and Hamish Inglis.

<text>Cynology (rarely kynology, ) is the study of matters related to canines or domestic dogs. 
In English, it is a term sometimes used to denote a serious zoological approach to the study of dogs as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders, trainers and enthusiasts who study the dog informally.

== Etymology ==
Cynology is a classical compound word (from Greek , , , , &#x27;dog&#x27;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;) referring to the study of dogs. The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized study in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are in other languages, such German and Dutch . is also the source of the English word &quot;cynic&quot;, and is directly related to &quot;canine&quot; and &quot;hound&quot;.

== Usage in English ==
The suffix &#x27;-logy&#x27; in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study. English classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as &#x27;cynologists&#x27; to imply serious study or scientific work.

The very rare term &quot;cynologist&quot; in English is generally found to refer to &quot;canine specialists&quot; such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and professional dog-handlers.

== Usage in other languages ==
Cynology may have other connotations or uses in languages other than English; see German &#x27;, Dutch &#x27; and Czech &quot;&quot;.

*A similar word is used to refer to dog handlers and dog trainers in Russia.
*A veterinary clinic in Armenia offers a &#x27;cynologist&#x27; to assist with dog training.
*A magazine in the Baltic states described as &#x27;dedicated to the development of cynology in the Baltic countries&#x27; covers dog training, dog shows, and veterinary advice (a hobbyist magazine, not a scientific journal.)

<text>Marshall Walter &quot;Major&quot; Taylor (November 26, 1878 – June 21, 1932) was an American professional cyclist. He has been called &quot;the first Black American global sports superstar.&quot;

He was born and raised in Indianapolis, where he worked in bicycle shops and began racing multiple distances in the track and road disciplines of cycling. As a teenager, he moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, with his employer/coach/mentor and continued his successful amateur career, which included breaking track records.

Taylor turned professional in 1896, at the age of 18, living in cities on the East Coast and participating in multiple track events including six-day races. He moved his focus to the sprint event in 1897, competing in a national racing circuit, winning many races and gaining popularity with the public. In 1898 and 1899, he set numerous world records in race distances ranging from the quarter-mile () to the two-mile ().

Taylor won the 1-mile sprint event at the 1899 world track championships to become the first African American to achieve the level of cycling world champion and the second Black athlete to win a world championship in any sport (following Canadian boxer George Dixon, 1890). Taylor was also a national sprint champion in 1899 and 1900. He raced in the U.S., Europe and Australia from 1901 to 1904, beating the world&#x27;s best riders. After a -year hiatus, he made a comeback in 1907–1909, before retiring at age 32 to his home in Worcester in 1910.

Towards the end of his life Taylor faced severe financial difficulties. He spent the final two years of his life in Chicago, Illinois, where he died of a heart attack in 1932. Throughout his career he challenged the racial prejudice he encountered on and off the track and became a pioneering role model for other athletes facing racial discrimination. Several cycling clubs, trails, and events in the U.S. have been named in his honor, as well as the Major Taylor Velodrome in Indianapolis and Major Taylor Boulevard in Worcester. Other tributes include memorials and historic markers in Worcester, Indianapolis, and at his gravesite in Chicago. He has also been memorialized in film, music and fashion.

==Early life==
Marshall Walter Taylor was the son of Gilbert Taylor, a Civil War veteran, and Saphronia Kelter Taylor. His parents migrated from Louisville, Kentucky, and settled on a farm in Bucktown, a rural area on the western edge of Indianapolis, Indiana. Taylor, who was born on November 26, 1878, in Indianapolis was one of eight children in the family that included five girls and three boys. Around 1887, his father began working in Indianapolis as a coachman for a wealthy white family named Southard.

When Taylor was a child, he occasionally accompanied his father to work. Taylor soon became a close friend of the Southards&#x27; son, Daniel, who was the same age. Approximately from the age of 8 until he was about 12, Taylor lived with the family and along with Daniel was tutored at their home. Taylor&#x27;s living arrangement with the Southards provided him with more advantages than his parents could provide; however, this period of his life abruptly ended when the Southards moved to Chicago. Taylor, who remained in Indianapolis, returned to live at his parents&#x27; home and &quot;was soon thrust into the real world.&quot;

The Southards provided Taylor with his first bicycle. By 1891 or early 1892, he had become such an expert trick rider that Tom Hay, an Indianapolis bicycle shop owner, hired him to perform bicycle stunts in front of the Hay and Willits bicycle shop. Taylor earned $6 a week for cleaning the shop and performing the stunts, plus a free bicycle worth $35. It is likely that Taylor received his nickname of &quot;Major&quot; because he performed the cycling stunts wearing a military uniform.
Taylor left the Hay and Willits shop in 1892 or early 1893 to take a job as head trainer for Harry T. Hearsey&#x27;s bicycle shop in Indianapolis, teaching local residents how to ride. While working at Hearsey&#x27;s shop, Taylor got to know Louis D. &quot;Birdie&quot; Munger, a former high-wheel bicycle racer who owned the Munger Cycle Manufacturing Company, a racing bicycle factory in Indianapolis. (Munger later established the Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company factory in Worcester, Massachusetts.) With a shared interest in bicycle racing, the two became friends and Munger hired the teenaged Taylor to work odd jobs that included sending Taylor to area high schools and colleges to train cyclists and promote Munger&#x27;s line of racing bicycles. Munger had also &quot;made up his mind to make Taylor a champion&quot; and coached him to become a racer.

===Early years and move to East Coast===
Although he competed in both road and track races during his amateur career, Taylor excelled in the track sprints, especially the race. The first cycling race Taylor won was a amateur event in Indianapolis in 1890. He received a 15-minute handicap (head start) in the road race because of his young age. Taylor subsequently traveled to Peoria, Illinois, to compete in another meet, finishing in third place in the under-16 age category.

Taylor encountered racial prejudice throughout his racing career from some of his competitors. In addition, some local track owners feared that other cyclists would refuse to compete if Taylor was present for a bicycle race and banned him from their tracks. In 1893, for example, after 15-year-old Taylor beat a one-mile amateur track record, he was &quot;hooted&quot; and then barred from the track. Taylor joined the See-Saw Cycling Club, which was formed by black cyclists of Indianapolis who were unable to join the local all-white Zig-Zag Cycling Club.

Major Taylor won his first significant cycling competition on June 30, 1895, when he was the only rider to finish a grueling road race near his hometown of Indianapolis. During the race Taylor received threats from his white competitors, who did not know that he had entered the event until the start of the race. A few days later, on July 4, 1895, Taylor won a ten-mile road race in Indianapolis that made him eligible to compete at the national championships for Black racers in Chicago. Later that summer, he won the ten-mile championship race in Chicago by ten lengths and set a new record for Black cyclists of 27:32.
In 1895, Taylor and Munger relocated from Indianapolis to Worcester. At that time, it was a center of the U.S. bicycle industry and included half-a-dozen factories and thirty bicycle shops. Munger, who was Taylor&#x27;s employer, lifelong friend, and mentor, had decided to move his bicycle manufacturing business to the state of Massachusetts, which was also a more tolerant area of the country.

Munger and Charles Boyd, a business partner, established the Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company with factories in Worcester, as well as Middletown, Connecticut. For Taylor, who continued to work for Munger as a bicycle mechanic and messenger between the company&#x27;s two factory locations, the move to the East Coast offered &quot;higher visibility, larger crowds, increased sponsorship dollars, and greater access to world-class cycling venues.&quot; After Taylor&#x27;s relocation to Massachusetts, he joined the all-Black Albion Cycling Club in 1895 and trained at YMCA in Worcester. Taylor is first mentioned in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on September 26, 1895, as a competitor in the Citizen Handicap event, a ten-mile race on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. Taylor raced with a 1:30 handicap in a field of 200 competitors that included nine scratch riders.

In 1896, Taylor entered numerous races in the Northeastern states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. After winning a ten-mile road race in Worcester, Taylor competed in the Irvington–Millburn race in New Jersey, also known as the Derby of the East. Within half a mile () of the finish line, someone startled Taylor by tossing ice water into his face and he finished in 23rd place. Taylor&#x27;s first major East Coast race was in a League of American Wheelmen (LAW) one-mile contest in New Haven, Connecticut, where he started in last place but won the event. In August 1896, Taylor made a trip to Indianapolis, where he set an unofficial new track record of 2:11 for a distance of one mile at the Capital City velodrome, beating Walter Sanger&#x27;s official track record of 2:19 . (Taylor could not compete with Sanger, a professional racer, in a head-to-head contest because he was still an amateur.) Taylor&#x27;s final amateur race took place on November 26, 1896, in the 25-mile Tatum Handicap at Jamaica, New York. Taylor finished the race in 14th place.
==Professional career==
===1896: First races===

Taylor turned professional in 1896, at the age of eighteen, and soon emerged as the &quot;most formidable racer in America.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s first professional race took place in front of 5,000 spectators on December 5, 1896. He competed in a half-mile handicap event on an indoor track at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden II on the opening day of a multi-day event. Although the main event was a six-day race from December 6–12, other contests in shorter distances were held on December 5 to entertain the crowd. These races included the half-mile handicap for professionals in which Taylor competed, a half-mile race between Jay Eaton and Teddy Goodman, and a half-mile scratch race. In addition, there were half-mile scratch and handicap races for amateurs.

Taylor began the half-mile handicap race on December 5, with a advantage over the scratch racers. He beat a field of competitors that included Tom Cooper, Philadelphia&#x27;s A.C. Meixwell, and scratch rider Eddie C. Bald, who represented New York&#x27;s Syracuse, and rode a Barnes bicycle. Taylor won the race riding Munger&#x27;s &quot;Birdie Special&quot; bicycle and beat Bald by in a sprint to the finish.

From December 6–12, 1896, Taylor participated as one of 28 competitors in a six-day event at Madison Square Garden. Although Taylor had just become a professional, he had achieved enough notoriety, possibly because of his stunning win on December 5, to be listed among the &quot;American contestants&quot; that also included A.A. Hansen (the Minneapolis &quot;rainmaker&quot;) and Teddy Goodman. In addition, many &quot;experts from abroad&quot; participated in the meet such as Switzerland&#x27;s Albert Schock, Germany&#x27;s Frank J. Waller, Frank Forster, and Ed von Hoeg, and Canada&#x27;s Burns W. Pierce. Several countries were represented in the event, including Scotland, Wales, France, England, and Denmark.

As the fascination with six-day races spread across the Atlantic from its origins in the United Kingdom, their appeal to base instincts attracted large crowds. The more spectators who paid at the gate, the bigger the prizes, which provided riders with the incentive to stay awake–or be kept awake–in order to ride the greatest distance. To prepare for the event, Taylor went to Brooklyn, where he became a member of the South Brooklyn Wheelmen. An estimated crowd of 6,000 spectators attended the final day of the Madison Square Garden races in December 1896. During these long, grueling races, riders suffered delusions and hallucinations, which may have been caused by exhaustion, lack of sleep, or perhaps use of drugs.

Madison Square Garden&#x27;s six-day event in 1896 was the longest race Taylor had ever entered. After Taylor refused to continue racing on the final day of the long-distance competition, exhausted from physical exertion and lack of sleep, a &quot;Bearnings&quot; reporter overheard him comment: &quot;I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.&quot; Taylor completed a total of in 142 hours of racing to finish in eighth place. Teddy Hale, the race winner, completed and took home $5,000 in prize money. Taylor never competed in another race that long.

After Taylor&#x27;s move to the East Coast in 1896, he initially lived in Worcester, where he worked for Munger, and in Middletown, the site of another of Munger&#x27;s cycle factories. Taylor also lived in other eastern cities, such as South Brooklyn, where he once trained, but it is not known how long he still resided in New York after he became a professional racer.

===1897–1898: Fame and records===

Taylor initially raced for Munger&#x27;s Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company. After the company went into receivership in 1897 he joined other racing teams. Taylor competed in his first full year on the professional racing circuit in 1897. Early in the season, at the Bostonian Cycle Club&#x27;s &quot;Blue Ribbon Meet&quot; on May 19, 1897, Taylor rode a Comet bicycle to win first place in the one-mile open professional race. On June 26, he won a quarter-mile () race at the track at Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. Taylor also beat Eddie Bald in a one-mile race in Reading, Pennsylvania, but finished fourth in the prestigious LAW convention in Philadelphia.

As a professional racer Taylor continued to experience racial prejudice as a black cyclist in a white-dominated sport. In November and December 1897, when the circuit extended to the racially-segregated South, local race promoters refused to let Taylor compete because he was black. Taylor returned to Massachusetts for the remainder of the season and Eddie Bald became the American sprint champion in 1897. Despite the obstacles, Taylor was determined to race.

In the early years of his professional racing career, Taylor&#x27;s reputation continued to increase as he competed in and won more races. Newspapers began referring to him as the &quot;Worcester Whirlwind,&quot; the &quot;Black Cyclone,&quot; the &quot;Ebony Flyer,&quot; the &quot;Colored Cyclone,&quot; and the &quot;Black Zimmerman,&quot; among other nicknames. He also gained popularity among the spectators. One of his fans was President Theodore Roosevelt who kept track of Taylor throughout his seventeen-year racing career.
Early in the 1898 racing season Taylor beat Bald at Manhattan Beach, but lost to Eddie McDuffie at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a paced race. On July 17 at Philadelphia, Taylor won his biggest victories of the season: first place in the one-mile championship and second place in the one-mile handicap races. On August 27, in a head-to-head race with Jimmy Michael of Wales, Taylor set a new world record of 1:41 for a one-mile paced match and beat the Welsh racer to the finish by .

Taylor was among several top cyclists who could claim the national championship in 1898; however, scoring variations and the formation of a new cycling league that year &quot;clouded&quot; his claim to the title. Early in the year a group of professional racers that included Taylor had left the LAW to join a rival group, the American Racing Cyclists&#x27; Union (ARCU), and its professional racing group, the National Cycling Association (NCA). During the ARCU sprint championship in St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Taylor, who was a devout Baptist, refused to compete for religious reasons in the finals of the championship races because they were held on a Sunday. As a result of Taylor&#x27;s decision not to race in the finals at Cape Girardeau, the ARCU suspended him from membership. Taylor petitioned the LAW for reinstatement in 1898 and was accepted, but Tom Butler, who had remained a LAW member after the break-up, was declared the League&#x27;s champion that year.

During 1898–99, at the peak of his cycling career, Taylor established seven world records; the quarter-mile, the one-third-mile (), the half-mile, the two-thirds-mile (), the three-quarters-mile (), the one-mile, and the two-mile () distances. His one-mile world record of 1:41 from a standing start stood for 28 years.

===1899: World sprint champion===

At the 1899 world championships in Montreal, Canada, Taylor won the one-mile sprint, to become the first African American to win a world championship in cycling. Taylor was the second black athlete, after Canadian bantamweight boxer George Dixon of Boston, to win a world championship in any sport. For decades he was the only black athlete to be a world champion in cycling. Taylor won the one-mile world championship sprint in a close finish a few feet ahead of Frenchman Courbe d&#x27;Outrelon and American Tom Butler. In addition, Taylor placed second in the two-mile championship sprint at Montreal behind Charles McCarthy and won the half-mile championship race. Because the finals were held on Sundays, when Taylor refused to compete for religious reasons, he did not compete in another world championship contest until 1909 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Taylor lost in a preliminary heat at Copenhagen and did not compete in the finals.

After Taylor&#x27;s world championship win in 1899, many claimed that the event &quot;had been a farce, because Taylor had not competed against the strongest riders.&quot; World cycling&#x27;s governing body, the International Cycling Association (replaced with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1900), did not allow NCA racers to compete at the world championships in Montreal. As a result, Taylor&#x27;s accomplishments were somewhat diminished. Because the rival organizations (LAW and the NCA) would not recognize each other, two American champions were crowned in 1899. Tom Cooper was the NCA champion and Taylor was the LAW champion.

In addition to the world championship wins in the one-mile and two-mile distances at Montreal and the LAW Championship, which he won on points, Taylor&#x27;s victories in 1899 included twenty-two first-place finishes in major championship races around the U.S. Taylor&#x27;s record-setting times were impossible to dismiss. No other rider had matched the &quot;range and variety&quot; of his winning performances, which made him an international celebrity. In 1899, Taylor made several unsuccessful attempts to recapture his world record for a one-mile paced distance in two &quot;strenuous record-breaking campaigns,&quot; before he finally achieved the new world record of 1:19 in November to regain the title of &quot;the fastest man in the world.&quot;

For the 1899 racing season, Taylor went to Syracuse and with Munger&#x27;s assistance he signed a contract to race for the E. C. Stearns Company. Taylor, Munger, and Harry Sager, who was Taylor&#x27;s bicycle parts sponsor, initially planned to negotiate a deal with the Olive Wheel Company; however, the men were able to work out a more lucrative contract with Stearns, who agreed to build Taylor&#x27;s bicycles using a chainless gear mechanism that Sanger had designed. The bicycles only weighed about and had an gear for sprinting and a gear for longer, paced runs. Stearns &quot;also agreed to build Taylor a revolutionary steam-powered pacing tandem, behind which he could attack world records and challenge the leading exponents of paced racing.&quot; Although the tandem was temperamental, it helped Taylor break Eddie McDuffie&#x27;s one-mile world record on November 15, 1899, with a time of 1:19 at a speed of . In late 1899, Taylor signed a contract to race with the Iver Johnson&#x27;s Arms &amp; Cycle Works team of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, during the 1900 racing season.

===1900: American sprint champion===
In 1900, when the LAW no longer governed professional bicycle races in the U.S., Taylor&#x27;s future as a professional racer was in jeopardy. Fortunately, the ARCU and the NCA, who had banned Taylor from competing in their leagues, readmitted him after payment of a $500 fine. Taylor won the American sprint championship on points in 1900. He also beat Tom Cooper, the 1899 NCA champion, in a head-to-head match in a one-mile race at Madison Square Garden in front of 50,000 to 60,000 spectators. In addition, Taylor set world records in the half-mile and two-thirds-mile sprints and raced indoors using a &quot;home trainer&quot; in head-to-head competitions with other riders as a vaudeville act. Taylor eventually settled in Worcester, where he purchased a home on Hobson Street in 1900.

===1901–1904: Europe and Australia===

Following his record-setting successes in the U.S. and Canada, Taylor agreed to a European tour. In 1901, Taylor made his first trip to Europe, but returned to compete in the U.S. after the conclusion of the European spring racing season. During his European tour Taylor still refused to race on Sundays, when most of the finals were held, because of his religious convictions. It was reported that Taylor took a Bible with him when he travelled and began each race with a silent prayer because of his religious beliefs. 

Taylor was popular among the European race fans and news reporters: &quot;Everywhere he went he was mobbed, talked about, or written up.&quot; In 1901, Taylor won 18 of the 24 European races he entered, notching up 42 victories when the individual heats are counted. A highlight of Taylor&#x27;s European tour in 1901 was the two match races with French champion Edmond Jacquelin at the Parc des Princes in Paris, the winner in each decided over the best of three heats. Jacquelin won the first match, on May 16, two heats to nil, a wheel length sealing the win in the first heat, two lengths the gap in the second. Taylor triumphed in the second match, on May 27, two heats to nil, four lengths his margin of victory in the first heat, three the gap in the second.

Taylor also participated in a European tour in 1902, when he entered 57 races and won 40 of them to defeat the champions of Germany, England, and France. In addition to racing in Europe, Taylor also competed in Australia and New Zealand in 1903 and 1904. In February 1903, for example, Taylor, lured by a £1,200 appearance fee and a world record 1st prize of £750, competed in the inaugural Sydney Thousand handicap. His fee the next year hit £2,000. During his world tour in 1903, Taylor earned prize money estimated at $35,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars).

===1907–1910: Later years===

Following a collapse from the mental and physical strain of professional competition, Taylor took a -year hiatus from cycling between 1904 and 1906, before returning to race in France. He set two world records in Paris in 1907 for the half-mile standing start at 0:42 and the quarter-mile standing start at 0:25 . Taylor also returned to Europe for the racing season in 1908 and in 1909. He finally broke his long-standing decision to avoid Sunday races in 1909 when he was nearing the end of his racing career. Taylor&#x27;s last professional race took place on October 10, 1909, in Roanne, France, in a match race against French world champion Charles Dupré. Taylor won the race, but he did not return to Europe for the 1910 season and retired from competitive cycling.

Taylor was still breaking records in 1908, but his age was starting to &quot;creep up on him.&quot; He retired from racing in 1910 at the age of 32. When Taylor returned to his home in Worcester at the end of his racing career, his estimated net worth was $75,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars) to $100,000 ($ in 2015 chained dollars). Taylor won his final competition, an &quot;old-timers race&quot; among former professional racers, in New Jersey in September 1917.

==Racism in cycling==

As Taylor gained notoriety as an amateur and a professional, he did not escape racial segregation. In 1894, the LAW changed its bylaws to exclude blacks from membership; however, it did permit them to compete in its races. Although Taylor&#x27;s cycling was greatly celebrated abroad, particularly in France, his career was still restricted by racism, particularly in the Southern U.S., where some local promoters would not permit Taylor to compete against white cyclists. Some restaurants and hotels also refused to serve him or provide him lodging.

Taylor asserted in his autobiography that prominent bicycle racers of his era often cooperated to defeat him, such as the Butler brothers (Nat and Tom) were accused of doing in the one-mile world championship race at Montreal in 1899. At the LAW races in Boston, shortly after Taylor had won the world championship, he accused the entire field that included Tom Cooper and Eddie Bald, among others for fouling him. Taylor complained after the event that he had been &quot;bumped, jostled, and elbowed until I was sorely tried.&quot; Racing promoter William A. Brady, who was also Taylor&#x27;s manager, chastised the other riders for their &quot;rough treatment&quot; of Taylor during the race.

While some of Taylor&#x27;s fellow racers refused to compete with him, others resorted to intimidation, verbal insults, and threats to physically harm him. While racing in Savannah, Georgia, in the Winter of 1898, he received a written threat saying &quot;Clear out if you value your life;&quot; the previous day, Taylor had challenged three riders together to a race after one of them had said they &quot;didn&#x27;t pace niggers.&quot; Taylor recalled that ice water had been thrown at him during races and nails were scattered in front of his wheels. Taylor further stated in his autobiography that he had been elbowed and &quot;pocketed&quot; (boxed in) by other riders to prevent him from sprinting to the front of the pack, a tactic at which he was so successful.

Taylor&#x27;s competitors also tried to injure him. One incident occurred after the one-mile Massachusetts Open race at Taunton on September 23, 1897; at the conclusion of the race, William Becker, who placed third behind Taylor in second place, tackled Taylor on the race track and choked him into unconsciousness. Becker, who claimed that Taylor had crowded him during the race, was temporarily suspended while the incident was investigated. Becker received a $50 fine as punishment for his actions but was reinstated and allowed to continue racing. In another incident, which occurred in February 1904, when Taylor was competing in Australia, he was seriously injured on the final turn of a race when his fellow competitor Iver Lawson veered his bicycle toward Taylor and collided with his front wheel. Taylor crashed and lay unconscious on the track before he was taken to a local hospital and later made a full recovery. Lawson was suspended from racing anywhere in the world for a year as a result of his actions.
Taylor explained that he included details of these incidents in his autobiography, along with his comments about his experiences, to serve as an inspiration for other African American athletes trying to overcome racial prejudice and discriminatory treatment in sports. Taylor cited exhaustion as well as the physical and mental strain caused by the racial prejudice he experienced on and off the track as his reasons for retiring from competitive cycling in 1910. His advice to African American youths wishing to emulate him straightforward was that although bicycle racing had been the appropriate route to success for him, he would not recommend it in general. He suggested that individuals &quot;practice clean living, fair play and good sportsmanship&quot; and develop their best talent with a strong character, significant willpower, and &quot;physical courage.&quot; Despite many obstacles, Taylor rose to the top of his sport and became &quot;one of the dominant athletes of his era.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
After retiring from competition, Taylor applied to Worcester Polytechnic Institute to study engineering although he did not have a high school diploma, but he was denied admission and took up various business ventures.

Nearly 20 years after his retirement, Taylor wrote and self-published his autobiography, &quot;The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the World: The Story of a Colored Boy&#x27;s Indomitable Courage and Success Against Great Odds: An Autobiography&quot; (1928). According to his book, Taylor was upbeat about his retirement: &quot;I felt I had my day, and a wonderful day it was too.&quot; Taylor also claimed he had no regrets and &quot;no animosity toward any man,&quot; but his autobiography included hints of bitterness in regard to his treatment as a competitor: &quot;I always played the game fairly and tried my hardest, although I was not always given a square deal or anything like it.&quot;

By 1930, Taylor had experienced severe financial difficulties from bad investments (including self-publishing his autobiography), the stock market crash, and businesses that proved unsuccessful. Taylor&#x27;s home in Worcester and some of the family&#x27;s personal property were sold to pay off debts. He also suffered from persistent ill health in his later years.

Little is known of Taylor&#x27;s life after the failure of his marriage and his move to Chicago around 1930. Taylor spent the final two years of his life in poverty, selling copies of his autobiography to earn a meagre income and residing at YMCA Hotel in Chicago&#x27;s Bronzeville neighborhood.

In March 1932, Taylor suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in the Provident Hospital. After an unsuccessful heart operation, he was moved to Cook County Hospital&#x27;s charity ward in April, where he died on June 21, at age 53. The official cause on his death certificate is &quot;nephrosclerosis and hypertension,&quot; contributed by &quot;Chronic myocarditis.&quot; His wife and daughter, who survived him, did not immediately learn of his death and no one claimed his remains. He was initially buried at Mount Glenwood Cemetery in Thornton Township, Cook County, near Chicago, in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. In 1948, a group of former professional bicycle racers used funds donated by Frank W. Schwinn, owner of the Schwinn Bicycle Co. at that time, to organize the exhumation and reburial of Taylor&#x27;s remains in a more prominent location at the cemetery. The plaque at the grave reads: &quot;World&#x27;s champion bicycle racer who came up the hard way without hatred in his heart, an honest, courageous and God-fearing, clean-living gentlemanly athlete. A credit to his race who always gave out his best. Gone but not forgotten.&quot;

==Legacy==
Taylor&#x27;s legacy lies in his willingness to challenge racial prejudice as an African American athlete in the white-dominated sport of cycling. He was also hailed as a sports hero in France and Australia. Taylor, who became a role model for other athletes facing racial prejudice and discrimination, was &quot;the first great black celebrity athlete&quot; and a pioneer in his efforts to challenge segregation in sports. He also paved the way for others facing similar circumstances. Taylor explained in his autobiography that he had no other African Americans to offer him advice and &quot;therefore had to blaze my own trail.&quot;

===Honors and tributes===

Taylor&#x27;s legacy remained largely unknown until 1982, when the Major Taylor Velodrome in Indianapolis opened for the city&#x27;s hosting of the U.S. Olympic Festival. Annual events taking place in the velodrome or the wider Indy Cycloplex named in honor of Taylor include the Major Taylor Racing League track series, and from 2015, the Major Taylor Cross Cup second division UCI cyclo-cross event. Taylor was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1996 and 1997, Taylor was posthumously awarded with the USA Cycling Korbel Lifetime Achievement Award and the Massachusetts Hall of Black Achievement, respectively. In 2002, he was one of the nine track cyclists inducted into the UCI Hall of Fame, created to commemorate 100 years of the Paris–Roubaix one-day road race and the inauguration of the World Cycling Centre. In 2003, he was named a Sports Ethics Fellow by the Institute for International Sport. During the 2005 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles, a Peugeot bicycle that Taylor had owned, and then was donated to the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, was put on display inside the ADT Event Center. In 2009, a state historical marker was installed as a tribute to Taylor near the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis, where the Capital City track once stood, and where he had set an unofficial track record in 1896. In 2018, he was honored with a special tribute award at the International Athletic Association&#x27;s Jesse Owens Awards held at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

In 1998, in Taylor&#x27;s adopted hometown of Worcester, where he lived for 35 years, the Major Taylor Association was formed by locals with the goal of erecting a permanent memorial to Taylor outside the Worcester Public Library and telling his story. On July 24, 2006, the city renamed the Worcester Center Boulevard, a high-traffic downtown street, to Major Taylor Boulevard. At the same time, funding for the memorial was secured with the Massachusetts Legislature approving $205,000, signed by governor Mitt Romney. The opening ceremony took place on May 21, 2008, attended by Tour de France winner Greg LeMond. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of Taylor surrounded by granite was created by Antonio Tobias Mendez, who was chosen from over more than 60 others. At the grand opening of Worcester&#x27;s Applebee&#x27;s restaurant in 2000, Taylor was selected as its &quot;hometown hero&quot; and has a display of his memorabilia. In 2002, the Educational Association of Worcester and the Worcester Public Schools, together with the Major Taylor Association, developed a curriculum guide on Taylor, which has since been expanded and used in schools nationwide. Since 2003, Worcester has hosted the annual &quot;George Street Bike Challenge for Major Taylor&quot; amateur hillclimb event.

The first of the many cycling clubs named in Taylor&#x27;s honor was organized in Columbus, Ohio, in 1979. In 2008, a number of these clubs joined with other African-American clubs to form the National Brotherhood of Cyclists (NBC), a nonprofit organization that aims to further diversity in cycling. The Major Taylor Trail, a rail trail that navigates through South Side, Chicago, opened in 2007. Eleven years later, Chicagoan artist Bernard Williams oversaw the creation of a community mural honoring Taylor along the metal siding of the Little Calumet River bridge, which the trail crosses. Taylor is also celebrated along the Alum Creek Greenway Trail in Columbus, Ohio. In 2009, the Cascade Bicycle Club community organization of Washington state launched The Major Taylor Project, a youth cycling program.

A small museum devoted to Taylor opened in 2021 in the former Worcester County Courthouse. Taylor&#x27;s great-granddaughter attended the dedication.
A mural was dedicated in Indianapolis, in September 2021, to honor his legacy. 

===In popular culture===
Actor Philip Morris portrayed Taylor in the 1992 television mini-series &quot;Tracks of Glory&quot;. Blues musician Otis Taylor (no relation) recorded &quot;He Never Raced on Sunday,&quot; a song about Taylor for his 2004 album &quot;Double V&quot;. In 2007, Nike produced the Major Taylor &quot;premium&quot; collection of their most iconic sneakers in a light brown/neon yellow/white colorway. In the same year, SOMA Fabrications began making a set of bicycle handlebars called the Major Taylor Bar, which is a replica of 1930s drop handlebar that was named for Taylor. Dewshane Williams portrayed Taylor in the 2013 episode of television drama series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Tour de Murdoch.&quot;

On April 12, 2018, at a private exhibition in the TheTimesCenter in New York City, cognac brand Hennessy announced that Taylor would become the subject of the company&#x27;s fifth instalment of their &quot;Wild Rabbit&quot; advertising campaign, created with agency Droga5, which through a series of partnerships tells inspirational the stories of culturally influential people, with the slogan &quot;Never stop. Never settle.&quot; The event included the unveiling some of the partnerships including Kadir Nelson&#x27;s bronze sculpture of Taylor, &quot;The Major&quot;. The campaign launched to the public with a television commercial during the 2018 NBA Finals in April. The &quot;Major&quot; directed by Derek Cianfrance, which has cuts in various lengths, features a voiceover from rapper Nas and recreates Taylor racing in an indoor velodrome. The 30-second cut was shown during third and fourth quarters of the Super Bowl LIII in February 2019, Hennessy&#x27;s first appearance in a Super Bowl commercial. On April 22, 2018, ESPN premiered the Hennessy-sponsored television documentary short &quot;The Six Day Race: The Story of Marshall &quot;Major&quot; Taylor&quot;; directed by Colin Barnicle, it features interviews with contemporary African-American athletes, road cyclist Ayesha McGowan and BMX rider Nigel Sylvester.

In 2019, two Taylor-inspired brand collaborations were released, with part of the proceeds going to the NBC. Kerby Jean-Raymond, under his &quot;haute couture&quot; fashion label Pyer Moss, designed a five-piece collection &quot;MMT 140,&quot; and Affinity Cycles made limited-run of a modern replica Taylor-era track bicycle. In partnership with the NBC, a series of tribute bicycle rides took place across the U.S. in November and December marking Taylor&#x27;s birth date, and the creation of the $25,000 &quot;MMT Higher Education Scholarship&quot;, awarded to one winner with the best &quot;Never stop. Never settle.&quot; story. Also in 2019, Taylor&#x27;s name and likeness was licensed to Major Taylor Cycling Wear of Columbus Ohio to manufacture and distribute official sports- and cycling-wear bearing the image of Major Taylor.

Graphic novel publisher Drawn and Quarterly planned to publish a biography of Taylor by comic artist Frederick Noland in 2023.

==Marriage and family==

Taylor&#x27;s wife, Daisy Victoria Morris, was born on January 28, 1876, in Hudson, New York. Taylor married Morris in Ansonia, Connecticut, on March 21, 1902. Taylor met her around 1900 when she was living in Worcester, with her aunt and uncle.

While in Australia in 1904, Taylor and his wife had their only child, a daughter that they named Rita Sydney in honor of Sydney, where she was born on May 11. When Taylor, his wife, and daughter were not traveling, they lived in a large home on Hobson Avenue in Worcester that Taylor had purchased in 1900.

After his retirement from racing in 1910 and the failure of subsequent business ventures in the 1920s, Taylor and his wife became estranged. She left him in 1930 and moved to New York City. Around the same time Taylor left Worcester and moved to Chicago; he never saw his wife or daughter again. 

Taylor&#x27;s daughter, who graduated from the Sargent School of Culture in Boston in 1925 and the University of Chicago in 1936, taught physical education at West Virginia State University. She died in 2005 at age 101; her survivors include a son, Dallas C. Brown Jr., and his five children. In 1984, Taylor&#x27;s daughter donated an extensive scrapbook collection on her father to the University of Pittsburgh Archives. The original scrapbooks were donated to the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites in 1988.

<text>Bluebeard, the Autobiography of Rabo Karabekian (1916–1988) is a 1987 novel by American author Kurt Vonnegut. Told in first-person narrative, it describes the later years of fictional Abstract Expressionist painter Rabo Karabekian, who first appeared as a minor character in Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1973). The novel’s circumstances bear a rough resemblance to the fairy tale of &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, popularized by Charles Perrault, a connection that Karabekian mentions once in the novel.

==Plot summary==

At the opening of the book, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian, apologizes to the arriving guests: &quot;I promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen...&quot; He describes himself as a museum guard who answers questions from visitors coming to see his priceless collected art. He shares the lonely home with his live-in cook and her daughter, Celeste.

One afternoon, Circe Berman, a woman living nearby, wanders onto Karabekian&#x27;s private beach. When he reaches out to greet her, she catches him by surprise with the forward statement &quot;Tell me how your parents died.&quot; He tells her the story and proceeds to invite her back to his home for a drink. After a drink and supper, Karabekian invites her to stay with him, as Paul Slazinger, a friend of Karabekian does. After a time, he begins to find her charm &quot;manipulative&quot;, as she typically gets her way. Mrs. Berman does not respect his abstract art collection, including works by Jackson Pollock. She explores every inch of Karabekian&#x27;s home, constantly asking him questions. The only place that is off-limits to her is the potato barn.

The potato barn is the home of Karabekian&#x27;s studio and holds his &quot;secret&quot;. The barn has no windows, and Karabekian has gone through the trouble of nailing one end shut and immobilizing the other with six padlocks. The mystery of the potato barn has enticed collectors to make outrageous offers and to raise suspicions of stolen masterpieces. Upon help from Berman, Karabekian comes to a realization in his life, that he was merely afraid of people, and opens the painting in the potato barn to the public.

==Characters==
*Rabo Karabekian — Karabekian is a 71-year-old, one-eyed, first-generation Armenian-American painter. He lives in a 19-room house on the waterfront of East Hampton, Long Island, which he has inherited from his second wife Edith.
*Circe Berman - Circe selects Rabo&#x27;s home as a place to research and write about working-class adolescents living with multi-millionaires. While living there she more or less takes charge of Rabo&#x27;s life and tells him to start writing an autobiography, which he does. After she impulsively renovates Rabo&#x27;s foyer without his permission—removing many of the things Rabo&#x27;s dead wife had used to decorate it in doing so—the two get into a heated argument which results in her departure, although she soon returns and is accepted back. This is the most notable example of Circe&#x27;s disregard for other people&#x27;s privacy and personal space. Although Rabo does most of the things she wants him to, he will not tell her what is in the potato barn no matter how much she pressures him to do so. She is a well-published novelist under the pen name &quot;Polly Madison.&quot; Her novels, although very popular, are criticized for tainting the world&#x27;s youth.
*Paul Slazinger - Slazinger is a poor, wounded World War II veteran. Though he owns his own home, he stays with Rabo and eats from his kitchen. He refuses permanent residence on the grounds that &quot;he can only write at home&quot;. He has had eleven novels published, but is not in the league of Circe Berman. Circe is pretending not to be Polly Madison, so Paul looks down on her and condescendingly gives her writing advice.
*Dan Gregory - Originally named Dan Gregorian before moving to America and changing his name. A magazine article estimates him to be the highest-paid artist in American history. That he is Armenian like Rabo&#x27;s family causes Rabo&#x27;s mother to believe he is a great man, an example of an Armenian who has become a success in America. She insists that her son write to &quot;Gregorian&quot;, as she calls him, to ask for an apprenticeship. Rabo became &quot;Gregorian&#x27;s&quot; apprentice at the age of 17. He is extremely pro-fascist and is obsessed with Benito Mussolini, whom he greatly admires. His high opinion of Mussolini results in him getting into arguments with such men as W.C. Fields and Al Jolson, who subsequently refuse to associate with him. He eventually goes to Italy to work directly for Mussolini during the Second World War. He is accepted by Mussolini, who welcomes the public support of such a famous artist, but is finally killed in battle by British troops.
*Marilee Kemp - Marilee is Dan Gregory&#x27;s mistress, who persuades Gregory to take Rabo as his apprentice. She eventually becomes Rabo&#x27;s love interest and later the two of them are expelled from Gregory&#x27;s studio when he catches them leaving the Museum of Modern Art together. They have a very brief affair which Marilee ends, claiming that Rabo is not the man she needed at the time. Through a series of events she becomes a rich countess in Italy.
*Edith Taft - Edith is Rabo&#x27;s second wife of twenty years.
*Dorothy Roy - Dorothy is Rabo&#x27;s first wife. She has left with their two boys, Terry and Henri.
*Rabo&#x27;s Parents - Rabo&#x27;s parents are survivors of the Armenian genocide who are then tricked by a con man into buying a fake deed for a house in San Ignacio, California, where they move in order to create a better life. His father, having been a teacher in Turkey, ends up becoming a cobbler when they reach their new home. When the Great Depression hits the family falls on very hard times.
*Allison White - She is Rabo&#x27;s live-in cook, though he never refers to her as anything besides that until she becomes upset with him for never using her name. She has a daughter, Celeste, who also lives with them.

== Major themes ==
A number of critics have suggested that the possibility of creating art with meaning is a major theme in &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. According to David Rampton in &quot;Studies in Contemporary Fiction,&quot; Circe Berman&#x27;s approaching Rabo with the challenge of making meaningful, moral art is Vonnegut himself directly addressing meaninglessness in art by asking for &quot;committed art.&quot; Rampton also proposed that Vonnegut may be questioning the possibility of truly moral art by writing about the lack of morality in the lives of many artists. Critics have also said that meaningful art is Karabekian&#x27;s way of battling his own demons. Donald Morse said that Karabekian&#x27;s accomplishment in the novel is realising that &quot;through self-acceptance, and the serious use of imagination and creativity, human beings can become reconciled to their weaknesses while still remaining outraged at human greed.&quot; Morse added that Karabekian&#x27;s final masterpiece, &quot;Now It&#x27;s the Women&#x27;s Turn,&quot; achieves the goal of meaningful art by developing a backstory for each of the 5,219 characters in the composition before painting it.

Other themes that critics have discussed are Survivor&#x27;s syndrome, family, and relationships with women. One critic wrote that Rabo escapes the Survivor&#x27;s syndrome that his parents suffered from by painting &quot;Now It&#x27;s the Women&#x27;s Turn.&quot; It has also been said that Karabekian&#x27;s mission in the narrative is to find a family that he feels a part of, which he achieves with the army and the Abstract Expressionism community. Lastly, women are certainly a theme in &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Julian Moynahan said that Circe Berman sees Karabekian&#x27;s main life struggle as strained relationships with women.

&quot;Bluebeard&quot; received positive reviews from many critics. Some considered the novel a milestone in Vonnegut&#x27;s career; &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called it &quot;Vonnegut at his edifying best,&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said it was &quot;a major breakthrough for Vonnegut,&quot; and &quot;a new and vital phase in his career.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; said it was &quot;worth reading twice,&quot; and &quot;Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Bluebeard&quot; ranks with [Vonnegut&#x27;s] best and goes one step beyond.&quot;

&quot;Bluebeard&quot; was also met with significantly negative reception. Julian Moynahan wrote in a &quot;New York Times&quot; book review that Bluebeard was a &quot;minor achievement&quot; and that Vonnegut &quot;isn&#x27;t moving ahead.&quot; In &quot;Library Journal&quot;, the novel is identified as &quot;not among [Vonnegut&#x27;s] best.&quot;

== Style ==
There were several unique aspects of the style in which Vonnegut wrote &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. Donald Morse identified a difference between Bluebeard and other Vonnegut&#x27;s novels, which was that the protagonist was happy and satisfied at the end of the narrative. Morse also said that Karabekian as a writer is very similar to Vonnegut as a writer, and that the criticism Circe Berman gives to Karabekian about his writing is a parallel to the issues critics have with Vonnegut&#x27;s writing.

==Paintings==
In the novel, several of Karabekian&#x27;s paintings are described in detail. The first is a photo-realistic painting of Dan Gregory&#x27;s studio. The second is an abstract painting of a lost Arctic explorer and a charging polar bear. It consists of a white background with two strips of tape, one white, one orange. The third painting is of six deer and a hunter, titled &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody Number Six&quot; which later fell apart in storage at the Guggenheim Museum. The scene is represented by a greenish-orange background with six strips of brown tape for the deer on one side, and one strip of red tape on the opposite side for the hunter. His most famous, which once hung in the lobby of GEFFCo headquarters on Park Avenue, is titled &quot;Windsor Blue Number Seventeen.&quot; The entire painting consisting of eight 8×8 panels hung side by side displays nothing but the paint by Sateen Dura-Luxe in the shade of the title of the work. However, the painting literally fell apart when the Sateen Dura-Luxe began to shred itself from the canvas upon which it was painted becoming Rabo Karabekian&#x27;s biggest embarrassment as an abstract expressionist. These very panels upon which Windsor Blue used to cover fully became the canvases Karabekian would prime back to pure white and use for his last work locked within his potato barn.

The last painting is the secret in the potato barn. The painting is an enormous photo-realistic picture of Karabekian&#x27;s experience of World War II where he and 5,219 other prisoners of war, Romani people, and concentration camp victims were dumped in a valley when the German forces realized that the war was lost. The painting, which becomes enormously successful as a tourist attraction, is meant to be the only painting that Karabekian created which contained &quot;soul&quot;.

<text>Ira Jeffrey Glass (; born March 3, 1959) is an American public radio personality. He is the host and producer of the radio and television series &quot;This American Life&quot; and has participated in other NPR programs, including &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;. His work in radio and television has won him awards, such as the Edward R. Murrow Award for Outstanding Contributions to Public Radio and the George Polk Award in Radio Reporting.

Originally from Baltimore, Glass began working in radio as a teenager. While attending Brown University, he worked alongside Keith Talbot at NPR during his summer breaks. He worked as a story editor and interviewer for years before he began to cover his own stories in his late twenties. After he moved to Chicago, he continued to work on the public radio programs &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;The Wild Room&quot;, the latter of which he co-hosted. After Glass received a grant from the MacArthur Foundation, he and Torey Malatia developed &quot;This American Life&quot;, which won a Peabody Award within its first six months and became nationally syndicated a year later. The show was formulated into a television program of the same name on Showtime that ran for two seasons. Glass also performs a live show, and has contributed to or written articles, books, and a comic book related to the radio show.

==Early life and education==
Glass was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 3, 1959, to Jewish parents Barry and Shirley Glass, and grew up with two sisters, one younger and one older. Barry started out as a radio announcer, but eventually became a CPA and businessman who founded the Glass Jacobson Financial Group, while Shirley Glass was a clinical psychologist, whose work prompted &quot;The New York Times&quot; to call her &quot;the godmother of infidelity research&quot;.
As a child, Glass wanted to be an astronaut, while his parents hoped he would become a doctor. From a young age, he loved comedy and his family frequented the theater. By the time he was 11, he and his sister put on shows in their house&#x27;s basement and invited neighborhood children to watch. As a teen, he moonlighted as a magician.

Glass attended Milford Mill High School in Baltimore County where he held editorial roles as a member of the school&#x27;s yearbook staff and as co-editor of the student literary magazine. His involvement in yearbook started in tenth grade and continued until his graduation in 1977. As a member of the Milford drama club, Glass was cast in several stage productions: his roles include Captain George Brackett in Milford&#x27;s 1975 production of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, Lowe in the school&#x27;s 1976 production of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, and Bud Frump in its 1977 production of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;. Glass was also a member of the International Thespian Society. Glass has remarked that his style of journalism is heavily influenced by the musicals he enjoyed when he was younger, especially &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. He was involved in student government during his junior and senior years as a member of the executive board, made Milford&#x27;s morning announcements, and was a member of the Milford Mill Honor Society in 1977. While in high school, he wrote jokes for Baltimore radio personality Johnny Walker.

After Glass graduated from high school, he was accepted into Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and was initially a pre-medical student. He attended with fellow alums Mary Zimmerman and David Sedaris, though he did not know them at the time. He spent a lot of time at the university&#x27;s radio station making its promos. He transferred to Brown University, where he concentrated in semiotics. There, he was introduced to &quot;S/Z&quot; by Roland Barthes, an analysis that, in hindsight, &quot;made [him] understand what [he] could do in radio&quot;. He graduated in 1982.

==Career==
===Early career===
After his freshman year, 19-year-old Glass looked around Baltimore for work in television, radio, and advertising without success; meanwhile, he was employed in the shock trauma unit at a medical center. After someone at the local rock station recommended that he seek out Jay Kernis at National Public Radio&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, DC, he found work as an unpaid intern editing promotional announcements, before becoming the production assistant to Keith Talbot. At the end of the summer, he chose to stay with NPR and abandon medicine, a decision that disappointed his parents. When he graduated from college, they placed a sardonic ad in the classified section of their local newspaper that read, &quot;Corporate office seeks semiotics grad for high paying position.&quot; Talbot brought Glass with him to New York between 1986-87 as an intern on Kids America produced at WNYC. In Glass&#x27; half-hour weekly segments, he took the on-air persona of &quot;Bob&quot; and asked opinion poll style questions.

Glass returned to DC and worked at NPR for 17 years, where he eventually graduated to being a tape-cutter, before becoming a reporter and host on several NPR programs, including &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;. In an interview, Glass recalled that his first show was with NPR&#x27;s Joe Frank, and says the experience influenced him in a &quot;huge way&quot;, adding: &quot;Before I saw Joe put together a show, I had never thought about radio as a place where you could tell a certain kind of story.&quot; He has also said that editing for Noah Adams, an early host of &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, taught him how &quot;to step back from the action and move to some bigger thought and then return to the plot&quot;, a technique that he still uses to structure &quot;This American Life&quot;. As he approached 30, he tried reporting his own stories, but said he was not good at it and that he performed poorly on air, took a long time to create a single piece, and did not have strong interviewing skills. During this time, he dated a lawyer for seven years who, according to him, made him feel terrible and did not take his work seriously or love him. He says that while she was away working in Texas, he felt his writing improved in her absence, and their relationship ended by the end of the summer.

In 1989, Glass followed his then-girlfriend, cartoonist Lynda Barry, to Chicago and settled into the Lakeview neighborhood. Although he began producing award-winning reports for NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, specifically on school reform at Taft High School and Irving Elementary School, Glass said it was a piece he did on the 75th anniversary of Oreo cookies that taught him how to write for radio. Soon, he and Gary Covino created and co-hosted a Friday-night WBEZ Chicago Public Radio program called &quot;The Wild Room&quot;, which featured eclectic content with a loose style and aired for the first time in November 1990. By this time, Barry and Glass were no longer a couple, but she initially collaborated on the project, even giving the show its title after she and Glass agreed that Covino&#x27;s suggestion (&quot;The Rainbow Room&quot;) was &quot;stupid&quot;. The first show aired in November 1990. In Glass&#x27;s first professional interview (with Cara Jepsen in 1993), he said: &quot;I like to think of it as the only show on public radio other than &quot;Car Talk&quot; that both NPR news analyst Daniel Schorr and Kurt Cobain could listen to.&quot; During this time they spent two years reporting on the Chicago Public Schools—one year at a high school, and another at an elementary school. The largest finding of their investigations was that smaller class sizes would contribute to more success in impoverished, inner-city schools.

Glass eventually tired of &quot;free-form radio&quot; and, looking at other opportunities, began sending grant proposals to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

===&quot;This American Life&quot;===

In 1995, the MacArthur Foundation approached Torey Malatia, the general manager of Chicago Public Radio, with an offer of to produce a show featuring local Chicago writers and performance artists. Malatia approached Glass with the idea, who countered that he wanted to do a weekly program, but with a different premise, a budget of , and a desire to make it a national show. He then took two months off without pay to work on the pilot. Glass, however, didn&#x27;t include his co-host in his plans, assuring him that the deal was unlikely to happen. When the show went on without him, Covino says he felt &quot;betrayed&quot;. He continued to produce &quot;The Wild Room&quot; alone until February 1996.
Early on, the idea was to make a show telling stories of &quot;nobody who&#x27;s famous, nothing you&#x27;ve ever heard of, nothing in the news&quot;. The everyday stories would be placed between works from journalists, fiction authors, or performing artists. Glass invited David Sedaris to read his essays on the program before producing Sedaris&#x27; commentaries on NPR and contributing to Sedaris&#x27;s success as an independent author. The show—then called &quot;Your Radio Playhouse&quot;—first aired on November 17, 1995; the episode was titled &quot;New Beginnings&quot;. It included interviews with talk-show host Joe Franklin and Shirley Glass—who maintained her position that her son should consider work in television because of his resemblance to Hugh Grant—as well as stories by Kevin Kelly (the founding editor of &quot;Wired&quot;) and performance artist Lawrence Steger. The show&#x27;s name changed to &quot;This American Life&quot; beginning with the episode on March 21, 1996, and was syndicated nationally in June 1996 by Public Radio International after NPR passed on it.

Glass devoted himself to the effort by making the daily commute from his North Side apartment and spending 70 to 80 hours per week in the offices on the Navy Pier.

The show quickly received wide acclaim and is often credited with changing the landscape of journalistic radio in the US. It won a Peabody Award within six months of its first broadcast for excellence in broadcast media. The fictional pieces were gradually replaced with more reporting in a storytelling format, such as in the show&#x27;s coverage of victims of Hurricane Katrina. Over the years, guest contributors included Dave Eggers, Sarah Vowell, Michael Chabon, Tobias Wolff, Anne Lamott and Spalding Gray. On November 17, 2005, &quot;This American Life&quot; reached its tenth anniversary and the following week, in celebration, broadcast for the first time outside of Chicago.

The television network Showtime approached the show&#x27;s production team and proposed to convert &quot;This American Life&quot; into a television program; the team originally refused, as they did not want to compromise the format and make something &quot;tacky and awful&quot;, but agreed to make the program for television after Showtime conceded to various conditions, including a format that did not resemble a news magazine. After viewing the pilot, Showtime ordered six episodes in January 2007 and the first half-hour episode aired on March 22, 2007. Glass had to move to New York for filming, and said in an interview with Patt Morrison on Southern California Public Radio that he lost over the project. The show aired for thirteen episodes over two seasons before ending in 2009 because of the heavy workload needed to produce it.

Chicago Public Media announced it would begin self-distribution of &quot;This American Life&quot; starting on July 1, 2014, through Public Radio Exchange (PRX).

By 2020, &quot;This American Life&quot; reached more than 4.7 million listeners each week. Glass can be heard in all but four episodes. In July 2013, the 500th episode premiered. For the 2013 fiscal year, the WBEZ board voted to raise Glass&#x27;s salary from $170,000 annually to $278,000. However, he requested that it be lowered to $146,000 the following year, and has since asked for it be lowered again, calling the original sum &quot;unseemly&quot;. He supplements his income with speaking engagements, which earn him &quot;five figures per talk&quot;.

In May 2009, the &quot;This American Life&quot; radio show episode &quot;Return to the Scene of the Crime&quot; was broadcast live to more than 300 movie theaters.

===Other works===
Outside of radio, Glass has also worked as a print author. In September 1999, he collaborated on a comic book, &quot;Radio: An Illustrated Guide&quot;, with Jessica Abel. The book describes how &quot;This American Life&quot; is produced and instructs the reader into building their own radio program. In October 2007, he published the anthology &quot;The New Kings of Nonfiction&quot;.

Glass has collaborated on several feature films. In the show&#x27;s contract with Warner Bros., &quot;This American Life&quot; has first pick options on any films that emerge from stories of that program. By extension, Glass goes to Warner Bros. with any movie idea he may have. In 2006, he was an executive producer of the feature film &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;, which is based on the true story of what happened to &quot;This American Life&quot; contributing editor Susan Burton and her sister Betsy at an airport one day before Christmas. Burton had already produced a segment on &quot;This American Life&quot; about the same experience before the story was adapted to film. In 2007, he and Dylan Kidd wrote a screenplay based on the nonfiction book &quot;Urban Tribes&quot; about a man who must choose between his friends and his girlfriend. Glass also produced the 2018 Netflix movie &quot;Come Sunday&quot;.

Glass regularly collaborates with comedian Mike Birbiglia. In 2012, Glass co-wrote and produced Birbiglia&#x27;s film &quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot; and they both went on a country-wide promotional tour for the film to give interviews and visit theaters to introduce the film. On September 17, 2012, Glass made a special voice appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; with Stephen Colbert to promote &quot;Sleepwalk with Me&quot; and invite Colbert to participate in a &quot;This American Life&quot; episode. Glass was credited as a co-producer in Birbiglia&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice&quot;, alongside Miranda Bailey and Amanda Marshall. Glass is also the producer for Birbiglia&#x27;s 2018 one-man Broadway show &quot;The New One&quot;.

In 2013, Glass partnered with Monica Bill Barnes &amp; Company to produce &quot;Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host&quot; and worked alongside Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass.

Glass toured Google&#x27;s headquarters in November 2013 and met the Google Doodle team, who collectively agreed to collaborate with &quot;This American Life&quot;. Glass suggested that for Valentine&#x27;s Day 2014 they interview &quot;random&quot; people about their experiences with love. Users in the American market could click on a candy heart that corresponded to each letter in &quot;Google&quot; and listen to a different story of unusual love in the same style as the radio program. Roger Neill composed the music, while Glass, fellow &quot;American Life&quot; producer Miki Meek, and Birbiglia conducted the interviews.

In 2019, Glass went on tour with the show &quot;Seven Things I&#x27;ve Learned&quot;, where he talks about the art of storytelling. The titles of the show&#x27;s acts include &quot;How to tell a story&quot;, &quot;Save the cat&quot;, &quot;Failure is Success&quot;, &quot;Amuse yourself, and &quot;It&#x27;s war&quot;. Two dancers from Monica Bill Barnes &amp; Company, whom Glass had collaborated with before, performed in the show.

Ben Sinclair, a co-creator of HBO&#x27;s TV show &quot;High Maintenance&quot;, sought out Glass to appear in the 2020 season premiere.

==Public image==
Glass has been called a visionary for his work in radio. In 2001, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Glass the &quot;Best Radio Host in America&quot;. Critics remark on the dedication and distinct vision he brings to the show. Steve Johnson with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called Glass &quot;the deliberately mysterious, apparently highly romantic force who is the program&#x27;s host, co-founder and executive producer&quot;. After remarking that, unlike on most shows, Glass serves as the director, senior producer, host, administrator, librarian, and researcher, Chicago writer Sarah Vowell said, &quot;Part of that is that he&#x27;s a control freak. Part of it is he has so much experience. Part of it is he really does have a vision for the show.&quot; Glass is credited with being a forebear of podcasting and modern audio storytelling. Samuel Fishwick of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called Glass the &quot;godfather of podcasting&quot;.
The nature of his voice also inspires commentary in the media. &quot;Vogue&quot; called his voice &quot;the aural embodiment of Sensitive Guy Who Is Friends with All the Girls.&quot; &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; called his voice &quot;adenoidal&quot; and said it has a &quot;slight stutter, not a speech defect, but a verbal tic, a device&quot;. Johnson said Glass&#x27; voice sounds like it does not belong on the radio and that it is &quot;kind of , decidedly conversational.&quot;

Jenji Kohan has said that Glass is part of the inspiration behind the character Maury Kind on her show &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;, in particular, his glasses. She offered Glass a role on the show, but he &quot;politely declined&quot; the offer due to his busy schedule.

==Personal life==
For a time, Glass dated cartoonist and author Lynda Barry. She briefly joined him in Washington, D.C., but she moved to Chicago to be near fellow cartoonists in the summer of 1989, with Glass following her. Reflecting on the relationship, Barry called it the &quot;worst thing [she] ever did&quot;, and said he told her she &quot;was boring and shallow, and...wasn&#x27;t enough in the moment for him.&quot; She later drew a comic based on their relationship titled &quot;Head Lice and My Worst Boyfriend&quot;, which was later included in her book &quot;One! Hundred! Demons!...&quot; Glass did not deny her assertions, and told the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;: &quot;I was an idiot. I was in the wrong...about so many things with her. Anything bad she says about me I can confirm.&quot;

Glass married Anaheed Alani, a writer and editor, in August 2005. They had dated before splitting harshly, but decided to give the relationship another try. &quot;We have the entire Middle East crisis in our house,&quot; joked Glass. &quot;Her mom is Christian and her dad is Muslim, from Iraq.&quot; They shared a pit bull named Piney, which they refused to put down even after it bit several people including two children, drawing blood. (Glass referred to these bites as &quot;nips&quot;.) In March 2017, Glass announced on &quot;This American Life&quot; that he and Alani had separated, and in an interview later that year, specified that they had been separating over the previous three years. On April 17, 2017, Glass reportedly filed for divorce. The pitbull contributed to the divorce. 
Alani later bought another pitbull. Glass has since resumed dating, calling it &quot;kind of nice and sort of sweet,&quot; and saying, &quot;[t]here&#x27;s a lot of hope to it.&quot;

His older sister, Randi Glass Murray, is a literary agent based in San Francisco, while his younger sister, Karen Glass Barry, was a senior vice president in film development at Disney Studios. He is a first cousin once removed of composer Philip Glass, who has appeared on Glass&#x27; show and whose music can often be heard on the program.

Glass has donated to Prison Performing Arts and dedicated a whole episode of &quot;This American Life&quot; around one of the organization&#x27;s productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Glass decided to become a vegetarian after visiting United Poultry Concerns&#x27; chicken sanctuary.

Glass likes the shows &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot;, and says he never missed an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot; His favorite podcasts include &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, &quot;The Daily&quot;, &quot;Reply All&quot;, &quot;Radiolab&quot;, &quot;Heavyweight&quot;, &quot;Stay Tuned with Preet&#x27;.&quot;

===Religion===
Glass has stated on &quot;This American Life&quot; that he is a staunch atheist. &quot;It&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m a Jew,&quot; he explained. &quot;I feel like I don&#x27;t have a choice about being a Jew. Your cultural heritage isn&#x27;t like a suitcase you can lose at the airport...But even when I was 14 or 15, it didn&#x27;t make that much sense to me that there was this Big Daddy who created the world and would act so crazy in the Old Testament. That we made up these stories to make ourselves feel good and explain the world seems like a much more reasonable explanation. I&#x27;ve tried to believe in God but I simply don&#x27;t.&quot; Atheism aside, he said, &quot;Some years I have a nostalgic feeling to go into a shul and I&#x27;ll go in for a High Holiday service. Rabbi Seymour Essrog was really funny, a great storyteller. He was so good that even the kids would stay and watch him. He&#x27;d tell a funny anecdote, something really moving, and go for a big finish. That&#x27;s what the show is.&quot;

Glass has stated that &quot;Christians get a really bad rap in the media&quot; and that contrary to the way they are portrayed in pop-culture, the Christians in his life &quot;were all incredibly wonderful and thoughtful&quot;.

==Awards==
Glass was named the recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award for Outstanding Contributions to Public Radio in 2009. In 2011, he earned the George Polk Award in Radio Reporting for &quot;Very Tough Love&quot;, an hour-long report that showed alarmingly severe punishments being meted out by a county drug court judge in Georgia. The episode prompted Georgia&#x27;s Judicial Qualifying Commission to file 14 ethical misconduct charges against Judge Amanda Williams and, within weeks, Williams stepped down from the bench and agreed never to seek other judicial offices.

In 2012, Glass was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Goucher College in Baltimore. In May 2013, Glass received the Medal for Spoken Language from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was on the team that won the Gold Award for best documentary from the Third Coast International Audio Festival in 2013 for &quot;Harper High School&quot;, and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November 2014.

In 2020, Glass and the rest of the &quot;This American Life&quot; staff (together with Molly O&#x27;Toole of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and Emily Green of &quot;Vice News&quot;) won the inaugural Pulitzer Prize for Audio Reporting for the episode &quot;The Out Crowd,&quot; which demonstrated &quot;revelatory, intimate journalism that illuminates the personal impact of the Trump Administration&#x27;s &quot;Remain in Mexico&quot; policy&quot;.

<text>Intent scale translation is a mathematical technique used by marketers to convert stated purchase intentions into purchase probabilities, that is, into an estimate of actual buying behaviour. It takes survey data on consumers purchase intentions, and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.

A survey might ask a question using a five-point scale such as:

:Which is most true about product X?
::___ I definitely would use product X
::___ I probably would use product X
::___ I might use product X
::___ I probably would not use product X
::___ I definitely would not use product X

A marketing researcher will first assign numerical values to these intention categories. If the numbers range from zero to one, they can be thought of as intent probabilities. This is a typical example:
:definitely -&gt; .99
:probably -&gt; .75
:maybe -&gt; .5
:probably not -&gt; .25
:definitely not -&gt; .01

Next, the researcher uses a predefined functional relationship to convert the stated intentions into estimates of actual purchase probabilities. The diagram that follows illustrates one such translation function. If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “definitely” and an intent probability of .99 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis. The translation function gives a value of about .8, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that not all people that claim they definitely intend to purchase will actually purchase.

If a survey respondent were to choose a response of “probably not” and an intent probability of .25 was assigned to that category, then the actual probability of purchase could be read off the vertical axis as .35, indicating the specifiers of the function feel that some people that claim they probably will not purchase will actually purchase.
Other purchase intention/rating translations include logit analysis and the preference-rank translation.

<text>Theodore Harold Maiman (July 11, 1927 – May 5, 2007) was an American engineer and physicist who is widely credited with the invention of the laser. Maiman&#x27;s laser led to the subsequent development of many other types of lasers. The laser was successfully fired on May 16, 1960. In a July 7, 1960, press conference in Manhattan, Maiman and his employer, Hughes Aircraft Company, announced the laser to the world. Maiman was granted a patent for his invention, and he received many awards and honors for his work. His experiences in developing the first laser and subsequent related events are recounted in his book, &quot;The Laser Odyssey&quot;, later being republished in 2018 under a new title, &quot;The Laser Inventor: Memoirs of Theodore H. Maiman&quot;.

==Early and student life==

Maiman was born in Los Angeles to a Jewish family. Abraham &quot;Abe&quot; Maiman, an electrical engineer and inventor, and Rose Abramson. At a young age his family moved to Denver, Colorado, where he helped his father with experimentation in a home electronics laboratory. Maiman says in his autobiography that &quot;as with most hyperactive kids, I was skinny, some 10–15 pounds underweight&quot;, and considers himself to have been a target for Ritalin should it have existed at the time. In his teens Maiman earned money by repairing electric appliances and radios, and after leaving high school was employed as a junior engineer with the National Union Radio Company at age 17.

Following a year&#x27;s service in the United States Navy at the end of World War II, he earned a B.S. in engineering physics from the University of Colorado Boulder. Maiman then went on to graduate studies at Stanford University where he earned an M.S. in electrical engineering in 1951 and a PhD in physics in 1955.

Maiman&#x27;s doctoral thesis in experimental physics, under the direction of physicist Willis Lamb, involved detailed microwave-optical measurements of fine structural splittings in excited helium atoms. He also devised laboratory instrumentation for Lamb&#x27;s experiments. Maiman published two articles jointly with Lamb in &quot;Physical Review&quot;, the second of which was based on his own thesis research. His thesis experiment was instrumental in his development of the laser.

==Career==
In 1956 Maiman started work with the Atomic Physics Department of the Hughes Aircraft Company (later Hughes Research Laboratories or HRL Laboratories) in California where he led the ruby maser redesign project for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, reducing it from a 2.5-ton cryogenic device to while improving its performance. As a result of this success Maiman persuaded Hughes management to use company funds to support his laser project beginning in mid-1959. On a total budget of $50,000, Maiman turned to the development of a laser based on his own design with a synthetic ruby crystal, which other scientists seeking to make a laser felt would not work.
On May 16, 1960, at Hughes&#x27; Malibu, California, laboratories, Maiman&#x27;s solid-state pink ruby laser emitted mankind&#x27;s first coherent light, with rays all the same wavelength and fully in phase. Maiman documented his invention in &quot;Nature&quot; on August 6, 1960, after two rejections by Samuel A. Goudsmit at &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, besides which he published other scholarly articles describing the science and technology underlying his laser.

Maiman had begun conceptualizing a solid-state laser design even before he undertook the maser project at Hughes. Moving the microwave frequency of masers up the electromagnetic spectrum 50,000-fold to the frequency of light would require finding a feasible lasing medium and excitation source and designing the system. Other major research groups at IBM, Bell Labs, MIT, Westinghouse, RCA and Columbia University, among others, were also pursuing projects to develop a laser.
Their work was stimulated by a 1958 paper by Arthur L. Schawlow and Charles H. Townes offering theoretical analysis and a proposal for a gaseous system using potassium vapor excited by a potassium lamp. However Maiman identified multiple flaws in the Schawlow-Townes proposal and the reason for their rejection of a solid-state design, including a significant difference in the band-gap nature of pink rubies and red rubies, and pursued his own vision: &quot;I was the only one that analyzed ruby in enough detail to have the confidence to stick with it.&quot; His successful design used synthetic pink ruby crystal grown by the Linde Division of Union Carbide as the active laser medium and a helical xenon flash lamp as the excitation source. As Townes later wrote, &quot;Maiman&#x27;s laser had several aspects not considered in our theoretical paper, nor discussed by others before the ruby demonstration.&quot; One piece of evidence that convinced Maiman (and later the world) that he had lased pink ruby was that &quot;when the crystal was pushed above threshold, we observed a brightness ratio&quot; of the twin red lines &quot;of more than 50 times&quot;.

Following his invention of the laser, in 1961 Maiman departed Hughes to join the newly formed Quantatron company, which grew in-house ruby crystals for lasers. Maiman was installed as vice president of the Applied Physics Laboratory, and he hired seven Hughes colleagues. Together they started a Verneuil plant to grow synthetic rubies, which were domestically available at that time only at Linde, who had been chosen by the US government to receive the WW2 technology transferred from Switzerland. &quot;The Swiss for many years used this Verneuil technology to make the jewel bearings in their famous precision watches.&quot; Brothers Rick and Tony Pastor were hired by Maiman from Hughes in order to start the Quantatron synthetic ruby plant. Rick devised methods to make ultra-high purity powder, while Tony improved the burner and powder handling process.
By 1962, when Smullin and Fiocco had already bounced the beam from a 50J 0.5 millisecond ruby laser off the moon, and the Soviets too, Maiman had hired 35 people for his APL lab at Quantatron. When its funds dried up because the venture capitalist was taken over, Maiman found an eager partner in Union Carbide with whom to nurse his improved synthetic ruby plant, and in 1962 Maiman founded and became the president of the Korad Corporation, which manufactured high-power ruby lasers. Among other developments while he was at Korad, Maiman supported Hellwarth in his Q-switch patent litigation against Gould. After Korad was fully acquired by Union Carbide in 1968, when they exercised the option written into the venture capital contract, Maiman left to found Maiman Associates, a venture capital firm of his own.

Maiman was awarded US Patent Number 3,353,115 for his &quot;Ruby Laser Systems&quot; on November 14, 1967, and paid $300 for it by assignee Hughes Aircraft Company. It turned out to be Hughes&#x27; most profitable patent.

In 1971 Maiman founded the Laser Video Corporation, and from 1976 to 1983 he worked as vice president for advanced technology at TRW Electronics (now Northrop Grumman). He later served as consultant to Laser Centers of America, Inc. (now LCA-Vision Inc.) and director of Control Laser Corporation. Maiman continued his involvement in laser developments and applications. In addition to his patent for the first working laser, Maiman authored a number of patents on masers, lasers, laser displays, optical scanning, and modulation.

Prior to his death, Maiman held an adjunct professor position in the School of Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University, where he worked on the development of curricula in biophotonics, photonics and optical engineering.

==Awards and recognition==
Maiman received numerous prizes, awards, and accolades over the years for his development of the first laser. He was granted membership in both the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering. He was made a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Optical Society of America (OSA), and the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). In 1962 Maiman was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Stuart Ballantine Medal for physics.
In 1966 Maiman received the American Physical Society&#x27;s Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize and the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Award for distinguished contribution in the field of science, presented in a White House ceremony by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 1976, Maiman was awarded the Optical Society of America&#x27;s R.W. Wood Prize for &quot;Pioneer Development of the First Laser&quot;. In 1980, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was the recipient of the 1983/84 Wolf Prize in Physics and was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame that year. In 1987 Maiman was awarded the Japan Prize in Electro-Optics for &quot;realization of the world&#x27;s first laser.&quot;

In 1994, he was inducted as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the only non-physician, non-royal member. Time magazine cited Maiman&#x27;s invention of the laser as among the twenty most important technological developments of the 20th century. Many universities granted Maiman honorary degrees, with the last from Simon Fraser University in 2002.

Recognition for Maiman and his laser invention continued posthumously. In a 2007 obituary testimonial, maser co-inventor Charles H. Townes described Maiman&#x27;s 1960 &quot;Nature&quot; article on his laser as &quot;probably more important per word than any of the papers published by Nature over the past century.&quot; The annual Theodore Maiman Student Paper Competition was established in 2008, endowed by major laser groups, and is administered by the OSA Foundation. In 2010 numerous events were staged worldwide by major scientific and industry photonics organizations to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Maiman&#x27;s first laser and subsequent lasers under the umbrella of LaserFest.

The U.S. Congress passed a resolution celebrating the invention of the laser and citing Maiman. Also in 2010 Maiman&#x27;s laser achievement was recognized as an IEEE Milestone, and the American Physical Society presented Hughes Research Laboratories with a plaque to commemorate the historic site of the world&#x27;s first laser.

In 2011, Maiman was recognized by Stanford University as a &quot;Stanford Engineering Hero&quot;, citing his &quot;rare blend of advanced training in physics and engineering combined with significant laboratory experience&quot;. In 2014, the National Academy of Sciences published a biographical memoir of Maiman including a tribute by Nick Holonyak, Jr.

In 2017 UNESCO declared May 16 the International Day of Light, which is celebrated every year by numerous laser and light-related events around the world. That date commemorates Maiman&#x27;s first successful firing of his laser.

==Death==

Maiman died from systemic mastocytosis on May 5, 2007, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he lived with his second wife, Kathleen, whom he met on February 13, 1984. He had one daughter, named Sheri, with his first wife, Shirley, whom he married in 1956. Sheri Maiman died of cancer in 1988 at the age of 30.

<text>The Barbet is a medium-sized breed of French water dog. It is a rare breed. The breed&#x27;s name comes from the French word , meaning &#x27;beard&#x27;.

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===
The barbet is a prototypic water dog, with a long, woolly, and curly coat. Their coats grow continuously and must be trimmed and must be groomed regularly, otherwise the coat can become matted.

Most Barbets, especially those shown in conformation shows, are black or brown, sometimes with white markings. Other rare colors include fawn, grey, pari, creme, and pied.

Male Barbets are usually tall and between , while females usually reach and .

===Temperament===
The Barbet is described as friendly, obedient, and intelligent. Due to their history as water dogs, many Barbet love swimming and playing in water.

They are capable retrievers for waterfowl hunting. In France, the barbet can take the (TAN), a basic water-retrieving test, and has recently been permitted to participate in the (BCE), a general hunting-dog test involving field and water trials. In Germany, the barbet takes part in field trials.

== Health ==
Barbets are a relatively healthy breed with a life expectancy of 13 to 15. Due to the rarity of the breed, there is limited data on breed-specific concerns. They can have hip dysplasia, epilepsy, and like most long-eared dogs are prone to ear infections.

The Barbet is a rare breed, which limits the genetic variety available. A 2006 study found a coefficient of inbreeding of 12.4%, significantly higher than the eight other French breeds examined in the study, while a 2013 study found a coefficient of 9.1%, likewise very high.

== History ==

The Barbet as it is known today is a fairly rare and recent breed development. Over the centuries, the breed existed in various forms, at times serving simply as a companion or guardian dog, but more often utilised as an all-around flushing or working dog. The term &quot;barbet&quot; gradually became a generic name for any dog with a long, curly, and/or woolly coat. Barbets are perhaps best-known for being a retriever of hunters&#x27; quarry, valued by duck, goose, and other fowl-hunters amongst the marshes, wetlands, estuaries and along the coastal areas of France; this wet and dirty job eventually spawned the term &quot;muddy as a barbet&quot;, popularised in the 19th century. Between the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the same type of dog was known as the in France, the in Italy, and the in Germany; additionally, for nearly 100 years, barbets and poodles were considered the same breed.

Like many others, the breed went nearly extinct after WWII. In the 1970s, French breeders attempted to revive the breed. In France, there were 307 Barbets registered between 1975 and 2001. Due to cross-breeding with the Standard Poodle and other breeds, the modern Barbet is notably taller than the historical breed. The dogs with more Poodle in them also tend to have smaller, tighter curls.

It is listed in Group 8 (retrievers, flushing dogs and water dogs) by the &quot;Société Centrale Canine&quot;, the French Kennel Club, and the &quot;Fédération Cynologique Internationale&quot; (International Canine Federation), a similar category of breeds as the &quot;sporting&quot; dogs of North American kennel clubs. It was introduced to the US in 1994 and recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2020.

=== Great Britain (UK) ===

The first Barbet, a male, was brought into the UK in 2001, although he did not reproduce. In 2007, two unrelated females were brought in from France; the majority of Barbets currently in the UK are descendants of these. Since then, further examples of the breed have been imported from France, Netherlands, Canada, Poland, and Sweden.

In April 2018, the Barbet became the 220th breed recognized by The Kennel Club of the UK and the Barbet can now be shown in Import Register classes at all UK dog shows held under The Kennel Club rules. Barbets born in the UK prior to this date were registered in France by the Société Centrale Canine (SCC), a national affiliate of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). There are on average only one or two British-born litters born per year. In 2018, there were approximately 140 barbets living in the UK.

The majority of Barbets in the UK are kept as pets, although a small number are used regularly as gun dogs, agility dogs, and for search-and-rescue work; they can also take part in conformation shows in the UK and in FCI-member countries, with two British Barbets achieving French Champion status in 2014.

<text>Kim Victoria Cattrall (; born 21 August 1956) is a British and Canadian actress. She is known for her portrayal of Samantha Jones on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998–2004), for which she received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations, winning the 2002 Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. She reprised the role in the feature films &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010), as well as guest starring on its revival &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; (2023).

Cattrall made her film debut in &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975) and went on to star opposite Jack Lemmon in his Oscar-nominated film &quot;Tribute&quot; (1980) and in &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot; (1981). She came to prominence with starring roles in films such as &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (1982), &quot;Police Academy&quot; (1984), &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986), &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987), and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991). She is also known for her theatre work including &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (Broadway, 1986), &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (McCarter Theatre, 1993), &quot;Private Lives&quot; (West End, 2010), &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (Liverpool Playhouse, 2010), and &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (The Old Vic, 2013).

From 2014 to 2016, Cattrall starred on and served as executive producer of HBO Canada&#x27;s &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot;, for which she received a nomination for the 2016 Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. She went on to star on the Paramount+ series &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot; (2018–2019), the Fox series &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; (2020), the Peacock revival series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (2022), and the Netflix series &quot;Glamorous&quot; (2023). From 2022 to 2023, she played &quot;future&quot; Sophie on the Hulu sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Father&quot;.

==Early life==
Kim Victoria Cattrall was born on 21 August 1956 in the Mossley Hill area of Liverpool, Lancashire the daughter of secretary Gladys Shane (née Baugh; 1929–2022) and construction engineer Dennis Cattrall (1925–2012). She has two sisters and she also had a brother named Christopher Cattrall (1963–2018). When she was 3 months old, her family emigrated to Canada and settled in Courtenay, British Columbia. At age 11, she returned to Liverpool when her grandmother became sick. She took acting examinations at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, but returned to Canada after one year and moved to New York City at the age of 16 for her first acting role.

== Career ==

=== 1970s–2000s ===
Cattrall began her career after graduating from Georges P. Vanier Secondary School in 1972, when she left Canada for the US. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, and upon her graduation signed a five-year film deal with director Otto Preminger. She made her film debut in Preminger&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975). A year later, Universal Studios bought out that contract and Cattrall became one of the last participants in the contract player system of Universal (also referenced as MCA/Universal during this period) before the system ended in 1980. The Universal system&#x27;s representative in New York, Eleanor Kilgallen (sister of Dorothy Kilgallen), cast Cattrall in numerous television guest-star roles. One of the first jobs Kilgallen got her was in a 1977 episode of &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; starring Jack Klugman, whom Kilgallen also represented.

In 1978, Cattrall played the house guest of a murderous psychologist in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; and also in &quot;Blindfold&quot;, an episode of the 1970s action series &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, in which Starsky (played by Paul Michael Glaser) is grief-stricken since he accidentally blinded Cattrall&#x27;s character, young artist Emily Harrison, by a shot of his gun. She appeared in &quot;The Bastard&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1979), two television miniseries based on the John Jakes novels of the same names. In 1979, she played the role of Dr. Gabrielle White on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and would go down in television &quot;Hulk&quot; lore as one of the few characters who knew David Banner (alter ego of the title character) was alive and was the creature. Her work in television paid off and she quickly made the transition to cinema. She appeared opposite Jack Lemmon in his Oscar-nominated film &quot;Tribute&quot; (1980), and in &quot;Crossbar&quot;, the film about a high jumper who loses his leg and still participates in the Olympic trials, with Cattrall&#x27;s help. The following year, she appeared in &quot;Ticket to Heaven&quot;.

In 1981, Cattrall played PE teacher Miss Honeywell in &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, followed three years later by a role in &quot;Police Academy&quot;. In 1985, she starred in three films: &quot;Turk 182&quot;, &quot;City Limits&quot; and &quot;Hold-Up&quot;, the last with French star Jean-Paul Belmondo. In 1986, she played Kurt Russell&#x27;s love interest in the action film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;. In 1987, her lead role in the cult comedy film &quot;Mannequin&quot; proved a huge success with audiences. One of her best-known film roles is that of Lieutenant Valeris in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;; Cattrall assisted in developing the character by designing her own hairstyle and even helped come up with the name. Aside from her film work, Cattrall is also a stage actress, with performances in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; and Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; to her credit. In addition, she can be heard reading the poetry of Rupert Brooke on the CD &quot;Red Rose Music SACD Sampler Volume One&quot;.
In 1997, she was cast in &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, Darren Star&#x27;s series which was broadcast on HBO. As Samantha Jones, Cattrall gained international recognition. She capitalized on her success by appearing in steamy television commercials promoting Pepsi One. &quot;Sex and the City&quot; ran for six seasons and ended as a weekly series in spring 2004 with 10.6 million viewers. Cattrall reprised the role of Samantha Jones in the 2008 &quot;Sex and the City&quot; film, as well as the 2010 sequel &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;. For her role on the television series, she was nominated for five Emmy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards, winning one in 2002. She also won two ensemble Screen Actors Guild Awards, shared with her co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon, although she never got along with them. She was ranked number eight in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 sexiest stars of all-time list in 2005. In 2008 she was honoured by the Cosmopolitan UK Ultimate Women Of The Year Awards with the &quot;Ultimate Icon Award&quot;. She was also awarded the NBC Universal Canada Award of Distinction at the 2008 Banff World TV Festival.

In 2005, she appeared in the Disney film &quot;Ice Princess&quot;, in which she played Tina Harwood, ice skating coach of the film&#x27;s lead character. She portrayed Claire, a paralysed woman who wants to die, in the West End drama revival of &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;. She appeared to rave reviews in a 2006 West End production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;The Cryptogram&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse in London. She appeared in a number of British television commercials for Tetley Tea from 2005, as well as ads for Bacardi&#x27;s Island Breeze cocktails. In 2006, a commercial for Nissan cars, which featured Cattrall as Samantha Jones, was withdrawn from New Zealand television, apparently because of complaints about its innuendo. She later starred alongside Brendan Gleeson in John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Tail&quot; (2006), a black comedy that focuses on the impact of the Celtic Tiger economy on Irish people. On ITV, she starred alongside David Haig, Daniel Radcliffe and Carey Mulligan in &quot;My Boy Jack&quot;, the story of author Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s search for his son lost in the First World War.

=== 2010s–2019 ===

Cattrall played Amelia Bly in Roman Polanski&#x27;s well-received &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (2010) and voiced the character Dee in the Canadian adult animated sitcom &quot;Producing Parker&quot;, the latter, for which she was awarded a Gemini for Best Performance in an Animated Program or Series. Cattrall has a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. While filming &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; in Marrakech, she took part in a seminar, &#x27;Being directed&#x27; with director John Boorman as part of the third edition of the Arts in Marrakech Festival. Cattrall acted opposite Matthew Macfadyen in a 2010 revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Private Lives&quot; at the Vaudeville Theatre on London&#x27;s West End, for which she received a &quot;Whats on Stage&quot; nomination for Best Actress.&quot; In the same year, Cattrall starred as Gloria Scabius (alongside Macfadyen once again) in Channel 4 adaptation of William Boyd&#x27;s novel &quot;Any Human Heart&quot;.

Cattrall played Cleopatra in a 2010 production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, directed by Janet Suzman, opposite Jeffery Kissoon as Anthony, in Liverpool at the Playhouse, with a subsequent revival at Chichester Festival Theatre (with Michael Pennington as Anthony) in 2012. In 2010, Cattrall was named an Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in recognition of her contributions to the dramatic arts. In 2011, Cattrall reprised her role as Amanda in a production of &quot;Private Lives&quot; opposite Canadian actor Paul Gross in Toronto and on Broadway. The &quot;New York Times&quot; theatre critic raved about Cattrall&#x27;s performance and she received a Drama League Award nomination. That year, Cattrall also appeared in &quot;Uptown Downstairs Abbey&quot;, the Comic Relief parody of the historical television dramas &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; and &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Playing Lady Grantham, she starred alongside Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, Victoria Wood, Harry Enfield, Patrick Barlow, Dale Winton, Olivia Colman, Tim Vine, Simon Callow, Michael Gambon and Harry Hill.

In 2013, Cattrall starred in the Old Vic&#x27;s production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, directed by Olivier Award-winner Marianne Elliott. In 2014, she starred in and executive produced HBO Canada&#x27;s &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot;, an adaptation of the 2005 British series. In 2015, the show was nominated for an International Emmy Award. The show was nominated for numerous Canadian Screen Awards with Cattrall receiving a nomination in 2017 for her role as Davina Jackson in the series. The show is now available for streaming on Netflix.

Cattrall was originally cast in the title role of Linda in a 2015 play by Penelope Skinner, to be directed by Michael Longhurst and produced at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre. She was forced to drop out of that production a few days before the opening, due to &quot;chronic, debilitating insomnia&quot;. She returned to New York and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to sleep better. The therapy was successful; it included developing certain evening rituals, removing electronic devices from her bedroom, and limiting the use of the bed to two activities, one of which would be sleeping. Meanwhile, for the scheduled opening of Skinner&#x27;s play, actress Noma Dumezweni took over the role to much acclaim and publicity. Cattrall opened up to the BBC &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on her insomnia journey and how she was able to manage it. Cattrall later returned that year to guest edit the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; to discuss &quot;Choosing to Be Child Free&quot; and &quot;Being a Parent Without Giving Birth&quot; which raised controversial response and opinions. She was also seen in 2015 on the SkyArts short &quot;Ruby Robinson&quot;, a physical comedy where Cattrall starred as Ruby, a woman living with a troupe of unusual acrobat helpers, who is taught a valuable lesson by her nephew.

Cattrall took part in the BBC Arts&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m with the Banned&quot;, the flagship event in Belarus Free Theatre&#x27;s (BFT) tenth-anniversary celebrations. Commissioned by The Space, the concert took place at London&#x27;s KOKO and was broadcast worldwide. Radical underground company BFT brought together a unique line-up of musicians and performers to stand up for artistic freedom of expression and against injustice.

In 2016, Cattrall starred in the BBC mini-series &quot;The Witness for the Prosecution&quot; based on the Agatha Christie short story. The celebrated two part mini-series was nominated for a 2017 BAFTA award for &quot;Best Mini-Series.&quot; In 2017, Cattrall also joined the cast of the hit Swedish TV show &quot;Modus&quot;, playing the President of the United States. &quot;Modus&quot; first aired in Sweden in 2015 and was later broadcast by BBC Four in the UK. The show also airs in Canada, Australia, France and Japan and is handled by FremantleMedia International. From 2018 to 2019, Cattrall starred on the Paramount+ series &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot;.

=== 2020s–present ===
In 2020, Cattrall starred on the Fox drama &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;, where she played Margaret Monreaux, the matriarch of a Southern family which has become mega-rich and famous for creating a wildly successful Christian television network. After her husband dies in a plane crash, Margaret and family are stunned to learn that he fathered three illegitimate children, all of whom are written into his will — threatening their family name and fortune. Cattrall also served as a producer on the series. Cattrall was honoured at the 2020 Atlanta TV festival with the Icon Award for the show.

Development began on a revival of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; following the cancellation of a third film adaptation. Catrall previously expressed that she did not want to return for the third film due to disagreeing with its planned storylines, involving killing off Mr. Big, and Samantha receiving nude pictures from Miranda&#x27;s 14-year-old son, Brady. The reboot titled &quot;And Just Like That...&quot; premiered in 2021. In 2022, Sarah Jessica Parker spoke on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; &quot;Award Chatter&quot; podcast about why Cattrall wasn&#x27;t asked to be a part of the revival. She stated, &quot;We did not ask her to be part of this because she made it clear that that wasn&#x27;t something she wanted to pursue, and it no longer felt comfortable for us, and so it didn&#x27;t occur to us&quot;. In 2023, however, Catrall reprised her role as Samantha for a brief cameo for the season 2 finale.

In 2021, Cattrall was cast in the &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; spinoff series, &quot;How I Met Your Father&quot; led by Hilary Duff, in the pivotal narrator role originated by Bob Saget. The series ran for two seasons. She joined Robert De Niro in the comedy film &quot;About My Father&quot; (2023) inspired by the life of stand-up comedian Sebastian Maniscalco, who also stars. Cattrall featured prominently in the permanent exhibition &quot;Wondrous Place&quot; celebrating Liverpool&#x27;s cultural heritage. In 2022, she starred on the Peacock revival series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. In 2023, Cattrall starred on the Netflix series &quot;Glamorous&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cattrall has held dual British and Canadian citizenship for most of her life and became an American citizen in 2020 in order to vote in that year&#x27;s election. Cattrall does not drink alcohol, saying that, &quot;I&#x27;m not a big drinker and when I do, I get a headache.&quot; On 21 December 1988, Cattrall narrowly escaped death when she was booked on the Pan Am Flight 103 but, a day prior, re-arranged to fly later that evening, in order to do shopping in Harrods.

===Family and relationships===
In 2009, Cattrall took part in the BBC One documentary series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. She discovered that her grandfather George Baugh disappeared in 1938, having abandoned his family (including Cattrall&#x27;s then 8-year-old mother and her two younger sisters) and turned out to have bigamously married his new wife the following year in Tudhoe; he subsequently had another four children. Cattrall was told that Baugh immigrated to Australia in 1961, became a postmaster, retired in 1972, and died in Sydney in 1974. Her mother and aunts had known nothing of their father&#x27;s life after he left until they heard what the &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; researchers had discovered, nor had the family previously seen a clear photograph of him. An edited version of the episode was later shown as a part of the U.S. series of the same name.

On 4 February 2018, Cattrall announced that her brother had disappeared in Alberta. She asked for public help in finding him, and he was found dead several hours later, having taken his own life.

Cattrall has been married three times. Her first marriage, from 1977 to 1979, was to Larry Davis, and was annulled. Her second marriage, from 1982 to 1989, was to Andre J. Lyson; the couple lived in Frankfurt, where she learned to speak German fluently, but she admits she has forgotten much of it. Her third marriage, from 1998 to 2004, was to American audio equipment designer Mark Levinson; the couple co-wrote the book &quot;Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm&quot; (2002).

Cattrall briefly dated former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau (and in 2016 was misidentified on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, from a 1981 photo, as Margaret, the mother of his sons Justin, Alexander, and Michel). She has also been connected to Brazilian-American actor Daniel Benzali, American musician Gerald Casale, French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy, and British-Sudanese actor Alexander Siddig. She has been dating BBC employee Russell Thomas since 2016.

===Recognition and philanthropy===
Cattrall has been awarded an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University in 2010, for &quot;outstanding and sustained contributions to the dramatic arts&quot;, and an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D. h.c.) from the University of British Columbia in 2018, for &quot;her contributions as an activist, advocate and humanitarian&quot;. 

Cattrall funds an annual bursary at her high school alma mater, Georges P. Vanier Secondary School in Courtenay, British Columbia. The Kim Cattrall Bursary for the Performing Arts awards $3,000 to &quot;applicants seeking post-secondary education and/or vocational training in the performing arts.&quot; In 2018, Cattrall joined Judi Dench as an ambassador for the Royal Botanical Kew Gardens in London.

<text>BBC Radio 3 is a British national radio station owned and operated by the BBC. It replaced the BBC Third Programme in 1967 and broadcasts classical music and opera, with jazz, world music, drama, culture and the arts also featuring. The station has described itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s most significant commissioner of new music&quot;.

Through its New Generation Artists scheme promotes young musicians of all nationalities. The station broadcasts the BBC Proms concerts, live and in full, each summer in addition to performances by the BBC Orchestras and Singers. There are regular productions of both classic plays and newly commissioned drama.

Radio 3 won the Sony Radio Academy UK Station of the Year Gold Award for 2009 and was nominated again in 2011. According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.9 million with a listening share of 1.6% as of March 2024.

== History ==

Radio 3 is the successor station to the Third Programme which began broadcasting on 29 September 1946. The name Radio 3 was adopted on 30 September 1967 when the BBC launched its first pop music station, Radio 1 and rebranded its national radio channels as Radio 1, Radio 2 (formerly the Light Programme), Radio 3, and Radio 4 (formerly the Home Service).

Radio 3 was the overall label applied to the collection of services which had until then gone under the umbrella title of the Third Network, namely:
*the Third Programme proper (as launched in 1946, an evenings-only offering of demanding cultural fare, both musical and spoken)
*the Music Programme (a daytime service of classical music)
*sports coverage (chiefly on Saturday afternoons) and adult educational programming in the early part of weekday evenings (known as Network Three).
All these strands, including the Third Programme, kept their separate identities within Radio 3 until 4 April 1970, when there was a further reorganisation following the introduction of the structural changes which had been outlined the previous year in the BBC document &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot;.

=== &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; ===
On 10 July 1969 the BBC published its plans for radio and television in a policy document entitled &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot;. Later described in 2002 by Jenny Abramsky, Head of Radio and Music, as &quot;the most controversial document ever produced by radio&quot;, the document outlined each station&#x27;s target audience and what content should be broadcast on each channel. This concept went against the earlier methods laid out by the BBC&#x27;s first Director General John Reith and caused controversy at the time, despite laying out the radio structure that is recognisable today.

At the time of the review, Radio 3 faced several problems. An early option to cut costs, required under the proposals, was to reduce the number of networks from four to three, so that Radio 3 would not broadcast during the day and would use the frequencies of either Radio 1 or 2 as the two stations would merge content. However &quot;Day-time serious music would be the casualty&quot; of these proposals and caused some controversy. A further rumour was expressed that Radio 3 could be closed altogether as a strong statistical case existed against the station according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. However, the Director-General, Charles Curran, publicly denied this as &quot;quite contradictory to the aim of the BBC, which is to provide a comprehensive radio service&quot;. Curran had earlier dismissed any suggestion that Radio 3&#x27;s small audience was a consideration: &quot;What is decisive is whether there is a worthwhile audience, and I mean by worthwhile an audience which will get an enormous satisfaction out of it.&quot;

As a result of &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot;, factual content, including documentaries and current affairs, were moved to BBC Radio 4 and the separate titled strands were abolished. The document stated that Radio 3 was to have &quot;a larger output of standard classical music&quot; but with &quot;some element in the evening of cultural speech programmes – poetry, plays&quot;. Equally, questions were being asked by the poet Peter Porter about whether other spoken content, for example poetry, would remain on the station. These concerns also led to the composer Peter Maxwell Davies and the music critic Edward Greenfield to fear that &quot;people would lose the mix of cultural experiences which expanded intellectual horizons&quot;. However, Radio 3 controller Howard Newby reassured these concerns by replying that only the coverage of political and economic affairs would be passed to Radio 4, and Radio 3 would keep drama, poetry, and talks by scientists, philosophers and historians.

The &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; report also proposed a large cutback in the number and size of the BBC&#x27;s orchestras. In September 1969, a distinguished campaign group entitled the Campaign for Better Broadcasting was formed to protest, with the backing of Sir Adrian Boult, Jonathan Miller, Henry Moore and George Melly. The campaign objected to &quot;the dismantling of the Third Programme by cutting down its spoken word content from fourteen hours a week to six&quot; and &quot;segregating programmes into classes&quot;. Mention of the campaign even reached debate in the House of Commons.

=== The &quot;arts&quot; controllers ===

From the launch until 1987, the controllers of Radio 3 showed preferences towards speech and arts programming as opposed to focus on classical music and the Proms. The first controller, Newby, made little contribution to the station, focusing on the transition from the Third programme to Radio 3 and as a result of the &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; report.

The second controller, Stephen Hearst who assumed the role in 1972, was different. As Hearst had previously been head of television arts features his appointment was seen with scepticism among the staff who viewed him as a populariser. According to Hearst when interviewed for Humphrey Carpenter&#x27;s book, the main rival candidate for controller Martin Esslin, head of Radio Drama, had said to the interviewing panel that audience figures should play no part in the decision making process over programming. Hearst said he responded to the same question about this issue by commenting that as the station was financed by public money it needed to consider the size of its audience – there was a minimum viable figure but this could be increased with &quot;a lively style of broadcasting&quot;.

Hearst attempted to make the content of the channel more accessible to a wider audience, but his efforts, which included the evening drivetime programme &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and Sunday phone-in request programme &quot;Your Concert Choice&quot; (the former an uninterrupted sequence of musical items identified only at the end of the programme; the latter a resurrection from the old Home Service), were criticised. However, during this time the long running arts discussion programme &quot;Critics&#x27; Forum&quot; was launched as well as themed evenings and programmes of miscellaneous music including &quot;Sounds Interesting&quot;.

In 1978, Ian McIntyre took over as controller of Radio 3 but quickly faced uncomfortable relationships between departments. At approximately the same time Aubrey Singer became managing director of Radio and began to make programming on the station more populist in a drive to retain listeners in face of possible competition from competitors using a &quot;streamed format&quot;. An example of this is the replacement of &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; in 1980 with an extended, presenter-driven programme called &quot;Mainly for Pleasure&quot;. The same year an internal paper recommended the disbandment of several of the BBC&#x27;s orchestras and of the Music Division, resulting in low morale and industrial action by musicians that delayed the start of the Proms. Senior management was also getting dissatisfied with listening figures leading to the Director-General Alasdair Milne to suggest that presentation style was &quot;too stodgy and old-fashioned&quot;.

=== The &quot;music&quot; controllers ===

In 1987 the positions of Controller of Music and Controller of Radio 3 were merged, and with it the operation of the Proms, under the former Music Controller John Drummond. Drummond, like Hearst, believed that the music programmes&#x27; presentation was too stiff and formal and he therefore encouraged announcers to be more natural and enthusiastic. Repeats of classic drama performances by the likes of John Gielgud and Paul Scofield were also included because, in his view, newer drama was &quot;gloomy and pretentious&quot;. He also introduced features and celebrations of the anniversaries of famous figures including William Glock, Michael Tippett and Isaiah Berlin. Drummond also introduced the show &quot;Mixing It&quot; which targeted the music genres that fell between Radios 1 and 3, often seen as a precursor to the programme &quot;Late Junction&quot;.

During Drummond&#x27;s time, Radio 3 also began to experiment with outside broadcasts, including an ambitious Berlin Weekend to mark the reunification of Germany in 1990, and a much praised weekend of programming that was broadcast from London and Minneapolis-St Paul – creating broadcasting history by being the first time a whole weekend had been transmitted &quot;live from another continent&quot;. However, Drummond complained about the former that &quot;not one single senior person in the BBC had listened to any part of it&quot;, reflecting his general feeling that the BBC senior management paid little attention stating: &quot;I can&#x27;t remember ever having a serious conversation with anyone above me in the BBC about Radio 3 ... I would much rather have had the feeling that they thought it mattered what Radio 3 did.&quot;
Drummond&#x27;s successor was Nicholas Kenyon, previously chief music critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;, who took over in February 1992 and was immediately faced with the looming launch date for commercial competitor Classic FM who were, and still remain, Radio 3&#x27;s biggest rivals. Kenyon, similar to Singer a decade earlier, believed that Radio 3 had to make changes to its presentation before the new station began broadcasting rather than react later. As a result, three senior producers were sent to study classical music stations in the United States and the station hired advertising agents Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to help improve public perception. Kenyon&#x27;s tenure was to meet with much controversy: in attempts to update the station&#x27;s presentation, popular announcers Malcolm Ruthven, Peter Barker and Tony Scotland were axed as well as drama being cut by a quarter, resulting in a letter of protest to &quot;The Times&quot; signed by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Fay Weldon among others; new weekday programmes for breakfast time and drive time, entitled &quot;On Air&quot; and &quot;In Tune&quot; respectfully, were launched, as was a new three-hour programme of popular classics on Sunday mornings fronted by Brian Kay.

These moves were defended by Kenyon who argued that the changes were not &quot;some ghastly descent into populism&quot; but were instead to create &quot;access points&quot; for new listeners. However, there was still &quot;widespread disbelief&quot; when it was announced in the summer that a new morning programme would take the 9am spot from the revered &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; and would be presented by a signing from Classic FM – the disc jockey Paul Gambaccini. The criticism, especially once the programme went on air a few weeks later, was so unrelenting that Gambaccini announced the following spring that he would not be renewing his contract with Radio 3.

However, Kenyon&#x27;s controllership was marked by several highly distinguished programming successes. &quot;Fairest Isle&quot; was an ambitious project from 1995 which marked the 300th anniversary of the death of Henry Purcell with a year-long celebration of British music and the programme &quot;Sounding the Century&quot;, which ran for two years from 1997, presented a retrospective of 20th-century music. Both won awards.
He also introduced a number of well received specialist programmes including children&#x27;s programme &quot;The Music Machine&quot;, early music programme &quot;Spirit of the Age&quot;, jazz showcase &quot;Impressions&quot;, vocal music programme &quot;Voices&quot; and the arts programme &quot;Night Waves&quot;.

BBC Radio 3 began nighttime transmissions in May 1996 with the introduction of &quot;Through the Night&quot;, consisting of radio recordings from members of the European Broadcasting Union and distributed to some of these other stations under the title &quot;Euroclassic Notturno&quot; since 1998. The introduction of 24-hour broadcasting resulted in the introduction of a fixed programming point at 22:00 so that if live programme overran, later programming could be cancelled to allow &quot;Through the Night&quot; to begin promptly.
In 1998, Roger Wright took over as controller of the station. Soon after his appointment some changes were made to showcase a wider variety of music; a new, relaxed, late-night music programme &quot;Late Junction&quot; featured a wide variety of genres; programmes focusing on jazz and world music were given a higher profile as were programmes presented by Brian Kay, focusing on light music, and Andy Kershaw, whose show was previously dropped by Radio 1. In these changes, Wright believed that, in the case of the former, he was addressing &quot;this feeling people had that they didn&#x27;t want to put Radio 3 on unless they were going to listen carefully&quot; and in the latter cases that he was &quot;not dumbing down but smarting up&quot; the programmes.
By 2004, Radio 3&#x27;s programming and services were being recognised by the Corporation at large, as seen in the 2003/4 Charter renewal application and the Annual report for the year which reported that Radio 3 had &quot;achieved a record [audience] reach in the first quarter of 2004&quot;, and by the government: the Secretary of State&#x27;s foreword to the government&#x27;s Green Paper in 2005 made special mention of &quot;the sort of commitment to new talent that has made Radio 3 the largest commissioner of new music in the world&quot; as a model for what the BBC should be about.

By 2008, however, the station faced pressures to increase its audience by making programmes more accessible while loyal listeners began to complain about the tone of these new changes. Presentation was described as &quot;gruesome in tone and level&quot; and global music output was mocked as &quot;street-smart fusions&quot; and &quot;global pop&quot;. At the same time RAJAR began to record lower listening figures and decisions on policy were being changed resulting in the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Making Tracks&quot;, experimental music programme &quot;Mixing It&quot;, theatre and film programme &quot;Stage and Screen&quot; and &quot;Brian Kay&#x27;s Light Programme&quot; all being dropped, a reduction in the number of concerts and format changes to several other programmes. In spite of the changes, figures still continued to fall.

The mid- to late 2000s did, however, offer new projects undertaken on the station: &quot;The Beethoven Experience&quot; in June 2005 saw the broadcast of his works broadcast non-stop for six days. A similar project occurred six months later when &quot;A Bach Christmas&quot; was run for ten days in the lead to Christmas and in February 2007 when a week was similarly given over to the works of Tchaikovsky &amp; Stravinsky, and Schubert in March 2012. As part of the original Beethoven Experience, the BBC trialled its first music downloads over the internet by offering free music downloads of all nine symphonies as played by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra under Gianandrea Noseda. The stated aim was &quot;to gauge audiences&#x27; appetite for music downloads and their preferred content, and will inform the development of the BBC strategy for audio downloads and on demand content&quot;. The experiment was wildly successful, attracting 1.4 million downloads but was met with anger from the major classical record labels who considered it unfair competition and &quot;devaluing the perceived value of music&quot;. As a result, no further free downloads have been offered, including as part of the BBC iPlayer service, and the BBC Trust has ruled out any classical music podcasts with extracts longer than one minute.
In 2007, Radio 3 also began to experiment with a visual broadcast as well as the audio transmissions. In October 2007, Radio 3 collaborated with the English National Opera in presenting a live video stream of a performance of &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;the first time a UK opera house has offered a complete production online&quot; and in September 2008, Radio 3 launched a filmed series of concerts that was available to watch live and on demand for seven days &quot;in high quality vision&quot;. This strategy was also introduced to some of the BBC Proms concerts.
By the latter years of the 2000s, Radio 3&#x27;s prospects were improving. The year 2008/9 saw the introduction of more concerts and other innovations had introduced Radio 3&#x27;s largest event to a wider audience. The introduction of family orientated concerts to the BBC Proms, which are broadcast live on Radio 3, helped the station to introduce itself to a younger audience. Innovations of this type began in 2008 with the introduction of a concert celebrating the music from the television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as composed by Murray Gold and was later followed by a further &quot;Doctor Who&quot; prom in 2010, a free family prom in 2009, another free &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; prom in 2011 and a &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; prom in 2012. These particular concerts were introduced by Wright, who became Proms Director in addition to his duties at Radio 3 in October 2007, and many were also televised for broadcast at a later date. The mix in these proms of classical music to combine with music of a classical nature from the programmes was hoped to introduce a much younger audience to the genres catered for by Radio 3.

 Radio 3 was having to undergo further changes as a result of recent findings from the BBC Trust. In the station&#x27;s latest service review, carried out in 2010, the Trust recommended the station become more accessible to new audiences, easier to navigate through the different genres and to review the output of the BBC&#x27;s orchestras and singers. Soon after this verdict, the license fee was capped and the BBC given more services to pay for with the same level of income. As a result, the corporation had to reduce its costs. In the proposal entitled &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot;, the BBC proposed that Radio 3 contribute by broadcasting 25% fewer live or specially recorded lunchtime concerts and reducing the number of specially recorded evening concerts. The Trust did recognise, however, that &quot;Radio 3 plays a vital role in the cultural and creative life of the UK&quot; and as a result, the report did agree to reinvest in the Proms, to retain the long dramas found on the station and to continue to broadcast a new concert live each evening.

The current controller of Radio 3 is Sam Jackson, who replaced Alan Davey in April 2023.

== Operation ==

BBC Radio 3 broadcasts from studios inside the 1930s wing of Broadcasting House in central London. However, in addition to these studios, certain programmes and performances are broadcast from other BBC bases including from BBC Cymru Wales&#x27; Cardiff headquarters and BBC North&#x27;s headquarters at MediaCityUK, Salford. The BBC also has recording facilities at the Royal Albert Hall, the Royal Festival Hall and the Queen Elizabeth Hall which can be used to record and broadcast performances at these London venues.

Radio 3 is broadcast on the FM band between 90.2 and 92.6 MHz, on DAB Digital Radio, the digital television services Freeview, Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk TV and Virgin Media Ireland and on BBC Sounds both online and on the app, where Radio 3 programmes can be listened back to.

On its FM frequencies, the station uses less dynamic range compression of the volume of music than rival station Classic FM. On DAB it uses dynamic range control (DRC) which allows compression to be defined by the user.

The station also uses a BBC-designed pulse-code modulation digitisation technique similar to NICAM, which is used for outside broadcasts running through a telephone line. This runs at a sample rate of 14,000 per second per channel. A similar technique was later used for recording at the same rate. In September 2010, for the final week of the Proms broadcasts, the BBC trialled XHQ (Extra High Quality), a live Internet stream transmitted at a rate of 320kbit/s, instead of Radio 3&#x27;s usual 192 kbit/s, using its AAC-LC &#x27;Coyopa&#x27; coding technology. This technology was later developed further, and Radio 3 became the first BBC Radio station to broadcast permanently in this High Definition Sound (as it has been termed) format.

== Notable programmes ==

===Current programmes===
==== &quot;Breakfast&quot; ====
BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Breakfast programme originally launched in 1992 as &quot;On Air&quot; and took on its current name in 2007. It airs every day and is on air on weekdays from 6:30am until 9:30am, with a 9:00 am finish at the weekend. Short news bulletins are broadcast on the hour. The programme is presented by Petroc Trelawny, Hannah French and Kate Molleson during the week and by Tom McKinney and Elizabeth Alker at the weekend.

==== &quot;Choral Evensong&quot; ====
The Anglican service of sung evening prayer is broadcast on Wednesday afternoons. It is broadcast live from cathedrals, university college chapels and churches throughout the UK. On occasion, it broadcasts Choral Vespers from Catholic cathedrals, (such as Westminster Cathedral), Orthodox Vespers, or a recorded service from choral foundations abroad. &quot;Choral Evensong&quot; is the BBC&#x27;s longest-running outside broadcast programme, the first edition having been relayed from Westminster Abbey on 7 October 1926. Its 80th anniversary was celebrated, also live from Westminster Abbey, with a service on 11 October 2006.

When &quot;Choral Evensong&quot; was moved from Radio 4 to Radio 3 with effect from 8 April 1970 and reduced to just one broadcast per month, the BBC received 2,500 letters of complaint, and weekly transmissions were resumed on 1 July.

In 2007 the live broadcast was switched to Sundays, which again caused protests. The live transmission was returned to Wednesdays in September 2008, with a recorded repeat on Sunday afternoons at approximately the same time. &quot;Choral Evensong&quot; forms part of Radio 3&#x27;s remit on religious programming though non-religious listeners have campaigned for its retention.

==== &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; ====

&quot;Composer of the Week&quot; was launched in the BBC Home Service on 2 August 1943 under its original title of &quot;This Week&#x27;s Composer&quot;. From 15 December 1964 the programme became a regular feature in the schedule of the newly established daytime &quot;Third Network&quot; classical music service, the Music Programme (later to be absorbed into Radio 3). The programme was renamed &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; on 18 January 1988.

Each week, in five daily programmes, the work of a particular composer is studied in detail and illustrated with musical excerpts. Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Handel have all featured once most years, a different aspect of their work being chosen for study each time. However, the programme also covers more &#x27;difficult&#x27; or less-widely known composers, with weeks devoted to Rubbra, Medtner, Havergal Brian, Kapralova, and the Minimalists among others. On 2 August 2013, in honour of the station&#x27;s 70th year, listeners were asked to nominate a composer who had never before been featured for a special broadcast at Christmas. The composer listeners chose was Louise Farrenc. The programme is written and presented by either Donald Macleod or Kate Molleson.

==== &quot;Classical Live&quot; ====

Two programs formerly showcased live or recorded performances from venues across the country. 

&quot;Lunchtime&quot; was from 1to 2pm and &quot;Afternoon&quot; continued until 5 pm, with presenters being rotated weekly for the latter program. The live Monday edition of &quot;Lunchtime&quot; was repeated on Sunday at the same time.

From 2024, these were merged as &quot;Classical Live&quot;.

==== &quot;The Early Music Show&quot; ====

&quot;The Early Music Show&quot; presents European music dating up to the time of Bach, broadcast at 2pm each Sunday. Episodes cover the music, the performers, and occasional discussions of musical style. Regular presenters include Lucie Skeaping and Hannah French.

====&quot;In Tune&quot;====

&quot;In Tune&quot; is &quot;Radio 3&#x27;s flagship early evening music programme&quot;. It was first broadcast on 13 July 1992 and was launched in response to the forthcoming launch of the competitor radio station Classic FM. Since 1997 the programme has been presented by Sean Rafferty and (since 2017) Katie Derham, and features a mix of live and recorded classical and jazz music, interviews with musicians, and arts news. The show is noted for its relaxed, convivial style of presentation.

==== &quot;Jazz Record Requests&quot; ====
&quot;Jazz Record Requests&quot; was the first weekly jazz programme on the Third Programme. First presented by the jazz musician Humphrey Lyttelton, the 30-minute programme was launched on 12 December 1964 and is still running. Now an hour long, it was broadcast on Saturdays, usually in the late afternoon, until October 2019 when it moved to Sunday afternoon. Presenters of it on Radio 3 have included Ken Sykora, Steve Race, Peter Clayton, Charles Fox and Geoffrey Smith. Alyn Shipton became the presenter in May 2012.

==== &quot;Opera on 3&quot; ====
Broadcast on Saturday nights between 6 and 9:30pm, &quot;Opera on 3&quot; features live performances by the Metropolitan Opera from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City.

==== &quot;The Proms&quot; ====
The annual BBC Proms concerts are broadcast live each summer on Radio 3. Broadcasting the Proms began in 1927, when the Third Programme transmitted the Thirty-Second Season of the Promenade Concerts live from the Queen&#x27;s Hall, conducted by Sir Henry Wood. The BBC&#x27;s involvement with the Proms led to the creation of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Wireless Orchestra to perform music. Television transmission began in 1947 and today, selected concerts are also simulcast on BBC Four. Promenade concerts are centred on the Royal Albert Hall with broadcasts from other venues around the UK.

==== &quot;Radio 3 in Concert&quot; ====
&quot;Radio 3 in Concert&quot; (originally &quot;Live in Concert&quot;) is a weeknight programme, broadcast between 7:30 and 10pm, with recorded concerts from various venues around the country and Europe. Regular presenters include Nicola Heywood-Thomas, Martin Handley and Petroc Trelawny. The last broadcast with the &quot;Live in Concert&quot; name was on 15 July 2015.

&quot;Record Review&quot; is a Saturday morning programme (usually airing from 9am to 11:45am) dealing with recent classical music releases, topical issues and interviews. The programme title is a return of &quot;Record Review&quot; which was broadcast on Network Three occasionally from 1949, then weekly from 1957. the regular presenter of &quot;Record Review&quot; is Andrew McGregor.

From 1998 to 2015 it became &quot;CD Review&quot;, until on 2 January 2016, its title reverted to &quot;Record Review&quot; to reflect the diversity of media proliferating (CDs, downloads, streaming, and so forth).

===Former programmes===

==== &quot;Pied Piper&quot; ====
&quot;Pied Piper&quot; was a children&#x27;s programme, presented by early music specialist, David Munrow, with the sub-title Tales and Music for Younger Listeners and ran from August 1971 until 1976. Lively and varied, it was aimed at the 6–12 age group, though much older children and adults also listened. The programme ran for five series and a total of 655 episodes until Munrow&#x27;s death in May 1976.

==== &quot;The Verb&quot; ====
This show, presented by poet Ian McMillan, is described as a &quot;cabaret of the word, featuring the best poetry, new writing and performance&quot;. It broadcast for 44 minutes at 10pm on Friday nights until March 2024, when it moved over to BBC Radio 4.

== News broadcasts ==

BBC Radio 3&#x27;s remit focuses mainly on music and the arts, and news is a minor part of its output, though the station does provide concise news bulletins every half hour from 06:30 to 08:30 throughout the &quot;Breakfast&quot; programme and also at 13:00 and 18:00 to give listeners the chance to switch to a more news-oriented station should they want more details about a particular news item. Following the &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot; proposals, it was suggested that Radio 3 share bulletins with Radio 4, so that the same bulletins would be broadcast on both channels. During weekdays the 1pm and 6pm news bulletins are read by a member of the Radio 4 presentation team.

From 30 March until 12 July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Radio 3 bespoke bulletins were replaced by network news bulletins from BBC Radio 2. These were broadcast at 08:00, 13:00 and 18:00 on weekdays, and at 08:00 and 13:00 on weekends. This format came back into effect from 24 December 2020 until 4 April 2021. Since then, normal service resumed with the exception of the 5pm bulletins, which were dropped entirely. 

As a result of the changes to the Radio 3 schedule that came into effect from April 2024, the Sunday 13:00 news summary was brought forward by an hour to 12:00.

== Performing groups ==
Much of Radio 3&#x27;s orchestral output is sourced from the BBC&#x27;s Orchestras and Singers. These groups are:

* The BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Chorus, based in London
* The BBC Concert Orchestra, based in Watford
* The BBC Philharmonic, based in Salford
* The BBC National Orchestra of Wales and the BBC National Chorus of Wales, based in Cardiff
* The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, based in Glasgow
* The BBC Singers, based in London.

In addition to the BBC&#x27;s own orchestras it also has broadcast commitments to the BBC Big Band, which is externally managed, and also broadcasts some works of the Ulster Orchestra, which it part funds.

== Controllers ==

* 19671971 Howard Newby
: An author, he published four novels during his time at the Third Programme/Radio 3, winning the first Booker Prize for fiction in 1969. Oversaw the implementation of &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; and an increase in the amount of classical music on Radio 3.
* 19721978 Stephen Hearst
: Previously head of BBC&#x27;s television music and arts department, Hearst attempted to make Radio 3 more accessible to a wider audience by introducing drivetime and request programmes as well as themed weekends. Some of these ventures were poorly viewed by critics.
* 19791987 Ian McIntyre
: Previously controller of Radio 4, McIntyre faced budgetary cuts that closed several orchestras and uncomfortable relations with the Music Division. The possibility of future competition to Radio 3 also resulted in more programmes viewed as populist by critics in an attempt to retain listeners.
* 19871992 John Drummond
: Previously an artistic administrator for events including the Edinburgh Festival, Drummond introduced repeats of classic drama performances and celebrations of artists anniversaries. His work also included programmes targeting fringe genres and ambitious outside broadcasts.
* 19921998 Nicholas Kenyon
: Kenyon, previously chief music critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;, made many controversial decisions relating to accessibility to the service in light of the launch of Classic FM including new drive time programmes. However several celebrated programmes and series of programmes were launched and Radio 3 began 24-hour broadcasting.
* 19982014 Roger Wright
: Wright attempted to ensure that all of the station&#x27;s musical genres were represented more equitably, and to &quot;smarten up&quot; programmes. While some of these measures were recognised by the BBC and Government, the audience began to decrease, and attempts by Wright to make programmes more accessible were met with complaints from listeners. It was announced in March 2014 that Wright would step down in early September 2014.
* 20152023 Alan Davey
: Davey became Controller in January 2015, having been chief executive of Arts Council England since 2008.
*2023present Sam Jackson
: Jackson became controller after a career in the music industry, most recently as Executive Vice-President of Global Classics &amp; Jazz for Universal Music Group.

== Criticisms ==

Controller Nicholas Kenyon summed up the perennial problem of Radio 3 as &quot;the tension between highbrow culture and popular appeal …the cost of what we do and the number of people who make use of it&quot;: elitism versus populism (or &#x27;dumbing down&#x27;) and the question of cost per listener. This argument has included members of the BBC, listeners and several different protest groups.

In 1969, two hundred members of the BBC staff protested to the director general at changes which would &#x27;emasculate&#x27; Radio 3, while managing director of radio Ian Trethowan described the station in a memorandum as &quot;a private playground for elitists to indulge in cerebral masturbation&quot;. Later, former Radio 3 controller John Drummond complained that the senior ranks of the BBC took no interest in what he was doing.

In 1995/6 listeners and press critics protested against the introduction into a slot formerly used for Composer of the Week of a programme presented by Paul Gambaccini, a former Radio 1 and Classic FM presenter. This was seen as part of a wider move towards popularisation, to compete with Classic FM and to increase ratings. Gambaccini is quoted as saying: &quot;I had a specific mission to invite [Radio 4&#x27;s] Today listeners to stay with the BBC rather than go to Classic FM.&quot;

Several groups were formed to protest against any changes to the station. These have included:

* The Third Programme Defence Society (1957) opposed cuts in broadcasting hours and the removal of what the BBC considered &quot;too difficult and too highbrow&quot;. Supported by TS Eliot, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Laurence Olivier
* The Campaign for Better Broadcasting (1969) opposed proposed cuts in Radio 3&#x27;s speech output. Supported by Sir Adrian Boult, Jonathan Miller, Henry Moore, George Melly.
* Friends of Radio 3 (FoR3), a listeners&#x27; campaign group set up in 2003 to express concern at changes to the station&#x27;s style and scheduling, including the shift to presenter-led programmes stripped through the week, as on Classic FM and other commercial music stations. Officially, the BBC stated that &quot;the network&#x27;s target audience has been redefined and broadened and the schedule began to be recast to move towards this during 1999.&quot; The group&#x27;s stated aim is &quot;To engage with the BBC, to question the policies which depart from Radio 3&#x27;s remit to deliver a high quality programme of classical music, spoken arts and thought, and to convey listener concerns to BBC management.&quot; The group is supported by Dame Gillian Weir, Robin Holloway, Andrew Motion, Dame Margaret Drabble. The BBC has rejected claims that the network has &#x27;dumbed down&#x27;.

In March 2019, more than 500 signatories including Jarvis Cocker, Shabaka Hutchings, and Norma Waterson called on the BBC &quot;to think again about changes to its schedules&quot;, as a result of proposed cuts to specialist music programming on the station.

<text>The Lok Sabha, also known as the House of the People, is the lower house of Parliament of India which is bicameral, where the upper house is Rajya Sabha. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by an adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the president of India on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the New Parliament House, New Delhi.

The maximum membership of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 (Initially, in 1950, it was 500.) Currently, the house has 543 seats which are filled by the election of up to 543 elected members. Between 1952 and 2020, two additional members of the Anglo-Indian community were also nominated by the President of India on the advice of the Government of India, which was abolished in January 2020 by the One Hundred and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India. The new parliament has a seating capacity of 888 for Lok Sabha.

A total of 131 seats (24.03%) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes (84) and Scheduled Tribes (47). The quorum for the House is 10% of the total membership. The Lok Sabha, unless sooner dissolved, continues to operate for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. However, while a state of emergency in India is in operation, this period may be extended by Parliament of India by law or decree.

An exercise to redraw Lok Sabha constituencies&#x27; boundaries is carried out by the Boundary Delimitation Commission of India every decade based on the census of India, the last of which was conducted in 2011. This exercise earlier also included redistribution of seats among states based on demographic changes but that provision of the mandate of the commission was suspended in 1976 following a constitutional amendment to incentivize the family planning program which was being implemented. The 18th Lok Sabha was elected in May 2024 and is the latest to date.

The Lok Sabha proceedings are televised live on channel Sansad TV, headquartered within the premises of Parliament.

== History ==
A major portion of the Indian subcontinent was under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During this period, the office of the Secretary of State for India (along with the Council of India) was the authority through whom British Parliament exercised its rule in the Indian sub-continent, and the office of Viceroy of India was created, along with an Executive Council in India, consisting of high officials of the British government. The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members. The Indian Councils Act 1892 established legislatures in each of the provinces of British India and increased the powers of the Legislative Council. Although these Acts increased the representation of Indians in the government, their power remained limited, and the electorate very small. The Indian Councils Act 1909 admitted some Indians to the various councils. The Government of India Act 1919 further expanded the participation of Indians in the administration, creating the Central Legislative Assembly, for which Parliament House, New Delhi, was built and opened in 1927.

The Government of India Act 1935 introduced provincial autonomy and proposed a federal structure in India. The Indian Independence Act 1947, passed by the British parliament on 18 July 1947, divided British India (which did not include the Princely states) into two newly independent countries, India and Pakistan, which were to be dominions under the Crown until they had each enacted a new constitution. The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations, with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion.

The Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950, proclaiming India to be a sovereign, democratic republic. This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form, which now included all the princely states which had not acceded to Pakistan.

According to &quot;Article 79 (Part V-The Union.)&quot; of the Constitution of India, the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha).

The Lok Sabha (House of the People) was duly constituted for the first time on 17 April 1952 after the first General Elections held from 25 October 1951 to 21 February 1952.

=== List ===
== Qualifications ==
&quot;Article 84&quot; (under Part V. – The Union) of Indian Constitution sets qualifications for being a member of Lok Sabha, which are as follows:
# They should be a citizen of India, and must subscribe before the Election Commission of India, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution.
# They should not be less than 25 years of age.
# They possess other such qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by the Parliament.
# They should not be proclaimed criminal i.e. they should not be a convict, a confirmed debtor or otherwise disqualified by law; and
# They should have their name in the electoral rolls in any part of the country.

However, a member can be disqualified from being a member of Parliament:
# If they hold the office of profit;
# If they are of unsound mind and stand so declared by a competent court
# If they are an undischarged insolvent;
# If they are not a citizen of India, or have voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or are under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State;
# If they are violating party discipline (as per the Tenth Schedule of the constitution); disqualified under Representation of People Act.
A seat in the Lok Sabha will become vacant in the following circumstances (during the normal functioning of the House):
# When the holder of the seat, by writing to the speaker, resigns.
# When the holder of the seat is absent from 60 consecutive days of proceedings of the House, without prior permission of the Speaker.
# When the holder of the seat is subject to any disqualifications mentioned in the Constitution or any law enacted by Parliament.
# A seat may also be vacated when the holder stands disqualified under the &#x27;Anti-Defection Law&#x27;.
Furthermore, as per &quot;article 101&quot; (Part V.—The Union) of the Indian Constitution, a person cannot be:
# A member of both Houses of Parliament and provision shall be made by Parliament by law for the vacation by a person who is chosen a member of both Houses of his seat in one House or the other.
# A member both of Parliament and of a House of the Legislature of a State.

=== System of elections in Lok Sabha ===
Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people of India, based on universal suffrage. Elections are by the people directly to the Lok Sabha and each state is divided into territorial constituencies under two provisions of the Constitution:
# Each state is allotted several seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population was as close to uniform as possible. This provision does not apply to states having a population of less than 6 million. The number of seats per state has been frozen under the constitutional amendment of 1976.
# Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it (in each case, one) remain the same throughout the state. This principle is upheld by the boundary reviews mentioned above.

Notes:
#The expression &quot;population&quot; while distributing seats among states refers to the population ascertained at the census of 1971, per the Constitutional Amendment of 1976.
#The expression &quot;population&quot; while distributing constituencies within a state refers to the population ascertained at the census of 2011.

== Powers ==

The Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha.

*Motions of no confidence against the government can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. If passed by a majority vote, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resign collectively. The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion and hence has no real power over the executive. This is because the Constitution of India has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha, not to the Rajya Sabha.
*Money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, and upon being passed, are sent to the Rajya Sabha, where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days. If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha, or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House, or recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha are not accepted by the Lok Sabha, the bill is considered passed. The budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister in the name of the President of India.
*In matters about non-financial (ordinary) bills, after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha), it is sent to the other house, where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months. If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House, or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house, it results in a deadlock. This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses, presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a simple majority. Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard, in reality, it is the Lok Sabha&#x27;s opinions that mostly prevail—due to its bigger numerical strength.
*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any Bill for Constitutional Amendment (by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting).
*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the impeachment of the President (by two-thirds of the membership of the House).
*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in the impeachment process (initiating and passing a motion for the removal) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts (by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two-thirds majority of the members present and voting), who then can be removed by the President of India.
*Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency (by two-thirds majority) or constitutional emergency (by simple majority) in a state.
*If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a National Emergency, the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament. It cannot be dissolved. This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha. But there is a possibility that the president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six-month if the said proclamation ceases to operate.

In conclusion, the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters. Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing, the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength. This is typical of parliamentary democracies, many of which have a lower house that is more powerful than the upper.

== Procedure ==
=== Procedure in the House ===
The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by the Speaker from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha. The items of business, a notice of which is received from the Ministers/ Private Members and admitted by the Speaker, are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance.

=== Sessions ===
The period during which the House meets to conduct its business is called a session. The Constitution empowers the President to summon each House at such intervals that there should not be more than a six-month gap between the two sessions. Hence the Parliament must meet at least twice a year. But, three sessions of Lok Sabha are held in a year:
*Budget session: February to May.
*Monsoon session: July to September.
*Winter session: November to mid-December.

When in session, Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 p.m. depending upon the business before the House. Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays.

=== Question Hour ===
The first hour of every sitting is called Question Hour. Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members, and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres. Every minister whose turn it is to answer questions has to stand up and answer for his department&#x27;s acts of omission or commission.

Questions are of three types—Starred, Unstarred, and Short Notice. A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark. An unstarred question is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked. An answer to such a question is given in writing. A minimum period of notice for starred/unstarred questions is 10 clear days. If the questions given notice are admitted by the Speaker, they are listed and printed for an answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains.

The normal period of notice does not apply to short-notice questions that relate to matters of urgent public importance. However, a short-notice question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice. A short-notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour, popularly known as Zero Hour.

=== Zero Hour ===
The time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as &quot;Zero Hour&quot;. It starts at around noon (hence the name) and members can, with prior notice to the Speaker, raise issues of importance during this time. Typically, discussions on important Bills, the Budget, and other issues of national importance take place from 2 p.m. onwards.

=== Business after Question Hour ===
After the Question Hour, the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day. These may consist of one or more of the following: Adjournment Motions, Questions involving breaches of Privileges, Papers to be laid on the Table, Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha, Intimations regarding President&#x27;s assent to Bills, Calling Attention Notices, Matters under Rule 377, Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee, Presentation of Petitions, miscellaneous statements by Ministers, Motions regarding elections to Committees, Bills to be withdrawn or introduced.

=== Main business ===
The main business of the day may be consideration of a bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion.

==== Legislative business ====
Legislative proposals in the form of a bill can be brought forward either by a minister or by an individual member. In the former case, it is known as a government bill and in the latter case, it is known as a private members&#x27; bill. Every bill passes through three stages—each called readings—before it is passed. To become law it must be passed by both the houses of Parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and then assented to by the president.

==== Financial business ====
The presentation, discussion of, and voting on the annual general and railways budgets—followed by the passing of the appropriations Bill and the finance bill—is a long, drawn-out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its budget session every year.

==== Motions and resolutions ====
Among other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions. Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by the government or by individual members. The government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the house on an important matter of policy or a grave situation. Similarly, an individual member may move a resolution or motion to draw the attention of the house and the government to a particular problem. The last two and half hours of sitting every Friday are generally allotted for the transaction of individual members&#x27; business. While private members&#x27; bills are taken up on one Friday, private members&#x27; resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday, and so on.

=== Parliamentary committees ===
Most of the business of drafting a bill or amendments is initially discussed and debated in the parliamentary committees. Since the time for legislation is limited, the work of all departments of the government and any special focus tasks are delegated to the committees, wherein the committees shall prepare the initial draft of the bill/amendment for consideration by both the houses. They consist of members of both houses.

There are primarily two kinds of parliamentary committees based on their nature:-
* Parliament Standing Committees (PSC) – Permanent in nature, reconstituted from time to time with every new election.
** Department based
** Others
* Ad hoc committees – Created for a specific purpose and ceases to exist when that purpose is achieved.

=== Half-an-Hour discussion ===
A half-an-hour discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact. Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion. Usually, the half-an-hour discussion is listed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only. In one session, a member is allowed to raise not more than two half-hour discussions. During the discussion, the member, who has given notice, makes a short statement, and not more than four members, who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places on the ballot, are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact. Thereafter, the minister makes replies. There is no formal motion before the house nor voting.

=== Discussion on matters of urgent public importance ===
Members may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker. Such discussions may take place two days a week. No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion.

=== Debate in the House ===
After the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken, other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them. Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the chair. A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided to employ a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member.

==== Division ====
A division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained. Normally, when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying &quot;Aye&quot; or &quot;No&quot; from their seats. The chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House. If a member challenges the decision, the chair orders that the lobbies be cleared. Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes. Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides. After the bell stops, all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over. Then the chair puts the question for a second time and declares whether in its opinion the &quot;Ayes&quot; or the &quot;Noes&quot;, have it. If the opinion so declared is again challenged, the chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment.

=== Automatic vote recording system ===
With the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes, the Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha presses the button of a keyboard. Then a gong sounds, serving as a signal to members for casting their votes. To vote, each member present in the chamber has to flip a switch and then operate one of the three pushbuttons fixed in their seat. The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds. There are two indicator boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker&#x27;s chair in the chamber. Each vote cast by a member is flashed here. Immediately after the votes are cast, they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the result indicator boards installed in the railings of the Speakers and diplomatic galleries.

Divisions are normally held with the aid of automatic vote recording equipment. Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of the relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. In the Lok Sabha, divisions may be held either by the distribution of &#x27;Aye&#x27;/&#x27;No&#x27; and &#x27;Abstention&#x27; slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies. There is an indicator board in the machine room showing the name of each member. The result of the division and vote cast by each member with the aid of automatic vote recording equipment also appear on this board and immediately a photograph of the indicator board is taken. Later the photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted &#x27;Ayes&#x27; and for &#x27;Noes&#x27; are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha debates.

=== Publication of debates ===
Three versions of Lok Sabha debates are prepared: the Hindi version, the English version, and the original version. Only the Hindi and English versions are printed. The original version, in cyclostyled form, is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference. The Hindi version contains proceedings (all questions asked and answers are given thereto and speeches made) in Hindi and verbatim Hindi translation of proceedings in English or regional languages. The English version contains proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings take place in Hindi or any regional language. The original version, however, contains proceedings in Hindi or English as they actually took place in the House and also the English/Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages.

If conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses, a joint sitting is held to resolve the differences. In such a session, the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail, since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha.

== Officers of Lok Sabha ==

;Speaker and Deputy Speaker
As per &quot;Article 93&quot; of the Indian Constitution, the Lok Sabha has a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker. In the Lok Sabha, both presiding officers — the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker — are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House. No specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected Speaker; the Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House. But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker. Vacation and resignation of, and removal from, the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India. As per &quot;Article 94&quot; of the Indian Constitution, a Speaker or a Deputy Speaker should vacate their office, a) if they cease to be a member of the House of the People, b) they resign, or c) is removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority.

The Speaker of Lok Sabha is both a member of the House and its Presiding Officer. The Speaker conducts the business in the House. They decide whether a bill is a money bill or not. They maintain discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them. They permit the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the motion of no confidence, motion of adjournment, motion of censure and calling attention notice as per the rules. The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting. It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure. Following the 52nd Constitution amendment, the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection. The Speaker makes obituary references in the House, formal references to important national and international events, and the valedictory address after every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires. Though a member of the House, the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision. To date, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote. While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence/resignation/removal, the duties of the office are performed by the Deputy Speaker or, if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant, by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose. The Lok Sabha has also a separate non-elected Secretariat staff.

Shri G. V. Mavalankar was the first Speaker of Lok Sabha (15 May 1952 – 27 February 1956) and Shri M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar was the first Deputy Speaker (30 May 1952 – 7 March 1956). In the 17th Lok Sabha, Om Birla is the current Speaker.

;Secretariat
The Secretariat of Lok Sabha was set up according to the provisions contained in Article 98 of the Constitution. The said Article, which provides for a separate secretarial staff for each House of Parliament, reads as follows:- 98. Secretariat of Parliament – Each House of Parliament shall have a separate secretarial staff: Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both Houses of Parliament. (2) Parliament may by law regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to the secretarial staff of either House of Parliament.

The Lok Sabha Secretariat functions under the overall guidance and control of the Speaker. The main activities of the Secretariat &quot;inter alia&quot; include the following:

(i) providing secretarial assistance and support to the effective functioning of the House of the People (Lok Sabha) possible to Members of Lok Sabha; (ii) providing amenities as admissible to Members of Lok Sabha; (iii) servicing the various Parliamentary Committees; (iv) preparing research and reference material and bringing out various publications; (v) recruitment of manpower in the Lok Sabha Secretariat and attending to personnel matters; &amp; (vi) preparing and publishing a record of the day-to-day proceedings of the Lok Sabha and bringing out such other publications, as may be required concerning the functioning of the Lok Sabha and its Committees, among other things.

In the discharge of his constitutional and statutory responsibilities, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is assisted by the Secretary-General, who holds the rank equivalent to the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India. The Secretary-General, in turn, is assisted by senior functionaries at the level of Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary and other officers and staff of the Secretariat. Since November 2020, the Secretary-General of Lok Sabha is Utpal Kumar Singh, IAS.

== Lok Sabha general elections ==

Each Lok Sabha is constituted after a general election:
== Statewise representation ==

As of 26 January 2020, the Lok Sabha is composed of 543 members
 made up of up to 524 members representing the people of 28 states and 19 members representing people of 8 Union territories based on their population. While maximum seats can now go up to 550 even though maximum size of the Lok Sabha as outlined in the Constitution of India, at its commencement, was 552 members because after The Constitution (One Hundred and Fourth Amendment) Act, 2019, Article 334 (b) of the Constitution of India was maintained at seventy years.

<doc id="275458" wikidata="Q585100" url="?curid=275458" title="The Right to Be Lazy">
<text>The Right to Be Lazy (French: &quot;Le Droit à la paresse&quot;) is a book by Paul Lafargue, published in 1883. In it, Lafargue, a French socialist, opposes the labour movement&#x27;s fight to expand wage labour rather than abolish or at least limit it. According to Lafargue, wage labour is tantamount to slavery, and to fight as a labour movement for the extension of slavery is preposterous. In the book, Lafargue proposes the right to be lazy, in contrast to the right to work, which he deems bourgeois.

== Introduction ==
After an initial quote from Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (&quot;Let us be lazy in everything, except in loving and drinking, except in being lazy&quot;), the book&#x27;s introduction reads: &quot;A strange delusion possesses the working classes of the nations where capitalist civilization holds its sway. This delusion drags in its train the individual and social woes which for two centuries have tortured sad humanity. This delusion is the love of work, the furious passion for work, pushed even to the exhaustion of the vital force of the individual and his progeny. Instead of opposing this mental aberration, the priests, the economists and the moralists have cast a sacred halo over work.&quot;

== Content ==
According to Lafargue, it is sheer madness that people are fighting for the right to an eight-hour working day. In other words, eight hours of servitude, exploitation and suffering, when it is leisure, joy, and self-realisation that should be fought for, and as few hours of slavery as possible. Automation, which had already come a long way in Lafargue&#x27;s time, could easily reduce working hours to three or four hours a day. This would leave a large part of the day for the things we really want to do, such as to spend time with friends, relax, enjoy life, and be lazy. Lafargue argues the machine is the saviour of humanity only if the working time it frees up becomes leisure time. The time that is freed up is usually converted into more hours of work, which he compares to more hours of toil and drudgery. Working too many hours a day is often degrading, while working very few hours can be very refreshing and enriching, leading to general advancement, health, joy, and satisfaction. He is also polemical against human rights, and instead prefers the right to be lazy.

Originating in the 1940s with the work of Pierre Schaeffer, they were used among contemporary composers of 1950s and 1960s, such as Éliane Radigue, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and Karlheinz Stockhausen, who used them to create phase patterns, rhythms, textures, and timbres. Popular music authors of 1960s and 1970s, particularly in psychedelic, progressive and ambient genres, used tape loops to accompany their music with innovative sound effects. In the 1980s, analog audio and tape loops with it gave way to digital audio and application of computers to generate and process sound.

==Description==
In a tape loop, a section of magnetic tape is cut and spliced end-to-end, creating a circle or loop which can be played continuously, usually on a reel-to-reel tape recorder, making the sound repeat endlessly.

Simultaneous playing of tape loops to create patterns and rhythms was developed and initially used by musique concrète and tape music composers, and was most extensively utilized by Steve Reich for his &quot;phasing&quot; pieces such as &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966) and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965), and by Karlheinz Stockhausen in &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56) and &quot;Kontakte&quot; (1958–60). Stockhausen also used the technique for live performance in &quot;Solo&quot; (1965–66).

If, instead of simply playing back a recorded loop, something is done to progressively alter the recorded material between cycles, such as re-recording the sound before it passes the playback head or adding new material to the loop, then a process of change will occur in the content, quality and complexity of the material.

On a standard reel-to-reel tape recorder, one loop can be no more than few seconds long. Some composers were satisfied with this approach, but there were other methods to allow for longer loops. For example, placing two reel-to-reel machines side by side with the tape path running from the one to the other. By using this method, some composers could create very long loops which allowed for sounds of greater duration. When recording his landmark 1978 ambient album &quot;Music for Airports&quot;, Brian Eno reported that for a particular song, &quot;One of the tape loops was seventy-nine feet long and the other eighty-three feet&quot;. The longest open tape loop ever created was made by Barry Anderson for performances of Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Solo&quot;, but closed cartridges commonly make much longer lengths available.

By accelerating the speed of a loop to a sufficient degree (e.g., 1,280 times faster), a sequence of events originally perceived as a rhythm becomes heard as a pitch, and variation of the rhythm in the original succession of events produces different timbres in the accelerated sound. The maximum available acceleration of most three-speed tape recorders is four times.

==History==
In the late 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer used special phonograph discs with a &quot;sillon fermé&quot; (closed groove) to repeat segments of sounds in his &quot;musique concrète&quot; studio in Paris. When magnetic tape technology became available, he replaced this technique with tape loops, where such segments could either be simply repeated, or could undergo electronic transformation during repetition.

In 1955, Éliane Radigue, an apprentice of Pierre Schaeffer at Studio d&#x27;Essai, learned to cut, splice and edit tape using his techniques. However, in the late 60s she became more interested in tape feedback. She composed several pieces (&quot;Jouet Electronique&quot; [1967], &quot;Elemental I&quot; [1968], &quot;Stress-Osaka&quot; [1969]&quot;, Usral&quot; [1969]&quot;, Ohmnht&quot; [1970] &quot;Vice Versa, etc&quot; [1970]) by processing the feedback between two tape recorders and a microphone.

Halim El-Dabh, who experimented with tape music from the early 1940s to the 1950s, also utilized tape loops. Beginning in the late 1950s, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop began using tape loops to add special effects to some BBC programming. Several different configurations of tape loops were employed in the early years of the WDR Studio in Cologne. One such arrangement was used to build up multilayered textures by sequentially recording sounds with the erase head disconnected or with a customised arrangement of the heads. Gottfried Michael Koenig applied this method in 1954, in his &quot;Klangfiguren I&quot;.

In Canada, Hugh Le Caine produced &quot;a particularly clear and memorable example of &quot;musique concrète&quot;&quot; in 1955 titled &quot;Dripsody&quot;. It was built from the sound of a single drop of water, using a variable-speed tape recorder, tape loops, and just 25 splices. At this same time in Cologne, Karlheinz Stockhausen produced a more ambitious work, &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56), which made extensive use of tape loops, particularly for its stratified impulse groups and choral swarms.

Minimalist composer Terry Riley began employing tape loops at the end of the 1950s. Using simple Wollensak tape recorders, he recorded piano music, speech and other sound samples, which he would reproduce on speakers surrounding the audience along with live performance, creating &quot;orchestral textures&quot;, as Edward Strickland puts it. With assistance of Richard Maxfield and Ramon Sender, Riley combined tape loops with echoplex devices, producing an &quot;acid trip&quot; piece &quot;Mescalin Mix&quot; (1961), made from sound samples from his earlier works. Later, he experimented with combining different tapes together, producing pieces such as &quot;Music for the Gift&quot; (1963) and culminating in his use of a tape delay/feedback system employing two tape recorders (collectively described by Riley as the &quot;time lag accumulator&quot;) in live solo performances.

The use of tape loops in popular music dates back to Jamaican dub music in the 1960s. Dub producer King Tubby used tape loops in his productions, while improvising with homemade delay units. Another dub producer, Sylvan Morris, developed a slapback echo effect by using both mechanical and handmade tape loops. These techniques were later adopted by hip hop musicians in the 1970s.

Steve Reich also used tape loops to compose, using a technique which he called &quot;phasing&quot;. He would put two tape loops together at slightly different speeds, so they would start playing simultaneously and then drift apart. Pieces created by this method are &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965) and &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966). In &quot;Violin Phase&quot; (1967) he combined the tape loop with an instrumental score. Later on, Gavin Bryars explored a similar concept in composition &quot;1, 2, 1-2-3-4&quot; (1971), played by a small ensemble in which every musician independently tried to reproduce tape recording.

In the 1960s and 1970s, use of tape loops made a breakthrough in popular music. As they progressed towards their &quot;psychedelic&quot; phase, the Beatles increasingly experimented with new technology and tape recorders, a process which culminated with &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) and its last track &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, based on five tape loops running simultaneously. &quot;Revolution 9&quot; (1968) was an even more experimental venture, consisting almost entirely of tape loops fading in and out.

Introduction of new technologies, such as analog music sequencers and synthesizers in the 1970s, followed by digital sequencers in 1977, marked an end of the tape loop era in the music industry. With the advent of MIDI in 1983, computers and digital devices took over the production of sound effects from analog devices. Tape loop compositions have seen only sporadic revivals since, such as William Basinski&#x27;s &quot;The Disintegration Loops&quot; series (2002–2003), evidencing the slow death of his tapes originally recorded in the 1980s.

<text>John Richard Schlesinger ( ; 16 February 1926 – 25 July 2003) was an English film and stage director, and actor. He emerged in the early 1960s as a leading light of the British New Wave, before embarking on a successful career in Hollywood, often directing films dealing frankly in provocative subject matter, combined with his status as one of the rare openly gay directors working in mainstream films.

Schlesinger started his career making British dramas &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962), &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963), and &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967). He won the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969) and was Oscar-nominated for &quot;Darling&quot; (1965) and &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971). He gained acclaim for his Hollywood films &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), and &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976). His later films include &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; (1988) and &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1995). He also served as an associate director of the Royal National Theatre.

Over his career he received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, and four BAFTA Awards as well as nominations for three Golden Globe Awards. In 1970, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 Birthday Honours for services to film, and in 2002, he was made a BAFTA Fellow. Four of Schlesinger&#x27;s films are on the British Film Institute&#x27;s Top 100 British films.

==Early life==
Schlesinger was born and raised in Hampstead, London, in a Jewish family, the eldest of five children of distinguished Emmanuel College, Cambridge–educated paediatrician and physician Bernard Edward Schlesinger (1896–1984), who had also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a brigadier, and his wife Winifred Henrietta, daughter of Hermann Regensburg, a stockbroker from Frankfurt. She had left school at 14 to study at the Trinity College of Music, and later studied languages at the University of Oxford for three years. Bernard Schlesinger&#x27;s father Richard, a stockbroker, had come to England in the 1880s from Frankfurt.

After St Edmund&#x27;s School, Hindhead and Uppingham School (where his father had also been), Schlesinger enlisted in the British Army during World War II. While serving with the Royal Engineers, he made films on the war&#x27;s front line. He also entertained his fellow troops by performing magic tricks. After his tour of duty, he continued making short films and acted in stage productions while studying at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was involved in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.

==Career==
Schlesinger&#x27;s acting career began in the 1950s and consisted of supporting roles in British films such as &quot;The Divided Heart&quot; and &quot;Oh... Rosalinda!!&quot;, and British television productions such as &quot;BBC Sunday Night Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;The Vise&quot;. He began his directorial career in 1956 with the short documentary &quot;Sunday in the Park&quot; about London&#x27;s Hyde Park. In 1958, Schlesinger created a documentary on Benjamin Britten and the Aldeburgh Festival for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; TV programme, including rehearsals of the children&#x27;s opera &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; featuring a young Michael Crawford. In 1959, Schlesinger was credited as exterior or second unit director on 23 episodes of the TV series &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; and four 30-minute episodes of the series &quot;Danger Man&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Col March of Scotland Yard&quot; as &quot;Dutch cook&quot; in &quot;Death and the Other Monkey&quot; 1956.

By the 1960s, he had virtually given up acting to concentrate on a directing career, and another of his earlier directorial efforts, the British Transport Films&#x27; documentary &quot;Terminus&quot; (1961), gained a Venice Film Festival Gold Lion and a British Academy Award. His first two fiction films, &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962) and &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1963) were set in the North of England. Both were produced by Joseph Janni and financed by Nat Cohen. &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; won the Golden Bear award at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival in 1962. His third feature film, &quot;Darling&quot; (1965), tartly described the modern way of life in London and was one of the first films about &#x27;swinging London&#x27;. Schlesinger&#x27;s next film was the period drama &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967), an adaptation of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s popular novel accentuated by beautiful English country locations. Both films (and &quot;Billy Liar&quot;) featured Julie Christie as the female lead.

Schlesinger&#x27;s next film, &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), was internationally acclaimed. A story of two hustlers living on the fringe in the bad side of New York City, it was Schlesinger&#x27;s first film shot in the US, and it won Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture. The film was one of the earliest mainstream American films to deal explicitly with homosexual relationships, and is considered a groundbreaking work of queer cinema. During the 1970s, he made an array of films that were mainly about loners, losers and people outside the mainstream world, such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976) and &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979). Later, came the major box office and critical failure of &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; (1981), followed by films that attracted mixed responses from the public, and low returns, although &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; (1985) made money and &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990) was a box-office hit. In Britain, he did better with films like &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; (1988) and &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1995). Other later works include plays for television &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; (1983) and &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; (1991), both with scripts by Alan Bennett, &quot;The Innocent&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (2000).

Schlesinger directed on stage &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1965) for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the musical &quot;I and Albert&quot; (1972) at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre. From 1973, he was an associate director of the Royal National Theatre, where he produced George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1975). He directed several operas, including &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; (1980) and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (1984), both at Covent Garden.

Schlesinger directed a party political broadcast for the Conservative Party in the general election of 1992, which featured Prime Minister John Major returning to Brixton in south London, thus highlighting Major&#x27;s humble background, something atypical for a Conservative politician at that time. Schlesinger said he had voted for all three main political parties in the UK at one time or another.

==Later life and death==
In 1991, Schlesinger made a brief return to acting, portraying the gay character &#x27;Derek&#x27; in the TV adaptation of &quot;The Lost Language of Cranes&quot; for the BBC. Schlesinger had himself come out during the making of &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;.

Schlesinger was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 Birthday Honours for services to film. Maintaining a flat in London and house at Palm Springs, California Schlesinger had a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated to him in January 2003, which was his final public appearance.

Schlesinger underwent a quadruple heart bypass in 1998, before suffering a stroke on New Year&#x27;s Day 2001, which substantially diminished his faculties. He died at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs on the morning of 25 July 2003, at the age of 77.

Schlesinger was survived by his partner of over 30 years, photographer Michael Childers. A memorial service was held on 30 September 2003. He was cremated, with most of his ashes interred next to his parents, and the remainder left to be interred with Childers.

<text>, often abbreviated as AIC, is a Japanese animation studio founded on June 15, 1982 and located in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan. On December 10, 2015, AIC RIGHTS Company, Inc. was established through a company split, in which AIC Rights received the transfer of some of the copyrights owned by Anime International Company.

Their notable works include series such as &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;, &quot;El Hazard&quot;, and several adaptations of the manga &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;.

AIC had eight sub-studios within itself, named: AIC ASTA (2003, formerly: AIC A.S.T.A.), AIC Build (2010), AIC Classic (2010), AIC Digital (1997), AIC Frontier (June 2012), AIC PLUS+ (2006), AIC Spirits (2003) and AIC Takarazuka (2006).

==History==

In June 2006, a partnership was started with NTU for the development of the CACANI system, a software used as a tool in the animation process to generate fills between keyframes.

In September 2010, Oizumi Corporation acquired 95% of the studio from the ACA-managed investment fund MCP Synergy for 530 million yen. Also on the same day of the acquisition, AIC will buyback the remaining shares of the company held by TM Company. Together with the 5% share buyback from AIC, the studio subsequently became a wholly owned subsidiary of Oizumi Corporation.

In March of the following year, Aplix Corporation acquired all shares of the studio except AIC&#x27;s treasury stock from Oizumi Corporation for 660 million yen, and AIC became a subsidiary of the company.

In February 2013, production producers of AIC Spirits quit the company and established an animation studio Production IMS. Also in May of that year, production producers of AIC Classic quit and founded the studio, Troyca.

On January 20, 2014, Aplix IP Holdings transferred all shares of AIC to Tōru Miura at 8,000 yen (1 yen per share).

In August 2015, former AIC animator Atsushi Okuda tweeted a post stating that AIC&#x27;s production department had been disbanded.

In December 2015, Yasutaka Omura was appointed as the CEO of AIC. Also in the same month, AIC RIGHTS CO., Ltd was established through a company split from AIC, in which AIC Rights received the transfer of some of the copyrights of the work of Anime International Company. Omura was appointed as the CEO of AIC Rights.

In February 2017, AIC Rights launched the &quot;anime reboot projects&quot; initiative to celebrate AIC&#x27;s 35th anniversary.

On January 12, 2020, Omura announced his resigning from his CEO position at Anime International Company, although he remained as CEO of AIC Rights. Following Omura&#x27;s resignation, Tōru Miura would return as CEO of AIC.

In April 2021, AIC Rights entered into a business alliance with Toei Agency, with the two companies going forward co-owning the copyrights to some of the intellectual property owned by AIC Rights.

In February 2022, Kenji Tsukamoto was appointed as the new representative director of AIC Rights, replacing Omura.

<text>A control system manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops. It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. The control systems are designed via control engineering process.

For continuously modulated control, a feedback controller is used to automatically control a process or operation. The control system compares the value or status of the process variable (PV) being controlled with the desired value or setpoint (SP), and applies the difference as a control signal to bring the process variable output of the plant to the same value as the setpoint.

For sequential and combinational logic, software logic, such as in a programmable logic controller, is used.

==Open-loop and closed-loop control==
==Feedback control systems==
==Logic control==
Logic control systems for industrial and commercial machinery were historically implemented by interconnected electrical relays and cam timers using ladder logic. Today, most such systems are constructed with microcontrollers or more specialized programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The notation of ladder logic is still in use as a programming method for PLCs.

Logic controllers may respond to switches and sensors and can cause the machinery to start and stop various operations through the use of actuators. Logic controllers are used to sequence mechanical operations in many applications. Examples include elevators, washing machines and other systems with interrelated operations. An automatic sequential control system may trigger a series of mechanical actuators in the correct sequence to perform a task. For example, various electric and pneumatic transducers may fold and glue a cardboard box, fill it with the product and then seal it in an automatic packaging machine.

PLC software can be written in many different ways – ladder diagrams, SFC (sequential function charts) or statement lists.

==On–off control==

On–off control uses a feedback controller that switches abruptly between two states. A simple bi-metallic domestic thermostat can be described as an on-off controller. When the temperature in the room (PV) goes below the user setting (SP), the heater is switched on. Another example is a pressure switch on an air compressor. When the pressure (PV) drops below the setpoint (SP) the compressor is powered. Refrigerators and vacuum pumps contain similar mechanisms. Simple on–off control systems like these can be cheap and effective.

==Linear control==
==Fuzzy logic==
Fuzzy logic is an attempt to apply the easy design of logic controllers to the control of complex continuously varying systems. Basically, a measurement in a fuzzy logic system can be partly true.

The rules of the system are written in natural language and translated into fuzzy logic. For example, the design for a furnace would start with: &quot;If the temperature is too high, reduce the fuel to the furnace. If the temperature is too low, increase the fuel to the furnace.&quot;

Measurements from the real world (such as the temperature of a furnace) are &quot;fuzzified&quot; and logic is calculated arithmetic, as opposed to Boolean logic, and the outputs are &quot;de-fuzzified&quot; to control equipment.

When a robust fuzzy design is reduced to a single, quick calculation, it begins to resemble a conventional feedback loop solution and it might appear that the fuzzy design was unnecessary. However, the fuzzy logic paradigm may provide scalability for large control systems where conventional methods become unwieldy or costly to derive.

Fuzzy electronics is an electronic technology that uses fuzzy logic instead of the two-value logic more commonly used in digital electronics.

==Physical implementation==

The range of control system implementation is from compact controllers often with dedicated software for a particular machine or device, to distributed control systems for industrial process control for a large physical plant.

Logic systems and feedback controllers are usually implemented with programmable logic controllers. The Broadly Reconfigurable and Expandable Automation Device (BREAD) is a recent framework that provides many open-source hardware devices which can be connected to create more complex data acquisition and control systems.

<text>The State University of New York at Binghamton (Binghamton University or SUNY Binghamton) is a public research university in Greater Binghamton, New York, United States. It is one of the four university centers in the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

Since its establishment in 1946, the school has evolved from a small liberal arts college to a large research university. It is one of 146 U.S. universities classified among R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity. Binghamton&#x27;s athletic teams are the Bearcats and they compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Bearcats are members of the America East Conference.

==History==

===Establishment===
Binghamton University was established in 1946 in Endicott, New York, as Triple Cities College to serve the needs of local veterans returning from World War II. Thomas J. Watson, a founding member of IBM in Broome County, viewed the Triple Cities region of the state&#x27;s Southern Tier as an area of great potential. In the early 1940s he collaborated with local leaders to begin establishing Triple Cities College as a two-year junior college operating as a satellite of private Syracuse University. Watson also donated land that would become the school&#x27;s early home.

Originally, Triple Cities College students going on to a bachelor&#x27;s degree finished their program at Syracuse. By the 1948–1949 academic year, the degrees could be completed entirely in Binghamton. In 1950, it split from Syracuse and became incorporated into the public State University of New York (SUNY) system as Harpur College, named in honor of Robert Harpur, a colonial teacher and pioneer who settled in the Binghamton area. At that time, Harpur and Champlain College in Plattsburgh were the only two liberal arts schools in the New York state system. When Champlain closed in 1952 to make way for the Plattsburgh Air Force Base, the records and some students and faculty were transferred to Harpur College in Binghamton. Harpur also received 16,000 non-duplicate volumes and the complete contents of the Champlain College library.

In 1955, Harpur began to plan its current location in Vestal, a town next to Binghamton. A site large enough to anticipate future growth was purchased, with the school&#x27;s move to its new campus being completed by 1961. Colonial Hall, Triple Cities College&#x27;s original building in Endicott, stands today as the village&#x27;s Visitor Center.

In 1965, Harpur College was selected to join New York state schools at Stony Brook University, Albany, and Buffalo as one of the four new SUNY university centers. Redesignated the State University of New York at Binghamton, the school&#x27;s new name reflected its status as an advanced degree granting institution. In a nod to tradition, its undergraduate college of arts and sciences remained &quot;Harpur College&quot;. it is the largest of Binghamton&#x27;s constituent schools. In 1967, the School of Advanced Technology was established, the precursor to the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science, which was founded in 1983. In 2020, the school became the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science.

Since 1992, the school has made an effort to distinguish itself from the SUNY system, rebranding itself as &quot;Binghamton University,&quot; or &quot;Binghamton University, State University of New York&quot;. Both names are accepted as first reference in news stories. While the school&#x27;s legal and official name, the State University of New York at Binghamton, still appears on official documents such as diplomas, the administration discourages using the full name unless absolutely necessary. It also discourages references to the school as &quot;SUNY—Binghamton,&quot; &quot;SUNY—B,&quot; or &quot;Harpur College&quot;.

===Presidents===
The first president of Harpur College, who began as dean of Triple Cities College, was Glenn Bartle. The second president, George Bruce Dearing, served several years before leaving to become vice chancellor for academic affairs at the SUNY Central Administration in Albany. Next was C. Peter Magrath, former interim president of the University of Nebraska, who served from 1972 to 1974 then left to become president at the University of Minnesota.

The fourth president at Binghamton was Clifford D. Clark, who left his position as dean of the business school at the University of Kansas to serve as vice president for academic affairs at Binghamton in 1973. He was asked to take on the job of acting president in the fall of 1974, when Magrath left for Minnesota. Clark was selected as president and served from March 1975 through mid-1990. He led the school&#x27;s evolution from primarily a four-year liberal arts college to a research university. Clark added the Anderson Center for the Performing Arts and inaugurated the Summer Music Festival, created the Harpur Forum (now called the Binghamton University Forum), established the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science, and fostered the expansion and development of the Decker School of Nursing.

Lois B. DeFleur became the university&#x27;s fifth president upon Clark&#x27;s retirement in 1990. She oversaw substantial additions to the student and faculty populations, expanded research activities and funding, formalized Binghamton&#x27;s fundraising efforts, expanded the campus&#x27; physical footprint by approximately 20 buildings, launched Binghamton&#x27;s &quot;green&quot; efforts, transitioned the school from Division III athletics to Division I and oversaw the university&#x27;s increase in academic rankings. DeFleur retired in 2010 amidst scandal regarding her corrupt efforts to catapult the university sports program into higher ranks by cheating, and due to her arranging for the firm of a friend (Kaye) to conduct the investigation thereby violating laws requiring a specific bidding process On July 1, Magrath returned as interim president.

On November 22, 2011, the SUNY Board of Trustees appointed Harvey G. Stenger, Jr. as the seventh president of Binghamton University, effective January 1, 2012. Stenger had been interim provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University at Buffalo since April 2011.

==Organization==
===University leadership===
Binghamton is one of four university centers of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and is governed by its board of trustees. The Binghamton University Council oversees such aspects of the school&#x27;s governance as student conduct, budget and physical facilities. Nine of its ten members are appointed by the state governor, one elected by the student body.

The university is organized into six administrative offices: Academic Affairs; Advancement; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; Operations; Research; and Student Affairs. The Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is managed by a chief diversity officer and the other divisions are managed by a vice president.

, the university had an endowment of $152.619 million, managed by the not-for-profit Binghamton University Foundation, which also oversees fundraising. Its most recent drive–&#x27;Bold.Brilliant.Binghamton—the Campaign for Binghamton University&#x27;– raised more than $100 million before ending on June 30, 2012, $5 million over its original goal.

===Colleges and schools===

Binghamton is composed of the following colleges and schools:
* Harpur College of Arts and Sciences is the oldest and largest of Binghamton&#x27;s schools. It has more than 9,400 undergraduates and more than 1,100 graduate students in 26 departments and 14 interdisciplinary degree programs in the fine arts, humanities, natural and social sciences, and mathematics.
* The College of Community and Public Affairs offers an undergraduate major in human development as well as graduate programs in social work; public administration; student affairs administration; human rights; sustainable communities (with Harpur College), public health (with Decker College), and teaching, learning and educational leadership. It was formed in July 2006, after a reorganization of its predecessor, the School of Education and Human Development, when it was split off along with the Graduate School of Education. In 2017, the Graduate School of Education merged back into the College of Community and Public Affairs as the Department of Teaching, Learning and Educational Leadership. The department continues to offer master&#x27;s of science and doctoral degrees.
* The Decker College of Nursing and Health Sciences was established in 1969. The school offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in nursing. The school is accredited by the Commission of Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).
* The School of Management was established in 1970. It offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in management, finance, information science, marketing, accounting, and operations and business analytics. It is accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).
* The Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, biomedical engineering, systems science and industrial engineering, materials science and engineering, and computer science. All of the school&#x27;s departments have been accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.
*The Graduate School administers advanced-degree programs and awards degrees through the seven component colleges above. Graduate students will find almost 70 areas of study. Undergraduate and graduate students are taught and advised by a single faculty.
*The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, the newest school at Binghamton, and offers doctoral degrees in pharmacy and pharmacology. The school has been granted Candidate status from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, which grants all the rights and privileges available to students of accredited schools, and anticipates full accreditation upon graduation of its inaugural class in 2021. The school enrolled its first students in fall 2017, and in 2018 opened its state-of-the-art, $60 million new building on a new Health Sciences Campus in Johnson City, near UHS-Wilson Medical Center.

==Campuses==

=== Main campus ===
The main campus in Vestal is spread over on a wooded hillside above the Susquehanna River; geographically, the Southern Tier of New York is located on Allegheny Plateau, a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains. The campus is shaped like a brain: the primary road on campus creates a closed loop to form the cerebrum and cerebellum, and the main entrance road creates the spinal cord which leads up to a traffic circle (representing the medulla). The main road is thus frequently referred to as &quot;The Brain&quot;. The connector road, which goes behind the Mountainview and College-in-the-Woods residential communities, is closed for a portion of the year (in late fall and early spring, to allow for safe migration of salamanders across the road). The campus features a Nature Preserve, which contains forest and wetland areas and includes a six-acre (24,000 m2) pond, named Harpur Pond, that adjoins the campus. The Nature Preserve drains into Fuller Hollow Creek, which runs parallel along the eastern portion of the campus. Fuller Hollow Creek meanders north after leaving campus, where it soon empties into the Susquehanna River.

====Libraries====
The Glenn G. Bartle Library, named after the university&#x27;s first president, contains collections in the humanities, social sciences, government documents, and collections in mathematical and computer sciences. Additionally, Bartle Library houses a fine arts collection and special collections (containing the Max Reinhardt Collection, as well as the Edwin A. Link and Marion Clayton Link Archives). The Science Library contains materials in all science and engineering disciplines, as well as a map collection. The University Downtown Center Library and Information Commons supports the departments of social work, human development, public administration, and student affairs administration.

The libraries offer a number of services including research consultation and assistance, a laptop lending program, customized instruction sessions and three information commons in the Bartle, Science and UDC libraries. The libraries offer access to various online databases to facilitate research for students and faculty. The entire campus is also served by a wireless internet network that all students, staff and faculty have access to, funded in part by mandatory student technology fees. The computing services center supports Windows, Macintosh and Unix systems, both in public computer labs and for students&#x27; personal computers.

====Anderson Center for the Performing Arts====
The Anderson Center for the Performing Arts complex has three proscenium stages: Watters Theater, seating 574; the Chamber Hall, seating 450; and the Osterhout Concert Theater, seating 1,170 inside and 1,500 outside. The Osterhout Concert Theater has the ability to become an open-air amphitheater, with its movable, floor-to-ceiling glass windows that open up to a grassy hill. The Anderson Center for the Performing Arts has hosted performers such as the Russian Symphony and Ballet, the Prague National Symphony and the Shakespearian Theater Company. Notable speakers who have presented on the Anderson Center for the Performing Arts stages include Noam Chomsky, Margaret Atwood, and Ralph Nader just to name a few. The Anderson Center for the Performing Arts presents its own season of cultural shows. Recent presentations include The Vienna Boys Choir, Step Afrika, Coco Live-to-Film, Ranky Tanky. Each summer the Anderson Center for the Performing Arts presents open air shows featuring national touring artists. Some memorable past performances include, Donna Summer, Tony Bennett, The Beach Boys, America, and more recently, The Temptations and Four Tops, and Melissa Etheridge.

====University Art Museum====
The university&#x27;s art collection is housed at more than one location, but all within the Fine Arts Building. The building&#x27;s main-level gallery hosts various artifacts which belong to the Permanent Collection, though typically showcases student work on a rotating basis. The Permanent Collection in the basement level of the building displays ancient art from Egypt, China and other locales. Lastly, the Elsie B. Rosefsky Gallery, just off the Grand Corridor, presents special exhibits and portfolios.

====University Union====
The University Union is divided into two sections, sometimes referred to as the old Union and the new Union, sometimes referred to as Union East and West respectively, yet called &quot;University Union (UU)&quot; and &quot;University Union West (UUW)&quot; by the university itself. The Union houses many student organizations, a food co-op, The MarketPlace food court, a number of meeting spaces, many new classrooms, the University Bookstore and a branch of Visions Federal Credit Union.

On August 23, 2013, President Barack Obama hosted a town hall meeting in the University Union to discuss college affordability with students, faculty, and staff at Binghamton University.

====Events Center====
The Events Center is one of the area&#x27;s largest venue for athletics, concerts, fairs and more. Home court to the Binghamton Bearcats basketball teams, the facility seats about 5,300 people for games. For concerts, Commencement and other larger events, the Events Center can hold up to 8,000 people. Home site for the America East Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball Championships in 2005, 2006, and 2008, the court hosted the women&#x27;s championships in 2007 and 2015. It has also held intercollegiate indoor track meets, tennis matches and wrestling matches, as well as opening and closing ceremonies for the Empire State Games. Its construction cost $33.1M and it opened in 2004.

====Other athletic facilities====

In addition to the Events Center, the north end of campus houses the East and West Gyms, which host student recreation and varsity athletics programs. The East Gym underwent a major renovation, completed in winter 2012, and is now called the Recreational Center at the East Gym, and includes the 10,000-sq. ft. FitSpace fitness facility, three new multipurpose rooms, improved pool and court spaces, a new wellness services suite and completely renovated locker rooms. Other varsity facilities include baseball and softball fields, the Bearcats Sports Complex (a soccer and lacrosse stadium) and an outdoor track. With a gift from an anonymous donor, the baseball fields underwent a $2 million facelift including the addition of artificial turf and lights in 2016. Other student recreation features are a series of playing fields used for soccer, football, rugby and ultimate frisbee.

====Science Complex====
The science complex includes five instructional and office buildings, as well as a four-climate teaching greenhouse and the Science Library. Buildings are named sequentially as Science 1 through 5. They contain faculty offices and classrooms for the biological sciences, anthropology, geological sciences and psychology departments.

====Innovative Technologies Complex====
More commonly known as the ITC, the Innovative Technologies Complex is a new development intended to advance venture capital research in both the support of the university&#x27;s activities and that of the local high-technology industry. The complex includes four buildings: the Biotechnology Building, formerly belonging to NYSEG and now extensively renovated; the Engineering and Science Building, opened in 2011; the Center of Excellence Building, which houses the Small Scale Systems Integration and Packaging Center, a New York State Center of Excellence, opened in 2014; and the Smart Energy Building that houses the chemistry and physics departments, opened in 2017. Early talks indicated plans for a six-building complex at its completion.

====Nature Preserve====
The university&#x27;s Nature Preserve is on the southern end of campus. The preserve features approximately 10 miles(16 km) of maintained paths, a six-acre pond, marsh areas, vernal pools, tall hills and a hill-top meadow.

===Residential communities===

Residence halls at Binghamton are grouped into seven communities. The apartment communities used to house graduate students, but now house undergraduates. Of the residential colleges, Dickinson Community and Newing College are the newest. Dickinson features &quot;flats&quot; of either four single rooms or two double rooms and a single, while Newing features semi-private room styles sharing private bathrooms as well as some common bathrooms. College-in-the-Woods mixes suites and double- and triple-occupancy rooms, and Hinman College and Mountainview College consist of suites, exclusively. Susquehanna Community and Hillside Community contain only apartments.

The newly completed Newing College, opened in fall 2011, and Dickinson Community, completed in 2013, are part of the university&#x27;s $375 million East Campus Housing project, which also included a new collegiate center and dining facility. The old Newing community was razed to make room for the new communities. The old Dickinson community was renovated and repurposed for academics, offices and departments. The last of the new Newing and Dickinson residence halls were unveiled in 2013.
* Dickinson Community: Named for Daniel S. Dickinson, a U.S. Senator from surrounding area, important as the &quot;Defender of the Constitution&quot; in the pre-Civil War era. Buildings are named after other prominent local figures, including founders of the university.
* Hinman College: Named for New York State Senator Harvey D. Hinman. Buildings are named after former New York State governors, and were constructed between 1967 and 1968.
* Newing College: Named for Stuart Newing, a local automobile dealer who was active in the effort to have SUNY purchase Triple Cities College. Buildings are named for Southern Tier towns and counties. Newing College was rebuilt completely, and the new residence halls and student center/dining hall opened in fall 2011.
* College-in-the-Woods: Named for its location in a wooded area of the campus. Buildings are named after tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy. College-in-the-Woods opened for residency in the fall of 1973.
* Mountainview College: The four individual residential halls—Cascade, Hunter, Marcy, and Windham—were named after peaks in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains and each house up to 300 students.
* Susquehanna Community: Buildings are named for tributaries of the Susquehanna River, which flows through the city of Binghamton.
* Hillside Community: Named for its location at the highest part of the Binghamton campus. Halls are named for New York state parks. The 16 apartment buildings are ordered clockwise, in alphabetical order.

=== Health Sciences campus ===
Binghamton&#x27;s nearly 15-acre Health Sciences Campus is located in Johnson City, New York. The campus is located a block from Main Street and is in close proximity to UHS Wilson Medical Center and Ascension Lourdes Hospital. The School of Pharmacy building opened in 2018, while the first floor floors the Decker College of Nursing and Health Sciences building opened in January 2021. A Research and Development facility is in the design phase and will be constructed immediately adjacent to the pharmacy school; it is slated to be completed by December 2022. The university also plans on developing a park on two acres of land between Corliss Avenue and Main Street, which will offer an attractive and safe connection between university facilities and the downtown business district.

=== Downtown Center ===
The University Downtown Center, located near the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers, opened in 2007 and houses the College of Community and Public Affairs. In 2011, the Downtown Center was severely damaged from flooding caused by Tropical Storm Lee. While only the lowest floor of the building was filled with water, the electric company was unable to shut the power off in time, resulting in the building&#x27;s electrical system being ruined. Classes were moved to the Main campus until repairs were completed. Repairs took a year to complete, and the UDC reopened for the start of the fall 2012 semester. In 2017, the university received $2.7 million for the flood repairs.

===Transportation===
Bus transportation on campus and in some neighborhoods is provided by the student-owned and operated OCC Transport. OCCT is free for all students; it is supported by mandatory student activity and transportation fees and by funds and resources provided by the university. OCCT is managed by the Student Association. Students, faculty and staff can ride the Broome County Transit bus system for free, paid for through a portion of the transportation fee. The Escape Student Bus Service, operated by the Student Association, provides coach transportation to students between Vestal and the New York metropolitan area on weekends and university breaks.

==Academics==
Binghamton offers more than 130 academic undergraduate majors, minors, certificates, concentrations, emphases, tracks and specializations and more than 60 master&#x27;s, 30 doctorate and 50 accelerated (combined bachelor&#x27;s/master&#x27;s) degrees. There also exist interdisciplinary programs that allow individualized degree programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

The university requires students to have completed 12 general education requirements in order to graduate, with some exceptions depending on the school. These include courses in aesthetics, global inter-dependencies, humanities, laboratory science, composition and oral communication, mathematics, physical activity and wellness, social science and U.S. pluralism. Individual schools within the university have additional requirements. Students in Harpur College must complete a minimum of 126 credits to graduate. Most classes at Binghamton are worth four credits, rather than the more usual three. The typical undergraduate course load thus consists of four courses (for 16 credits) rather than the usual five (for 15 credits).

The reverence in which this concert is held owes both to the performance and to the fact that high quality bootleg cassette recordings circulated widely among Deadheads for decades before the recording was officially released on CD as &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 8&quot;. According to Jimmy Cawley writing in the Boston &quot;Globe&quot;, &quot;The Harpur College show has long been prized by tape collectors as an example of the depth the Dead were capable of on any given night.&quot;

<text>The Šarplaninac or Sharr dog is a breed of dog of livestock guardian type. It is named for the Šar Mountains or Šar Planina range in the Balkans, where it is principally found. It was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as the Illyrian Shepherd Dog or Ilirski Ovčar from 1939 until 1957, when the name was changed to Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog – Sharplanina or Jugoslovenski Ovčarski Pas – Šarplaninac.

In Ottoman times, the dogs moved with the flocks of sheep, spending the summer in the area of the Šar Mountains and the winter in Thessaly, where they were known as Greek Shepherd Dogs.

== History ==
The origins of the Šarplaninac are not known. It was traditionally used to guard cattle or sheep. In the transhumant system of management, livestock was moved twice a year, to the high mountain pastures for the summer, and to the warmer plains for the winter. In the southern Balkans, very large numbers of sheep were moved in this way, accompanied by men and dogs. In Ottoman times, dogs of this type moved with the flocks of sheep, spending the summer in the area of the Šar Mountains and the winter in Thessaly – where they were known as &#x27;Greek Shepherd Dogs&#x27;.

In 1939 it was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a Yugoslav breed with the name &#x27;Ilirski Ovčar&#x27; or &#x27;Illyrian Shepherd Dog&#x27;; In 1957, following a request from the Yugoslav Federation of Cynology (Jugoslovenski Kinološki Savez), the Fédération Cynologique Internationale agreed to change the official international names of the breed to &#x27;Jugoslovenski Ovcarski Pas – Sarplaninac&#x27; and &#x27;Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog – Sharplanina&#x27;. In 1968 the Kraški Ovčar or Karst Shepherd Dog, which had previously been considered a sub-type, was recognised as a separate breed.

Breed numbers were much reduced by the conflicts associated with the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Following these events, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognised North Macedonia and Serbia as the countries of origin.

The Šarplaninac is found mainly in the Šar Mountains, where it is thought to have originated and from which the name &#x27;Šarplaninac&#x27; derives. It is also distributed in the areas of the Jablanica, Korab and Pelister mountains.

== Characteristics ==

The Šarplaninac is a large and strongly built dog. The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes.

It is a robust, well-proportioned dog with plenty of bone, of a size that is well above the average and with a thick, long, rather coarse coat that emphasises the short-coupled appearance. Dogs weigh some , bitches about less. The average height at the withers is for dogs and for bitches.

It is always solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or grey with darker &quot;overalls&quot; on the head and back, the undercoat being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another.

The dogs may be expected to live for some .

== Legislation ==
The Šarplaninac is on the list of banned dog breeds in Denmark. The Danish list includes 13 breeds and it is considered controversial, having received criticism from dog owners and several political parties because eight of the 13 breeds have no reports of any incident. Among the eight is Šarplaninac.

It is viewed on the one Macedonian denar coin.

<doc id="275477" wikidata="Q3007331" url="?curid=275477" title="Culture of Guyana">
<text>Guyanese culture reflects the influence of Indian, African, Amerindian, British, Portuguese, Chinese, Creole, and Dutch cultures. Guyana is part of the mainland Caribbean region. Guyanese culture shares a continuum with the cultures of islands in the West Indies.

==Holidays==

Celebrations in Guyana reflect the diverse origins of its people; typical European holidays such as Easter and Christmas, Diwali, and Phagwah from Guyanese Hindus, and Mashramani, a holiday to celebrate Guyana&#x27;s independence inspired by Amerindian festivals.

==Literature and theatre==
Colonial society put a greater value on entertainment from Europe than locally-produced ones, and for the most part sought to emulate popular Victorian English styles. Abolition of slavery and the end of indenture were factors in a growing middle class, and towards the middle of the 20th century, there was a growing need for arts that reflected the reality of life and people of the Caribbean region. 

Notable Guyanese authors include Wilson Harris, Jan Carew, Denis Williams, Roy A. K. Heath and E. R. Braithwaite. Braithwaite&#x27;s memoir &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot; details his experiences as a black high-school teacher in the poor East End of London. An early Guyanese-born author was Edgar Mittelholzer, who became more well known while living in Trinidad and England. He is well known for his works, which include &quot;Corentyne Thunder&quot; and a three-novel set known as the Kaywana Trilogy, the latter focusing on one family through 350 years of Guyana&#x27;s history. Other writers who have made a significant contribution to Guyanese literary culture include Fred D&#x27;Aguiar, David Dabydeen, Martin Carter and Shana Yardan.

Although the beginning of theatre in 19th-century Georgetown was European, in the early 20th century a new African and Indian Guyanese middle-class theatre emerged. In the 1950s there was an explosion of an ethnically diverse and socially committed theatre. Despite an economic depression, there was a struggle to maintain theatre post-1980. Serious repertory theatre was highlighted by Carifesta and the Theatre Guild of Guyana. Wordsworth McAndrew has been prominent in Guyanese theatre since the 1960s.

Guyanese actors who have been successful internationally include Harry Baird, Norman Beaton, Anthony Chinn, Tommy Eytle, Cy Grant, Ram John Holder, Pauline Melville, Carmen Munroe, Sol Raye, and Ian Valz.

==Music and visual arts==

Guyana&#x27;s musical tradition is a mix of African, Indian, European, and Latin elements. The most popular type of music is Calypso and its offshoots and mixes, like in other parts of the Eastern Caribbean. The various types of popular music include reggae, calypso, chutney, Soca, local Guyanese soca-chutney and Bollywood film songs (or Indian music). Due to globalization, sounds from neighbouring countries can be heard such as Merengue, Bachata, Salsa, with Reggaeton being the most popular. Popular Guyanese performers include Billy (William) Moore, Terry Gajraj, Mark Holder, Eddy Grant, Dave Martins &amp; the Tradewinds, Aubrey Cummings and Nicky Porter. Among the most successful Guyanese record producers are Eddy Grant, Terry Gajraj and Dave Martin.

Visual art takes many forms in Guyana, but its dominant themes are Amerindian, the ethnic diversity of the population and the natural environment. Modern and contemporary visual artists living in, or originally from, Guyana include Stanley Greaves, Ronald Savory, Philip Moore, Donald Locke, Frank Bowling, Hew Locke, Roshini Kempadoo, Leila Locke, George Simon and Aubrey Williams.

==Film==
The story of cinema in Guyana goes back to the 1920s when the Gaiety, probably British Guiana&#x27;s first cinema, stood by the Brickdam Roman Catholic Presbytery in Georgetown, and showed Charlie Chaplin-type silent movies. After the Gaiety burnt down around 1926, other cinemas followed, such as the Metro on Middle Street in Georgetown, which became the Empire; the London on Camp Street, which became the Plaza; and the Astor on Church and Waterloo Streets, which opened around 1940.

The Capitol on La Penitence Street in Albouystown had a rough reputation. The Metropole was on Robb and Wellington Streets; the Rialto, which became the Rio, on Vlissengen Road; the Hollywood was in Kitty; and the Strand De Luxe on Wellington Street, was considered the luxury showplace.

Cinema seating was distinctly divided. Closest to the screen, with rows of hard wooden benches, was the lowly Pit, where the effort of looking upwards at the screen for several hours gave one a permanent stiff neck. The next section, House, was separated from the Pit by a low partition wall. House usually had individual but connected wooden rows of seats that flipped up or down. Above House was the Box section, with soft, private seats and, behind Box, Balcony, a favourite place for dating couples. These divisions in the cinema roughly represented the different strata existing in colonial society.

Bollywood films and music are also very popular in Guyana, especially among the Indo-Guyanese population. When famed Bollywood playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar, visited Guyana, she was given a key to the capital city, Georgetown.

==Architecture==
Guyana&#x27;s historic architecture reflects the country&#x27;s British colonial past. Even current houses when made of wood still emulate aspects of the style. Many of the buildings in Georgetown and New Amsterdam were built entirely of local wood.

==Sports==

The most-played sports in Guyana are cricket, basketball and football. Key sport organizations in Guyana include the government&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport; the Guyana Cricket Board; Guyana Amateur Basketball Federation; and the Guyana Football Federation. Professional level sports have suffered from lack of funding, lacking access to facilities and training. Guyana plays as part of West Indies team for international cricket since 1928. 

Guyana&#x27;s national football teams, the Golden Jaguars and the Lady Jaguars, participate at the international level. A number of boxers have done well at the international level, including Andrew Lewis, Vivian Harris, Wayne Braithwaite. Boxing is the only sport that has earned Guyana an Olympic medal.

=== Cricket ===
Cricket has been an important vehicle for cultural unity across the Caribbean. In British Guiana, it represented a way for the non-white lower classes to earn recognition in colonial society. It was introduced to Guyana by British military teams, and has since become dominated by Afro and Indo-Guyanese. The West Indies team victory in 1950 against England at Lord&#x27;s, &quot;still remains the single most satisfying moment in the history of West Indies cricket&quot; also inspired a calypso.

Guyana hosted international cricket matches as part of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The new 15,000-seat Providence Stadium, also referred to as Guyana National Stadium, was built in time for the World Cup and was ready for the beginning of play on March 28. At the first international game of CWC 2007 at the stadium, Lasith Malinga of the Sri Lankan team performed a &quot;helmet trick&quot; or &quot;double hat-trick&quot; (four wickets in four consecutive deliveries).

==Cuisine==
Guyanese cuisine is similar to the rest of the Anglo-Caribbean, especially Trinidad and Tobago and Dutch-speaking Suriname, where the ethnic mix is somewhat similar. The food reflects the ethnic makeup of the country and its colonial history, and includes ethnic groups of Indian, African, Creole, Portuguese, Amerindian, Chinese and European (mostly British) influences and dishes. The food is diverse and includes dishes such as dal bhat, curry, roti, kitchrie, and cook-up rice (the local variation on the Anglo-Caribbean rice and peas). The one-pot meal, while not the national dish, is one of the most cooked dishes. 

Dishes have been adapted to Guyanese tastes, often by the addition of herbs and spices. Unique preparations include Guyana pepperpot, a stew of Amerindian origin made with meat, &quot;cassareep&quot; (a bitter extract of the cassava), and seasonings. Other favourites are cassava bread, stews, and metemgee, a thick rich type of soup with ground provision, coconut milk and large dumplings (called duff), eaten with fried fish or chicken. Homemade bread-making, an art in many villages, is a reflection of the British influence that includes pastries such as cheese rolls, pine tarts (pineapple tarts), and patties.

Many common dishes have their ultimate ancient origins in eastern Uttar Pradesh. These include satwa, pholourie, prasad, pera, dal puri, and several other variations of Indian dishes. Curry is widely popular in Guyana and most types of meat can be curried: chicken, seafood, goat, lamb, and even duck. 

Caribbean ground provisions (known colloquially as provisions) are part of the staple diet and include cassava, sweet potato, and eddoes. There is an abundance of fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood on the coast.

Most individuals use fresh fruits to make their own beverages, which are called &quot;local drink&quot;, which are made from readily available fruits or other parts of plants. Popular homemade drinks are lime wash (like lemonade), pine drink (from a pineapple), mauby, made from the bark of a tree; sorrel drink, made from hibiscus; ginger beer (made from ginger root), and peanut punch.

Fresh fish and seafood are an integral part of the Guyanese diet especially in the rural areas and small villages along the coast. Popular fish types include gilbaka, butter fish, tilapia, catfish, and hassa (Hoplosternum). The crab soups with okra from the Berbice coastal region resemble the Louisiana Creole soups like gumbo.

Christmas and Old Year&#x27;s Night (New Year) is the most celebrated time for Guyanese for food and festivities. Advance preparation starts with the preparation and soaking of fruits and rum or wine for Black Cake weeks or sometimes months ahead to intensify the flavour. Local drinks such as ginger beer, mauby and sorrel are fermented and require a sitting (pre-preparation) period prior to making. Ginger beer is the Christmas drink of choice, similar to the popularity of eggnog in North America. Some dishes certain to be served are Guyana pepperpot, garlic pork, black cake, sponge cake and home-made bread. Some of the local drinks and food require advance preparation.

Guyanese-style Chinese food is popular along with fried chicken as the most popular restaurant and take-out items in the bigger towns. Popular Chinese dishes include lo mein, chow mein, and &quot;chicken in the ruff&quot; (fried rice with Chinese-style fried chicken).

==Folklore==
Guyanese folklore is similar to Caribbean folklore, mixed with African, Indian, Amerindian, and British/European beliefs.
Folklores are the cultural beliefs and demonstrations that bind people from a group and help them to form an identity. These expressions can be in the form of dances, food, festivals, proverbs, stories, legends, music, festivals and costumes. Guyanese myths have their foundations in cultural influences from Amerindian, European, African and Indian backgrounds. Some of these beliefs are similar to the Caribbean diaspora while some are uniquely Guyanese. Some known Guyanese myths include:

The Old Higue (Hag)

An Old Higue is an old woman, who can also be depicted as a man, that becomes a ball of fire at night and flies through the air seeking babies&#x27; blood. After shedding her skin, she places it in a calabash gourd or in a tree for safekeeping and then proceeds to travel until she finds a newborn baby. She draws blood from the infant who then becomes blue and dies. The belief of this being is still upheld in many rural areas and people usually set traps to catch the old higue after which they would beat her with a manicole broom. The manicole broom is left over the doorway along with a bowl of uncooked rice which she cannot resist counting. When the old higue begins to count the rice grain she has to be careful not to drop it, or she would have to restart her undertaking which may keep her into the morning hours and get her caught by the family. People also believe that if the old higue&#x27;s skin is found, it should be pounded with salt and pepper and left where found. Once the old higue puts back the on their body it will burn them to death. 
Obeah
Obeah is a practice stemming from African origins passed down from the times of slavery. This is a practice where people petition to dead ancestors for assistance with issues like health, family, work, love or seeking favour and protection. An offering and commitment have to be made after which the instructions given should be followed precisely. 

Cumfa

This is an African-style dance which includes the beating of drums. The drums are an instrument used to summons spirit into a human host&#x27;s body. The dancers perform ceremonial, acrobatic and energetic dances sometimes over broken bottles and whilst eating fire in tribute to spirits and ancestors. The dancers are unscathed and do not have recollection of the performance once the spirit leaves the body.

==Language==

English is the main language, and Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America, although many people in neighboring Suriname also speak English. British English is taught in school and used in Government and business. Guyanese creole, a pidgin of 17th-century English, African and Hindi words, is used at home and on the street. It is the same as creoles spoken in the Eastern Caribbean such Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent but with different accent or emphasis on how the words are pronounced.

There are also a small number of trace words from the extinct Dutch Creoles, and French. Depending on the race of the person and location, the accent and sprinkling of other words can also change. An example of this would be an Indo Guyanese who would use a word or two words left over from when they spoke Hindi.

As time passes, British terms and phrases for things are being replaced by American ones, due to U.S. influence. Where once people would have said &quot;flats&quot; as in England, the term &quot;apartment&quot; is now being used by some people.

==Religion==

There are 3 major religions in Guyana; Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.

<text>The Tubes are a San Francisco-based rock band. Their self-titled 1975 debut album included the single &quot;White Punks on Dope&quot;, while their 1983 single &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot; was a top-10 U.S. hit and its music video was frequently played in the early days of MTV. The band also performed in the 1980 film &quot;Xanadu&quot;, singing the rock portion of the cross-genre song &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; opposite a big band.

== History ==
The Tubes formed on March 22, 1972, in San Francisco featuring members from two Phoenix bands who had moved to San Francisco in 1969. One, The Beans (alternately billing themselves as the Radar Men from Uranus), included Bill Spooner, Rick Anderson, Vince Welnick, and Bob McIntosh. The other, the Red White and Blues Band, featured Prairie Prince, Roger Steen, and David Killingsworth. After performing at Expo &#x27;70 in Japan, Killingsworth left the Red, White and Blues Band, leaving Steen and Prince to audition new bass players, albeit unsuccessfully. Before moving to San Francisco the Beans had been a local favorite in Phoenix, selling out shows with a tongue-in-cheek concept rock show called &quot;The Mother of Ascension&quot; featuring costumes and props. After moving, Bill Spooner worked at the Fillmore West concert hall sweeping floors in between Beans shows at the Longshoremen&#x27;s Hall and other minor venues. The band&#x27;s loud, heavy jamming style did not attract much attention, and the band needed to go back home to Phoenix. There they would sell out shows, which provided enough money to pay their rent. The Beans&#x27; manager and former Alice Cooper Group drummer, John Speer, suggested they add Prince and Steen along with their roadie John Waybill to one of these shows. Waybill&#x27;s nickname among the band was &quot;Fee,&quot; short for &quot;Fiji,&quot; thanks to his copious head of hippie hair.

&quot;The Radar Men from Uranus&quot; played the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, as well as a show in Mexico where they were run out of town by the police (it was where Rick Anderson almost drowned after he was washed out to sea while swimming). The group would stick together and play shows at biker bars such as The Inn of The Beginning in Cotati, California. The vocals at the time were shared by Spooner, Steen, and Waybill as different characters. Prairie Prince and Phoenix high school friend Michael Cotten were attending art school at the San Francisco Art Institute at this time; they attracted local press attention by painting a mural of crashing waves on the side of the Cliff House Restaurant. Cotten was asked by Spooner to buy an ARP synthesizer instead of a film camera and began to perform with the band as well as create props and costumes.

One of the first Tubes shows was at the Art Institute cafeteria as part of an art show for classmate and future Hollywood director Kathryn Bigelow. While experimenting with their stage show and art, Prince and Cotten met model Re Styles while painting the Cliff House mural. Styles was born Shirley Marie Macleod on March 30, 1950, in Middelburg, Netherlands. She had appeared in both Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; and Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Space Is the Place&quot;, and posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines. By 1975 she was credited with clothing design and dance co-ordination for the band. Onstage she played Patty Hearst and dress in wild leather outfits during the &quot;Mondo Bondage&quot; dance with Waybill. By 1979, she and Prince were married.

After several years of playing biker bars, the band needed help. They had a temporary agreement with producer David Rubinson and played on bills with The Pointer Sisters and Sylvester, but were still trying to find an audience. Prince had been hired by newly formed jazz-rock band Journey to record demos, and approached their manager Herbie Herbert, a former Santana roadie and Bill Graham employee. Herbert made a deal with Graham that if the Tubes could sell out three local shows, Graham would give him an opening slot on the show of his choice.

Herbert booked shows at a local club called the Village, which sold out thanks to themes inspired by the San Francisco post-hippie underground culture such as &quot;The Streaker&#x27;s Ball&quot; and &quot;Mondo Bondage.&quot; Much to Graham&#x27;s dismay, Herbert chose an opening slot for the upcoming Led Zeppelin show at Kezar Stadium. The band pulled out the stops, including Waybill dressed as an early version of &quot;Quay Lewd&quot; throwing &quot;Cocaine&quot; (flour) and &quot;Pills&quot; (candy) at the crowd, who threw it back. Graham threatened Herbert saying that the band would never play in San Francisco again but calmed down and eventually fell in love with the band, booking them at Winterland and other California venues for New Year&#x27;s shows and Halloween. After the 1973 Led Zeppelin show, Herbert wanted to manage the band, but Spooner and the group went with local management team Mort Moriarty and Gary Peterson, also known as &quot;Bag O&#x27; Bucks.&quot; Moriarty was interested in the use of video in rock music and saw the Tubes&#x27; stage show as the future of music videos. Bob McIntosh died of cancer at this time, leaving Prince as the only drummer.

In 1974, Bag O&#x27; Bucks filmed a Tubes show at the California Hall and shopped the &quot;video demo&quot; around Los Angeles. George Daly, Columbia Records head of A&amp;R in San Francisco, made some Tubes demos, but CBS&#x27; corporate headquarters in New York City would not agree to signing the Tubes to Columbia due to the radical nature of their art. After 18 months, with no success at his own label, Daly, at the suggestion of Rick Wakeman, finally pitched the group to competitor A&amp;M Records, where his former Columbia East Coast A&amp;R colleague and friend, Kip Cohen, had recently headed the A&amp;R division. Daly personally flew managers Moriarity and Petersen to Los Angeles and Cohen signed the Tubes to A&amp;M, a rare example of cross-company support by major label executives. Working with lawyer Greg Fischbach, the band signed with A&amp;M Records.

=== Debut album ===
The Tubes&#x27; first album, &quot;The Tubes&quot; (1975), was produced by Al Kooper. The track &quot;White Punks on Dope&quot; was an &quot;absurd anthem of wretched excess&quot; and ridiculed the Hollywood kids of the rich and famous. Since then the song has been covered by Mötley Crüe, P.O.L. (Parade of Losers) and the German rock musician Nina Hagen took the tune and set new lyrics to it (not a translation of the original lyrics), titled her work &quot;TV-Glotzer&quot; (&quot;Couch Potato&quot;), using this song as the opening track of her own debut album &quot;Nina Hagen Band&quot; (1978). The album track &quot;What Do You Want from Life?,&quot; which became another of the Tubes&#x27; signature songs, satirizes consumerism and celebrity culture and climaxes in a monolog by Waybill who, in a rapid game show announcer&#x27;s patter, name-checks celebrities such as Bob Dylan, Paul Williams and Randolph Mantooth, as well as well-known products of the period, including the Dynagym exercise machine and a host of American vehicles such as &quot;a herd of Winnebagos&quot; and a &quot;Mercury Montclair...&quot; as part of a list of things that, &quot;if you&#x27;re an American citizen, you are entitled to&quot; culminating in &quot;a baby&#x27;s arm holding an apple.&quot;

By late 1975, the band created a stage show unlike any other after hiring Kenny Ortega to direct and choreograph, comedian Jane Dornacker and her band &quot;Leila and the Snakes,&quot; and event support/video pioneer T.J. McHose to run a live video feed with films for each song. The show was critically acclaimed and broke them into show business in Los Angeles during sold-out runs at the Roxy Theater, David Allen&#x27;s Boarding House and Bimbo&#x27;s in San Francisco, as well as The Bottom Line in New York City. Compared at the time to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, the Tubes&#x27; stage show was closer to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with its mix of topical satire and subversive postmodern Andy Kaufman-like routines such as Waybill beating up a couple in the front row (who were planted) during the &quot;Crime Medley,&quot; then taking off his disguise as the band launched into &quot;Mondo Bondage&quot; and a huge stack of &quot;Kill Amplifiers&quot; (cardboard) falling on Quay Lewd during the finale of &quot;White Punks on Dope.&quot;

The band was part of the mid-&#x27;70s underground comedy scene which included The Credibility Gap, Firesign Theatre, Ace Trucking Company, Kentucky Fried Theater, Groundlings, Ken Shapiro&#x27;s Channel One Video Theatre and National Lampoon. The L.A. Connection Comedy Theatre performed during the Tubes show intermission many times. In 1975, the Tubes were offered a spot on &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot; and &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, but manager Mort Moriarty wanted the band to be able to play several songs in a row to show off how tight their transitions were; both shows declined, and without major network TV appearances, the Tubes missed out on huge TV exposure, cementing their &quot;cult&quot; status until the early 1980s. The band&#x27;s touring crew was up to 24 people at this point, making it hard to tour for the standard weeks on end most bands of the era were committing to build a fan base.

=== &quot;Young and Rich&quot; ===
The Tubes&#x27; second album, &quot;Young and Rich&quot; (1976) on A&amp;M Records, was produced by Ken Scott. It featured &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch Me There,&quot; a suggestive duet between Waybill and Styles, which was arranged in classic &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; style by Jack Nitzsche. The song was co-written by Ron Nagle and Tubes dancer/vocalist Jane Dornacker.

The band toured America with a new stage show including new numbers &quot;Slipped My Disco,&quot; &quot;Madam, I&#x27;m Adam&quot; and &quot;Pimp.&quot; They also played several sold out nights at The Shrine in Los Angeles and Bimbo&#x27;s in San Francisco. Mingo Lewis joined the band after performing several shows with them at Bimbo&#x27;s.

=== &quot;Now&quot;, &quot;What Do You Want From Live&quot;, &quot;Remote Control&quot; ===
The Tubes&#x27; third album &quot;Now&quot; (1977) was an attempt to write less satirical songs with the band sharing song writing duties with Bill Spooner. It was recorded while the band was playing a special engagement on weekends at The Whisky in Los Angeles. They played a small American tour of the west coast and a month-long run at San Francisco&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts featuring the band&#x27;s most elaborate stage show to date. The band had met manager Rikki Farr at a show opening for Alice Cooper. Farr fell in love with the band&#x27;s stage show and agreed to manage them after they sued Bag O&#x27; Bucks to get out of their contract. Farr used his fame in England to promote them as &quot;America&#x27;s Answer to Punk.&quot;

The band created a new &quot;best of&quot; stage show and finally played a tour of Europe. They were banned in several towns and attracted front page press attention for their dark satirical stage show that spoofed America&#x27;s consumer culture with dancers, video and sketches. They appeared on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and played &quot;God-Bird-Change&quot; and &quot;White Punks on Dope.&quot;

After their live record &quot;What Do You Want from Live&quot; (1978), recorded during their record-breaking run at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, England, the band toured America and played a sold-out run at The Pantages Theater in Hollywood, which attracted celebrities such as the cast of &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, Cher, Kate Jackson, and Gene Simmons. The stage show had reached new levels of lewdness with Quay Lewd&#x27;s large dildo hanging out of his costume and a fake bomb threat number called &quot;The Terrorists of Rock,&quot; which caused Cher to flee the theater, believing the threat was real. She later asked the band to appear in her next TV special &quot;Cher...Special&quot;. The band went back to Europe to follow up their big splash but it was canceled after Waybill fell off stage and broke his leg. The band returned and played the dates in the fall before headlining the Knebworth Rock Festival with Frank Zappa, Peter Gabriel and Boomtown Rats.

The fourth album for A&amp;M, &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1979) was a concept album produced by Todd Rundgren, about a television-addicted idiot-savant, inspired by the Jerzy Kosinski novel &quot;Being There&quot; (which was later made into a movie starring Peter Sellers). The cover of &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1979) shows a baby (Rikki Farr&#x27;s son) in a specially made &quot;Vidi-Trainer&quot; (a car seat/TV with a baby bottle nipple) created by Michael Cotten and Dave Mellot. Much of the new music was rewritten by Rundgren and the band in studio, including &quot;Turn Me On&quot; (formerly &quot;Get Over It&quot;); &quot;The Terrorists of Rock&quot; number was cannibalized to become &quot;Telecide.&quot;

Waybill and Styles shared vocals on &quot;Prime Time,&quot; although Rundgren had tried to record a version with just Styles. When Waybill found out, he demanded to sing as well. The band performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and on tour in Europe before cutting it from the set, due to tensions between Waybill and Styles.

Synth player and visual stylist Michael Cotten designed an innovative multimedia stage show for the &quot;Remote Control&quot; tour, which employed multiple TV monitors and a 35 mm film projector, which according to Cotten, cost US$12,000 (equivalent to around $50,000 in 2022). They tested it (with no dress rehearsal) at UCLA&#x27;s Royce Hall, but there were multiple technical problems, including the poor visibility of the small TV screens, and synchronization problems with the film projections. The show was scrapped after Steen, Waybill and the group&#x27;s management reportedly complained about the cost, and the show overtaking the music. This led to a stripped-down tour in the U.S., Japan, and Europe with Squeeze as the support act. The band also played two shows at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, with Yellow Magic Orchestra as support; that show was released on home video in 1982. The band held an auction of Tubes stage props and costumes in 1980 at the Boarding House before the band attempted to play as a straight rock act for several sold-out shows at The Roxy in Los Angeles.

=== Music videos ===
John Tobler said that with their media savvy and theatrical skills, the Tubes were born to create rock video but arrived several years too early. However, the band did produce at least one collection of music videos, which were issued on the 1982 RCA Capacitance Electronic Disc and Pioneer Laserdisc &quot;The Tubes Video&quot;, containing versions of twelve of the band&#x27;s hits, including &quot;White Punks on Dope,&quot; &quot;Mondo Bondage,&quot; &quot;Talk to Ya Later,&quot; and most of &quot;The Completion Backward Principle&quot; album, in slickly produced music videos based on the group&#x27;s stage shows. It was directed by Russell Mulcahy and filmed at Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, England.

=== Stage show production pioneers ===
The Tubes put their creativity and art skills mainly into their live performances, in which songs could be full-fledged production numbers with props and costumes built at the Tubes Warehouse by the band, crew and friends. Everything was satirized, from a beach movie parody for &quot;Sushi Girl,&quot; to leather clad S&amp;M hijinks in &quot;Mondo Bondage,&quot; to the game show antics of &quot;What Do You Want from Life?&quot; At their peak, their live act featured dozens of other performers, including tap dancers and acrobats. The Tubes&#x27; stage productions were choreographed by Kenny Ortega and featured cast members Jane Dornacker, LeRoy Jones, Michael Holman, Michael Springer, Cindi Osborn, Heline Gouax, and Mary Niland from 1975 to 1977.

From 1978 to 1979, the cast included Sharon Collins, Caty Bevan, and Loryanna Catalano. The &quot;Completion Backward&quot; tour featured Shelly Pang, Cheryl Hangland, Joey Richards, and Cynthia Rhodes. From 1983 to 1985, Michele Gray (who later married Todd Rundgren) and Cheryl Hangland were principal dancers. Several crew members—including Tour Manager Steve &quot;Chopper&quot; Borges, Lee Collins, and Gail Lowe — made frequent appearances on stage in various roles as well.

The Tubes&#x27; live shows in the late 1970s and early 1980s were rife with allusions to mainstream film: &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), &quot;Grease&quot; (1978)] then-forgotten B-movies [&quot;Wild Women of Wongo&quot; (1958), &quot;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&quot; (1958)], music (Tom Jones, punk rock, a medley of Nelson Riddle television themes), contemporary pop culture (Patty Hearst, the Viking program), television (&quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;Fernwood 2Nite&quot;, the anime &quot;Raideen&quot;), and literature (Nelson Algren&#x27;s &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot;).

The shows were expensive to produce, however, and although they earned the band a reputation for being one of the most entertaining live acts of the time, by the early 1980s, they&#x27;d left the band in debt to A&amp;M Records, even after they&#x27;d sold their song rights for tour support.

=== Dropped by A&amp;M Records and signing with Capitol Records ===
The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, the self-produced &quot;Suffer for Sound&quot;, was meant to complete the group&#x27;s contract with A&amp;M. The recession had affected the music industry, and many other bands were cut from A&amp;M at the end of the 1970s. The band owed A&amp;M a large amount of money and after playing the new record for Jerry Moss, Rikki Farr insulted Moss&#x27; taste in music to ensure that the band was let go and able to sign with a new label. Tubes friend Matt Leach compiled the outtakes, B-sides, and oddities collection &quot;T.R.A.S.H. (Tubes Rarities and Smash Hits)&quot; (1981). The band was signed to Capitol Records by Bruce Garfield and Bobby Colomby, toning down the X-rated sketches for the live shows and redesigning itself as a leaner ensemble with a view to release more accessible hits. The band worked with Bobby Colomby to find a new musical direction and then met with possible producers including Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter before deciding on David Foster. The Tubes and David Foster recorded &quot;Gonna Get It Next Time&quot; for the soundtrack of Chevy Chase&#x27;s &quot;Modern Problems&quot; directed by Ken Shapiro.

=== New label, mainstream success ===
&quot;The Completion Backward Principle&quot; (1981) was engineered by Humberto Gatica and produced by David Foster (Earth, Wind and Fire). It featured the classic rock radio staple &quot;Talk to Ya Later,&quot; written by Waybill, Foster and Toto guitarist Steve Lukather. The songwriting credits were shared again but included input from all members, including &quot;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&quot; by Prince, &quot;Think About Me&quot; by Cotten, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore&quot; by Vince Welnick and &quot;Matter of Pride&quot; by Steen. The album was a satire of Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Morning in America&quot; corporate movement and included pictures of the band members cleaned up and wearing suits. The band also had their first Top 40 hit in the United States in 1981, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore,&quot; with vocals by Spooner. The band returned to the road in America and Europe with a new stage show designed by Cotten, Prince, and Ortega, featuring new dancers including Cynthia Rhodes, who would leave soon after to star in &quot;Flashdance&quot; and &quot;Staying Alive&quot;. Styles was said to have left the band: Waybill said at the time that she was &quot;going on to a Hollywood movie career or something&quot;. Styles, Cotten and Prince played as the Boring Squares in San Francisco in 1980. The trio were also said to have played a show on Bora Bora in 1984.

While on tour in Italy the Tubes were forced off stage by local police with machine guns and they escaped the country with the promoter&#x27;s money after he failed to deliver professional shows. The single &quot;Sports Fans&quot; was recorded live during halftime of the legendary San Francisco 49ers &quot;The Catch&quot; game; Tubes crew members can be seen on the side lines in the slow motion replay.

As the band gained more mainstream popularity, Waybill auditioned for roles in &quot;Night Shift&quot; and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; and appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; twice.

&quot;Outside Inside&quot; (1983) was produced by David Foster and included the number 10 US hit &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty.&quot; The album was recorded with several studio musicians, including members of Chicago and Toto. The slicker sound added to the tension between the &quot;art&quot; oriented members of the group (Cotten, Spooner and Prince) and the pop-music fans (Steen and Waybill). The band performed &quot;The Monkey Time&quot; on &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, and toured the United States, mostly playing theme parks like Six Flags Magic Mountain and colleges for a new generation of fans. The band filmed an hour-long concert special at the Kabuki Theatre in San Francisco which played on MTV and was directed by Jim Yukich. &quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot; won song of the year and The Tubes performed live at the &quot;BAM&quot; music awards.

=== &quot;Love Bomb&quot; and departure from Capitol Records ===
In 1984, the band teamed up with Todd Rundgren again for their eighth album, &quot;Love Bomb&quot; (1985). Tired of spending money at other recording studios, the band built their own studio with Rundgren called &quot;Cavum Soni&quot; and XTC recorded several tracks there with Todd for &quot;Skylarking&quot; on which also Prince played drums. Glen Tilbrook of Squeeze sings back up on &quot;Night People.&quot; The entire recording process was video taped by a camera crew on Betamax. Bruce Garfield and Bobby Colomby were dropped by Capitol in the company-wide layoffs that took place pre-reorganization, and like many of their label mates, the Tubes were released; however that occurred just as they were going on tour in support of the album. The band found it necessary to self-finance the tour as a matter of respect to honor their commitment to their fans. Between this tour&#x27;s self-financing and the band&#x27;s continued self-financing of their San Francisco recording studio built in 1980, the tour left the band a half million dollars in debt, obliging them to play less expensive and smaller venues for a year to pay off their financial commitments. The Tubes recorded several songs for movie soundtracks including &quot;Hardbodies,&quot; &quot;My Science Project&quot;, and &quot;Heavenly Bodies&quot;. Bill Spooner also recorded a solo album titled &quot;First Chud&quot;, released on The Residents&#x27; record label Ralph Records.

Spooner&#x27;s next solo project was &quot;Mall to Mars&quot;, recorded with coproducer Jim Blake and featuring fellow Tubes member Prairie Prince on drums. The concept album was released on Visible Records, a label owned by long-time Tubes music publishing associate/copyright administrator Richard Kaye, and contains several cover versions including the &quot;Theme from &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;, &quot;Dimming of the Day&quot;, and &quot;They Kicked Me Out of the Band&quot; (that Bill claims is not true... he says, he actually quit the Tubes).

=== Waybill departs ===
Waybill released a solo album produced by David Foster (&quot;Read My Lips&quot;, Capitol Records) in 1984 and was on-camera talent for the 1985 MTV Video Awards. He also enjoyed a fruitful writing partnership with Capitol Records label mate Richard Marx, their most popular and well known collaboration being &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart,&quot; recorded by the female band Vixen. Waybill left the Tubes in 1986.

=== Personnel changes ===
Later in the year, the remaining members of the band hired David Killingsworth, a longtime friend from Phoenix, as lead vocalist. Killingsworth had been the singer in the Red and White Blues Band with Prince and Steen. The band appeared on &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; on Fox in 1987 and played &quot;Talk to Ya Later,&quot; a new song called &quot;No Baby&#x27;s Gonna Break My Heart,&quot; and were also interviewed.

Michael Cotten moved to New York City to pursue a career based on his artwork, stage design and production, and is considered one of the country&#x27;s top production designers. In the fall of 1988, Bill Spooner traveled his final tour with the band and left in early 1989. Vince Welnick departed as well to take to the road with Todd Rundgren in 1989 and then joined the Grateful Dead in 1990. Gary Cambra joined on keyboards and guitar in 1989. He and Roger Steen took over most of the lead vocal duties after Killingsworth left in early 1990.

In 1993, Fee Waybill rejoined the band. The lineup toured Europe and released two albums, a compilation and the 1996 album &quot;Genius of America&quot;. David Medd joined in 1996 to play keyboards alongside Cambra. In 2001, the band released a live CD, &quot;The Tubes World Tour 2001&quot;, and continued to tour.

=== 2000–present ===
The band has toured the United States each year with a lineup of Waybill, Steen, Anderson, Medd, Gary Cambra and Prince. Cambra left in 2006. After a 2004 tour of the UK, the London show was released as a live album and DVD called &quot;Wild in London&quot;. On June 2, 2006, former keyboardist Vince Welnick died. In September 2007, the remaining members reunited in Phoenix for induction into the Arizona Music and Entertainment Hall Of Fame.

On April 17, 2022, Styles died at the age of 72. On December 16, 2022, Rick Anderson died at the age of 75.

== The Tubes Project and other milestones ==
Michael Cotten began the Tubes Project in 2005, to save and digitize the band&#x27;s reel to reel and video tape archive. The collection had been kept in the closet of Tubes fan club president Marilyn Wood&#x27;s son after being discarded in the late 1980s. Included in the vault are full color shows taped for TV at Bimbo&#x27;s in San Francisco, 1975 and Dutch VARA TV from the 1977 European tour. Over 70 interviews were conducted with band members, crew, managers, cast and colleagues such as Styles, Todd Rundgren, Al Kooper, Devo, and David Foster. Hundreds of photos were scanned and compiled from band members and fan collections for use in the hour and half documentary.

After leaving the band, Jane Dornacker performed as stand-up comedian and later worked as a traffic reporter with the team which replaced Howard Stern at WNBC. She was killed in a helicopter crash in 1986, while giving a live report. A benefit show was held for her daughter at the Warfield in San Francisco with the Tubes and Todd Rundgren.

On November 10, 2009, &quot;Mondo Birthmark,&quot; a CD of previously unreleased rarities, was released through the label Fuel 2000. The package was designed by Michael Cotten and Prairie Prince with rare photos and interviews of the group. The early demos featured the band&#x27;s first drummer, Bob Macintosh.

On July 24, 2019, Kenny Ortega was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Fee, Michael Cotton and Michael Holman attended the ceremony.

<text>August Dvorak (May 5, 1894 – October 9, 1975) was an American educational psychologist and professor of education at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. He and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, are best known for creating the Dvorak keyboard layout in the 1930s as a replacement for the QWERTY keyboard layout. 

While his name is pronounced , with the &quot;ř&quot; roughly as a simultaneous trilled and due to him being of Czech descent, Dvorak&#x27;s family in the U.S. pronounces it , with an English &quot;r.&quot;

==Keyboard development==
In the 1940s, Dvorak designed keyboard layouts for people with the use of one hand.

Dvorak and Dealey, together with Nellie Merrick and Gertrude Ford, wrote the book &quot;Typewriting Behavior&quot;, published in 1936. The book is an in-depth report on the psychology and physiology of typing.

==Military service==
Dvorak served with the American Army Field Artillery during the punitive expedition against Pancho Villa and was wounded during the campaign. Afterward he was discharged and enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve, teaching mathematics and navigation until World War I, during which he served aboard the captured German privateer USS &quot;Callao&quot; bringing troops home until his discharge in 1919. Later, he was the captain of a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine in the United States Navy during World War II. 

==Life and family==
Dr. August Dvorak died in Seattle on October 9, 1975.

<text>Carl Hilding &quot;Doc&quot; Severinsen (born July 7, 1927) is an American retired jazz trumpeter who led the NBC Orchestra on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

==Early life==
Severinsen was born in Arlington, Oregon, to Minnie Mae (1897–1998) and Carl Severinsen (1898–1972). He was nicknamed Doc after his father, the only dentist in Arlington, who was born in Germany to a Danish father and a Swiss mother. Severinsen&#x27;s father played violin and wanted him to play it as well, but Severinsen wanted to play trombone. Because his arms were not long enough for trombone, and the small Arlington music store had none available, he settled for the cornet. A neighbor provided him with some lessons, while his father, tobacco in mouth, instructed him to spit out the notes like spitting tobacco. His mother threatened to spank him if he didn&#x27;t practice. Growing up, Severinsen idolized the trumpeter and band leader Harry James.

&quot;wining (sic) the Music Teachers National Association’s National Contest at the age of 12&quot; - PBS

Severinsen proved to have a knack for the instrument, and was in a high school band when he was seven. At 9, he won a state trumpet contest, at 13, he joined a multi-state all-star band and, at 14, he auditioned for Tommy Dorsey but was not hired. He started a quartet called the Blue Notes that performed at local dances.

Before graduating from high school, he was hired to go on the road with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra. After graduation, he went on tour with Charlie Barnet, Tommy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman. He served in the Army during World War II. Severinsen was a member of Sam Donahue&#x27;s band between 1946 and 1951. In 1946, he played trumpet on radio station KODL.

==&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and other television appearances==
In 1949, Severinsen landed a job as a studio musician for NBC, where he accompanied Steve Allen, Eddie Fisher, Dinah Shore, and Kate Smith, and was a member of the original band for &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot;, and was the soloist playing the closing theme. He left the show with Allen in 1957. The leader of The Tonight Show Band, Skitch Henderson, asked him to return as first-chair trumpeter in 1962 for what had become &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and five years later, after Milton Delugg, Severinsen was leading the band.

Under Severinsen&#x27;s direction, The Tonight Show Band, styled the NBC Orchestra, became perhaps the best known big band in America. Severinsen became one of the most popular bandleaders, appearing almost every night on television. He led the band during commercials and while guests were introduced. He joked with Johnny Carson, the show&#x27;s host, and developed an amusing habit of wearing gaudy clothing.

The show introduced a comic &quot;Stump the Band&quot; segment in which audience members called out the titles of obscure songs to see if the band could play them. Severinsen often cried &quot;key of E&quot;, his signal for the band to strike up a western theme, and then he would enthusiastically sing a country music-flavored nonsense song.

Severinsen substituted for Ed McMahon on occasions when Ed was absent as Carson&#x27;s announcer and sidekick. He typically assumed this role when the show featured a guest host, which became increasingly frequent during the program&#x27;s later years. Tommy Newsom was usually the band&#x27;s substitute director when Severinsen was away from the show or filling in for McMahon. The sidekick role was omitted from the show when Leno guest hosted (it was discontinued altogether after Leno replaced Carson permanently). While Leno guest hosted for Carson, Severinsen typically introduced Leno and led the band while interacting with Leno in a similar manner to his interactions with Carson and McMahon.

Doc continued as bandleader until Carson&#x27;s retirement in May 1992. Doc, along with Tommy Newsom and Ed Shaughnessy, appeared on the January 31, 2005 episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; performing &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot; in honor of Johnny Carson, who died on January 23 of that same year. He appeared on Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; in February 2015 when the show traveled to Los Angeles for a week. He played for the evening with The Roots. The appearance helped to promote his nationwide tour.

Through the 1970s to the 1990s Severinsen also made appearances on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, among others.

==Recording career==
During the early 1960s, Severinsen began recording big band albums, then moved toward instrumental pop music by the end of the decade. In the 1970s he recorded jazz funk, then disco, finding hits with &quot;Night Journey&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be With You&quot;. He released an album with the jazz fusion group Xebron in 1985. During the next year, he recorded &quot;The Tonight Show Band with Doc Severinsen&quot; which won the Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance. After Carson retired in 1992, he toured with some of the band&#x27;s members, including Conte Candoli, Snooky Young, Bill Perkins, Ernie Watts, Ross Tompkins, and Ed Shaughnessy.

Severinsen performed with high school bands, in particular in the 1970s with Don Caneva&#x27;s John Hersey High School Bands, which recorded four albums.

He performed the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on at least three nationally telecast occasions; however, the first two renditions were marred by problems. When he accompanied actor Pat O&#x27;Brien, as O&#x27;Brien recited the National Anthem at Super Bowl IV, the public address system at Tulane Stadium went dead for a minute, although viewers were unaware of it. Fifteen years later, when he performed the anthem again prior to the Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns fight, a giant US flag on the side of the Fantasy Tower at Caesar&#x27;s Palace overlooking the outdoor ring was not unfurled properly due to problems with the roping. He performed the anthem again, as well as &quot;O Canada&quot;, at the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Anaheim, California. With the game being played in the Los Angeles television and radio market, he was accompanied by the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; band. As of 2020, Severinsen and the NBC Orchestra&#x27;s performance remains the most recent non-vocal rendition of the national anthem at the Midsummer Classic.

Severinsen is credited for co-writing the hit song &quot;Stop and Smell the Roses&quot; with Mac Davis, although both parties agree that Severinsen only came up with the title.

==Conducting and teaching==

Severinsen was the principal pops conductor for several American orchestras during and after his time on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. His first position was with the Phoenix Symphony in 1983. He then held similar positions with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, and Minnesota Orchestra.

He retired from conducting in 2007 and was named Pops Conductor Emeritus in Milwaukee and Pops Conductor Laureate in Minnesota. Severinsen was also named distinguished visiting professor of music and Katherine K. Herberger Heritage Chair for Visiting Artists at Arizona State University School of Music in 2001 and 2002.

In 2014, he was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame.

Severinsen performed his final concert, accompanied by his San Miguel 5 group, on September 1, 2022, in Saratoga Springs, New York.

On June 23, 1949, Severinsen married Jane Simpson Frazer. They had four children before divorcing.

On August 7, 1964, Severinsen married Evonne Nyman. They had one child and were divorced in 1976.

In 1980, he married Emily Marshall, who was a television writer and producer and is an on-camera subject in a 2020 PBS documentary produced by American Masters titled &quot;Never Too Late: The Doc Severinsen Story&quot; that premiered April 2, 2021. They met when she was working as a secretary for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; producer Fred de Cordova. In 1992, after The Tonight Show, Severinsen moved to Mexico with his wife, and formed a new band, The San Miguel Five. They divorced in 2006. Marshall died in 2023.

By 2013, Severinsen was living in Tennessee for a few years, moving to Tennessee to be closer to Cathy Leach, principal trumpeter with the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra and professor of trumpet at the University of Tennessee.&lt;ref name=&quot;shns/severinsen-85&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Severinsen&#x27;s &quot;companion&quot; was trumpet player Cathy Leach, a professor emerita of trumpet at the University of Tennessee. In 2022, Leach was cited as his wife. Severinsen and Leach perform together.

Severinsen has been quoted as saying that he has been married four times.

Severinsen&#x27;s children are Nancy, Cindy, Allen, Robin, and Judy. He has eight grandchildren, including Blaire and Gray Reinhard, who write and perform roots rock music together in various incarnations as Curtis &amp; Reinhard and the Blaire Reinhard Band.
