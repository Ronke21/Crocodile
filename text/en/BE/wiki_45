<text>Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent (born Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, ; 27 August 1968) was a Greek and Danish princess by birth and a British princess by marriage. She was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, and a granddaughter of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece. Princess Marina married Prince George, Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary, in 1934. They had three children: Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael.

Marina was widowed in 1942, when her husband was killed in a plane crash on active service. In later life she carried out many royal engagements, including the independence celebrations for Ghana and Botswana.

==Early life==

Princess Marina was born on 13 December 1906 in Athens, Greece, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, George I of Greece. She was the third and youngest daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, and his wife Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. Her father was the third son of George I of Greece and Queen Olga, while her mother was the only daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Her father was a grandson of Christian IX of Denmark, while her mother was a granddaughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia.

Princess Marina had two elder sisters, Princess Olga and Princess Elizabeth. Princess Olga married Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in 1923. After the assassination of his cousin, Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Paul served as Prince Regent of Yugoslavia from 1934 to 1941. Princess Elizabeth married Carl Theodor, Count of Toeering-Jettenbach in 1934. One of their paternal uncles was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (making Marina and her sisters Philip&#x27;s first cousins).

Marina spent her early years in Greece, and lived with her parents and paternal grandparents at Tatoi Palace. Along with her sisters, she was raised to be devout and religious, which was encouraged by her grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece. Marina&#x27;s family travelled outside of Greece often, especially during the summer months. Her first recorded visit to Britain was in 1910, when she was 3, after the death of her godfather, Edward VII. During that visit, she met her other godmother and future mother-in-law, Queen Mary, who treated Marina and her sisters like her own children.

The Greek royal family was forced into exile when Marina was 11, following the overthrow of the Greek monarchy. They later moved to Paris, while the Princess stayed with her extended family throughout Europe.

==Marriage and children==

===Wedding ceremony===
In 1932, Princess Marina and Prince George (later the Duke of Kent), a second cousin through Christian IX of Denmark, met in London. Their betrothal was announced in August 1934. Prince George was created Duke of Kent on 9 October 1934. On 29 November 1934, they married at Westminster Abbey, London. The wedding was a grand affair, as it had been more than eleven years since the last royal wedding with Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). The wedding of Prince George and Princess Marina was the first royal wedding ceremony to be broadcast by wireless, and with the use of other technology, such as microphones—the control room was located underneath the Unknown Warrior&#x27;s tomb of Westminster Abbey. The service was broadcast locally and abroad to other nations, and loudspeakers allowed spectators from outside the Abbey to hear the proceedings. The wedding was followed by a Greek ceremony in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace, which was converted into an Orthodox chapel for the ceremony. The wedding was the most recent occasion on which a princess from another royal family married into the British royal family.

===Married life===

The Duke and Duchess set up their first home at 3 Belgrave Square, close to Buckingham Palace. She became a patroness of several organizations and charities, including the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, the Women&#x27;s Hospital Fund, and the Central School of Speech and Drama. She would continue to support these charities and institutions for the rest of her life. She became very close to her mother-in-law, Queen Mary, with whom she would usually spend time while her husband was off performing his own royal duties.

The couple had three children:

*Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (born 9 October 1935). He married Katharine Worsley on 8 June 1961. They have three children.
*Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (born 25 December 1936). She married the Hon. Angus Ogilvy, son of David Ogilvy, 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, on 24 April 1963. They have two children.
*Prince Michael of Kent (born 4 July 1942). He married Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz on 30 June 1978. They have two children.

The Duke of Kent was killed on 25 August 1942, in an airplane crash at Eagle&#x27;s Rock, near Dunbeath, Caithness, Scotland, while on active service with the Royal Air Force. The Duchess, according to royal biographer Hugo Vickers, was &quot;the only war widow in Britain whose estate was forced to pay
death duties&quot;.

During World War II, Marina was trained as a nurse for three months under the pseudonym &quot;Sister Kay&quot; and joined the civil nurse reserve.

==Later life and death==
After her husband&#x27;s death, the Duchess of Kent continued to be an active member of the British royal family, carrying out a wide range of royal and official engagements. She was the president of the Wimbledon All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for 26 years. She was also the president of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1943 until her death and was awarded the RNLI&#x27;s gold medal in 1967 to mark this contribution. One of her first cousins was Prince Philip (later the Duke of Edinburgh), who married her niece, the future Queen Elizabeth II, in 1947.

In 1947, Princess Marina visited Greece and Italy. In June 1952 the Duchess laid the foundation stone of the new St Mark&#x27;s Church in Bromley, London, which had been damaged in the war.

In 1952, the Duchess also visited Sarawak (then a British Crown Colony), where she laid the foundation stone of the Cathedral of St Thomas in Kuching. She also visited the Batu Lintang camp, a Japanese internment camp during World War II which had been converted to a teacher training college, and the city of Sibu, where she opened the outpatient department of the Lau Kheng Howe Hospital.

In March 1957, when the Gold Coast achieved independence from Britain as Ghana, the Duchess of Kent was appointed to represent the Queen at the celebrations. Fifty years later, at the 50th anniversary of Ghana&#x27;s independence, her son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was appointed by the Queen to represent her.

Marina earned a place in the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1960 together with the Princess of Monaco, Patricia Lopez-Willshaw and Merle Oberon. In 1964, the Princess took an extensive tour of Australia and officially opened Gladesville Bridge in Sydney.

In September and October 1966, when the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland and Basutoland became the new Republic of Botswana and the Kingdom of Lesotho respectively, the Princess was appointed again to represent the Queen at both celebrations. The main public hospital in Gaborone, the new Botswana&#x27;s capital, is named &quot;Princess Marina Hospital&quot;. She was the Chancellor of the University of Kent at Canterbury from 1963 until her death.

Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, died of a brain tumour at Kensington Palace at 11.40 am on 27 August 1968, aged 61. The funeral service for the Princess was held at St. George&#x27;s Chapel on 30 August. She was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. Her funeral was the last royal ceremony attended by her brother-in-law, the former king Edward VIII. Her will was sealed in London after her death in 1968. Her estate was valued at £76,166 (or £940,600 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<text>The Killing is a 1956 American film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick and produced by James B. Harris. It was written by Kubrick and Jim Thompson and based on Lionel White&#x27;s novel &quot;Clean Break&quot;. It stars Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, and Vince Edwards, and features Marie Windsor, Elisha Cook Jr., Jay C. Flippen and Timothy Carey.

==Plot==
Johnny Clay, a career criminal recently released from prison, plans the heist of a horse racetrack, with an estimated take of two million dollars. His associate Marvin Unger provides financial backing for the plot, makes his apartment available as a hideout, and provides its address to two of the track&#x27;s employees: cashier George Peatty, and bartender Mike O&#x27;Reilly. Corrupt police officer Randy Kennan joins the scheme. George, trapped in a loveless marriage with his materialistic wife Sherry, confesses the plan to her, which she immediately communicates to her boyfriend Val.

At the hideout, the five men conspire regarding the details of the heist. Johnny discloses that two other men will be involved, and paid low, flat fees for their roles: a sharpshooter will kill the favored horse in the race to sow confusion, and a wrestler will make a scene at the bar to create a diversion. Sherry is discovered to be eavesdropping on the plot, and the others separate George and Sherry. Johnny orders Sherry not to interfere further until the heist is completed.

On the morning of the heist, Marvin expresses paternal feelings for Johnny, suggesting that they go away together following its completion. Johnny rebuffs this suggestion, ordering Marvin to stay away from the track while the heist is in progress. Mike smuggles a gun into the track&#x27;s locker room, opposite its money room. Marvin, who is very drunk, appears at the track, against Johnny&#x27;s wishes, and to the disturbance of the others. Despite this, all others are in position, and they commit to the heist. As the wrestler starts a fight at the bar, drawing security away from the money room, George helps Johnny access the locker room. Johnny acquires the gun, dons a mask, and holds up the money room as the horse is shot, throwing a sack of money out the window, where Randy collects it. When the sharpshooter attempts to get away, his tire is punctured by a horseshoe just thrown on the ground by an attendant he had antagonized, and he is shot dead.

At the hideout, the others await the return of Johnny, now in possession of the money. Val ambushes the hideout, a shootout ensues, and a wounded George is left as the last man standing. As George stumbles outside, Johnny sees that something is clearly wrong, and continues driving. He purchases a large suitcase, transfers the money into it, and struggles to secure it. George returns to his apartment, kills Sherry, and collapses. At the airport, Johnny reunites with his girlfriend Fay. They fail to register the suitcase as carry-on luggage, and have no choice but to check it. When a baggage cart driver swerves in order to avoid hitting a dog, the suitcase bursts open, and the money is scattered in the wind by a propeller. While attempting to leave, Johnny is identified by authorities. Although Fay urges Johnny to run, he refuses, calmly accepting his fate.

==Cast==
==Production==

While playing chess in Washington Square, Kubrick met producer James B. Harris, who had sold his film distribution company and was looking for a new young talent. Harris considered Kubrick &quot;the most intelligent, most creative person [he had] ever come in contact with&quot;, and the two formed the Harris-Kubrick Pictures Corporation in 1955. Harris purchased the rights to Lionel White&#x27;s novel &quot;Clean Break&quot; for $10,000, beating United Artists, which was interested in the film as a vehicle for Frank Sinatra. At Kubrick&#x27;s suggestion they hired hardboiled fiction novelist Jim Thompson to write the script. United Artists told the pair that it would help finance the picture if Harris and Kubrick could find a high-profile actor to star. They signed Sterling Hayden, who agreed to accept $40,000. But Hayden was not a big enough star for UA, which wound up providing only $200,000 for the film; Harris financed the rest using $80,000 of his own money and a $50,000 loan from his father. The film was the first of three on which Harris and Kubrick collaborated as producer and director over less than ten years. Working titles for the film were &quot;Clean Break&quot; and &quot;Bed of Fear&quot;. It was the last feature film completely filmed by Kubrick in the United States (interiors for &quot;Spartacus&quot; were shot on Universal&#x27;s Hollywood sound stages, but its battle exteriors were shot in Spain).

Three members of the cast—Hayden, Ted de Corsia, and Timothy Carey—had appeared together the previous year in the low-budget noir film &quot;Crime Wave&quot;. The art director, Ruth Sobotka, was Kubrick&#x27;s wife at the time. Kubrick and Harris moved from New York to L.A. to shoot the picture, and Kubrick went unpaid during the shooting, surviving on loans from Harris. In addition to Hayden, Kubrick cast actors from &quot;films noirs&quot; he liked, such as Carey, de Corsia, Elisha Cook Jr. and Marie Windsor. He chose former professional wrestler and old chess friend Kola Kwariani to play an aging, chess-playing grappler. The Hollywood cinematographers&#x27; union told Kubrick that he could not be both director and cinematographer, so veteran cinematographer Lucien Ballard was hired to shoot the picture. He and Kubrick often clashed. On one occasion Kubrick favored a long tracking shot, with the camera close to the actors with a 25mm wide-angle lens to provide slight distortion of the image, but Ballard moved it further away and began using a 50mm lens. Kubrick sternly ordered him to put the camera back or he would be fired.

==Reception==
===Theatrical run===
Without a proper release across the U.S., &quot;The Killing&quot; performed poorly at the box office. In spite of a last-minute promotion as a second feature to &quot;Bandido!&quot;, it failed to turn a profit. But it garnered critical acclaim, landing on several critics&#x27; top-ten lists for 1956. &quot;Time&quot; wrongly predicted that it would &quot;make a killing at the cash booths&quot;—asserting that Kubrick &quot;has shown more audacity with dialogue and camera than Hollywood has seen since the obstreperous Orson Welles went riding out of town on an exhibitors&#x27; poll&quot;—as the film recorded a loss of $130,000.

===Critical response===

&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic A. H. Weiler wrote, &quot;Though &quot;The Killing&quot; is composed of familiar ingredients and it calls for fuller explanations, it evolves as a fairly diverting melodrama. ... Aficionados of the sport of kings will discover that Mr. Kubrick&#x27;s cameras have captured some colorful shots of the ponies at Bay Meadows track. Other observers should find &quot;The Killing&quot; an engrossing little adventure.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; liked the acting and wrote, &quot;This story of a $2 million race track holdup and steps leading up to the robbery, occasionally told in a documentary style which at first tends to be somewhat confusing, soon settles into a tense and suspenseful vein which carries through to an unexpected and ironic windup ... Hayden socks over a restrained characterization, and Cook is a particular standout. Windsor is particularly good, as she digs the plan out of her husband and reveals it to her boyfriend.&quot;

Kubrick and Harris thought the positive critical reception had made their presence known in Hollywood, but Max Youngstein of United Artists still considered them &quot;not far from the bottom&quot; of the pool of new talent at the time. Dore Schary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was impressed with the film, and offered the duo $75,000 to write, direct and produce another, which became &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;.

&quot;The Killing&quot; has gained a cult following, among other Kubrick films. For example, Eddie Muller placed the film 15th among his top 25 favorite &quot;noir&quot; films, saying, &quot;If you believe that a good script is a succession of great scenes, you can&#x27;t do better than this. Hey, that scene was so good, let&#x27;s do it again from somebody else&#x27;s perspective&quot;.

In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

In 1999, film critic Mike Emery wrote, &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s camerawork was well on the way to finding the fluid style of his later work, and the sparse, low-budget circumstances give the film a raw, urgent sort of look. As good as the story and direction are, though, the true strength of &quot;The Killing&quot; lies in the characters and characterizations.&quot; The same year, director Peter Bogdanovich wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that while &quot;The Killing&quot; did not make money, it, along with &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, established &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s reputation as a budding genius among critics and studio executives.&quot;

In 2012, Roger Ebert added &quot;The Killing&quot; to his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot;. In his opening remarks, Ebert writes, &quot;Stanley Kubrick considered &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956) to be his first mature feature, after a couple of short warm-ups. He was 28 when it was released, having already been an obsessed chess player, a photographer for &quot;Look&quot; magazine and a director of &quot;March of Time&quot; newsreels. It&#x27;s tempting to search here for themes and a style he would return to in his later masterpieces, but few directors seemed so determined to make every one of his films an individual, free-standing work. Seeing it without his credit, would you guess it was by Kubrick? Would you connect &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; with &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;?&quot;

===Awards===

Nominations
* BAFTA Film Award, Best Film from any Source, USA; 1957.

===Influence===
Quentin Tarantino has said that this film was an influence on &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, that he thought of that film as &quot;my &quot;Killing&quot;, my take on that kind of heist movie.&quot;

==Home media==
A digitally restored version of &quot;The Killing&quot; was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection, which also included &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; as a bonus feature. On July 26, 2022, Kino Lorber (under the KL Studio Classics line) released a Ultra HD Blu-ray edition of the film from a new remaster of the original negative with new audio commentary by film historian Alan K. Rode.

<doc id="282968" wikidata="Q2502186" url="?curid=282968" title="Stephen Decatur Sr.">
<text>Stephen Decatur Sr. (June 1751 – November 11, 1808) was a United States Navy officer and privateer who served in the American Revolutionary War and the Quasi-War. He was commissioned as a captain in the United States Navy, and was the father of Stephen Decatur.

== Life ==
Born in Newport, Rhode Island, Decatur was a merchant captain before the Revolution. He married Ann Pine; in addition to Stephen Jr., they had two other children: Lieutenant James Decatur, who was killed in action in 1804 during the Barbary Wars, and Ann Decatur McKnight.

During the American Revolution he commanded the &quot;Royal Louis&quot; and the &quot;Fair American&quot;.

With the outbreak of the Quasi War with France, Decatur was commissioned as a captain in the United States Navy on May 11, 1798.

On May 5, 1798, Decatur was placed in command of the converted merchant ship and sailed in the first American Navy squadron to cross the Atlantic along with his son Stephen Decatur Jr. &quot;Delaware&quot; captured a French privateer, &quot;La Croyable&quot;, off Great Egg Harbor, N.J., on 7 July 1798. The U.S. Navy purchased &quot;La Croyable&quot; on 30 July 1798, and renamed her . From 14 July to 23 September, &quot;Delaware&quot; cruised in the West Indies, often in company with the frigate , and together the ships took two privateers prize. During her second cruise in the West Indies, between 15 December 1798 and 20 May 1799, she took another prize.

On October 12, 1799, he was inducted as a Mason in St. John&#x27;s Lodge #1 in Newport, Rhode Island.

In 1800, Decatur commissioned &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, the very vessel that his son later burned several months after it ran aground and was captured near Tripoli harbor in 1803.

In accordance with the Peace Establishment Act of 1801, which greatly reduced the United States Army and Navy, Decatur was discharged from the Navy on October 22, 1801.

He died in 1808, at his country home &quot;Millsdale&quot; in Frankford, Pennsylvania. He is interred next to his famous son at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia.

<doc id="282970" wikidata="Q365496" url="?curid=282970" title="Joey Smallwood">
<text>Joseph Roberts Smallwood (December 24, 1900 – December 17, 1991) was a Newfoundlander and Canadian politician. He was the main force who brought the Dominion of Newfoundland into Canadian Confederation in 1949, becoming the first premier of Newfoundland, serving until 1972. As premier, he vigorously promoted economic development, championed the welfare state, and emphasized modernization of education and transportation. The results of his efforts to promote industrialization were mixed, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining and paper mills.

Smallwood was charismatic and controversial. While many Canadians today remember Smallwood as the man who brought Newfoundland into Canada, the opinions held by Newfoundlanders and their diaspora remain sharply divided as to his legacy.

==Early life==
Smallwood was born at Mint Brook, near Gambo, Newfoundland, to Charles and Minnie May Smallwood. His grandfather, David Smallwood, was a well-known maker of boots in St. John&#x27;s. Growing up in St. John&#x27;s, as a teenager he worked as an apprentice at a newspaper and moved to New York City in 1920. In New York, he worked for the socialist newspaper &quot;The Call&quot;. Smallwood returned to Newfoundland in 1925, where he soon met and married Clara Oates (23 October 1901 – 14 April 1996). In 1925, he founded a newspaper in Corner Brook.

In 1928, he acted as district campaign manager for Sir Richard Squires, Prime Minister of Newfoundland]. He also ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in Bonavista in 1932.

During the Great Depression, Smallwood worked for various newspapers and edited a two-volume collection titled &quot;The Book of Newfoundland&quot;. He also hosted a radio program, &quot;The Barrelman&quot;, beginning in 1937, that promoted pride in Newfoundland&#x27;s history and culture. He was very successful in this job with a voice for radio that was easily recognizable throughout all of Newfoundland.

He left the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland in 1943 to operate a pig farm at the Newfoundland Airport at Gander.

==National Convention and Confederation==
As soon as prosperity returned in 1942, action began to end the Commission of Government. Newfoundland, with a population of 313,000 (plus 5,200 in Labrador), seemed too small to be independent.

At this point, Smallwood was a well-known radio personality, writer and organizer; he was a nationalist who had long criticized British rule. In 1945, London announced that a National Convention would be elected in Newfoundland to advise on what constitutional choices should to be voted on by referendum. Union with the United States was a possibility, but London rejected that option and instead offered two options: a return to dominion status or continuation of the unpopular Commission. Canada issued an invitation to join on generous financial terms.

In 1946, Smallwood was elected as a delegate to the Newfoundland National Convention, which was organized to make recommendations to London about the future of Newfoundland that would be placed before the people of the country in a constitutional referendum. Smallwood supported joining Canada, arguing that union with Canada would bring prosperity. His skills as a radio broadcaster served him well. He was able to use the proceedings of the Convention, which were broadcast over the radio, to publicise the benefits of union with Canada. He founded and led the Confederate Association that supported the Confederation option in the Convention during the 1948 Newfoundland referendums.

At the convention Smallwood emerged as the leading proponent of confederation with Canada, insisting, &quot;Today we are more disposed to feel that our very manhood, our very creation by God, entitles us to standards of life no lower than our brothers on the mainland.&quot; He succeeded in putting the Canada option on the ballot. His main opponents were Peter Cashin and Chesley Crosbie. Cashin, a former finance minister, led the Responsible Government League, warning against cheap Canadian imports and the high Canadian income tax. Crosbie, a leader of the fishing industry, led the Economic Union Party, seeking responsible government first, to be followed by closer ties with the United States, which could be a major source of capital.

Smallwood carried his cause in a hard-fought referendum and a runoff in June and July 1948 as the decision to join Canada (rather than restoration of independent dominion status) carried 77,869, against 71,464, or 52.3%. A strong rural vote in favour of Canada overwhelmed the pro-independence vote in the capital of St. John&#x27;s. Catholics (mostly of Irish descent) in the city desired independence to protect their parochial schools, leading to a Protestant backlash in rural areas. The promise of cash family allowances from Canada proved decisive.

Smallwood was a member of the 1947 Ottawa Delegation that negotiated the Terms of Union with Canada. He created another newspaper, &quot;The Confederate&quot;, to promote Confederation. The 1948 referendums resulted in Confederation being approved, and in 1949, as leader of the Liberal Party, Smallwood was elected premier of the new province.

==Premiership==

Smallwood ran Newfoundland virtually unchallenged for 23 years. He governed with large majorities for virtually his entire tenure. During his first six terms, he never faced more than eight opposition MHAs.

He vigorously promoted economic development through the Economic Development Plan of 1951, championed the welfare state (paid for by Ottawa), and attracted favourable attention across Canada. He emphasised modernisation of education and transportation to attract outsiders, such as German industrialists, because the local economic elite would not invest in industrial development. Although he had had socialist leanings in his youth, he often sided with bankers and became hostile to the militant unions that sponsored numerous strikes. He relied heavily on the expertise of German industry in his repeated attempts to industrialise Newfoundland in the post-Confederation period. His efforts to promote industrialisation were a mixed bag, with the most favourable results in hydroelectricity, iron mining, and paper mills. Part of Smallwood’s industrialization legacy is the 1969 agreement locking Newfoundland into selling electricity from the power dam at Labrador’s Churchill Falls to Quebec until the year 2041—at a fixed rate that is now roughly one-tenth of the market price.

Smallwood was willing to side with corporations in his drive to industrialise the province. He granted foreign companies concessions to encourage development and even intervened in a labour dispute in 1959. The International Woodworkers of America had struck to get higher wages and better working conditions in the logging camps. In a controversial move, Smallwood decertified and effectively made the union illegal, replacing it with a government-sponsored union.

During his long career as Premier, Smallwood was often accused of being autocratic and self-aggrandising. He brought libel suits against &quot;The Telegram&quot; and he would threaten to pull government advertising over stories. He kept a tight rein on his ministers, regarding them as extensions of his own authority rather than as colleagues. Additionally, the House of Assembly did not have a question period, unlike most other provincial legislatures.

Smallwood announced his retirement in 1969, only to change his mind and run for the leadership against John Crosbie. In the ensuing contest, Smallwood sent Cabinet ministers to delegate selection meetings with notebooks, detailing who voted for which slate of delegates. They brought Crosbie delegates to his residence, forcing them to sign affidavits supporting Smallwood&#x27;s leadership. The affidavits would later be published in local newspapers.

By Newfoundland&#x27;s seventh general election in 1971, Smallwood&#x27;s government had become tired and complacent. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with Smallwood&#x27;s Liberals winning 20 seats to the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; 21. The Labrador Party&#x27;s lone MHA, Tom Burgess, threw his support to Smallwood, resulting in a three-month deadlock. However, under the threat of a revolt in his own caucus, Smallwood was forced to resign in January 1972 in favour of the PCs&#x27; Frank Moores. Smallwood was voted out as Liberal leader soon afterward. In 1975, he took most of his followers into the Newfoundland Reform Liberal Party, which elected four candidates in that year&#x27;s election. He retired for good at the end of the term.

==Life after politics==

In his retirement, Smallwood resumed writing. His autobiography entitled &quot;I Chose Canada&quot; was published by Macmillan, A sequel, I Chose Canada: The Memoirs of the Honourable Joseph R. &quot;Joey&quot; Smallwood: Volume II The Premiership, was published by Signet in 1975. 

He began an ambitious project compiling a comprehensive &quot;Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;. The five volume set was completed by a charitable foundation after Smallwood&#x27;s death. Smallwood&#x27;s publishing firm, Newfoundland Book Publishers (1967) Ltd., published Volumes 1 and 2; the Smallwood Heritage Foundation completed and published Volumes 3, 4, and 5.

In 1986, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, after hesitating because he felt that he should be more honoured for bringing Newfoundland and Labrador into Canada and he would have liked to have had The Right Honourable added to his name as well as a knighthood.

In 1989, a new Marine Atlantic ferry, , was placed in service; she was paid off in 2011.

==Death==
On December 17, 1991, a week before his 91st birthday, Smallwood died. He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. His wife Clara, who died in 1996, is buried beside him.

==Notable quotes==
&quot;I don&#x27;t need you. I&#x27;ve been elected. But you need me. I&#x27;m sitting on top of the public chest, and not one red cent will come out of it for Ferryland unless Greg Power is elected [to Ottawa]. Unless you vote for my man, you&#x27;ll be out in the cold for the next five years ... Those settlements which vote against Greg Power will get nothing – absolutely nothing.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Smallwood was featured in two National Film Board of Canada documentaries: In 1970, he was the subject of Julian Biggs&#x27;s documentary film &quot;A Little Fellow from Gambo&quot;, for which he unusually received a Canadian Film Award for Best Actor in a Non-Feature at the 22nd Canadian Film Awards.

In 1974, he was featured alongside Newfoundland media mogul Geoff Stirling and director Michael Rubbo in Rubbo&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Fidel&quot;. In 1998, Wayne Johnston&#x27;s novel &quot;The Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot; presented a fictionalized portrayal of Smallwood.

CJON-DT, Geoff Stirling&#x27;s television station, conducted several interviews with Smallwood, particularly during the years after he left politics; many of these were extended dialogues with Stirling on various esoteric topics. Many of Smallwood&#x27;s interviews, as well as numerous solo films and speeches he made, are rebroadcast during the &quot;Captain Atlantis&quot; block of freeform telecasts that CJON carries very early on Saturday mornings.

<doc id="282973" wikidata="Q289643" url="?curid=282973" title="AC Propulsion tzero">
<text>The tZero (a mathematical symbol meaning, &#x27;time from a standing start in sequence&#x27;) is a hand-built electric sports car designed and built in very limited numbers by the U.S. pioneering company AC Propulsion in the mid 1990&#x27;s. It was the inspiration and direct predecessor of the Tesla line of electric cars. The only part of the tZero that was not proprietary was the body that was based on the Piontek Sportech sports car, yet many parts of the body and interior were extensively modified. It consists of a Kevlar &amp; Carbon Fiber reinforced body built over a custom hand-built reinforced stainless steel fabricated to package batteries space frame with double wishbone independent suspension and rack and pinion steering. AC Propulsion utilized their AC-150 drivetrain, a single-speed electric system with an overall gear ratio of 9:1.

Experimental mule in early 90&#x27;s, a complete vehicle the following year and launched in January 1996, only 3 prototypes were built, the last one also being an official VIN production car. Prospect interested buyers included many big celebrities, well known scientists, and silicon valley engineers. Unfortunately, plans for a viable commercial production were eventually dropped in mid-2003. The name comes from &quot;t&quot;0, the mathematical symbol for a starting point in time. Due to high production costs, AC Propulsion ceased to produce the tzero. Only three were built, and as of 2024 only 2 survive. The only remaining examples are owned by the company itself and a private owner. The last tZero vehicle built used an advanced/updated ACP Gen 2 system that was capable of V2G (vehicle-to-grid &amp; vehicle-to-vehicle charging system). The tZero vehicles were extensively tested. Even including a cross country USA trip. 

Adjustable Regenerative Braking: Because the car recharges its batteries when the throttle is released slowing sharply as energy is recaptured It can be driven hard using only the accelerator pedal. Also, if the car detects a turn with more than half a &quot;g&quot;-force (5 m/s²), it eases the rear-wheel regenerative braking to prevent slides.

==Original lead–acid battery powered tzero==

The original version of the tZero roadster ran on 28 Johnson Controls Optima Yellow Top spiral wound AGM deep cycle lead–acid batteries in series, which produced 150 &amp; 165 kW (220 horsepower) and 177 lbs·ft (240 N·m) of torque at 336 volts and accelerated the car from a standstill to in 4.07 seconds. The single gear ratio limited the car&#x27;s maximum speed to at 12,000 rpm, although it is said that early prototypes fitted with multiple gear ratios could hit . Even with the single ratio, lead–acid models are capable of completing a quarter mile (400 m) drag race in 13.24 seconds. The expected range per charge of the tzero with the lead–acid batteries is as a result of consuming only 180 watt hours (DC) per mile (112 Wh/km) on the highway and due to regenerative braking. The car could be charged from 0 to 95% within an hour. The initial base price of this version was to have been US$90,000. but later exceeded to $150K 

==Lithium-ion battery conversion==

Tom Gage was contacted by Martin Eberhard about the tZero car which Gage had built, and was currently converting to lithium batteries, similar to those that make up the battery packs of laptop computers. Gage stated that Eberhard had multiple &quot;Schemes&quot; and that he had to explain to Eberhard how unfeasible most of his concepts were. The conversion was done over six months from March through September, 2003 and gave the tZero a range. Lighter than the original version by , the lithium-ion conversion goes from in 3.6 seconds. The single gear ratio limits the car&#x27;s maximum speed to just over at 13,000 rpm with proper gearing, though it has never been tested at greater than the electronic limit of . The base price of the car was US$220,000. Elon Musk and Martin Eberhard encouraged Tom Gage and Alan Cocconi to move the lithium-ion powered prototype into production. Eberhard then borrowed the converted tZero for three months and used it as a daily driver. The 2003 Li-on tZero version achieved over 320 miles range per charge.

JB Straubel then told Elon Musk about the newly converted, now lithium-ion powered tZero and arranged a test drive. Musk also encouraged AC Propulsion to commercialize the vehicle. Tom Gage, however, again deferred in favor of working on their electrified Scion xB called the eBox. But he put Elon Musk in contact with Martin Eberhard which led to Elon Musk&#x27;s Series A funding of Tesla Motors in April, 2004 and their hiring JB Straubel.

==Long Ranger genset trailer==

AC PROPULSION also built a range extender for the tZero. Known as the Long Ranger this was a portable internal combustion powered generator mounted on a trailer that could be towed behind the car and feed power to the batteries during travel. A tZero with Long Ranger was a series hybrid. The trailer used a Kawasaki engine with a fuel tank and achieved in highway driving over at least . It was rated at DC output and could maintain . The trailer incorporated a novel &quot;backtracking&quot; feature that automatically steered the trailer wheels allowing even novice drivers to easily back a trailer through complex maneuvers; the company published a video demonstrating the ease with which the trailer could be backed through a set of slalom cones.

==Production==
, only 2 of the 3 &quot;tzero&quot; production models remain, since Gruber Motor Company&#x27;s car was destroyed in a building fire in May 2017. The surviving two models are currently on display at The Petersen Museum.

<text>Parcheesi is a brand-name American adaptation of the Indian cross and circle board game Pachisi, published by E. G. Selchow &amp; Co and Winning Moves Games USA.

==Equipment==
&quot;Parcheesi&quot; is typically played with two dice, four pieces per player and a with a track around the outside, four corner spaces and four &quot;home paths&quot; leading to a central end space. The most popular &quot;Parcheesi&quot; boards in America have 68 spaces around the edge of the board, 12 of which are darkened &quot;safe spaces&quot;. Each corner of the board contains one player&#x27;s &quot;nest&quot;, or .

==Setup==
* Each player positions their four single colored pieces in their respective starting nest.
* Each player rolls a single die to determine player order. The player with the lowest roll goes first.
* The order of players&#x27; turns moves to the next player on the current player&#x27;s left.
* Pieces move from the nest to the colored starting space to the left of the nest, per rules in the following section.

==Rules==

===Gameplay===
A player rolls the dice and must use the topmost facing die pip values shown to move their pieces around the board in one of the following ways:
* Only pieces not in the nest may move forward on the board.
* Pieces may only leave the nest with a roll of a five on a single die or the sum of the dice. A double five can be used to move two pieces from the nest simultaneously.
* In the case of a non-doubles roll, a player may move one or two pieces, either one piece by each of the numbers on the two dice or one piece by the total. If no move is possible, the turn is forfeited. 
* When moving a single piece the total of two dice the turn is taken in increments, allowing pieces to be captured along the way. For example, if a double two is rolled and an opponent&#x27;s piece lies on a cream space two spaces in front of the piece you wish to move the full four, you would move the piece two, and then two again, allowing the opponent&#x27;s piece to be captured.
* All die rolls must be taken and may not be voluntarily forfeited by a player.
* If a player cannot use both dice, the player must use one of the dice, if possible. If either can be used, the player must use the larger die.
* All die moves must be taken before the application of any extra rewards for sending an opponent to their nest or moving a piece to its home position.
* With a roll of doubles, the player makes four moves, one for each of the numbers on top of the two dice and one for each of the numbers on the bottoms. The player may distribute these four moves among one, two, three, or four pieces. Note that the sum of numbers on the opposite sides of a die is always seven, so with doubles, there are a total of fourteen spaces to move. This can only be done if all four pieces are out of the nest.
* When the player rolls doubles, the player rolls again after moving, provided all of the doubles roll was used. If the player is unable to use all of the roll, the player doesn&#x27;t get another roll.
* When a piece ends its move on the same space as an opponent&#x27;s piece, the opponent&#x27;s piece is sent back to its nest.
* A piece may not be placed on a safe space (generally colored light blue) if it is occupied by an opponent&#x27;s piece. The exception is the safe space used when a piece leaves its nest — a single piece occupying such a safe space is sent back to its nest when an opponent&#x27;s piece leaves the nest and occupies the space.
* A blockade is formed when two pieces of a single player occupy the same space. No piece of any player may move through a blockade, including pieces of the blockade owner. Blockade pieces may not be moved forward together with the roll of a double. Another player may break the blockade with the roll of a double one. Another player&#x27;s piece cannot land in a space occupied by a blockade, even to leave its nest. Local rules may limit the number of turns that a blockade can stay in place.
* A piece is not required to enter the home row and can pass the row and start another circuit of the board voluntarily or as the result of requirement of the use of the total die roll.
* A turn ends when the next player rolls the dice with the consent of the current player. Any rewards not taken are lost.

===Rewards of extra moves===
* The reward for sending an opponent&#x27;s piece to the nest is a free move of twenty spaces that may not be split between pieces.
* The reward for landing a piece in the home space is a free move of ten spaces that may not be split between pieces.

===Winning the game===
* Moving all four pieces to the home position wins the game.
* Pieces may only be moved to the home position with an exact application of the total roll, the value on a single die, or the complete application of a reward.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Parcheesi&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as a &quot;classic chase game from India that has withstood the test of millennia&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Parcheesi&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, describing it as &quot;one of the easiest board games to learn and is perfectly suited for family play&quot;.

<text>An optical prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that are designed to refract light. At least one surface must be angled — elements with two parallel surfaces are &quot;not&quot; prisms. The most familiar type of optical prism is the triangular prism, which has a triangular base and rectangular sides. Not all optical prisms are geometric prisms, and not all geometric prisms would count as an optical prism. Prisms can be made from any material that is transparent to the wavelengths for which they are designed. Typical materials include glass, acrylic and fluorite.

A dispersive prism can be used to break white light up into its constituent spectral colors (the colors of the rainbow) to form a spectrum as described in the following section. Other types of prisms noted below can be used to reflect light, or to split light into components with different polarizations.

==Types==
===Dispersive===
&quot;Dispersive prisms&quot; are used to break up light into its constituent spectral colors because the refractive index depends on wavelength; the white light entering the prism is a mixture of different wavelengths, each of which gets bent slightly differently. Blue light is slowed more than red light and will therefore be bent more than red light.

*Triangular prism
*Amici prism and other types of compound prisms
*Littrow prism with mirror on its rear facet 
*Pellin–Broca prism
*Abbe prism 
*Grism, a dispersive prism with a diffraction grating on its surface
*Féry prism

Spectral dispersion is the best known property of optical prisms, although not the most frequent purpose of using optical prisms in practice.

===Reflective===
&quot;Reflective prisms&quot; are used to reflect light, in order to flip, invert, rotate, deviate or displace the light beam. They are typically used to erect the image in binoculars or single-lens reflex cameras – without the prisms the image would be upside down for the user.

Reflective prisms use total internal reflection to achieve near-perfect reflection of light that strikes the facets at a sufficiently oblique angle. Prisms are usually made of optical glass which, combined with anti-reflective coating of input and output facets, leads to significantly lower light loss than metallic mirrors.

*Odd number of reflections, image projects as flipped (mirrored)
**triangular prism reflector, projects image sideways (chromatic dispersion is zero in case of perpendicular input and output incidence)
**Roof pentaprism projects image sideways flipped along the other axis
**Dove prism projects image forward
**Corner-cube retroreflector projects image backwards
*Even number of reflections, image projects upright (without change in handedness; may or may not be rotated)
**Porro prism projects image backwards and displaced
**Porro–Abbe prism projects image forward, rotated by 180° and displaced
**Perger prism a development based on the Porro–Abbe prism, projects image forward, rotated by 180° and displaced
**Abbe–Koenig prism projects image forward, rotated by 180° and collinear (4 internal reflections [2 reflections are on roof plains])
**Bauernfeind prism projects image sideways (inclined by 45°)
**Amici roof prism projects image sideways
**Pentaprism projects image sideways
**Schmidt–Pechan prism projects image forward, rotated by 180° (6 reflections [2 reflections are on roof plains]; composed of Bauernfeind part and Schmidt part)
**Uppendahl prism projects image forward, rotated by 180° and collinear (6 reflections [2 reflections are on roof plains]); composed of 3 prisms cemented together)

=== Beam-splitting ===

Various thin-film optical layers can be deposited on the hypotenuse of one right-angled prism, and cemented to another prism to form a beam-splitter cube. 
Overall optical performance of such a cube is determined by the thin layer.

In comparison with a usual glass substrate, the glass cube provides protection of the thin-film layer from both sides and better mechanical stability. The cube can also eliminate etalon effects, back-side reflection and slight beam deflection.

*dichroic color filters form a dichroic prism
*Polarizing cube beamsplitters have lower extinction ratio than birefringent ones, but less expensive
*Partially-metallized mirrors provide non-polarizing beamsplitters
*Air gap − When hypotenuses of two triangular prisms are stacked very close to each other with air gap, frustrated total internal reflection in one prism makes it possible to couple part of the radiation into a propagating wave in the second prism. The transmitted power drops exponentially with the gap width, so it can be tuned over many orders of magnitude by a micrometric screw.
* Biprism (or Fresnel biprism): two prisms joined at their bases, forming a wide vertex angle (~ 180°); used in common-path interferometry.

===Polarizing===
Another class is formed by &quot;polarizing prisms&quot; which use birefringence to split a beam of light into components of varying polarization. In the visible and UV regions, they have very low losses and their extinction ratio typically exceeds formula_1, which is superior to other types of polarizers. They may or may not employ total internal reflection;

*One polarization is separated by total internal reflection:
**Nicol prism
**Glan–Foucault prism
**Glan–Taylor prism, a high-power variant of which is also denoted as Glan–laser prism
**Glan–Thompson prism
* One polarization is deviated by different refraction only: 
**Rochon prism
**Sénarmont prism
* Both polarizations are deviated by refraction: 
**Wollaston prism
**Nomarski prism – a variant of the Wollaston prism where &quot;p-&quot; and &quot;s-&quot;components emerge displaced and converging towards each other; important for differential interference contrast microscopy
* Both polarizations stay parallel, but are spatially separated: 
**polarisation beam displacers, typically made of thick anisotropic crystal with plan-parallel facets

These are typically made of a birefringent crystalline material like calcite, but other materials like quartz and α-BBO may be necessary for UV applications, and others (,  and ) will extend transmission farther into the infrared spectral range.

Prisms made of isotropic materials like glass will also alter polarization of light, as partial reflection under oblique angles does not maintain the amplitude ratio (nor phase) of the s- and p-polarized components of the light, leading to general elliptical polarization. This is generally an unwanted effect of dispersive prisms. In some cases this can be avoided by choosing prism geometry which light enters and exits under perpendicular angle, by compensation through non-planar light trajectory, or by use of p-polarized light.

Total internal reflection alters only the mutual phase between s- and p-polarized light. Under well chosen angle of incidence, this phase is close to formula_2. 
*Fresnel rhomb uses this effect to achieve conversion between circular and linear polarisation. This phase difference is not explicitly dependent on wavelength, but only on refractive index, so Fresnel rhombs made of low-dispersion glasses achieve much broader spectral range than quarter-wave plates. They displace the beam, however. 
*Doubled Fresnel rhomb, with quadruple reflection and zero beam displacement, substitutes a half-wave plate.
*Similar effect can also be used to make a polarization-maintaining optics.

==== Depolarizers ====
Birefringent crystals can be assembled in a way that leads to apparent depolarization of the light.
* Cornu depolarizer
* Lyot depolarizer
Depolarization would not be observed for an ideal monochromatic plane wave, as actually both devices turn reduced temporal coherence or spatial coherence, respectively, of the beam into decoherence of its polarization components.

== Other uses ==
Total internal reflection in prisms finds numerous uses through optics, plasmonics and microscopy. In particular:
*Prisms are used to couple propagating light to surface plasmons. Either the hypotenuse of a triangular prism is metallized (Kretschmann configuration), or evanescent wave is coupled to very close metallic surface (Otto configuration).
*Some laser active media can be formed as a prism where the low-quality pump beam enters the front facet, while the amplified beam undergoes total internal reflection under grazing incidence from it. Such a design suffers less from thermal stress and is easy to be pumped by high-power laser diodes.
Other uses of prisms are based on their beam-deviating refraction:
*Wedge prisms are used to deflect a beam of monochromatic light by a fixed angle. A pair of such prisms can be used for beam steering; by rotating the prisms the beam can be deflected into any desired angle within a conical &quot;field of regard&quot;. The most commonly found implementation is a Risley prism pair. 
*Transparent windows of, e.g., vacuum chambers or cuvettes can also be slightly wedged (10&#x27; − 1°). While this does not reduce reflection, it suppresses Fabry-Pérot interferences that would otherwise modulate their transmission spectrum.
*&quot;Anamorphic pair&quot; of similar, but asymmetrically placed prisms can also change the profile of a beam. This is often used to make a round beam from the elliptical output of a laser diode. With its monochromatic light, slight chromatic dispersion arising from different wedge inclination is not a problem. 
*Deck prisms were used on sailing ships to bring daylight below deck, since candles and kerosene lamps are a fire hazard on wooden ships.

==In optometry==

By shifting corrective lenses off axis, images seen through them can be displaced in the same way that a prism displaces images. Eye care professionals use prisms, as well as lenses off axis, to treat various orthoptics problems:

*Diplopia (double vision)
*Positive and negative fusion problems

Prism spectacles with a single prism perform a relative displacement of the two eyes, thereby correcting eso-, exo, hyper- or hypotropia.

In contrast, spectacles with prisms of equal power for both eyes, called yoked prisms (also: &quot;conjugate prisms&quot;, &quot;ambient lenses&quot; or &quot;performance glasses&quot;) shift the visual field of both eyes to the same extent.

<text>In geometry, a prism is a polyhedron comprising an polygon base, a second base which is a translated copy (rigidly moved without rotation) of the first, and other faces, necessarily all parallelograms, joining corresponding sides of the two bases. All cross-sections parallel to the bases are translations of the bases. Prisms are named after their bases, e.g. a prism with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism. Prisms are a subclass of prismatoids.

Like many basic geometric terms, the word &quot;prism&quot; () was first used in Euclid&#x27;s Elements. Euclid defined the term in Book XI as “a solid figure contained by two opposite, equal and parallel planes, while the rest are parallelograms”. However, this definition has been criticized for not being specific enough in regard to the nature of the bases (a cause of some confusion amongst generations of later geometry writers).

== Oblique vs right ==
An oblique prism is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are not perpendicular to the base faces.

Example: a parallelepiped is an oblique prism whose base is a parallelogram, or equivalently a polyhedron with six parallelogram faces.
A &quot;right&quot; prism is a prism in which the joining edges and faces are &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the base faces. This applies if and only if all the joining faces are &quot;rectangular&quot;.

The dual of a &quot;right&quot; -prism is a &quot;right&quot; -bipyramid.

A right prism (with rectangular sides) with regular -gon bases has Schläfli symbol It approaches a cylinder as approaches infinity.

=== Special cases ===
*A right rectangular prism (with a rectangular base) is also called a &quot;cuboid&quot;, or informally a &quot;rectangular box&quot;. A right rectangular prism has Schläfli symbol 
*A right square prism (with a square base) is also called a &quot;square cuboid&quot;, or informally a &quot;square box&quot;.

Note: some texts may apply the term &quot;rectangular prism&quot; or &quot;square prism&quot; to both a right rectangular-based prism and a right square-based prism.

== Types ==

=== Regular prism ===
A regular prism is a prism with regular bases.

=== Uniform prism ===
A uniform prism or semiregular prism is a right prism with regular bases and all edges of the same length.

Thus all the side faces of a uniform prism are squares.

Thus all the faces of a uniform prism are regular polygons. Also, such prisms are isogonal; thus they are uniform polyhedra. They form one of the two infinite series of semiregular polyhedra, the other series being formed by the antiprisms.

A uniform -gonal prism has Schläfli symbol 

== Properties ==

=== Volume ===
The volume of a prism is the product of the area of the base by the height, i.e. the distance between the two base faces (in the case of a non-right prism, note that this means the perpendicular distance).

The volume is therefore:
:formula_1

where is the base area and is the height.

The volume of a prism whose base is an -sided regular polygon with side length is therefore:
formula_2

=== Surface area ===
The surface area of a right prism is:
:formula_3
where is the area of the base, the height, and the base perimeter.

The surface area of a right prism whose base is a regular -sided polygon with side length , and with height , is therefore:

:formula_4

=== Symmetry ===
The symmetry group of a right -sided prism with regular base is of order , except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group of order 48, which has three versions of as subgroups. The rotation group is of order , except in the case of a cube, which has the larger symmetry group of order 24, which has three versions of as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains inversion iff is even.

The hosohedra and dihedra also possess dihedral symmetry, and an -gonal prism can be constructed via the geometrical truncation of an -gonal hosohedron, as well as through the cantellation or expansion of an -gonal dihedron.

=== Schlegel diagrams ===
== Similar polytopes ==

=== Truncated prism ===

A truncated prism is formed when prism is sliced by a plane that is not parallel to its bases. A truncated prism&#x27;s bases are not congruent, and its sides are not parallelograms.

=== Twisted prism ===
A twisted prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed from a uniform -prism with each side face bisected on the square diagonal, by twisting the top, usually by radians ( degrees) in the same direction, causing sides to be concave.

A twisted prism cannot be dissected into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. The simplest twisted prism has triangle bases and is called a Schönhardt polyhedron.

An -gonal &quot;twisted prism&quot; is topologically identical to the -gonal uniform antiprism, but has half the symmetry group: , order . It can be seen as a nonconvex antiprism, with tetrahedra removed between pairs of triangles.

=== Frustum ===
A frustum is a similar construction to a prism, with trapezoid lateral faces and differently sized top and bottom polygons.

=== Star prism ===

A star prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed by two identical star polygon faces on the top and bottom, being parallel and offset by a distance and connected by rectangular faces. A &quot;uniform star prism&quot; will have Schläfli symbol with rectangles and 2 faces. It is topologically identical to a -gonal prism.

=== Crossed prism ===
A crossed prism is a nonconvex polyhedron constructed from a prism, where the vertices of one base are inverted around the center of this base (or rotated by 180°). This transforms the side rectangular faces into crossed rectangles. For a regular polygon base, the appearance is an -gonal hour glass. All oblique edges pass through a single body center. Note: no vertex is at this body centre. A crossed prism is topologically identical to an -gonal prism.

=== Toroidal prism ===
A toroidal prism is a nonconvex polyhedron like a &quot;crossed prism&quot;, but without bottom and top base faces, and with simple rectangular side faces closing the polyhedron. This can only be done for even-sided base polygons. These are topological tori, with Euler characteristic of zero. The topological polyhedral net can be cut from two rows of a square tiling (with vertex configuration ): a band of squares, each attached to a crossed rectangle. An -gonal toroidal prism has vertices, faces: squares and crossed rectangles, and edges. It is topologically self-dual.

=== Prismatic polytope ===
A &quot;prismatic polytope&quot; is a higher-dimensional generalization of a prism. An -dimensional prismatic polytope is constructed from two ()-dimensional polytopes, translated into the next dimension.

The prismatic -polytope elements are doubled from the ()-polytope elements and then creating new elements from the next lower element.

Take an -polytope with -face elements (). Its ()-polytope prism will have -face elements. (With , .)

By dimension:
*Take a polygon with vertices, edges. Its prism has vertices, edges, and faces.
*Take a polyhedron with vertices, edges, and faces. Its prism has vertices, edges, faces, and cells.
*Take a polychoron with vertices, edges, faces, and cells. Its prism has vertices, edges, faces, cells, and hypercells.

=== Uniform prismatic polytope ===
A regular -polytope represented by Schläfli symbol can form a uniform prismatic ()-polytope represented by a Cartesian product of two Schläfli symbols: 

By dimension:
*A 0-polytopic prism is a line segment, represented by an empty Schläfli symbol 
*A 1-polytopic prism is a rectangle, made from 2 translated line segments. It is represented as the product Schläfli symbol If it is square, symmetry can be reduced: 
*:Example: , Square, two parallel line segments, connected by two line segment &quot;sides&quot;.
*A polygonal prism is a 3-dimensional prism made from two translated polygons connected by rectangles. A regular polygon can construct a uniform -gonal prism represented by the product If , with square sides symmetry it becomes a cube: 
*:Example: , Pentagonal prism, two parallel pentagons connected by 5 rectangular &quot;sides&quot;.
*A polyhedral prism is a 4-dimensional prism made from two translated polyhedra connected by 3-dimensional prism cells. A regular polyhedron can construct the uniform polychoric prism, represented by the product If the polyhedron and the sides are cubes, it becomes a tesseract: 
*:Example: , Dodecahedral prism, two parallel dodecahedra connected by 12 pentagonal prism &quot;sides&quot;.

Higher order prismatic polytopes also exist as cartesian products of any two or more polytopes. The dimension of a product polytope is the sum of the dimensions of its elements. The first examples of these exist in 4-dimensional space; they are called duoprisms as the product of two polygons in 4-dimensions.

Regular duoprisms are represented as with vertices, edges, square faces, -gon faces, -gon faces, and bounded by -gonal prisms and -gonal prisms.

For example, a &quot;4-4 duoprism&quot; is a lower symmetry form of a tesseract, as is a &quot;cubic prism&quot;. (4-4 duoprism prism), (cube-4 duoprism) and (tesseractic prism) are lower symmetry forms of a 5-cube.

<doc id="283063" wikidata="Q945556" url="?curid=283063" title="Parchís">
<text>Parchís is a Spanish board game of the original from the Cross and Circle family. It is an adaptation of the Indian game Pachisi.
Parchís was a very popular game in Spain at one point as well as in Europe and north Morocco - specifically Tangiers and Tetouan, and it is still popular especially among adults and seniors. Since it uses dice, Parchís is not usually regarded as an abstract strategy game like checkers or chess. It does not depend entirely on luck either, since the four pawns under a player&#x27;s command demand some sort of strategy.

Parchís is license-free in Spain, so in stores it is just as easy to find as a deck of cards, and is usually cheaper. Although the original game allows up to four players (that is, the board counts four colors: yellow, blue, red and green), six-player versions are not hard to find (adding orange and purple, in that order), and eight-player boards can be found in big toy stores.

Traditionally, each player has a &quot;cubilete&quot; (dice cup) to shake and toss the dice. This does not affect the course of the game itself, but most habitual players find it imperative.

On the reverse of the board it is usual to find a board for the Game of the Goose.

The game can now be played on mobile. Certain apps offer real time multiplayer gameplay where you can play with real opponents across the world.

==Rules==

This game is played with one six-sided die and four pawns per player. Dice cups are optional, but most game sets include them. The players compete on leading their four pawns out of their nest, around the whole board, into the color track and up to the center of the board, chasing and &quot;eating&quot; each other in the process.

A roll of five forces the player to release one pawn from the nest (if there are any left), and a roll of six gives the player an extra turn. When the player has four pawns in the game (outside the nest), whenever they get a six, they can move 7 squares. The rule gets cancelled if a pawn reaches the end and gets out of the board.

If ever three 6s are rolled in a row, the last piece moved is killed and returned to the nest. If the last piece moved was in the final colored ramp, it is only moved to the bottom of it. And if the final move is in a secured square it remains there, and the turn is cancelled and passed to the next player.

When a pawn &quot;eats&quot; an opponent&#x27;s pawn (by landing on the same square, if it is not a safe square), it &quot;kills&quot; it, sending it back to the nest, and advances 20 squares. If a player doesn&#x27;t notice a kill and moves another pawn, that pawn gets back to the nest. When a pawn reaches the end, one of the other pawns of the same color can advance ten squares.

When one or two pawns of any other color are in the starting square and the player rolls a five, it eats the opposing pawn or pawns, in case it kills two opposing pawns, player can advance with 40 squares.

Blockades can also be made with two pawns. In some variants, a blockade can be formed in any square, if both pawns belong to the same player—otherwise the last to arrive would kill the first. Pawns cannot jump over blockades, which causes &quot;jams&quot;, making it easy for players to &quot;eat&quot; each other. A player must open a blockade if they toss a six with the dice.

<text>A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that can combine the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation. An LLC is not a corporation under the laws of every state; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs are well known for the flexibility that they provide to business owners; depending on the situation, an LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership, and, under certain circumstances, LLCs may be organized as not-for-profit. In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).

An LLC is a hybrid legal entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC is a type of unincorporated association, distinct from a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. As a business entity, an LLC is often more flexible than a corporation and may be well-suited for companies with a single owner.

Although LLCs and corporations both possess some analogous features, the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity, at least within the United States, is sometimes different. When an LLC is formed, it is said to be &quot;organized&quot;, not &quot;incorporated&quot; or &quot;chartered&quot;, and its founding document is likewise known as its &quot;articles of organization&quot;, instead of its &quot;articles of incorporation&quot; or its &quot;corporate charter&quot;. Internal operations of an LLC are further governed by its &quot;operating agreement&quot;. An owner of an LLC is called a &quot;member&quot;, rather than a &quot;shareholder&quot;. Additionally, ownership in an LLC is represented by a &quot;membership interest&quot; or an &quot;LLC interest&quot; (sometimes measured in &quot;membership units&quot; or just &quot;units&quot; and at other times simply stated only as percentages), rather than represented by &quot;shares of stock&quot; or just &quot;shares&quot; (with ownership measured by the number of shares held by each shareholder). Similarly, when issued in physical rather than electronic form, a document evidencing ownership rights in an LLC is called a &quot;membership certificate&quot; rather than a &quot;stock certificate&quot;.

In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. As long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it is difficult to pierce the LLC veil. Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor&#x27;s share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.

Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.

== History ==
The first state to enact a law authorizing the creation of limited liability companies was Wyoming in 1977. The law was a project of the Hamilton Brothers Oil Company, which sought to organize its business in the United States with liability and tax advantages similar to those it had obtained in Panama.

From 1960 to 1997, the classification of unincorporated business associations for the purpose of U.S. federal income tax law was governed by the &quot;&quot;Kintner&quot; regulations&quot;, which were named after the prevailing taxpayer in the 1954 legal precedent of that name. As promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 1960, the &quot;Kintner&quot; regulations set forth a complex six-factor test for determining whether such business associations would be taxed as corporations or partnerships. Some of these factors had equal significance, so that the presence of only half of them would result in classification as a partnership. Accordingly, the Wyoming Legislature tailored its statute to grant LLCs particular corporate features without exceeding this threshold.

For several years, other states were slow to adopt the LLC form because it was unclear how the IRS and courts would apply the &quot;Kintner&quot; regulations to it. After the IRS finally decided in 1988 in Revenue Ruling 88-76 that Wyoming LLCs were taxable as partnerships, other states began to take the LLC seriously and enacted their own LLC statutes. By 1996, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had LLC statutes. In 1995, the IRS came to the conclusion that the widespread enactment of LLC statutes had undermined the &quot;Kintner&quot; regulations, and in 1996 it promulgated new regulations establishing a so-called &quot;check the box&quot; (CTB) entity classification election system that went into effect throughout the United States on January 1, 1997.

==Flexibility and default rules==
LLCs are subject to fewer regulations than traditional corporations, and thus may allow members to create a more flexible management structure than is possible with other corporate forms. As long as the LLC remains within the confines of state law, the operating agreement is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed. State statutes typically provide automatic or &quot;default&quot; rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, as permitted by statute in the state where the LLC was organized.

The limited liability company has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. Even the use of a single member LLC affords greater protection for the assets of the member, as compared to operating as an unincorporated entity.

Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a Delaware-domiciled limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp&quot;),&quot;&quot; parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).

Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. The written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.

Like a corporation, LLCs are required to register in the states they are &quot;conducting (or transacting) business.&quot; Each state has different standards and rules defining what &quot;transacting business&quot; means, and as a consequence, navigating what is required can be quite confusing for small business owners. Simply forming an LLC in any state may not be enough to meet legal requirements, and specifically, if an LLC is formed in one state, but the owner (or owners) are located in another state (or states), or an employee is located in another state, or the LLC&#x27;s base of operations is located in another state, the LLC may need to register as a foreign LLC in the other states it is &quot;transacting business.&quot;

==Income tax==
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity. If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a &quot;disregarded entity&quot; for tax purposes (unless another tax status is elected), and an individual owner would report the LLC&#x27;s income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member&#x27;s distributive share of the LLC&#x27;s income or loss that is then reported on the member&#x27;s individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice: once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders. Thus, more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.

An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832. After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity&#x27;s income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as an S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).

Some legal scholars argue that corporate income taxes are intended to limit the power of corporations and to offset the legal benefits corporations enjoy, such as limited liability for their investors. There is concern that LLCs, by combining limited liability with no entity-level taxation, could contribute to excessive risk-taking and harm to third parties.

==Advantages==

* Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
* A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members&#x27; distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
* The owners of the LLC, called members, are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
* In the United States, an S corporation is limited to 100 shareholders, and all of them must be U.S. tax residents. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
* Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
* Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
* Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
* LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC) (see, for example, the case of &quot;Sturm v. Harb Development&quot;
* LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
* Less risk of being &quot;stolen&quot; by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against &quot;hungry&quot; investors).
* For some business ventures, such as real estate investment, each property can be owned by a separate LLC, thereby shielding the owners and their other properties from cross-liability.
*Flexible membership: Members of an LLC may include individuals, partnerships, trusts, estates, organizations, or other business entities, and most states do not limit the type or number of members.

==Disadvantages==

Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. In the absence of such statutory provisions, members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.
* It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
* Many jurisdictions—including Alabama, California, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas—levy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.
** Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
** In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profit—unless the entity is tax exempt—must at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.
* Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
* The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers (this could also be seen as an advantage to some).
* Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposes—for example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction. This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
* The principals of LLCs use many different titles—e.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC&#x27;s behalf.

==Variations==
*A professional limited liability company (usually shortened as PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L., sometimes PLC, standing for professional limited company – not to be confused with public limited company) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC. However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC&#x27;s members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.

*A series LLC is a special form of a limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.

*An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.

*An anonymous limited liability company is an LLC for which ownership information is not made publicly available by the state. Anonymity is possible in states that do not require the public disclosure of legal ownership of an LLC, or where an LLC&#x27;s identified legal owners are another anonymous company.

<doc id="283120" wikidata="Q466089" url="?curid=283120" title="American Philosophical Society">
<text>The American Philosophical Society (APS) is an American scholarly organization and learned society founded in 1743 in Philadelphia that promotes knowledge in the humanities and natural sciences through research, professional meetings, publications, library resources, and community outreach. It was founded by the polymath Benjamin Franklin and is considered the first learned society founded in what became the United States.

Philosophical Hall, the society&#x27;s headquarters and a museum, is located just east of Independence Hall in Independence National Historical Park. In 1965, in recognition of the building&#x27;s history, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.

The society has about 1,000 elected members. As of April 2020, 5,710 members had been inducted since its creation. Through research grants, published journals, the American Philosophical Society Museum, an extensive library, and regular meetings, the society supports a variety of disciplines in the humanities and the sciences.

== History ==

The American Philosophical Society was founded as the Philosophical Society in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, James Alexander, Francis Hopkinson, John Bartram, Philip Syng Jr., and others as an offshoot of an earlier club, the Junto.

Early members included: Benjamin Franklin, John Dickinson, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James McHenry, Thomas Paine, David Rittenhouse, Peter Stephen Du Ponceau, Nicholas Biddle, Owen Biddle, Benjamin Rush, James Madison, Michael Hillegas, John Marshall, Charles Pettit, and John Andrews.

It was common at the time for intellectual societies to invite members from around the world, where the society recruited members from other countries, including Alexander von Humboldt, the Marquis de Lafayette, Baron von Steuben, Tadeusz Kościuszko, and Princess Dashkova. The society lapsed into inactivity by 1746, but was revived in 1767.

On January 2, 1769, the society united with the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge under the name American Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Franklin was elected the first president. During this time, the society maintained a standing Committee on American Improvements; one of its investigations was to study the prospects for a canal to connect the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which had been proposed by Thomas Gilpin, Sr., was built in the 1820s.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the society looked for leadership to Francis Hopkinson, one of the signatories of the United States Declaration of Independence. Under his influence, the society received land from the government of Pennsylvania, along with a plot of land in Philadelphia, where Philosophical Hall now stands.

Charles Darwin, Robert Frost, Louis Pasteur, Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz, John James Audubon, Linus Pauling, Margaret Mead, Woodrow Wilson, Maria Mitchell, and Thomas Edison were all prominent members of the society.

Many members of the Society of the Cincinnati were among the APS&#x27;s first board members and contributors; the APS and SOC still maintain an informal, collegial relationship.

== Membership ==
Membership of the APS &quot;honors extraordinary accomplishments in all fields.&quot; It has about 1,000 elected members, comprising about 840 &quot;resident&quot; members (United States citizens or those working or living in the United States) and about 160 &quot;international&quot; members. it had elected 5,890 members since its foundation.

Over that history, 220 members have been from Harvard University, 117 from Princeton University, 91 from Stanford University, and 86 from the University of California, Berkeley. Ten academic institutions have each been affiliated with 50 or more members:

== Awards ==
In 1786, the society established the Magellanic Premium, a prize for achievement in &quot;navigation, astronomy, or natural philosophy,&quot; the oldest scientific prize awarded by an American institution, which it still awards. Other awards include the Barzun Prize for cultural history, the Judson Daland Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Clinical Investigation, the Benjamin Franklin Medal for distinguished achievement in the sciences, the Lashley Award for neurobiology, the Lewis Award for the best book published by the society in the year, and the Thomas Jefferson Medal for distinguished achievement in the arts, humanities, or social sciences.

== Publications ==
The society has published the &quot;Transactions of the American Philosophical Society&quot; since 1771. Five issues appear each year. The &quot;Proceedings&quot; have appeared since 1838; they publish the papers delivered at the society&#x27;s biannual meetings. The society has also published The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, Joseph Henry, William Penn, and Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Jane Aitken bound 400 volumes for the society.

The society also has an expansive archive on framer of the U.S. constitution John Dickinson.

APS holds the ACLS Collection (American Council of Learned Societies Committee on Native American Languages, American Philosophical Society) which is a collection of indigenous language documents from around the United States including recordings of the Odawa language from northern Michigan. APS has created a guide to help provide broad coverage of the Native American and Indigenous archival collections at the Library &amp; Museum of the American Philosophical Society. These materials date from 1553 to 2020 and include manuscript, audio, and visual materials relating to Indigenous peoples throughout the Americas.

The society also has a collection of manuscripts on the history of the British colonies, Revolutionary War, the history of American science, quantum physics, Charles Darwin and evolution, genetics and the history of technology.

== Buildings ==

=== Philosophical Hall ===

Philosophical Hall, at 104 South Fifth Street, Philadelphia, between Chestnut and Walnut Streets, immediately south of Old City Hall, was built in 1785–1789 to house the society and designed by Samuel Vaughan in the Federal style. A third floor was added in 1890 to accommodate the expanding library, but was removed in 1948–1950, when the building was restored to its original appearance for the creation of Independence National Historical Park. In 2001, it was opened to the public as The American Philosophical Society Museum, hosting revolving, thematic exhibitions that explore intersections of history, art, and science. The museum features works of art, scientific instruments, original manuscripts, rare books, natural history specimens, and curiosities of all kinds from the APS&#x27;s own collections, along with objects on loan from other institutions.

=== Library Hall ===

In 1789–90, the Library Company of Philadelphia (LCP) built its headquarters directly across 5th Street from APS. In 1884 LCP sold its building, which was demolished for the expansion of the Drexel &amp; Company Building in 1887. This building was demolished in the mid-1950s, during the creation of Independence National Historical Park.

APS built a library on the site in 1958 and recreated the façade of the old LCP building.

=== Benjamin Franklin Hall ===
APS restored the former Farmers&#x27; &amp; Mechanics&#x27; Bank building at 425–29 Chestnut Street, which was built in 1854–55 to the design of John M. Gries in the Italianate style, to serve as a lecture hall. It is the site of meetings and most major events the society hosts.

=== Richardson Hall ===
The Constance C. and Edgar P. Richardson Hall at 431 Chestnut Street, immediately west of Benjamin Franklin Hall, is the former Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities Building, which was built in 1871–1873 and designed by Addison Hutton. It contains offices and the Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine.

<doc id="283187" wikidata="Q7911276" url="?curid=283187" title="Valerie Goulding">
<text>Valerie Hamilton, Lady Goulding (12 September 1918 – 28 July 2003) was an Irish campaigner for disabled people, and senator who set up the Central Remedial Clinic in 1951 alongside Kathleen O&#x27;Rourke which is now the largest organisation in Ireland looking after people with physical disabilities. She served as a member of Seanad Éireann from 1977 to 1981.

==Background==
Born Valerie Hamilton Monckton, she was the only daughter of Mary Adelaide Somes Colyer-Ferguson and Sir Walter Monckton (later 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley). She was born at Ightham Mote, which was owned by her maternal grandfather, Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson, until his death in 1951. Her only brother, Gilbert, became a Major general in the British Army. She was educated at Downe House School, near Newbury. Both Valerie and her brother, Gilbert, would ultimately convert to Roman Catholicism.

Her father was a British lawyer and politician, and became chief legal adviser to Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis in 1936. She acted as her father&#x27;s secretary and courier during the crisis, carrying letters between the King and the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin.

==Career==
In World War II, she joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry before switching to the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In Dublin for a race meeting in 1939, she met and soon married Irish fertiliser manufacturer and art collector Sir Basil Goulding and moved to Ireland. However, her husband moved to England to join the RAF, ending the war as a Wing commander; meanwhile, she served as a second lieutenant in the British Army. After the war, the couple returned to Ireland, where Sir Basil and his family managed Goulding Chemicals.

In 1951, she co-founded, with Kathleen O&#x27;Rourke, the Central Remedial Clinic located in a couple of rooms in central Dublin, to provide non-residential care for disabled people. The Clinic later moved to a purpose building in Clontarf in 1968, where it is located today. The Clinic&#x27;s foundation initiated a revolution in the treatment of physical disability and rapidly grew to by far the largest centre dealing with the needs of disabled people. Lady Goulding remained chairman and managing director of the CRC until 1984.

On account of her widespread popularity, she was nominated by the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, to Seanad Éireann, where she worked to raise awareness of disability issues in 1977. She sought election to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil candidate at the November 1982 general election for the Dún Laoghaire constituency but was unsuccessful. She was spoken of as a possible President of Ireland in 1983, should the president, Patrick Hillery, decline to seek a second term. (Hillery ultimately was re-elected).

==Family==
Lady Goulding died in a nursing home on 28 July 2003 in Dublin, aged 84. She was predeceased by her husband, Sir Basil Goulding, in 1982. Her eldest son, Sir William Goulding, known as Lingard Goulding, served as Headmaster of Headfort School in County Meath; the other sons are Hamilton and Timothy of Dr. Strangely Strange.

<text>The National Basketball League (NBL) is a men&#x27;s professional basketball league in Australasia, currently composed of ten teams: nine in Australia and one in New Zealand. It is the premier professional men&#x27;s basketball league in Australia and New Zealand.

The NBL was established as the National Invitation Basketball League (NIBL) in 1978 and commenced its first season in 1979. It was renamed to the NBL in 1980. The league was played in the Australian winter until 1998 when it switched to summer seasons beginning with the 1998–99 season. The NBL&#x27;s regular season runs from October to February, with each team playing 28 games. The league&#x27;s finals extends into March, culminating with the Championship grand final series.

== History ==
Before the establishment of the NBL, there were two national basketball competitions: the National Titles and the Australian Club Championships. The NBL was established as the National Invitation Basketball League (NIBL) in 1978. It was renamed as the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1980.

In August 1979, the inaugural season of the NBL commenced, playing in the winter season (April–September) which it did so until the completion of the 1998 season, the league&#x27;s twentieth season. The 1998–99 season, which began only months later, was the first to be played during the summer season (October–April). The shift, which is currently used by the league, was an attempt to avoid competing directly against Australia&#x27;s various winter season football codes. Officially the NBL is Australia&#x27;s third oldest continuing national sporting competition after the domestic cricket competition (which commenced its first season in 1892) and Australian Football League (which commenced its first season in 1897 as the Victorian Football League before changing its name in 1990).

The NBL experienced its &quot;golden age&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its popularity, media attention, attendance and corporate support deteriorated and plateaued in the decade afterward with the growth of the country&#x27;s four football codes.

A second Melbourne club, the South Dragons, entered the league in the 2006–07 season, but was short lived, soon folding 3 years later after the 2008–09 season in which they were NBL champions. In the 2006–07 season, the NBL became the first Australasian sporting league to field a team from Asia with the Singapore Slingers playing. The Gold Coast Blaze also joined the competition in the 2007–08 season. In 2007, Australian NBA player Andrew Bogut suggested the NBL try to adopt a model similar to the Australian Football League (AFL) whereby there are the same 10 or 15 teams over a 10-year period.
A turbulent period during 2008 and 2009 saw the league lose teams from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Singapore.

The 2009–10 season earmarked as the season in which the NBL would begin its revamping, much like the old National Soccer League which became the eight team A-League. The NBL returned to free-to-air television in Australia for the first time in three years with One broadcasting 2–3 games a week.

The 2010–11 season saw the return of the Sydney Kings after the club was purchased for 20,000 on 31 July 2008.

In 2013, the NBL had a de-merger from Basketball Australia.

Crowds improved for the 2013–14 NBL season, recording the highest cumulative crowd attendance figures for the past five years.

After numerous teams folding and a plummeting public profile property developer Larry Kestelman purchased a 51% portion of the league. Since then game attendance, TV viewership, website visitors and app downloads have been consistently on the increase.

In April 2016, the Townsville Crocodiles folded as they had become too financially unsustainable to continue.

Larry Kestelman has stated on the Aussie Hoopla podcast that no NBL club will ever fold again as long as he is in control of the league.

Allowing for clubs to recruit the best Australian players not in the NBA became easier with the marquee rule which saw the return from Europe and the US of players such as Brad Newley, David Andersen and Andrew Bogut. In addition the Special Restricted Player rule, introduced for the 2016–17 season, allows for clubs to recruit players born in countries such as China, Philippines, Taiwan, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan who would not count as imports under NBL rules.

From 2016 to 2018, there was a renewed interest in the sport, with it being described as being the National Basketball League&#x27;s greatest ever period. 2016–17 set a new attendance record for the league, with the figure being matched the following year, as well as the Grand Final series for the 2017–18 season.

In 2018, the S.E. Melbourne Phoenix were announced as the latest club to join the league, and started competing in the 2019–20 season; a season which was widely regarded as a major season for the league. After an active off-season, including the signings of LaMelo Ball and R. J. Hampton, two highly rated NBA 2020 draft picks, the league started by continuing to topple attendance records from the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2019/20 attendance&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The season&#x27;s opening night had 10,300 fans in attendance to watch Melbourne United and the S.E. Melbourne Phoenix compete in the first &quot;Throwdown&quot;, with a further 20,550 fans attending games across the first round. After signing a broadcasting deal with Facebook Watch, over one million American fans watched Ball&#x27;s first game in the NBL against the Brisbane Bullets.

Following two condensed seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022–23 NBL season and the 2023 finals series saw a number of all-time attendance records being set for the league.

In the 2023–24 season, one million fans attended NBL games for the first time since 1996.

== Competition format ==
=== Regular season ===
Since the 2009–10 season, each team has played 28 games during the regular season, 14 home and 14 away. The regular season starts in early October and ends in mid February.

In the 2020–21 season, each team played an extra 8 games (36 games) due to the newly formatted NBL Cup tournament. The following season the NBL returned to their normal format of 28 games with no midseason tournament.

=== Finals ===

The top four teams at the end of the regular season advances to the Finals. The team finishing in the first and second position at the completion of the regular season receives home advantages in their best-of-three first round matchup against the team finishing in third and fourth position. The winner of each of the three matches advances to the Grand Final. The winner of Series 1 plays the winner of Series 2 in the best-of-five Grand Final series, with home advantage being awarded to the highest remaining seed. The winner of this series is crowned as NBL champion.

In the 2022–23 season, the NBL introduced play-in games. The top two seeds in the regular season will automatically qualify to the semi-finals. Teams ranked three to six will compete in the play-in tournament. The third seed will play the fourth seed for third spot and the loser will play the winner of fifth or sixth for the fourth seed.

=== NBL Cup ===
In the 2020–21 season, the NBL introduced the NBL Cup which is a 36-game mid-season competition. Each game would contribute to each team&#x27;s regular season record.

In the 2021–22 season, the NBL returned to their normal format of 28 games. In May 2023, the league raised the potential for a return of a cup tournament with a Magic Round-style basketball event. A mid-season tournament was raised again by the league in January 2025 following the success of the NBA Cup.

=== Game length ===
From the 1979 season until the 1983 season, the NBL played 40 minute games with two 20-minute halves and no three-point line. From the 1984 season until the 2008–09 season, the NBL played 48 minute games over four 12-minute quarters. Since the 2009–10 season, the NBL&#x27;s format is 40 minute games with four 10-minute quarters, known as the &quot;modern&quot; 40-minute era.

== Current clubs ==
The NBL was founded in 1979 with ten clubs. Due to club expansions, reductions, and relocations, many of the clubs either changed or ceased to exist. There are currently ten clubs; nine clubs in Australia and one club in New Zealand. The clubs are located in Adelaide, Auckland, Brisbane, Cairns, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, and Wollongong. The Brisbane Bullets and the Illawarra Hawks are the oldest clubs in the league, both clubs were established in 1979. The Illawarra Hawks are the only club which has participated in every NBL season since the inaugural season in 1979.


=== Former clubs ===


=== Recent expansion ===
After weeks of reports of a return of a Tasmanian team, in June 2019, Larry Kestelman flagged Tasmania as a potential 10th team. However he stressed that if a Tasmanian team did enter the NBL, they would be eased in, and that there was no timeline. On 28 February 2020, the NBL and the Tasmanian Government announced that they had reached an agreement for Tasmania to host the 10th team in the NBL, known as the Tasmania JackJumpers, which would join for the 2021–22 season.

In April 2022, Larry Kestelman flagged Canberra as a potential 11th team. Kestelman says “Canberra could be next in line for a league license, following the same model as the Tasmania JackJumpers.” The last Canberra team to play in the NBL was the Cannons from 1979–2003. They won three NBL championships and played their home games at the AIS Arena.

In January 2024, the NBL announced a partnership with the Japanese B.League which will see future collaboration on pre-season game crossovers and potential exploration of the viability of a team from Japan participating in the NBL.

== Rivalries ==

Adelaide 36ers vs Brisbane Bullets

Arguably the NBL&#x27;s oldest rivalry started in 1985 when the Brian Kerle coached Bullets defeated the Ken Cole coached 36ers 121–95 in the 1985 NBL Grand Final, the last single game Grand Final in NBL history. From 1985 to 1987, the Bullets and 36ers were the two dominant teams in the NBL and the two clubs met in the 1986 NBL Grand Final, the first NBL GF to be played over a 3-game series. An Australian indoor sports attendance record of around 11,000 saw the first game of the 1986 series played at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre with Adelaide, who had a 24–2 record for the season, winning 122–119 in overtime. Brisbane then handed Adelaide its only home loss of 1986 (the 36ers had gone 13–0 at the Apollo Stadium) when they won Game 2 104–83 before Adelaide won its first NBL title with a 113–91 win at Apollo in Game 3. The teams were evenly matched at the time with players such as Al Green, Mark Davis, Bill Jones, Peter Ali, Darryl Pearce, Mike McKay and Dwayne Nelson (Adelaide) against Brisbane&#x27;s star import Leroy Loggins, captain Larry Sengstock, guard Ron Radliff, forwards Danny Morseu, Robert Sibley and Chris McGraw, centre John Dorge and (in 1985 and 1986) Cal Bruton. Loggins was the NBL MVP in 1986 and 1987 (and player of the match in the 1985 GF) while Mark Davis was the Grand Final MVP in 1986 and shared the NBL MVP award with Loggins in 1987.

The Rivalry between the two clubs again reached fever pitch in the mid-1990s when Bullets guard Shane Heal earned the ire of the Adelaide crowd during Game 3 of the 1994 Elimination final series when he gave the crowd at the Clipsal Powerhouse a &#x27;double bird&#x27;. Heal, who had scored 61 points in the last regular season game before scoring 42 points in Game 1 to lead Brisbane to a 116–105 home win over the 36ers, had not actually managed to score a point before half time in Game 2 which the 36ers had won 99–91 before also winning Game 3 101–84. Heal, along with former 36er Mark Bradtke who had left under acrimonious circumstances at the end of 1992 to join the Melbourne Tigers, became public enemy #1 to the 36ers crowd following the incident.

With the Bullets returning to the NBL in 2016, the rivalry has continued with Adelaide defeating the Bullets in their first encounter at home, the Bullets returning the favour with an away win in Adelaide, while a week later Adelaide spoiled the Bullets regular season return to the Entertainment Centre for the first time since 1997 with a resounding 101–83 win.

Adelaide 36ers vs Melbourne United

Apart from the normal South Australian and Victorian rivalry, the 36ers vs United (formerly Tigers) rivalry started at the end of the 1992 season when 36ers centre Mark Bradtke joined Spanish club Juver Murcia following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain for a short stint. Before he left he signed an agreement with the 36ers stating that he would finish his one-year contract with the club should he return within a certain time. Upon his return to Australia, Bradtke stated his intention not to return to the 36ers with the Tigers rumoured to be actively chasing him. After protracted negotiations with 36ers management that led to the club being prepared to buy out his remaining contract, the NBL stepped in and vetoed the buy out, effectively letting Bradtke leave for Melbourne without the 36ers receiving any compensation for the remainder of his contract with the club. When Bradtke returned to Adelaide with the Tigers on 4 July 1993 he was soundly booed whenever he touched the ball by the 8,000 strong crowd at the Clipsal Powerhouse. The booing of Bradtke and the Andrew Gaze led Tigers continued for a number of seasons.

A new rivalry has emerged with Julius Hodge, a former 36er, returning to the NBL in November 2009, signing with the Melbourne Tigers. Hodge was a star in Adelaide when he joined the 36ers mid-season the previous two years, however issues relating to alleged missed payments caused him to walk out on the club in early January 2009 on bad terms.

Hodge returned to his old home court for the first time on 5 December 2009 in a Tigers overtime victory. After being heckled and taunted all night in a quiet game by his standards, Hodge caused more controversy when he stamped and spat on the Brett Maher signature on the centre of the Brett Maher Court following his new club&#x27;s win. He was booed off aggressively and loudly by the Adelaide fans and needed security to escort him out of the stadium.

Adelaide 36ers vs Perth Wildcats

Both teams were perennial championship contenders in the late 1980s and early 90s and had several marquee players with excellent match-ups, the three most notable all involving American imports: Al Green (Adelaide) vs Cal Bruton (Perth), Mark Davis (Adelaide) vs James Crawford (Perth) and Bill Jones (Adelaide) vs Tiny Pinder (Perth). Games during this era were rarely blowouts and helped to fuel the rivalry. Adelaide won the 1986 NBL Championship over the Brisbane Bullets and Bruton, who moved from Brisbane to be player-coach of Perth in 1987, built a team specifically to beat the reigning champions. Despite the long time rivalry between the two clubs, and the two teams having played numerous semi-final series against each other with the first being in that 1987 season, they did not face each other in a grand final series until the 2013–14 season, which was won by the Perth Wildcats. the Wildcats have won each semi-finals series played between the two (1987, 1989 and 1995).

The 1995 series proved to be one of the most volatile and controversial due to an incident between 36ers forward Chris Blakemore and Perth&#x27;s Martin Cattalini in Game 1 in Adelaide. Under instructions from coach Mike Dunlap to basically belt the next Perth player to go through the key, Blakemore back handed Cattalini, giving the Wildcats forward a large cut on his mouth that required 15 stitches. Blakemore was suspended for Game 2 in Perth as the Wildcats swept the 36ers 2–0 before going on to defeat the defending champion North Melbourne Giants (who had swept Adelaide in 1994) 2–1 in the Grand Final. In an ironic twist, Cattalini would join the 36ers in 1996 and later went on to win two championships with the club (plus another with Perth), while Blakemore, the NBL&#x27;s Rookie of the year in 1993 and its Most Improved Player award winner in 1994, as well as playing for the Australian Boomers in 1995, joined the Canberra Cannons in 1996 and his career went downhill from there with his NBL career ending at the end of 1997 after just two seasons with the Cannons.

As the mainstay players began to slow with age and retire, the intensity of this rivalry has declined. The two clubs remain some of the most successful in the NBL with four championships for Adelaide and ten for Perth, and are first and second on the all-time wins list (748 wins for Perth, 692 wins for Adelaide as of 20 May 2021) and have also matched up on more occasions (134 times total; Perth leading all time between the two 73 – 61) than any other two teams in the NBL (as of 15 November 2019). The rivalry continues into the 2012–13 season with the 36ers beating the Wildcats in back to back games in rounds 6 and 7, including the opening game at Perth&#x27;s new home, the Perth Arena, in front of a then record Wildcats crowd of 11,562.

The Wildcats and the 36ers dominated the 2013–14 NBL season, finishing first and second respectively during the regular round. After the three previous semi-final meetings, they then faced off in their first ever Grand Final series which saw the Wildcats emerge with their record 6th NBL championship with a 2–1 series win. This was one of the most anticipated series in NBL history, not only given the two clubs&#x27; long-standing rivalry, but also due to the post-game on court &#x27;brawl&#x27; which took place following their Round 18 clash in Perth earlier in the season.

Adelaide and Perth play for the Cattalini Cup named for Perth born Martin Cattalini who won two championships with each club. In each game, the game MVP is awarded with the Paul Rogers Medal named for Adelaide born centre Paul Rogers who made his NBL debut for the 36ers in 1992 and later joined Perth, winning 2 championships and the NBL MVP award in 2000 while with the Wildcats.

Cairns Taipans vs Townsville Crocodiles

A local derby-style rivalry nicknamed &quot;Reptile Rumble&quot; has developed to determine which is the dominant North Queensland team. The Cairns-Townsville basketball rivalry would have to be one of the longest and most passionate in the NBL. Both teams generally attract a close to capacity crowd anywhere from 4000+ at their home games. Each team and their supporters and mascots generally boo and taunt their visiting rivals. The rivalry has been in existent for over 10 years and almost came to a near end when the Cairns Taipans were on the verge of extinction due to financial issues.

The rivalry between the two North Queensland based clubs is currently extinct due to the Crocodiles folding at the end of the 2015–16 NBL season.

Illawarra Hawks vs Sydney Kings

Illawarra Hawks fans consider the Sydney Kings to be their most fierce rival. Many Hawks players have moved to the Kings including two former Rookie of the Year winners and a two-time Olympian. In the absence of the Kings, the Sydney Spirit took the role of rival, but this felt fake to some Hawks faithful. The Hawks took bragging rights after the 2000–01 season when they became the first team from New South Wales to qualify for the NBL finals, which they won against Townsville. Sydney then took the ascendency when they won three championships in a row, including a clean sweep of the Hawks.

The next time they met in the post-season, Sydney swept the Hawks 2–0 in the 2022 Semi-Finals enroute to their fourth championship.

New Zealand Breakers vs Perth Wildcats

The Breakers and the Wildcats have arguably been the NBL&#x27;s strongest teams and have been fairly evenly matched. Between them, they have won every year&#x27;s premiership from 2009–10 to 2016–17 and met in the final in 2011–12 and 2012–13 (both won by the Breakers) and 2015–16 (won by the Wildcats). Both teams have similarities in that they have to travel great distances to play any other NBL team. These two factors have combined to make a &quot;derby of distance&quot; between the NBL&#x27;s farthest-flung members. The rivalry may have its origins in a scrap between players from each side after a game in 2004. Games between the two sides have been intense ones for several years and often marked with incident.

Melbourne United vs South East Melbourne Phoenix

Known as the &quot;Throwdown&quot;, these two teams formed a rivalry as they are both based in Melbourne and play their games at John Cain Arena. The first Throwdown was the Phoenix&#x27;s first game in the NBL, as well as the first game of the 2019–20 NBL season, with the Phoenix winning 91–88.

The two teams have since met in the 2021 semi-finals, with United winning the series 2–1.

== Organisation ==
=== Sponsorship ===
At the start of the 2004–05 season, the NBL struck a new television deal with Fox Sports in Australia and a multi-year naming-rights sponsorship deal with electronics manufacturer Philips. Though in 2007, Philips announced they would not continuing their naming rights sponsorship in response to the NBL wishing to increase the sponsorship deal. On 18 September 2007, the NBL announced Hummer as their naming rights sponsor for the 2007–08 season.

On 13 September 2010, iiNet was announced as the NBL naming rights sponsor and Centrebet as the official sports betting partner. Spalding provided equipment including the official game ball, with AND1 supplying team apparel. The iiNet sponsorship lasted for 3 seasons, and the Centrebet sponsorship lasted for two seasons.

On 5 October 2017, Hungry Jack&#x27;s became the naming rights sponsor for the NBL. The Hungry Jack&#x27;s logo features on player jerseys, in and around venues and the company is closely associated with Heritage Month in January.

=== Media coverage ===
National television broadcasting rights are as follows: While the ABC had exclusive national broadcasting rights from 1979 to 1987, other television stations around the country (usually those affiliated with either the Seven Network or Network Ten) would broadcast their local teams to their state markets once the sport gained popularity. For example, in the mid-1980s the Adelaide 36ers and Brisbane Bullets home games were shown in Adelaide and Brisbane by Network Ten stations SAS and TV0 respectively.

In 2015, Fox Sports secured a 5-year deal for the Australian broadcasting rights of all games, starting with the 2015–16 season. In addition, for the 2015–16 season Nine Network secured one weekly match (every Sunday afternoon) for FTA. In 2016, SBS secured the exclusive free-to-air rights for the 2016–17 season, broadcasting and streaming online one Sunday match live each week. In the 2017–18 Season, SBS broadcast 2 games live, one on Saturday and another on Sunday, while ABC broadcast a Friday night game on delay at 11pm. In 2021, the NBL signed a three-year deal with ESPN, Foxtel, Kayo Sports and News Corp, with every game broadcast on ESPN and Kayo Sports, and selected games broadcast with the NBL&#x27;s free-to-air partner 10 Peach.

In August 2022, FanDuel TV announced they had acquired the broadcast rights to the NBL in the United States.

The entire 2023–24 season will be carried on ESPN3 and the ESPN App in the United States.

=== Squad formation and salary cap ===
Most teams have historically featured at least one and usually two American imports. Currently, teams are limited to having three imports (i.e., non-Australasians) on the roster at any one time; NBL initiatives in recent years have added two roster slots that may be filled by imports without counting against the three-import limit. Some of these players have moved to Australia permanently and become Australian citizens; a few including Cal Bruton, Mark Davis, Leroy Loggins and Ricky Grace have even played for the Australian national team (under a FIBA rule that allows one naturalised player to compete for a national team).

The NBL&#x27;s salary cap for the 2006–07 season was 776,000, and increased to 810,000 for the 2007–08 season; the cap rose for two consecutive years due to the continued growth of the NBL. The salary cap rose 1,000,000 for the 2009–10 season. The cap remains at 1,000,000 for the 2012–13 season.

For the 2016–17 season, the salary cap was changed from a 1,000,000 ‘hard cap’ to a 1,100,000 ‘soft cap’. Teams may exceed the soft cap provided that they pay a salary equalisation subsidy based on the extent to which they have exceeded the cap. In addition, player values for purposes of the salary cap are not based on the salary submitted to the NBL, but are determined by a special NBL panel. The cap regulations also mandate that teams distribute their salaries so that at least one group of five players has a collective cap value of no more than 400,000. Both cap numbers (the soft cap and the 5-player aggregate cap) have increased since then, based on average NBL salaries.

On 9 May 2014, to help attract high-calibre imports or offer financial incentive for local stars considering overseas opportunities, the NBL introduced a marquee player rule, in which a team can nominate one player whose salary is paid outside the cap, with a 25% Marquee Player levy applied to any payment made above the salary cap. For the 2016–17 season, the value was modified so that if the marquee player is a &quot;non-restricted&quot; player (explained below), only the first $150,000 of that player&#x27;s salary will be counted toward that team&#x27;s salary cap.

NBL legend Andrew Gaze has pointed to these changes being instrumental to the improvement of NBL and its Australian players.

Also effective in 2016–17, the number of import roster slots was increased from two to three, and each team was allowed (but not required) to have one player from a FIBA Asia or FIBA Oceania country other than Australia or New Zealand on its roster who would not be counted against the import limit. Since then, the NBL has used the term &quot;non-restricted&quot; to describe all players signed as locals, including Asian/Oceanic players signed under the regional initiative. With this change, many of the best Asian-born players were expected to seek NBL contracts, as teams can now recruit them and play them as locals.

In 2020, the NBL reduced the number of imports per club from 3 to 2.

The maximum length of NBL player contracts is three years. The 2020–21 NBL salary cap has been set at $US 1,227,930, with one marquee &#x27;local&#x27; player (including players with Asian or Oceania passports) and traditional imports exempt from the salary cap. Next Stars may also be exempt.

The salary cap will increase by another seven percent in the 2024–25 season to $1,947,662.58, making a fourteen percent jump since 2022–23 season, a $244,423 uplift.

The salary floor (the minimum each team must spend) sits at $1,752,913.85.

==== Next Stars Program ====
On 2 March 2018, the NBL announced the &quot;Next Stars&quot; initiative which would launch with the NBL&#x27;s 2018–19 season. The scheme is designed to provide young elite overseas players, mainly Americans (who are currently barred from the NBA draft until one year out of secondary school), as well as Australians and New Zealanders considering U.S. college basketball, with a professional option immediately out of secondary school.

Each team received one additional import roster slot intended for a &quot;Next Star&quot; player. Players who will be part of the scheme will be selected by a special NBL panel and, should they accept the NBL&#x27;s offer, be contracted directly by the NBL and placed into an allocation pool to be distributed among the NBL&#x27;s teams. The chosen players will receive a salary of at least 100,000, as well as a car, apartment, and flights home during NBL breaks. The scheme was funded for the first season by the NBL, meaning that &quot;Next Star&quot; players will not count against the salary cap. Finally, under current rules, the NBA allows its teams to spend up to 700,000 to buy players out of professional contracts in non-North American leagues; should a &quot;Next Star&quot; be bought out by an NBA team (or by a team in another overseas league), the buyout amount will be split between the team and the NBL.

In April 2024, the NBL appointed NBA legend Kenny Smith, as Head of Next Stars’ Player Initiatives (North America) for its Next Stars program. In June 2024, Carmelo Anthony joined the NBL’s Next Stars program as a Global Ambassador. The appointment will also see Anthony join the ownership group of a future NBL expansion team.

The first player signed to a Next Star contract was American Brian Bowen, who signed on 7 August 2018 and was assigned to the Sydney Kings. As of July 2024, three players from the Next Stars Program have become top ten NBA draft picks: LaMelo Ball (third in 2020), Josh Giddey (sixth in 2021), and Alex Sarr (second in 2024). The 2024 NBA draft also saw four Next Stars players be drafted in total.

=== Uniforms ===
Since the 2020–21 season, Champion has supplied the uniforms for all teams in the NBL.

==== City Round ====
With the introduction of First Ever as uniform supplier in 2018, the NBL announced the &quot;City&quot; round. During this annual round, all teams wear limited edition jerseys which are specific to the city of their team.

==== Indigenous Round ====
In December 2018, the Illawarra Hawks and Sydney Kings wore Indigenous based jerseys to celebrate &quot;the rich Indigenous culture within basketball as a whole.&quot;

After this successful launch, the NBL announced that in the 2019–20 season all teams would be competing in an Indigenous round.

==Road trips==
Doomsday Double
The Doomsday Double, involving a road trip to play the Adelaide 36ers and Perth Wildcats during the same round, has occurred 141 times as at the end of the 2010–11 season. Only four teams have won both legs of the trip, played either on consecutive nights or on a Friday night and Sunday afternoon. Due to the long time success rate of both the 36ers and Wildcats, the Double has long been considered the toughest two games in one weekend road trip in the NBL. The Doomsday Double was given its name by Hall of Famer Cal Bruton during its early days when the trip was a game in Perth on the Friday night followed by Adelaide the following night or vice versa.

Sunshine Swing
Similar to the Doomsday Double, the Sunshine Swing pits teams against an away double or even triple game schedule against opponents from the state of Queensland, in the same round. The most frequent combinations have featured the Brisbane Bullets/Gold Coast Rollers or Cairns Taipans/Townsville Crocodiles double. Other variants include Brisbane Bullets/Cairns Taipans (current version), Brisbane Bullets/Townsville Crocodiles and the Brisbane Bullets/Cairns Taipans/Townsville Crocodiles triple.

== NBLxNBA ==
NBLxNBA is a series involving clubs from the NBL and the National Basketball Association (NBA) of Northern America. The series started in 2017 for each organisation&#x27;s 2017–18 season, and each season includes between two and seven games. The games have always been held in the U.S. and Canada, and typically are held during September and early October.

== NBL All-Star Game ==
The NBL All-Star Game is an event that was first contested in 1982 by East and West teams. It was revived in 1988 when North and South teams competed. This match was played annually until 1997. In 2003–04 season the concept was revived with an east–west match being held in Melbourne. The following season saw a change of format, with a local team (Aussie All-Stars) playing an imports team (World All-Stars). This was discontinued after the 2007–08 season. The concept was revived in 2012 with an All-Star game between North and South that was scheduled for December 2012.

<text>Anti-Americanism (also called anti-American sentiment and Americanophobia) is a term that can describe several sentiments and positions including opposition to, fear of, distrust of, prejudice against or hatred toward the United States, its government, its foreign policy, or Americans in general. Anti-Americanism can be contrasted with pro-Americanism, which refers to support, love, or admiration for the United States.

Political scientist Brendon O&#x27;Connor at the United States Studies Centre in Australia suggests that &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon, since the term originated as a rough composite of stereotypes, prejudices, and criticisms which evolved into more politically-based criticisms. French scholar Marie-France Toinet says that use of the term &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; is &quot;only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole.&quot; Some, such as Noam Chomsky and Nancy Snow, have argued that the application of the term &quot;anti-American&quot; to other countries or their populations is &#x27;nonsensical&#x27;, as it implies that disliking the American government or its policies is socially undesirable or even comparable to a crime. In this regard, the term has been likened to the propagandistic usage of the term &quot;anti-Sovietism&quot; in the USSR.

Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led the term to be used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American. Author and expatriate William Russell Melton argues that criticism largely originates from the perception that the U.S. wants to act as a &quot;world policeman&quot;.

Negative or critical views of the United States or its influence have been widespread in Russia, China, Serbia, Pakistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and the Greater Middle East, but remain low in Israel, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and certain countries in central and eastern Europe. In Western Europe, anti-Americanism is mainly present in the United Kingdom and France. A benign form of anti-Americanism has also been present in Canada since the late 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.

Anti-Americanism has also been identified with the term &quot;Americanophobia&quot;, which Merriam-Webster defines as &quot;hatred of the U.S. or American culture&quot;.

==Etymology==
In the online Oxford Dictionaries, the term &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; is defined as &quot;Hostility to the interests of the United States&quot;.

In the first edition of Webster&#x27;s American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) the term &quot;anti-American&quot; was defined as &quot;opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America&quot;.

In France the use of the noun form &quot;antiaméricanisme&quot; has been cataloged from 1948, entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.

==Rationale==
Bradley Bowman, a former professor at the United States Military Academy, argues that United States military facilities overseas and the forces stationed there serve as a &quot;major catalyst for anti-Americanism and radicalization.&quot; Other studies have found a link between the presence of the US bases and al-Qaeda recruitment. These bases are often cited by opponents of repressive governments to provoke anger, protest, and nationalistic fervor against the ruling class and the United States. This in turn, according to JoAnn Chirico, raises concerns in Washington that a democratic transition could lead to the closure of bases, which often encourages the United States to extend its support for authoritarian leaders. This study suggests that the outcome could be an intensifying cycle of protest and repression supported by the United States. In 1958, Eisenhower discussed with his staff what he described as a &quot;campaign of hatred against us&quot; in the Arab world, &quot;not by the governments but by the people.&quot; The United States National Security Council, concluded that was due to a perception that the U.S. supports corrupt and brutal governments and opposes political and economic development &quot;to protect its interest in Near East oil&quot;. 
The Wall Street Journal reached a similar conclusion after surveying the views of wealthy and Western Muslims after September 11 attacks.
In this vein, the head of the Council of Foreign Relations terrorism program believes that the American support for repressive regimes such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia is undoubtedly a major factor in anti-American sentiment in the Arab world.

==Interpretations==
In a poll conducted by the BBC World Service of 19 countries, four of the countries rated U.S. influence positively, while 14 leaned negatively, and one was divided.

Anti-Americanism had risen in the late 2010s in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and the European Union, due in part to the strong worldwide unpopularity of the Donald Trump administration&#x27;s policies, though anti-Americanism is noted to be low in numerous countries of central and eastern Europe due to stronger anti-communist sentiment amongst numerous former Warsaw Pact satellite states of the Soviet Union and strong support for joining and remaining within the NATO alliance. Following the 2020 election of Joe Biden as new president, overall global views of the United States have returned to being positive overall once more.

Interpretations of anti-Americanism have often been polarized. Anti-Americanism has been described by Hungarian-born American sociologist Paul Hollander as &quot;a relentless critical impulse toward American social, economic, and political institutions, traditions, and values&quot;.

German newspaper publisher and political scientist Josef Joffe suggests five classic aspects of the phenomenon: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing the United States to have an irredeemably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the U.S. responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence of the U.S. by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one&#x27;s society off from its polluting products and practices. Other advocates of the significance of the term argue that anti-Americanism represents a coherent and dangerous ideological current, comparable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Americanism has also been described as an attempt to frame the consequences of U.S. foreign policy choices as evidence of a specifically American moral failure, as opposed to what may be unavoidable failures of a complicated foreign policy that comes with superpower status.

Its status as an &quot;-ism&quot; is a greatly contended suspect, however. Brendon O&#x27;Connor notes that studies of the topic have been &quot;patchy and impressionistic,&quot; and often one-sided attacks on anti-Americanism as an irrational position. American academic Noam Chomsky, a prolific critic of the U.S. and its policies, asserts that the use of the term within the U.S. has parallels with methods employed by totalitarian states or military dictatorships; he compares the term to &quot;anti-Sovietism&quot;, a label used by the Kremlin to suppress dissident or critical thought, for instance.

Some have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: &quot;One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled &#x27;anti-American&#x27; by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents&quot;. Guerlain argues that these two &quot;ideal types&quot; of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult. Other scholars have suggested that a plural of anti-Americanisms, specific to country and time period, more accurately describe the phenomenon than any broad generalization. The widely used &quot;anti-American sentiment&quot;, meanwhile, less explicitly implies an ideology or belief system.

Globally, increases in perceived anti-American attitudes appear to correlate with particular policies or actions, such as the Vietnam and Iraq wars. For this reason, critics sometimes argue the label is a propaganda term that is used to dismiss any censure of the United States as irrational. American historian Max Paul Friedman has written that throughout American history the term has been misused to stifle domestic dissent and delegitimize any foreign criticism. According to an analysis by German historian Darius Harwardt, the term is nowadays mostly used to stifle debate by attempting to discredit viewpoints that oppose American policies.

== History ==
=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
==== Degeneracy thesis ====
In the mid- to late-eighteenth century, a theory emerged among some European intellectuals which stated that the landmasses of the New World were inherently inferior to that of Europe. Proponents of the so-called &quot;degeneracy thesis&quot; held the view that climatic extremes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions in America physically weakened both men and animals. American author James W. Ceaser and French author Philippe Roger have interpreted this theory as &quot;a kind of prehistory of anti-Americanism&quot; and have (in the words of Philippe Roger) been a historical &quot;constant&quot; since the 18th century, or again an endlessly repetitive &quot;semantic block&quot;. Others, like Jean-François Revel, have examined what lay hidden behind this &#x27;fashionable&#x27; ideology. Purported evidence for the idea included the smallness of American fauna, dogs that ceased to bark, and venomous plants; one theory put forth was that the New World had emerged from the Biblical flood later than the Old World. Native Americans were also held to be feeble, small, and without ardor.

The theory was originally proposed by Comte de Buffon, a leading French naturalist, in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; (1766). The French writer Voltaire joined Buffon and others in making the argument. Dutchman Cornelius de Pauw, court philosopher to Frederick II of Prussia became its leading proponent. While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked the people who were native to the continent. James Ceaser has noted that the denunciation of America as inferior to Europe was partially motivated by the German government&#x27;s fear of mass emigration; de Pauw was called upon to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher Immanuel Kant in a similar direction.

De Pauw said that the New World was unfit for human habitation because it was, &quot;so ill-favored by nature that all it contains is either degenerate or monstrous&quot;. He asserted that, &quot;the earth, full of putrefaction, was flooded with lizards, snakes, serpents, reptiles and insects&quot;. Taking a long-term perspective, he announced that he was, &quot;certain that the conquest of the New World...has been the greatest of all misfortunes to befall mankind.&quot;

The theory made it easier for its proponents to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing a true culture. Echoing de Pauw, the French Encyclopedist Abbé Raynal wrote in 1770, &quot;America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science&quot;. The theory was debated and rejected by early American thinkers such as Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson; Jefferson, in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1781), provided a detailed rebuttal of de Buffon from a scientific point of view. Hamilton also vigorously rebuked the idea in Federalist No. 11 (1787).

One critic, citing Raynal&#x27;s ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States.

Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific, America that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon&#x27;s ideas formed the root of a &quot;stratification of negative discourses&quot; that has recurred throughout the history of the two countries&#x27; relationship (and been matched by persistent Francophobia in the United States).

==== Culture ====
According to Brendan O&#x27;Connor, some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking &quot;taste, grace and civility,&quot; and having a brazen and arrogant character. British author Frances Trollope observed in her 1832 book &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot;, that the greatest difference between the English and Americans was &quot;want of refinement&quot;, explaining: &quot;that polish[,] which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature[,] is unknown and undreamed of&quot; in America. According to one source, her account &quot;succeeded in angering Americans more than any book written by a foreign observer before or since&quot;. English writer Captain Marryat&#x27;s critical account in his &quot;Diary in America, with Remarks on Its Institutions&quot; (1839) also proved controversial, especially in Detroit where an effigy of the author, along with his books, was burned. Other writers critical of American culture and manners included the bishop Talleyrand in France and Charles Dickens in England. Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1844) is a ferocious satire on American life.

Sources of American resentment are evident following the Revolutions of 1848 and the ensuing European class struggles. In 1869, after a visit to his country of birth, the Swedish immigrant, Hans Mattson observed that, &quot;...the ignorance, prejudice and hatred toward America and everything pertaining to it among the aristocracy, and especially the office holders, was as unpardonable as it was ridiculous. It was claimed by them that all was humbug in America, that it was the paradise of scoundrels, cheats, and rascals, and that nothing good could possibly come out of it.&quot; After seven years in the US, Ernst Skarstedt, a graduate of Lund University and native Swede, returned to Sweden in 1885. He complained that, in upper-class circles, if he &quot;told something about America, it could happen that in reply (he) was informed that this could not possibly be so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden.&quot; The dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886 solidified The &quot;New Colossus&quot; as a beacon to the &quot;huddled masses&quot; and their rejection of the &quot;storied pomp&quot; of the old world. 

Simon Schama observed in 2003: &quot;By the end of the nineteenth century, the stereotype of the ugly American – voracious, preachy, mercenary, and bombastically chauvinist – was firmly in place in Europe&quot;. O&#x27;Connor suggests that such prejudices were rooted in an idealized image of European refinement and that the notion of high European culture pitted against American vulgarity has not disappeared.

==== Politics and ideology ====
The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented: &quot;With the expression &quot;Bodenlosigkeit&quot; (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme&quot;. Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada nor Mexico. Lenau had immigrated to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the U.S. were the subject of a novel titled &quot;The America-exhaustion&quot; (&quot;Der Amerika-Müde&quot;) (1855) by fellow German Ferdinand Kürnberger.

The nature of American democracy was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked &quot;[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system,&quot; according to Judy Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure. The French Revolution, which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles. That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with slavery. &quot;How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?&quot; asked Samuel Johnson in 1775. He famously stated, that &quot;I am willing to love all mankind, except an American&quot;.

=== 20th century ===

==== Intellectuals ====

Sigmund Freud was vehemently anti-American. Historian Peter Gay says that in &quot;slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was ventilating some inner need&quot;. Gay suggests that Freud&#x27;s anti-Americanism was not really about the United States at all.

Numerous authors went on the attack. French writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine denounced the United States. German poet Rainer Marie Rilke wrote, &quot;I no longer love Paris, partly because it is disfiguring and Americanizing itself&quot;.

==== Communist critiques ====
Until its demise in 1991, the Soviet Union and other communist nations emphasized capitalism as the great enemy of communism, and identified the United States as the leader of capitalism. They sponsored anti-Americanism among followers and sympathizers. Russell A. Berman notes that in the mid-19th century, &quot;Marx himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century&quot;. O&#x27;Connor argues that, &quot;communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism – a coherent world view that challenged the free market, private property, limited government, and individualism&quot;.
The USA was and is heavily criticised by contemporary socialist nations and movements for imperialism, especially as a reaction to United States involvement in regime change. In the DPRK for example, Anti-Americanism comes not only from ideological opposition to the USA and its actions, but also as a result of allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War and bombing of North Korea.

Authors in the West, such as Bertolt Brecht and Jean-Paul Sartre criticized the U.S. and reached a large audience, especially on the left. In his &quot;Anti-Americanism&quot; (2003), French writer Jean François Revel argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from anti-capitalism, and this critique also comes from non-communist, totalitarian regimes.

America was criticised and denounced by Communists such as Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev during the Russian Civil War. Galiev particularly emphasised native genocide of America and the institution of slavery. American treatment of minority groups such as natives and African-Americans would go on to be a continued point of opposition and criticism to the USA throughout the 20th century.

The East German regime imposed an official anti-American ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools. Anyone who expressed support for the West would be investigated by the Stasi. The official line followed Lenin&#x27;s theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in Dimitrov&#x27;s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the &quot;terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street&quot;. East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the Americans. However, Western media outlets such as the American Radio Free Europe broadcasts, and West German media may have limited Anti-Americanism. The official communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock and roll.

==== Fascist critiques ====

Drawing on the ideas of Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), European fascists decried the supposed degenerating effect of immigration on the racial mix of the American population. The Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to racially pure nations.

Anti-Semitism was another factor in these critiques. The view that the U.S. was controlled by a Jewish conspiracy through a Jewish lobby was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during World War II. Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind supposed American plans for world domination, were also seen as using jazz in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions; Adolf Hitler dismissed the threat of the United States as a credible enemy of Germany because of its incoherent racial mix; he saw Americans as a &quot;mongrel race&quot;, &quot;half-Judaized&quot; and &quot;half-Negrified&quot;.

In an address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt:

In 1944, as war was basically lost, the SS published a virulent article in their weekly &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot; titled &quot;Danger of Americanism&quot; which criticized and characterized the American entertainment industry, as it was thought to be owned by the Jews: &quot;Americanism is a splendid method of depoliticization. The Jews have used jazz and movies, magazines and smut, gangsterism and free love, and every perverse desire, to keep the American people so distracted that they pay no attention to their own fate&quot;.

===== &quot;Liberators&quot; poster =====
The &quot;Liberators&quot; poster that was distributed by the Nazis to a Dutch audience in 1944 displays multiple elements of anti-American attitudes promoted by the Nazis. The title &quot;Liberators&quot; refers to a common Allied justification for attacking Germany (and possibly the American B-24 Liberator bombers as well), and the poster depicts this &quot;liberation&quot; as the destruction of European cities. The artist was Harald Damsleth, a Norwegian who worked for the NS in occupied Norway.
Motifs contained in this poster include:

* The decadence of beauty pageants (scantily-clad &quot;Miss America&quot; and &quot;Miss Victory&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Leg&quot;) – or more generally, the putative sexual laxness of American women. The &quot;Miss America&quot; beauty pageant in Atlantic City had expanded during the war and was used to sell war bonds.
* Gangsterism and gun violence (the arm of an escaped convict holding a submachine gun). Gangsterism had become a theme of anti-Americanism in the 1930s.
* Anti-black violence (a lynching noose, a Ku Klux Klan hood). The lynching of blacks had attracted European denunciations by the 1890s.
* General violence of American society, in addition to the above (boxing-glove which grasps the money-bag). The theme of a violent American frontier was well known in the 19th century.
* Americans as Indian savages and as a mockery of American genocide over Natives as well as land-theft, since it is a chieftain symbol here used as a fashion trinket. (&quot;Miss America&quot; wears plains-Indian head-dress).
* The capitalism, pure materialism and commercialism of America, to the detriment of any spirit or soul (money bag with &quot;$&quot; symbol). The materialism of America contrasted with the spiritual depth of European high culture is a common trope, especially in Scandinavia.
* Anti-semitism appears in most Nazi-generated images of America. A Jewish banker is seen behind the money.
* The presence of blacks in America equals its &quot;mongrelization&quot;, adding undesirably &quot;primitive&quot; elements to American popular culture, and constituting a potential danger to the white race (a stereotypically-caricatured black couple dancing the &quot;Jitterbug – Triumph of Civilization&quot; in birdcage, which is portrayed as a degraded animalistic ritual). The degradation of culture, especially through miscegenation, resonated with European anxieties, especially in Germany.
* Decadence of American popular culture, and its pernicious influence on the rest of the world (dancing of jitterbug, hand holds phonograph record, figure of a European gullible &quot;all-ears&quot; dupe in lower foreground). The growing popularity of American music and dancing among young people had ignited a &quot;moral panic&quot; among conservative Europeans.
* Indiscriminate U.S. military violence (bloodied bomb for foot, metal legs, military aircraft wings), threatening the European cultural landmarks at lower right.
** Hence the suggested falsity of American claims to be &quot;Liberators&quot; (the Liberator was also the name of a U.S. bomber plane).
* Nazis denounced American jingoism and war fervor (a business-suited arm literally &quot;beating the drum&quot; of militarism, &quot;Miss Victory&quot; and her drum-majorette cap and boots).
* The malevolent influence of American Freemasons (Masonic apron descending from drum) was a theme among conservative Catholics, as in Spain.
* Demonization of national symbols of the United States (&quot;Miss Victory&quot; waves the reverse side of 48-star U.S. flag, and the WW2-era Army Air Corps roundel – of small red disk within white star on large blue disk – is shown on one of the wings).

=== 21st century ===
==== September 11 attacks ====

In a book called &quot;The Rise of Anti-Americanism&quot;, published in 2006, Brendon O&#x27;Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the September 11 attacks were &quot;quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism&quot;. They ask, &quot;If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?&quot; Most leaders in Islamic countries, including Afghanistan, condemned the attacks. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that &quot;the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity&quot;.

Europe was highly sympathetic to the United States after the 9/11 attack. NATO unanimously supported the United States, treating an attack on the U.S. as an attack on all of them after Article 5 of the NATO treaty was invoked for the very first time. NATO and American troops entered Afghanistan. When the United States decided to invade and overthrow the Iraqi regime in 2003, it won some support in Europe, especially from the British government, but also intense opposition, led by the German and French governments. Konrad Jarausch argues that there was still fundamental agreement on such basic issues of support for democracy and human rights. However, there emerged a growing gap between an American &quot;libertarian, individualistic, market outlook, and the more statist, collectivist, welfare mentality in Europe.&quot;

==== U.S. computer technology ====
A growing dimension of anti-Americanism is fear of the pervasiveness of U.S. Internet technology. This can be traced from the very first computers which were either British (Colossus) or German (Z1) through to the World Wide Web itself (invented by Englishman Tim Berners-Lee). In all these cases the U.S. has commercialized all these innovations.

Americanization has advanced through widespread high speed Internet and smart phone technology since 2008 and a large fraction of the new apps and hardware were designed in the United States. In Europe, there is growing concern about excessive Americanization through Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Uber, among many other U.S. Internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants. There is fear that they are significantly evading taxes, and posting information that may violate European privacy laws. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2015 reported &quot;deep concerns in Europe&#x27;s highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies.&quot;

==== Mitigation of anti-Americanism ====
Sometimes developments help neutralize anti-Americanism. In 2015, the United States Department of Justice went on the attack against corruption at FIFA, arresting many top world soccer leaders long suspected of bribery and corruption. In this case the U.S. government&#x27;s self-defined role as &quot;policeman of the world&quot; won widespread international support.

==Regional anti-Americanism==
=== Europe ===
Recent polls has shown anti-Americanism in Europe to be increasing following the Iraq War and due to U.S policies in the recent years. Eurobarometer survey conducted among European Union countries revealed that Europeans view America as a higher risk to Global Peace than Iran and North Korea.

==== Eastern Europe ====

=====Russia=====

Russia has a long history of anti-Americanism, dating back to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. As early as in 1919, leader of Soviet Russia Vladimir Lenin was recorded addressing Red Army soldiers where he claimed that &quot;capitalists of England, France and America are waging war against Russia&quot;. The image of Uncle Sam was also used by the Bolsheviks to portray White Russian forces as foreign-sponsored.

In 2013, 30% of Russians had a &quot;very unfavorable&quot; or &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; view of Americans and 40% viewed the U.S. in a &quot;very unfavorable&quot; or &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; light, up from 34% in 2012. Recent polls from the Levada center survey show that 71% of Russians have at least a somewhat negative attitude toward the U.S., up from 38% in 2013. It is the largest figure since the collapse of the USSR. In 2015, a new poll by the Levada center showed that 81% of Russians now hold unfavorable views of the United States, presumably as a result of U.S. and international sanctions imposed against Russia because of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Anti-Americanism in Russia is reportedly at its highest since the end of the Cold War. A December 2017 survey conducted by the Chicago Council and its Russian partner, the Levada Center, showed that 78% of &quot;Russians polled said the United States meddles &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;a fair amount&quot; in Russian politics&quot;, only 24% of Russians say they hold a positive view of the United States, and 81% of &quot;Russians said they felt the United States was working to undermine Russia on the world stage.&quot;

Survey results published by the Levada-Center indicate that, as of August 2018, Russians increasingly viewed the United States positively following the Russia–U.S. summit in Helsinki in July 2018. &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; reported that &quot;For the first time since 2014, the number of Russians who said they had &quot;positive&quot; feelings towards the United States (42 percent) outweighed those who reported &quot;negative&quot; feelings (40 percent).&quot; In February 2020, 46% of Russians polled said they had a negative view of the United States. According to the Pew Research Center, &quot;57% of Russians ages 18 to 29 see the U.S. favorably, compared with only 15% of Russians ages 50 and older.&quot; In 2019, only 20% of Russians viewed U.S. President Donald Trump positively. Only 14% of Russians expressed net approval of Donald Trump&#x27;s policies.

====Western Europe====

In a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:
* Representations, images and stereotypes (from the birth of the Republic onwards)
* The challenge of economic power and the American model of modernization (principally from the 1910s and 1920s on)
* The organized projection of U.S. political, strategic and ideological power (from World War II on)
He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.

In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-9/11 unilateralism of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq fed deep-rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe. Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the specific policy decisions, that are decisive.

During the George W. Bush administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Project poll showed &quot;favorable opinions&quot; of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain. In Spain, unfavorable views of Americans rose from 30% in 2005 to 51% in 2006 and positive views of Americans dropped from 56% in 2005 to 37% in 2006.
In Europe in 2002, vandalism of American companies was reported in Athens, Zürich, Tbilisi, Moscow and elsewhere. In Venice, 8 to 10 masked individuals claiming to be anti-globalists attacked a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant.
In Athens, at the demonstrations commemorating the 17 November Uprising there was a march toward the U.S. embassy to emphasize the U.S. backing of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 attended by many people each year.

Ruth Hatlapa, a PhD candidate at the University of Augsburg, and Andrei S. Markovits, a professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan, describe President Obama&#x27;s image as that of an angel – or more precisely, a rock star – in Europe in contrast to Bush&#x27;s devilish image there; they argue, however, that &quot;Obamamania&quot; masks a deep-seated distrust and disdain of America.

=====France=====
In France, the term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; is often used in expressions of anti-Americanism or Anglophobia. French writers have also used it in more nuanced ways in discussions about French decline, especially as an alternative model to which France should aspire, how France should adjust to its two most prominent global competitors, and how it should deal with social and economic modernization.

The First Indochina War in Indochina and the Suez Crisis of 1956 caused dismay among the French right, which was already angered by the lack of American support during Dien Bien Phu in 1954. For the Socialists and Communists of the French left, it was the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism that were the sources of resentment. Much later, the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq affair further dirtied the previously favorable image. In 2008, 85% of the French people considered the American government and banks to be most liable for the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In her contribution to the book &quot;Anti-Americanisms in World Politics&quot; edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, Sophie Meunier wrote about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.

In 2013, 36% viewed the U.S. in a &quot;very unfavorable&quot; or &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; light.

Richard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American power and values. He wrote in 2013 that:

In October 2016, French President François Hollande said: &quot;When the (European) Commission goes after Google or digital giants which do not pay the taxes they should in Europe, America takes offence. And yet, they quite shamelessly demand 8 billion from BNP or 5 billion from Deutsche Bank.&quot; French bank BNP Paribas was fined in 2014 for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.

=====Germany=====
German naval planners in the 1890–1910 era denounced the Monroe Doctrine as a self-aggrandizing legal pretension to dominate the Western hemisphere. They were even more concerned with the possible American canal in Panama, because it would lead to full American hegemony in the Caribbean. The stakes were laid out in the German war aims proposed by the Navy in 1903: a &quot;firm position in the West Indies,&quot; a &quot;free hand in South America,&quot; and an official &quot;revocation of the Monroe Doctrine&quot; would provide a solid foundation for &quot;our trade to the West Indies, Central and South America.&quot;

During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the official government policy in East Germany, and dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti-Americanism was the common position on the left, but the majority praised America as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation. Germany&#x27;s refusal to support the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq was often seen as a manifestation of anti-Americanism. Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but re-emerged in the 21st century especially in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Merkel.

In the affair surrounding &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; journalist Claas Relotius, U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell wrote to the magazine complaining about an anti-American institutional bias (&quot;Anti-Amerikanismus&quot;) and asked for an independent investigation. Grenell wrote that &quot;These fake news stories largely focus on U.S. policies and certain segments of the American people.&quot;

German historian Darius Harwardt has noted that from 1980 onwards, the term has seen an increase in usage in German politics, for example to discredit those that wish to close American military bases in Germany.

===== Greece =====
Although the Greeks have generally held a favorable attitude towards America and still do today, with 56.5% holding a favorable view in 2013 and 63% in 2021, Donald Trump was highly unpopular in Greece, with 73% having no confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs. Joe Biden however is popular among the Greek public, with 67% having confidence in the American president.

=====Netherlands=====

Although the Dutch have generally held a favorable attitude toward America, there were negative currents in the aftermath of World War II as the Dutch blamed American policy as the reason why their colonies in Southeast Asia were able to gain independence. They credit their rescue from the Nazis in 1944–45 to the Canadian Army. Postwar attitudes continued the perennial ambiguity of anti-Americanism: the love-hate relationship, or willingness to adopt American cultural patterns while at the same time voicing criticism of them. In the 1960s, anti-Americanism revived largely in reaction against the Vietnam War. Its major early advocates were non-party-affiliated, left-wing students, journalists, and intellectuals. Dutch public opinion polls (1975–83) indicate a stable attitude toward the United States; only 10% of the people were deeply anti-American. The most strident rhetoric came from the left wing of Dutch politics and can largely be attributed to the consequences of Dutch participation in NATO.

=====United Kingdom=====
According to a Pew Global Attitudes Project poll, during the George W. Bush administration &quot;favorable opinions&quot; of America between 2000 and 2006 fell from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom.

News articles and blogs have discussed the negative experiences of Americans living in the United Kingdom.

Anti-American sentiment became more widespread in the United Kingdom following the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.

=====Ireland=====
Negative sentiment towards American tourists is implied to have risen around 2012 and 2014.

=====Spain=====

Anti-American sentiment is perceived to be deeply entrenched within elements of Spanish society, with several surveys conducted concerning the topic tending to back up that assertion. Spain ranks among the highest countries in terms of the level of anti-Americanism in Europe. According to a German Marshall Fund study, feelings towards the United States in Spain were among the least favourable in Europe, second only to Turkey. The sentiment has not only been historically a left-wing phenomenon, but the United States is viewed very negatively by right-wing factions in Spain as well.

=== Asia ===
Anti-Americanism in the Middle East and parts of Asia has substantially increased due to U.S sanctions and military involvement in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq worsening relations and public opinion. However East and South Asian countries like the Philippines, South Korea and India remains the most Pro-American countries. 

==== East Asia ====

=====China=====
China has a history of anti-Americanism beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which the U.S. helped in militarily suppressing.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, the U.S. provided economic and military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek government against the Japanese invasion. In particular, the &quot;China Hands&quot; (American diplomats known for their knowledge of China) also attempted to establish diplomatic contacts with Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist regime in their stronghold in Yan&#x27;an, with a goal of fostering unity between the Nationalists and Communists. However, relations soured after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the relocation of the Chiang government to Taiwan, together with the start of the Cold War and rise of McCarthyism in U.S. politics. The newly communist China and the U.S. fought a major undeclared war in Korea, 1950–53 and, as a result, President Harry S. Truman began advocating a policy of containment and sent the United States Seventh Fleet to deter a possible communist invasion of Taiwan. The U.S. signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan which lasted until 1979 and, during this period, the communist government in Beijing was not diplomatically recognized by the U.S. By 1950, virtually all American diplomatic staff had left mainland China, and one of Mao&#x27;s political goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to capitalism.

Mao initially ridiculed the U.S. as &quot;paper tiger&quot; occupiers of Taiwan, &quot;the enemy of the people of the world and has increasingly isolated itself&quot; and &quot;monopoly capitalist groups&quot;, and it was argued that Mao never intended friendly relations with the U.S. However, due to the Sino-Soviet split and increasing tension between China and the Soviet Union, US President Richard Nixon signaled a diplomatic rapprochement with communist China, and embarked on an official visit in 1972. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were eventually restored in 1979. After Mao&#x27;s death, Deng Xiaoping embarked on economic reforms, and hostility diminished sharply, while large-scale trade and investments, as well as cultural exchanges became major factors. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the U.S. placed economic and military sanctions upon China, although official diplomatic relations continued.
In 2013, 53% of Chinese respondents in a Pew survey had a &quot;very unfavorable&quot; or &quot;somewhat unfavorable&quot; view of the U.S. Relations improved slightly near the end of Obama&#x27;s term in 2016, with 44% of Chinese respondents expressing an unfavorable view of the U.S compared to 50% of respondents expressing a favorable view.

There has been a significant increase in anti-Americanism since U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war against China, with Chinese media airing Korean War films. In May 2019, &quot;Global Times&quot; said that &quot;the trade war with the U.S. at the moment reminds Chinese of military struggles between China and the U.S. during the Korean War.&quot;

=====Japan=====

In Japan, objections to the behavior and presence of American military personnel are sometimes reported as anti-Americanism, such as the 1995 Okinawa rape incident. , the ongoing U.S. military presence on Okinawa remained a contentious issue in Japan.

While protests have arisen because of specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments. Robert Hathaway, director of the Wilson Center&#x27;s Asia program, suggests: &quot;The growth of anti-American sentiment in both Japan and South Korea must be seen not simply as a response to American policies and actions, but as reflective of deeper domestic trends and developments within these Asian countries&quot;. In Japan, a variety of threads have contributed to anti-Americanism in the post-war era, including pacifism on the left, nationalism on the right, and opportunistic worries over American influence in Japanese economic life.

From the postwar until today, most conservatives, including the Liberal Democratic Party, have a pro-American view; there are &quot;anti-American conservative&quot; who are critical of this and seek to preserve Japan&#x27;s independent foreign policy or cultural values.

=====South Korea=====

Speaking to the Wilson Center, Katharine Moon notes that while the majority of South Koreans support the American alliance &quot;anti-Americanism also represents the collective venting of accumulated grievances that in many instances have lain hidden for decades&quot;. In the 1990s, scholars, policy makers, and the media noted that anti-Americanism was motivated by the rejection of authoritarianism and a resurgent nationalism, this nationalist anti-Americanism continued into the 2000s fueled by a number of incidents such as the IMF crisis. During the early 1990s, Western princess, prostitutes for American soldiers became a symbol of anti-American nationalism.

&quot;Dear American&quot; is an anti-American song sung by Psy. &quot;Fucking USA&quot; is an anti-American protest song written by South Korean singer and activist Yoon Min-suk. Strongly anti-U.S. foreign policy and anti-Bush, the song was written in 2002 at a time when, following the Apolo Ohno Olympic controversy and an incident in Yangju in which two Korean middle school students died after being struck by a U.S. Army vehicle, anti-American sentiment in South Korea reached high levels. However, by 2009, a majority of South Koreans were reported as having a favorable view of the United States. In 2014, 58% of South Koreans had a favorable view of the U.S., making South Korea one of the world&#x27;s most pro-American countries.

=====North Korea=====

Relations between North Korea and the United States have been hostile ever since the Korean War, and the former&#x27;s more recent development of nuclear weapons and long range missiles has further increased tension between the two nations. The United States currently maintains a military presence in South Korea, and President George W. Bush had previously described North Korea as part of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;.

In North Korea, July is the &quot;Month of Joint Anti-American Struggle,&quot; with festivities to denounce the U.S.

====Southeast Asia====
=====Philippines=====

Anti-American sentiment has existed in the Philippines, owing primarily to the Philippine–American War of more than 100 years ago, and the 1898–1946 period of US colonial rule. One of the country&#x27;s most recognizable patriotic hymns, (; ), written during the Philippine–American War, makes reference to &quot;the Anglo-Saxon … who with vile treason subjugates [the Fatherland]&quot;. The song then exhorts the invaded and later occupied nation to &quot;free [it]self from the traitor.&quot; Mojarro (2020) wrote that, during the US occupation, &quot;Filipino intellectuals and patriots fully rejected US tutelage of Philippine politics and the economy,&quot; adding that &quot;The Spanish language was understood then as a tool of cultural and political resistance.&quot; Manuel L. Quezon himself refused to learn English, having &quot;felt betrayed by the Americans whom [the Katipunan] considered allies against Spain&quot;.

Statesman and internationally renowned Hispanophone writer Claro Mayo Recto had once dared to oppose the national security interests of the US in the Philippines, such as when he campaigned against the US military bases in his country. During the 1957 presidential campaign, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted black propaganda operations to ensure his defeat, including the distribution of condoms with holes in them and marked with &quot;Courtesy of Claro M. Recto&quot; on the labels. The CIA is also suspected of involvement in his death by heart attack less than three years later. Recto, who had no known heart disease, met with two mysterious &quot;Caucasians&quot; wearing business suits before he died. US government documents later showed that a plan to murder Recto with a vial of poison was discussed by CIA Chief of Station Ralph Lovett and US Ambassador Admiral Raymond Spruance years earlier.

In October 2012, American ships were found dumping toxic wastes into Subic Bay, spurring anti-Americanism and setting the stage for multiple rallies. When U.S. president Barack Obama toured Asia, in mid to late April 2014 to visit Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, hundreds of Filipino protests demonstrated in Manila shouting anti-Obama slogans, with some even burning mock U.S. flags.

The controversial Visiting Forces Agreement adds further fuel to anti-American sentiment, especially among Philippine Muslims. US military personnel have also been tried and convicted for rapes and murders committed on Philippine soil against civilians. These service personnel would later either be freed by the justice system or receive a presidential pardon.

However, despite these incidents, a poll conducted in 2011 by the BBC found that 90% of Filipinos have a favorable view of the U.S., higher than the view of the U.S. in any other country. According to a Pew Research Center Poll released in 2014, 92% of Filipinos viewed the U.S. favorably, making the Philippines the most pro-American nation in the world. The election of Rodrigo Duterte in 2016, along with persistently high approval ratings thereafter, nevertheless herald a new era marked by neonationalism and a resurgent anti-Americanism founded on what had by then been long-unattended historical grievances.

====South Asia====

=====Afghanistan=====
Drone strikes have led to growing anti-Americanism.

=====Pakistan=====

Negative attitudes toward the U.S.&#x27;s influence on the world has risen in Pakistan as a result of U.S. drone attacks on the country introduced by George W. Bush and continued by Barack Obama. In a poll surveying opinions toward the United States, Pakistan scored as the most negatively aligned nation, jointly alongside Serbia.

====Middle East====
After World War I, admiration was expressed for American President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s promulgation of democracy, freedom and self-determination in the Fourteen Points and, during World War II, the high ideals of the Atlantic Charter received favorable notice. According to Tamim Ansary, in &quot;Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes&quot; (2009), early views of America were mostly positive in the Middle East and the Muslim World.

Just as they do elsewhere in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or the reiteration of certain policies by the U.S. government, in special its support for Israel in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War. In regards to 9/11, a Gallup poll noted that while most Muslims (93%) polled opposed the attacks, &#x27;radicals&#x27; (7%) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at U.S. policies. In effect, when targeting U.S. or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al-Qaeda included, have made reference to U.S. policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. For example, to explain the Khobar Towers bombing (in which 19 American airmen were killed), Bin Laden, although proven to have not committed the attack, named U.S. support for Israel in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the Qana massacre, as the reasons behind the attack.

Al-Qaeda also cited the U.S. sanctions on and bombing of Iraq in the Iraqi no-fly zones (1991–2003), which exacted a large toll in the Arab country&#x27;s civilian population, as a justification to kill Americans.

Although right-wing scholars (e.g. Paul Hollander) have given prominence to the role that religiosity, culture and backwardness play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn&#x27;t correlated with poverty, backwardness or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than &#x27;moderates&#x27;.

There is also, however, a cultural dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative groups in the Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, &quot;The America I Have Seen&quot; (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, &quot;They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire...&quot; He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: &quot;The American girl is well acquainted with her body&#x27;s seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it&quot;. He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American&#x27;s preferred music, and which &quot;was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ...&quot; Qutb&#x27;s writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes.

Qutb&#x27;s ideas influenced Osama bin Laden, an anti-American extremist from Saudi Arabia, who was the founder of the Jihadist organization Al-Qaeda. In conjunction with several other Islamic militant leaders, bin Laden issued two fatawa – in 1996 and then again in 1998 – that Muslims should kill military personnel and civilians of the United States until the United States government withdraw military forces from Islamic countries and withdraw support for Israel.

After the 1996 fatwa, entitled &quot;Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places&quot;, bin Laden was put on a criminal file by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under an American Civil War statute which forbids instigating violence and attempting to overthrow the U.S. government. He has also been indicted in United States federal court for his alleged involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya, and was on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On 14 January 2009, bin Laden vowed to continue the fight and open up new fronts against the U.S. on behalf of the Islamic world.

In 2002 and in mid-2004, Zogby International polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby&#x27;s 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004. Attitudes were virtually unchanged in Lebanon but improved slightly in the UAE, from 87% who said in 2002 that they disliked the United States to 73% in 2004. However, most of these countries mainly objected to foreign policies that they considered unfair.

=====Iran=====
The chant &quot;Death to America&quot; (Persian: مرگ بر آمریکا) has been in use in Iran since at least the Iranian revolution in 1979, along with other phrases often represented as anti-American. A 1953 coup which involved the CIA was cited as a grievance. State-sponsored murals characterized as anti-American dot the streets of Tehran. It has been suggested that under Ayatollah Khomeini anti-Americanism was little more than a way to distinguish between domestic supporters and detractors, and even the phrase &quot;Great Satan&quot; which has previously been associated with anti-Americanism, appears to now signify both the American and British governments.

The Iran hostage crisis that lasted from 1979 to 1981, in which fifty-two Americans were held hostage in Tehran for 444 days, was also a demonstration of anti-Americanism, one which considerably worsened mutual perceptions between the U.S. and Iran.

=====Jordan=====
Anti-Americanism is felt very strongly in Jordan and has been on the rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America&#x27;s closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is among the highest in the world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although 2017 data indicates negative attitudes towards the U.S. and American people have gone down to 82% and 61% respectively, rates of anti-Americanism in Jordan are still among the highest in the world.

=====Palestinian territories=====
In July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, a leader of the Jerusalem-based Hizb ut-Tahrir, called for the destruction of America, France, Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot;. He warned: &quot;We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt. Who do you think we are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar. All glory to Allah&quot;. Al-Hammouri also warned U.S. president Barack Obama that there is an impending rise of a united Muslim empire that will instill religious law on all of its subjects.

=====Saudi Arabia=====
In Saudi Arabia, anti-American sentiment was described as &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;at an all-time high&quot;.

According to the survey taken by the Saudi intelligence service of &quot;educated Saudis between the ages of 25 and 41&quot; taken shortly after the 9/11 attacks &quot;concluded that 95 percent&quot; of those surveyed supported Bin Laden&#x27;s cause. (Support for Bin Laden reportedly waned by 2006 and by then, the Saudi population become considerably more pro-American, after Al-Qaeda linked groups staged attacks inside Saudi Arabia.) The proposal at the Defense Policy Board to &#x27;take Saudi out of Arabia&#x27; was spread as the secret US plan for the kingdom.

=====Turkey=====
In 2009, during U.S. president Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Turkey, anti-American protestors held signs saying &quot;Obama, new president of the American imperialism that is the enemy of the world&#x27;s people, your hands are also bloody. Get out of our country.&quot; Protestors also shouted phrases such as &quot;Yankee go home&quot; and &quot;Obama go home&quot;. A 2017 Pew Research poll indicated that 67% of Turkish respondents held unfavourable views of Americans and 82% disapproved of the spread of American ideas and customs in their country; both percentages were the highest out of all the nations surveyed.

Anti-American sentiment in Turkey had existed since the mid-1940s. However, Anti-Americanism began to spread primarily in the 1950s due to views that America had begun to dominate Turkey and spread its cultural influence into the middle class.

Leftist figures such as Mehmet Ali Aybar, who would later become the Chairman of the Turkish Worker&#x27;s Party, opposed collaboration with the USA and Turkey, on the grounds that US economic aid would turn Turkey into an &quot;Anglo-Saxon satellite state&quot; as early as 1947. The Turkish revolutionary and Maoist İbrahim Kaypakkaya considered Turkey to be an American semi-colony. However, there were also growing Anti-American sentiments on the Turkish Right. Conservative newspapers such as Büyük Doğu and Kuvvet also held views that America would in the future meddle in Turkish domestic affairs. Anti-American sentiment spread among more of the public when a law was passed in Turkey that authorized only US officials, to exercise criminal jurisdiction over American personnel in cases where a criminal act had been committed. While this on its own did not lead to Anti-American sentiment spreading, it did mean that any incidents resulting from the actions of American personnel would have a considerable impact on popular views towards America. Such incidents often led to anger and resentment to American personnel and America by extension.

Anti-Americanism in Turkey saw a significant rise as a result of the Johnson Letter in the 1960s, which stated that the US was against an invasion of Cyprus, and stated that the USA would not come to the aid of Turkey if an invasion of Cyprus led to war with the Soviet Union. Many Turks saw the letter as tantamount to outright veto power over Turkish affairs by the USA.

=== The Americas ===
All the countries of North and South America (including Canada, the United States of America, and Latin American countries) are often referred to as &quot;The Americas&quot; in the Anglosphere. In the U.S. and most countries outside Latin America, the terms &quot;America&quot; and &quot;American&quot; typically refer only to the United States of America and its citizens respectively. In the 1890s Cuban writer José Martí in an essay, &quot;Our America,&quot; alludes to his objection to this usage.

====Latin America====
Anti-Americanism in Latin America has deep roots and is a key element of the concept of Latin American identity, &quot;specifically anti-U.S. expansionism and Catholic anti-Protestantism.&quot; An 1828 exchange between William Henry Harrison, the U.S. minister plenipotentiary rebuked President Simón Bolívar of Gran Colombia, saying &quot;... the strongest of all governments is that which is most free&quot;, calling on Bolívar to encourage the development of a democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote, &quot;The United States ... seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom&quot;, a phrase that achieved fame in Latin America.
The Spanish–American War of 1898, which escalated Cuba&#x27;s war of independence from Spain, turned the U.S. into a world power and made Cuba a protectorate of the United States via the Platt Amendment to the Cuban constitution and the 1903 Cuban–American Treaty of Relations. The U.S. action was consistent with the Big Stick ideology espoused by Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s corollary to the Monroe Doctrine that led to numerous interventions in Central America and the Caribbean, also prompted hatred of the U.S. in other regions of the Americas. A very influential formulation of Latin-American anti-Americanism, engendered by the 1898 war, was the Uruguayan journalist José Enrique Rodó&#x27;s essay &quot;Ariel&quot; (1900) in which the spiritual values of the South American Ariel are contrasted to the brutish mass-culture of the American Caliban. This essay had enormous influence throughout Spanish America in the 1910s and 1920s, and prompted resistance to what was seen as American cultural imperialism. Perceived racist attitudes of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants of the North toward the populations of Latin America also caused resentment.
The Student Reform that began in the Argentine University of Cordoba in 1918, boosted the idea of anti-imperialism throughout Latin America, and played a fundamental role for launching the concept that was to be developed over several generations. Already in 1920, the Federación Universitaria Argentina issued a manifesto entitled &quot;Denunciation of Imperialism&quot;.

Since the 1940s, U.S. relations with Argentina have been tense, when the U.S. feared the regime of General Peron was too close to Nazi Germany. In 1954, American support for the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état against the democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán fueled anti-Americanism in the region. This CIA-sponsored coup prompted a former president of that country, Juan José Arévalo to write a fable entitled &quot;The Shark and the Sardines&quot; (1961) in which a predatory shark (representing the United States) overawes the sardines of Latin America.

Vice-President Richard Nixon&#x27;s tour of South America in 1958 prompted a spectacular eruption of anti-Americanism. The tour became the focus of violent protests which climaxed in Caracas, Venezuela where Nixon was almost killed by a raging mob as his motorcade drove from the airport to the city. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower assembled troops at Guantanamo Bay and a fleet of battleships in the Caribbean to intervene to rescue Nixon if necessary.

Fidel Castro, the late revolutionary leader of Cuba, tried throughout his career to co-ordinate long-standing Latin American resentments against the USA through military and propagandist means. He was aided in this goal by the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961, planned and implemented by the American government against his regime. This disaster damaged American credibility in the Americas and gave a boost to its critics worldwide. According to Rubin and Rubin, Castro&#x27;s Second Declaration of Havana, in February 1962, &quot;constituted a declaration of war on the United States and the enshrinement of a new theory of anti-Americanism&quot;. Castro called America &quot;a vulture...feeding on humanity&quot;. The United States embargo against Cuba maintained resentment and Castro&#x27;s colleague, the famed revolutionary Che Guevara, expressed his hopes during the Vietnam War of &quot;creating a Second or a Third Vietnam&quot; in the Latin American region against the designs of what he believed to be U.S. imperialism.


Many subsequent U.S. interventions against countries in the region, including democracies, and support for military dictatorships solidified Latin American anti-Americanism. These include the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, the 1965–1966 occupation of the Dominican Republic, the 1971 Bolivian and 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;états, U.S. involvement in Argentina&#x27;s Dirty War, U.S. involvement in Operation Condor, the Salvadoran Civil War, the support of the Contras, the training of future military men, subsequently seen as war criminals, in the School of the Americas, the refusal to extradite convicted terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, and U.S. support for dictators such as Paraguayan Alfredo Stroessner, Haitian François Duvalier, and pre-1989 Panamanian Manuel Noriega.

Many Latin Americans perceived that neo-liberalism reforms were failures in the 1980s and 1990s and intensified their opposition to the Washington consensus. This led to a resurgence in support for Pan-Americanism, support for popular movements in the region, the nationalization of key industries and centralization of government. America&#x27;s tightening of the economic embargo on Cuba in 1996 and 2004 also caused resentment amongst Latin American leaders and prompted them to use the Rio Group and the Madrid-based Ibero-American Summits as meeting places rather than the United States-dominated OAS. This trend has been reinforced through the creation of a series of regional political bodies such as Unasur and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and a strong opposition to the materialization of the Washington-sponsored Free Trade Area of the Americas at the 2005 4th Summit of the Americas.

Polls compiled by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed in 2006 Argentine public opinion was quite negative regarding America&#x27;s role in the world. In 2007, 26% of Argentines had a favorable view of the American people, with 57% having an unfavorable view. Argentine public opinion of the United States and U.S. policies improved during the Obama administration, and was divided about evenly (42% to 41%) between those who viewed these favorably or unfavorably. The ratio remained stable by 2013, with 38% of Argentines having a favorable view and 40% having an unfavorable view.

Furthermore, the renewal of the concession for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador was met by considerable criticism, derision, and even doubt by the supporters of such an expansion. The near-war sparked by the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis was expressed by a high-level Ecuadorean military officer as being carried under American auspices. The officer said &quot;a large proportion of senior officers,&quot; share &quot;the conviction that the United States was an accomplice in the attack&quot; (launched by the Colombian military on a FARC camp in Ecuador, near the Colombian border). The Ecuadorean military retaliated by stating the 10-year lease on the base, which expired in November 2009, would not be renewed and that the U.S. military presence was expected to be scaled down starting three months before the expiration date.

=====Mexico=====
In the 1836 Texas Revolution, the Mexican province of Texas seceded from Mexico and nine years later, encouraged by the Monroe Doctrine and manifest destiny, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas - at its request, but against vehement opposition by Mexico, which refused to recognize the independence of Texas - and began their expansion into Western North America. Mexican anti-American sentiment was further inflamed by the resulting 1846–1848 Mexican–American War, in which Mexico lost more than half of its territory to the United States.

The Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao predicted in &quot;America in Danger&quot; (1856) that the loss of Texas and northern Mexico to &quot;the talons of the eagle&quot; was just a foretaste of an American bid for world domination. An early exponent of the concept of Latin America, Bilbao excluded Brazil and Paraguay from it, as well as Mexico, because &quot;Mexico lacked a real republican consciousness, precisely because of its complicated relationship with the United States.&quot; Interventions by the U.S. prompted a later ruler of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, to lament: &quot;Poor Mexico, so far from God, and so close to the United States&quot;. Mexico&#x27;s National Museum of Interventions, opened in 1981, is a testament to Mexico&#x27;s sense of grievance with the United States.

In Mexico during the regime of liberal Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911), policies favored foreign investment, especially American, who sought profits in agriculture, ranching, mining, industry, and infrastructure such as railroads. Their dominance in agriculture and their acquisition of vast tracts of land at the expense of Mexican small holders and indigenous communities was a cause for peasant mobilization in the Mexican Revolution (1910–20). The program of the Liberal Party of Mexico (1906), explicitly called for policies against foreign ownership in Mexico, with the slogan &quot;Mexico for the Mexicans.&quot; Land reform in Mexico in the postrevolutionary period had a major impact on these U.S. holdings, where many were expropriated.

=====Venezuela=====

Since the start of the Hugo Chávez administration, relations between Venezuela and the United States deteriorated markedly, as Chávez became highly critical of the U.S. foreign policy. Chávez was known for his anti-American rhetoric. In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Chávez said that Bush promoted &quot;a false democracy of the elite&quot; and a &quot;democracy of bombs&quot;. Chávez opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and also condemned the NATO–led military intervention in Libya, calling it an attempt by the West and the U.S. to control the oil in Libya.

In 2015, the Obama administration signed an executive order which imposed targeted sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials whom the White House argued were instrumental in human rights violations, persecution of political opponents and significant public corruption and said that the country posed an &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&quot; Nicolás Maduro responded to the sanctions in a couple of ways. He wrote an open letter in a full page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in March 2015, stating that Venezuelans were &quot;friends of the American people&quot; and called President Obama&#x27;s action of making targeted sanctions on the alleged human rights abusers a &quot;unilateral and aggressive measure&quot;. Examples of accusations of human rights abuses from the United States to Maduro&#x27;s government included the murder of Luis Manuel Díaz, a political activist, prior to legislative elections in Venezuela.

Maduro threatened to sue the United States over an executive order issued by the Obama Administration that declared Venezuela to be a threat to American security. He also planned to deliver 10 million signatures, denouncing the United States&#x27; decree declaring the situation in Venezuela an &quot;extraordinary threat to US national security&quot;. and ordered all schools in the country to hold an &quot;anti-imperialist day&quot; against the United States with the day&#x27;s activities including the &quot;collection of the signatures of the students, and teaching, administrative, maintenance and cooking personnel&quot;. Maduro further ordered state workers to apply their signatures in protest, with some workers reporting that firings of state workers occurred due to their rejection of signing the executive order protesting the &quot;Obama decree&quot;. There were also reports that members of Venezuelan armed forces and their families were ordered to sign against the United States decree.

==== Canada ====
Anti-Americanism in Canada is often considered unique. Historians like J. L. Granatstein argue that no other political community has sustained such a deeply entrenched tradition of anti-American sentiment, while Frank Underhill noted how Canada holds the &quot;world record as the oldest continuing anti-Americans,&quot; when speaking of its longevity. Political scientist Kim Richard Nossal highlights the role of the national myth pushed by Loyalist refugees who migrated north as a result of the American Revolution, who portrayed Canada as a community founded on a conscious rejection of the United States. Anti-American sentiment became more entrenched through generations of Canadian-U.S. disputes. 

Granatstein further asserts that Canadian anti-Americanism is unique, not only for its long history but also for its relatively benign nature compared to other regions. As Canadians are within U.S. television and radio broadcast range, their anti-American rhetoric is often shaped by public opinion rather than political elites. Consequently, anti-Americanism in English Canada tends to be defined by a desire to differentiate from Americans, with common caricatures often based on half-truths or truths lacking context, and which often reflected public opinion that exists in certain U.S. sectors as well. 

This benign form of anti-Americanism rarely leads to confrontation or calls for radical decoupling from the U.S. It is often restrained by shared culture, language, and heritage, manifesting instead as a sense of estrangement and mistrust or as an outlet for feelings of insecurity and hostility against the U.S. This sentiment tends to focus on the U.S. government and its policies rather than the American people. Canadians generally view Americans positively, but hold more negative opinions of U.S. leaders and policies.

Historian Bruce C. Daniels suggests that the long-standing dynamic between Canadians and Americans has fostered an &quot;invasion mentality&quot; in Canada, with Canadians initially viewing the U.S. as a military threat and later as an economic and cultural one. Modern Canadian anti-Americanism is rooted in a mix of tangible nationalistic concerns over American influence and encroachment and intangible negative evaluations of American society in contrast to Canadian values. Historian Reginald C. Stuart identified five types of Canadian anti-Americanism that arises from disagreements with the U.S., including policy, anti-unilateralism, ideological, nationalistic, and partisan. The latter is a political strategy Canadian politicians have used to rally support against perceived external threats.

The paradox of Canadian anti-Americanism lies in Canada&#x27;s simultaneous embrace of U.S. economic and cultural influence, and its persistent rejection of &quot;American republicanism&quot; as an &quot;inappropriate means of governance&quot; and viewing the U.S. as a threat to its identity and sovereignty. As Nossal argues, this creates a distinct form of anti-Americanism, different from European anti-American forms identified by James W. Ceaser, Paul Hollander, and Adam Garfinkle.

Anti-Americanism also varies across Canada. Anti-Americanism in French Canada aligns more with anti-Americanism in Europe as opposed to the forms found in English Canada. The degree of anti-Americanism also differs in Canada, with Lydia Miljan and Barry Cooper highlighting how the Loyalist heartland of southern Ontario embraced an anti-American &quot;garrison mentality&quot;, while the formative mythos of provinces like Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador place no significance to emotional anti-Americanism. 

=====History of anti-Americanism in Canada=====
Before the American Revolution, colonists in British America—including the Thirteen Colonies, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Rupert&#x27;s Land—and New France—including Canada, Acadia, and Louisiana—engaged in four major conflicts, culminating in the British conquest of New France in 1760. However, British America fragmented decades later after the Province of Quebec declined to send delegates to the Second Continental Congress, the American invasion of Quebec failed, and the United Colonies declared independence from the British Empire.

While Quebec and Nova Scotia&#x27;s inhabitants were primarily neutral, the influx of loyalist refugees from the war brought a population deeply loyal to the Crown and antagonistic to the American political regime that displaced them. This fostered a political community that rejected the American republic in favor of a constitutional monarchical system that evolved from 1774, laying the foundation for Canada&#x27;s unique constitutional evolution and distinct anti-Americanism not seen elsewhere in the international system.

Loyalists who sought refuge in Canada brought with them negative views of the new US republic, depicting it as a chaotic land of republican anarchy dominated by money, mob rule, and violence. This ideological opposition contributed to a national mythology that Canada was formed through the rejection of the American republic. Historians Norman Hillmer and Granatstein observed that the Loyalist population exhibited a &quot;fanatical&quot; determination to ensure Canada remained distinct from the US. While anti-Americanism in Canada from the mid-19th century to 1989 was largely economic, the loyalist narrative continues to influence Canadian views, with a 2005 Pew Research Center poll revealing Canadians were more likely than other Western respondents to describe Americans as violent and rude.

Until the mid-19th century, anti-Americanism in Canada stemmed from fears of US expansionism and its promotion of manifest destiny. The US Army&#x27;s actions in Upper Canada during the War of 1812 fuelled &quot;deep prejudice against the United States,&quot; in the colony after the conflict. The 1837–1838 rebellions, which involved pro-American elements and American volunteers, intensified these fears, leading to assaults on Americans in the Canadas. Anti-American sentiment during this period contributed to the union of the Province of Canada with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to form Canadian Confederation in 1867.

From the end of the Fenian Raids in 1871 to the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) in 1989, anti-Americanism in Canada was primarily driven by opposition to deeper economic integration with the US, as fears of military invasion had largely subsided. Granatstein argues that Canadian business interests, initially opposed to free trade, fuelled economic anti-Americanism until 1988. This sentiment played a pivotal role in the 1911 Canadian federal election, where Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s pro-free trade Liberals were defeated afer the Conservative Party stoked anti-American fears. This helped legitimizing economic anti-Americanism in Canadian politics until the 1980s. 

Economic anti-Americanism also spurred broader cultural anti-Americanism, as seen in the 1891 Canadian federal election. While the election focused explicitly on issues of free trade with the US, its underlying concerns, and the subsequent Conservative victory, reflected a wider rejection of American influence and an English Canada that to &quot;desperately wanted remain to British.&quot; Early 20th-century Canadian intellectuals like Harold Innis, Donald Creighton and George Grant criticized US values of progress, technology, and mass culture, contrasting them with Canada&#x27;s traditions of order and harmony. Cultural anti-Americanism also influenced Canadian English, as Canadians favoured the use of Briticisms over American lexicon especially during periods of heightened tension with the US, such as during the Vietnam War.

The political shift away from economic anti-Americanism came in the 1980s, as Canadian businesses began to support free trade, leading to CUSFTA. By the 1990s, economic anti-Americanism had largely faded, but Granatstein and Nossal argue that a milder form persists as an attenuated device that &quot;Canadians will employ to differentiate themselves from [the US]&quot;. This subdued anti-Americanism has been leveraged by politicians, particularly Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Liberal Party from 1993 to 2003, and to a lesser extent by Paul Martin. Its use was particular successful for the party in its constituencies in Ontario. 

John Herd Thompson and Stephen Randall have noted that anti-American sentiment continued to nourish Canadian identity into the early 21st century. However, Stuart argues that after the September 11 attacks, anti-Americanism in Canada diminished as &quot;non-Americanism&quot; became less central to the country&#x27;s identity and as Canadians&#x27; social and cultural outlooks continued to diverge from those of the US. 

A Fraser Institute study of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation coverage from 2001 to 2002 found it overwhelmingly critical of US policies and actions, suggesting it exacerbated anti-American sentiment. Anti-American sentiment on Canadian television was noted by US diplomats cables leaked in the 2008 US diplomatic cables leak, where they noted that although anti-American sentiment wasn&#x27;t a &quot;public diplomatic crisis,&quot; it was indicative of the &quot;insidious negative popular stereotyping&quot; the US increasingly faced in Canada.

Anti-American sentiment in Canada rose during the first presidency of Donald Trump. In 2017, Pew Research reported that 30% of Canadians viewed Americans negatively, and 58% opposed the spread of American ideas and customs. By 2018, dissatisfaction hit historic levels, with 56% expressing negative views of the US, spurred by Trump’s inflammatory comments and tariffs on Canada. This discontent led to organized boycotts of American goods and tourism. 

Anti-Americanism also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with isolated incidents of vandalism and harassment targeting Americans in Canada taking place in 2020.

On February 1, 2025, Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting Canada to announce retaliatory tariffs and product removals, triggering the 2025 United States trade war with Canada and Mexico. In the days that followed, Canadian fans at multiple sporting events featuring Canadian and American teams booed the American anthem in protest. A movement to boycott American goods emerged in Canada as a protest against the tariffs. Political scientist Guy Lachapelle observed that anti-American sentiment in Canada had surged in response but noted that the boycott was &quot;not so much against the United States, but more towards the American president.&quot;

==== Australia ====
Australian anti-Americanism has been attributed to an &quot;invasion mentality&quot; arising from the perceived threat of American commercial dominance. By the mid-20th century, concerns over American influence on Australian culture and identity further shaped this sentiment. Unlike the philosophical anti-Americanism counterparts in Western Europe, Australian anti-Americanism is rooted in apprehensions about American encroachment. 

Similar to other Anglophone countries, Australian anti-Americanism is mild and tempered by shared culture, language, and heritage; with the historian Bruce C. Daniels observing that Australians have experienced a complex mix of affection, affinity, annoyance, and anger toward American culture and power simultaneously. 

Anti-Americanism in Australia has often been shaped by specific U.S. administrations and policies, with opposition in the 1960s tied to the Vietnam War and in the early 2000s to U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy. Political scientist Ann Capling describes this as &quot;contingent&quot; anti-Americanism, akin to the &quot;rational anti-Americanism&quot; identified by sociologist Paul Hollander, where criticism is precipitated from U.S. actions perceived as harmful. It also extends to dissatisfaction with U.S. protectionist economic policies, amplified by Australia&#x27;s trade deficit and dissatisfaction with what Australians perceive as &quot;unfair&quot; American trade practices. 

=====History of anti-Americanism in Australia=====
Concerns over American economic influence in Australia emerged in the 1830s, driven by increased American whaling activity and the presence of a U.S. naval squadron along the Australian coastline in 1838. By the 1920s, growing American business activity sparked debates about the &quot;Americanization&quot; of Sydney and whether Australians could maintain a distinct identity from Americans. 

While American-Australian cooperation during World War II and its aftermath dampened anti-American sentiment, it resurfaced during the Vietnam War. Anti-Americanism in Australia were found across the political spectrum, from Anglophile conservatives to radical socialists, united from a shared fear of growing U.S. influence and economic suspicion. Though some attribute modern anti-Americanism to the Vietnam War and &quot;boorish&quot; American tourists in Australia, historian Bruce C. Daniels argues the backlash reflects pre-existing resentment, temporarily masked by earlier periods of cooperation.

The modern wave of protest literature against American influence in Australia began in the mid-1960s, driven by political economists on the far left. By 1970, anti-American discourse spread to moderates and even some conservatives. The &quot;radical left&quot; escalated its rhetoric against the Vietnam War, with groups like the Australian Union of Students endorsing the burning of U.S. flags on campuses. These sentiments also permeated the Australian Labor Party (ALP) as it strengthened ties with anti-Vietnam War groups. The ALP, emboldened by discontent over Australia&#x27;s Vietnam War involvement and growing U.S. economic influence, eventually adopted an anti-Vietnam War stance and opposed further American dominance.

Anti-Americanism within the ALP peaked when Gough Whitlam&#x27;s government came to power in 1972, although Whitlam tried to curb these factions. However, these elements gave rise to domestic partisan rhetoric that branded Whitlam as an &quot;anti-American radical socialist,&quot; despite being an &quot;amiable centrist.&quot; Anti-American sentiment surged briefly in 1975 when conspiracy theorists linked Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal in 1975 to CIA machinations. After the ALP’s defeat and return to opposition, anti-Americanism diminished within the party. Though some left-wing elements still held these views, these sentiments were opposed and stifled by ALP leaders like Bob Hawke. Anti-Americanism briefly resurfaced under Mark Latham from 2003 to 2005, but his fall and the discrediting of his anti-American positions marked the end of serious public anti-American sentiment in the ALP.

Australian public opinion on the U.S. soured in the early 2000s, fuelled by disillusionment with the U.S.-led Global War on Terror. According to Peter Costello, then treasurer of Australia, anti-American sentiment in Australia saw a boost in 2003, due to Australia&#x27;s participation in the U.S.-led Iraq War. Richard Alston, then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, claimed that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s coverage of the war exhibited anti-American bias, though three inquiries found no evidence of this. The perceived rise in anti-American sentiment was echoed by Rupert Murdoch, an Australian-born American media mogul and owner of News Corp, in 2006. 

While Australian opinion of the U.S. improved in the following years, a 2020 Lowy Institute poll revealed it reverted to 2006 levels due to the U.S.&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and Trump tariffs.

<text>Chaupar (IAST: &quot;caupaṛ&quot;), chopad or chaupad is a cross and circle board game very similar to pachisi, played in India. The board is made of wool or cloth, with wooden pawns and seven cowry shells to be used to determine each player&#x27;s move, although others distinguish chaupur from pachisi by the use of three four-sided long dice. Variations are played throughout India. It is similar in some ways to Pachisi, Parcheesi and Ludo. In most of the villages in India, this game is played by old people.

== History ==
Games similar to chaupar with difference in colour schemes along with dice have been identified from Iron Age, Painted grey ware period from Mathura. Pachisi is originated from chaupar. Chopat is claimed to be a variation of the game of dice played in the epic poem Mahabharata between Yudhishthira and Duryodhan.

=== Legends ===
There are famous stories amongst kings passed on from generation to generation about kings who played this magnificent game. One particular tale tells of a King who had 2 trained mice called &quot;Sundari and Mundari&quot;. This king would distract his opponent with details, stories and tales. He would then casually utter &quot;Sundari and Mundari&quot;; at this point the mice would come and move the pieces around without the opponent noticing.

== Set up ==
A chopat &#x27;board&#x27; is traditionally an embroidered cloth in the shape of a cross. Each arm of the cross is divided into three columns and each column is divided into eight squares. The “dice” are seven cowry shells. The “men” or pieces (Sogthi)are usually made of wood. Each player has four men, although variants exist using 8 men each.

== Playing style ==
This game is usually played in a bantering manner, and it is quite common for players to mock each other&#x27;s play just before the &quot;choris&quot; are thrown, or to attempt to distract their opponent by snorting, cracking knuckles, pretending to spit or making absurd noises to &quot;curse&quot; or spoil the opponent&#x27;s turn.

If any of the players does not have his &quot;thore&quot; (to have killed at least one pawn) by the end of the game, then that player is known to have lost with a &quot;bay-thoree&quot;, which is the most disgraceful form of losing.

== Basic rules ==
A maximum of four players play this game, each sitting in front of an arm of the cross. The centre of the cross is “ghar&quot; or &quot;home”.

The center column on each arm of the cross is the &quot;home column&quot; for each player&#x27;s men after they cross the flower motif. The starting point for each player is the flower motif on the column to the left of his home column.

Each player has to enter his four men into the game from the starting point. The men travel around the outer perimeter columns in an anti-clockwise direction. Before a player can bring any of his own men “home”, he has to knock out at least one man of another player. This is called a “tohd”. Only the player&#x27;s own men can enter the home column of each player. Once the men cross the flower motif, they are played by laying the pieces on their side to indicate they are in their final home stretch and are safe now from any further attack.

=== Cowry Shells ===

All seven cowry shells are used in each throw. In one version, scoring is as follows:
*All 7 facing down – 7 points
*1 facing up, 6 facing down – 10 points
*2 facing up, 5 facing down – 2 points
*3 facing up, 4 facing down – 3 points
*4 facing up, 3 facing down – 4 points
*5 facing up, 2 facing down – 25 points
*6 facing up, 1 facing down – 30 points
*All 7 facing up – 14 points

===Entering men===

To start, each player takes turns throwing the cowry shells. The player with the highest score starts first.

A player can only enter a man into the game if he has a “high” throw - 10, 25 or 30 points or higher. The starting point each player is the flower motif on the column to the left of his home column.

===Mid-game===
The men travel around the outer perimeter columns in an anti-clockwise direction from their starting flower motifs. For each high throw, a player gets an additional throw. If he has three consecutive high throws, they “burn” up - &quot;beli jaye&quot; and he loses a turn. If a player has multiple throws in a turn because of a “high” throw, he is allowed to move different men for each of the throws.

Once all four of his men have entered into play, any further throws of 10, 25 or 30 points by the player results in the granting of one additional step or point called “peghedu”. This is a bonus point. This peghedu (single step) may be used to move another man, separate from the man moved for the throw itself. At any point in the game, if a player has no men who can move the amount of a throw, that throw is forfeited.

If at any point our doublet is there and number 10 or 25 is to move then exact 10 or 25 will move with doublet not single single pawn will move 10 or 25.If at any point doublet is there and we have to move 1 extra number of 10 or 25 it will also move as doublet not single pawn.

===Safe Squares===
The squares with the flower motifs are “safe” squares (&quot;Cheere&quot;). Two opposing players’ men can both land on the same square with no harm to either. If two men of the same player rest on a single square, they are safe. Men of other players can move past this square on their turn although they cannot land there. There are a total of 8 safe squares.

===Knock Out===
Each player has to knock out at least one man of another player – do a “tohd” or &quot;hit&quot; - before he can bring any of his men home, Flower Motif of First strip players home arm. This is done by landing his man on any square other than one with a flower motif, occupied by a single man of his opponent. The knocked out man is taken out of play and has to be re-entered into the game the usual way.

===Counting Strategies===
Each arm of the cross has 17 squares for moving so:
#&quot;aanth ghar pacchees&quot; - move 8 for throw of 25 - count 8 squares forward and move to the corresponding square on the next arm of the cross. 
#&quot;tehr ghar trees&quot; - move 13 for throw of 30 - count 13 squares forward and move to the corresponding square on the next arm of the cross.

===Coming Home===

The home column for each player can only be entered by his men if he has already made at least one “tohd”. Once the men cross the flower motif, they are played by laying the pieces on their side to indicate they are in their final home stretch and are safe now from any further attack.

Each man enters the center cross “home” only with the exact number of steps. If the throw is higher than the required number of steps, and if it cannot be used by any other of his men still in play, that throw is forfeited.

===Winning===
The first player who brings all four of his men home is the winner. Play continues for second and third places until one last player has men remaining on the board.

== Playing notes ==
* Games can last anything from 30 minutes to many hours. Technically, a game can never end depending on the players. This is possible if players keep doing &quot;&quot;Alkhee&quot; ghaats&quot; moves.
* A player wins an extra turn if they roll the dice to 6, 12, 10 or &quot;8&quot; (25 square move).
* The pawns are not permitted to get out from the &quot;Charkoni&quot; (nest) square, but from the 10 or &quot;8&quot; (25 square move)
* Forfeiting the turn voluntarily is not allowed (unlike Pachisi).
* The game is either played by 2 opponents who sit opposite each other with 4 pawns each. or is played by 2 partners against another pair of 2 partners. The partners sit opposite each other. If either partner gets all his pawns up (achieves his side of objectives of the game), then that partner will miss his/her turn for 5 times and then will aid his partner thereafter. For example, if Partner A is using red pawns and Partner B is using yellow pawns. If partner B gets all his pawns up and misses 5 turns. This means that every turn that Partner A AND B play will be used to move the red pawns.
* When a pawn reaches the &#x27;top&#x27;; that pawn can be removed by the top voluntarily by playing a 10 or an &quot;8&quot;. This &quot;re-awakened&quot; (called an &quot;Alkhee&quot;) pawn can kill other pawns who have partnered up together on the same square or pawns on a safe square and can be awakened from any of the 4 houses. It will go up to the house from which it was awakened.
* Players cannot move their pawns past the safe square outside their house (to go into their house) unless they have killed at least one pawn. To gain their &quot;thore&quot;.
* It is not allowed to fix the cowry shells before throwing them. This is cheating and is known as &quot;Bandhana&quot;.
* The cowri shells are usually thrown in 3 styles: either by sliding them, throwing them in the air with one cowri placed on the index finger (which is thrown higher) or by spinning them in the hand.

<text>Andrew Barry Casson Gaze (born 24 July 1965) is an Australian former professional basketball player and coach. He played 22 seasons in the National Basketball League (NBL) with the Melbourne Tigers from 1984 to 2005, winning the league&#x27;s MVP award seven times and winning the scoring title 14 times. He also guided the Tigers to two NBL championships, in 1993 and 1997, and was named an All-NBL First Team member for a record 15 consecutive years. Gaze has been described as one of the greatest players Australia has ever produced.

Gaze led the senior Australian national team, the Boomers, to five Summer Olympic Games – including as the flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and he was also the Australian Team Captain. He was inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2005, after being appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 2002. In 2013, he joined his father, Lindsay, in the FIBA Hall of Fame, after being elected as a player, to become just the third Australian inductee. Two Australian basketball awards have been named in Gaze&#x27;s honour: the NBL MVP award is named the Andrew Gaze Trophy, and the Australian International Player of the Year award is named the Gaze Medal.

==Early life and family==

Gaze was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Lindsay and Margaret Gaze. He has an older sister, Janet. Gaze is also the nephew of former Australian Opals coach Tony Gaze and the cousin of Mark Gaze, who played 182 games in the NBL from 1983 to 1991 and represented Australia at the 1982 FIBA World Championship. He is also the second cousin of Canberra Capitals guard Kate Gaze, the daughter of Mark Gaze and former WNBL player Michelle O&#x27;Connor.

Gaze grew up at Albert Park Basketball Stadium, the home of the Victorian Basketball Association (VBA), with his father the general manager of the VBA at the time. After graduating from Albert Park College, Gaze pursued a professional basketball career and attended Victoria University in Melbourne.

==Playing career==
===NBL and college===
In 1984, Gaze joined the Melbourne Tigers of the National Basketball League as an 18-year-old. His first season with the Tigers saw him win the NBL Rookie of the Year Award after averaging an impressive 29.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.6 steals in 24 games. By 1986, he made his first All-NBL First Team selection. He would go on to earn first-team honours in 15 straight seasons (1986–2000). In the 1987 NBL season, Gaze set an NBL record for points per game in a season when he averaged 44.1 points. This was despite the Tigers finishing the season in last place with a 3–23 record. During the season, Gaze had a 60-point game (against the Newcastle Falcons) and another five 50-point games.

Following the 1988 NBL season, Gaze, who was spotted by talent scouts while playing for Australia at the 1988 Olympics, moved to the United States after being recruited to play college basketball for Seton Hall University. During the 1988–89 season, Gaze played in 38 games for the Seton Hall Pirates, averaging 13.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game. Gaze started every game in The Hall&#x27;s first-ever run to the NCAA Final Four, twice leading all Pirates scorers with 19 points in their Elite Eight win over UNLV and 20 points (highlighted by 4-from-9 shooting from 3) in the National Semifinal win against Duke. He completed his season at Seton Hall with an 80–79 overtime loss to the Michigan Wolverines in the NCAA Championship Game which was played in front of 39,187 fans at the Kingdome in Seattle, where he was heavily guarded and limited to only five field goal attempts, all from three-point range. After a year in New Jersey, Gaze returned to Australia and re-joined the Tigers for the 1989 NBL season. He missed the back-end of the 1990 NBL season due to a blood clot in his right shoulder.

Not known for being an outstanding athlete, Gaze&#x27;s heavy scoring in the NBL was due to exceptional shooting, including from three-point range. A crowd favourite to the Tigers faithful, Gaze was a front runner in the league&#x27;s resurgence during the 1990s, as he and American import Lanard Copeland combined to form a formidable backcourt and guided the Tigers to two championships in 1993 and 1997. Playing under his father with the Tigers, Gaze assured the team were perpetual finalists.

In his later years, Gaze still managed to score at a high clip for the Tigers, averaging over 19 points per game in each of his last four NBL seasons. Following the 2004–05 NBL season, Gaze announced his retirement from the NBL. In 20 seasons with the Tigers, he played a total of 612 games and recorded 18,908 points at an average of 30.9 points per game.

===Europe and NBA===
In addition to playing in the NBL, Gaze spent multiple seasons overseas during the 1990s. In 1991, Gaze became the first Australian male to play professionally in Europe, with Italian 2nd League club Udine. In a six-month stint in Italy, he averaged over 30 points per game. Despite his best efforts, the team finished the league last and was relegated to the 3rd division. In March 1994, Gaze returned to the United States and signed with the NBA&#x27;s Washington Bullets. In seven games for the Bullets during the 1993–94 NBA season, he averaged 3.1 points per game. In early 1995, he moved to Greece and played half a season for Greek League club Apollon Patras. He had another short stint in the NBA during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, this time with the San Antonio Spurs. He received very little court time for a stacked Spurs team that included guards Mario Elie, Avery Johnson, Antonio Daniels and Steve Kerr. He appeared in just 19 games for the Spurs during the regular season and was inactive for the entire playoff run, which saw the Spurs win their first NBA championship.

===National team===
On the international stage, Gaze forged his reputation as one of Australia&#x27;s finest products, appearing at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, as a 19-year-old. He led all scorers at the 1994 FIBA World Championship with 23.9 points per game, leading the Aussies to a fifth-place finish. In 2000, he became (jointly with American Teresa Edwards) the third basketball player to compete at five Olympics, after Puerto Rican Teófilo Cruz and Brazilian Oscar Schmidt. That year, Gaze was the flag bearer at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics, and he was also the Australian Team Captain. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he led the Boomers to their then best Olympic performance, a fourth-placed finish, with a 5–3 record.

Gaze also competed in four FIBA World Cups with the Boomers, as he played in more than 280 matches for Australia. Gaze is the second all-time career points scorer, behind only Brazil&#x27;s Oscar Schmidt, in Summer Olympic Games history, and he is third all-time in career points scored in FIBA World Cup history, after Schmidt and Argentina&#x27;s Luis Scola.

==Coaching career==
===Sydney Kings===
In April 2016, Gaze was appointed head coach of the Sydney Kings in the NBL. He served as coach for three seasons before stepping down in 2019.

===Melbourne Tigers===
In 2016 and 2017, Gaze served as head coach of the Melbourne Tigers men&#x27;s team in the SEABL.

On 4 February 2022, Gaze was announced as head coach of the Melbourne Tigers men&#x27;s team, now in the NBL1 South, for the 2022 NBL1 season. He returned as head coach for the 2023 season and the 2024 season.

===Indiana Pacers===
In 2017, Gaze joined the coaching staff of the Indiana Pacers for the Orlando Summer League.

==Personal life==
After retiring from playing professionally, Gaze became a media personality and an NBL commentator for Network Ten and Fox Sports. He later became a presenter on &quot;Bounce&quot; on Fox Footy. In 2006, he appeared in season five of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

Gaze and his wife Melinda have four children; Courtney, Phoebe, Annie and Mason. In 2014, he was named Australian Father of the Year by children&#x27;s charity &quot;The Shepherd Centre&quot;.

<doc id="283269" wikidata="Q1427393" url="?curid=283269" title="IBM Lotus Organizer">
<text>Lotus Organizer is a discontinued personal information manager (PIM). It was initially developed by Threadz, a small British software house, reaching version 3.0. Organizer was subsequently acquired by Lotus Development Corporation, for whom the package was a Windows-based replacement for Lotus Agenda. For several years it was the unquestioned market leader until it was gradually overtaken by Microsoft Outlook.

Organizer is notable for using the ″leather-bound personal organizer″ graphical metaphor for its user interface. It is often bundled within Lotus SmartSuite.

==Status==
On 14 May 2013, IBM announced the immediate &quot;withdrawal and discontinuance of support&quot; of Lotus SmartSuite, Lotus Organizer and Lotus 123.

Version 6.1 was the last version. It supported Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 10.

==Versions==

===Microsoft Windows===
Organizer was a part of Lotus SmartSuite, but was also sold as a single application. The latest releases of SmartSuite did not include the current version of Organizer; it was sold separately only.

Versions up to 2 were 16-bit programs. Later versions are 32-bit programs.

===IBM OS/2===
The first OS/2 version was released in 1998. Until then, the Windows 16-bit version had been used. The last version is 1.7 from 2001. Later revisions of SmartSuite did not upgrade Organizer, although some fixes have been made.

Organizer for OS/2 uses the .or4 file format. This means that it cannot exchange data files with the later Windows versions, other than by importing and exporting data.

The features and user interface for Organizer for OS/2 are similar to that of Organizer 97 for Windows. It lacks later improvements, such as importing and exporting vCard and iCalendar files, and synchronisation with PDAs.

===Mac OS===
Lotus Organizer 97 GS was released for classic Mac OS in 1997 with features similar to the Windows version, including integration with Lotus Notes calendars and address books.

<doc id="283329" wikidata="Q1081067" url="?curid=283329" title="Personal information management">
<text>Personal information management (PIM) is the study and implementation of the activities that people perform in order to acquire or create, store, organize, maintain, retrieve, and use informational items such as documents (paper-based and digital), web pages, and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks (work-related or not) and fulfill a person&#x27;s various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.); it is information management with intrapersonal scope. Personal knowledge management is by some definitions a subdomain.

One ideal of PIM is that people should always have the right information in the right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet their current need. Technologies and tools can help so that people spend less time with time-consuming and error-prone clerical activities of PIM (such as looking for and organising information). But tools and technologies can also overwhelm people with too much information leading to information overload.

A special focus of PIM concerns how people organize and maintain personal information collections, and methods that can help people in doing so. People may manage information in a variety of settings, for a variety of reasons, and with a variety of types of information. For example, a traditional office worker might manage physical documents in a filing cabinet by placing them in hanging folders organized alphabetically by project name. More recently, this office worker might organize digital documents into the virtual folders of a local, computer-based file system or into a cloud-based store using a file hosting service (e.g., Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive). People manage information in many more private, personal contexts as well. A parent may, for example, collect and organize photographs of their children into a photo album which might be paper-based or digital.

PIM considers not only the methods used to store and organize information, but also is concerned with how people retrieve information from their collections for re-use. For example, the office worker might re-locate a physical document by remembering the name of the project and then finding the appropriate folder by an alphabetical search. On a computer system with a hierarchical file system, a person might need to remember the top-level folder in which a document is located, and then browse through the folder contents to navigate to the desired document. Email systems often support additional methods for re-finding such as fielded search (e.g., search by sender, subject, date). The characteristics of the document types, the data that can be used to describe them (meta-data), and features of the systems used to store and organize them (e.g. fielded search) are all components that may influence how users accomplish personal information management.

==Overview==
The purview of PIM is broad. A person&#x27;s perception of and ability to effect change in the world is determined, constrained, and sometimes greatly extended, by an ability to receive, send and otherwise manage information.

=== Senses in which information is personal ===
Research in the field of personal information management has considered six senses in which information can be personal (to &quot;me&quot;) and so an object of that person&#x27;s PIM activities: 
# Owned by &quot;me&quot;, e.g., paper documents in a home office, emails on a personal account, files on a personal computer or in the personal store of a Web cloud service. Preservation of this information especially for the longer-term and for legacy raises issues of personal archiving. The increasing digitization of personal information raises issues of digital preservation.
# About &quot;me&quot;. This refers especially to information (sometimes referred to as personal data) kept by others such as credit records, health records, search history, etc. Such information can greatly impact a person&#x27;s reputation, treatment and ability to get things done and raises major issues of privacy.
# Directed toward &quot;me&quot;, e.g., e-mails, phone calls, drop-ins, TV ads, web ads, pop-ups and including, even, self-interruptions (e.g., interrupting a work task to check a sports score). The management of incoming information raises issues of attention management: It can sometimes have critical importance but at other times, it can distract and derail a person&#x27;s efforts to get things done. Information filtering systems have the potential to increase the relevance to the person of incoming information but at the potential cost of reinforcing a person&#x27;s prejudices and preconceived notions or of filtering out information that the person should experience.
# Sent/Posted by &quot;me&quot;, e.g., sent e-mails, personal websites, blog posts, social media posts, published reports and articles. Information provided by a person – deliberately and inadvertently – can prove decisive in the impressions that others form of this person. 
# Experienced by &quot;me&quot;, e.g., Web history, photos (taken by others as well as by &quot;me&quot;), journal entries, full-motion videos from head-mounted cameras and other efforts to lifelog. The increasing use of tools that keep a time-stamped record of a person&#x27;s activities and bodily states either explicitly (e.g., Fitbit or the Apple Watch) or implicitly (e.g., through Web page browsing, emails and texts) has given rise to notions of a quantified self. 
# Relevant to &quot;me&quot;—a catch-all category that includes information of potential relevance to a person e.g., information a person does not know about but ought to know about. Recommender systems, which learn a person&#x27;s preferences either from explicit ratings or, implicitly, from a person&#x27;s past selections, have the potential to make a person aware of information the person might not otherwise know about or think to search for. More conventionally, a person&#x27;s network of friends, family and colleagues can provide a means for the person to incidentally encounter information of relevance.

=== Personal space of information and personal information collections ===

An encyclopaedic review of PIM literature suggests that all six senses of personal information listed above and the tools and technologies used to work with such information (from email applications and word processors to personal information managers and virtual assistants) combine to form a &quot;personal space of information&quot; (PSI, pronounced as in the Greek letter, alternately referred to as a &quot;personal information space&quot;) that is unique for each individual. Within a person&#x27;s PSI are &quot;personal information collections&quot; (PICs) or, simply, collections. Examples include:

* photos, digital or paper-based, possibly as organized into albums, virtual or physical; 
* digital documents organized into folders and subfolders
* emails, organized into email folders or, possibly, left in an ever larger inbox;
* paper documents relating to personal finances and possessions, as organized into the hanging folders of a traditional vertical filing cabinet.
* digital songs as organized through application such as iTunes.

=== Activities ===
Activities of PIM – i.e., the actions people take to manage information that is personal to them in one or more of the ways listed above – can be seen as an effort to establish, use, and maintain a mapping between information and need.

Two activities of PIM occur repeatedly throughout a person&#x27;s day and are often prompted by external events.
* Activities to find (and re-find) move from a current need toward information to meet this need. If a person is asked by a colleague &quot;When is the staff meeting?&quot;, for example, the person may meet the need (to answer accurately) by checking in a calendar of scheduled events.
* Activities to keep move from encountered information toward anticipated need. A person may, for example, receive an email (information encountered) and flag (an act of keeping) as &quot;high priority&quot; or &quot;read later&quot; depending upon the message&#x27;s assessed importance.

Meta-level activities focus more broadly on aspects of the mapping itself. 
* Activities to maintain and organize focus on personal information collections such as a person&#x27;s inbox, photo collection, or the digital documents in a personal file system. Included are efforts to delete or archive information that is out-of-date or no longer used, efforts to update file formats, and efforts to create backups of information to secure against loss. Also included are efforts to create an organizing structure in support of keeping and re-finding.
* Activities to manage privacy and the flow of information include, for example, decisions concerning privacy settings in a social media application such as Facebook and efforts to manage email subscriptions and efforts to filter incoming email (e.g., by marking some as &quot;junk&quot; or &quot;spam&quot;).
* Activities to measure and evaluate include efforts to assess the time effectiveness of a practice of PIM e.g., &quot;Am I spending too much time in email?&quot;; &quot;Is this folder structure worth the trouble it takes to maintain?&quot;
* Activities to make sense of and use information focus on the decisions to make and the actions to take for a collection of information, once gathered. For example, among the choices available in new automobiles (new laptops, new employees, etc.), which will best meet a person&#x27;s needs? Or what is the overall picture of health that emerges from all the data kept by a fitness tracker?

PIM activities overlap with one another. For example, the effort to keep an email attachment as a document in a personal file system may prompt an activity to organize the file system e.g., by creating a new folder for the document. Similarly, activities to organize may be prompted by a person&#x27;s efforts to find a document as when, for example, a person discovers that two folders have overlapping content and should be consolidated.

Meta-level activities overlap not only with finding and keeping activities but, even more so, with each other. For example, efforts to re-organize a personal file system can be motivated by the evaluation that the current file organization is too time-consuming to maintain and doesn&#x27;t properly highlight the information most in need of attention.

=== Information items, forms, and fragmentation ===
Information sent and received takes many different information forms in accordance with a growing list of communication modes, supporting tools, and people&#x27;s customs, habits, and expectations. People still send paper-based letters, birthday cards, and thank you notes. But increasingly, people communicate using digital forms of information including emails, digital documents shared (as attachments or via a file hosting service such as Dropbox), blog posts and social media updates (e.g., using a service such as Facebook), text messages and links, text, photos, and videos shared via services such as Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, and Instagram.

People work with information items as packages of information with properties that vary depending upon the information form involved. Files, emails, &quot;tweets&quot;, Facebook updates, blog posts, etc. are each examples of the information item. The ways in which an information item can be manipulated depend upon its underlying form. Items can be created but not always deleted (completely). Most items can be copied, sent and transformed as in, for example, when a digital photo is taken of a paper document (transforming from paper to digital) and then possibly further transformed as when optical character recognition is used to extract text from the digital photo, and then transformed yet again when this information is sent to others via a text message.

Information fragmentation is a key problem of PIM often made worse by the many information forms a person must work with. Information is scattered widely across information forms on different devices, in different formats, in different organizations, with different supporting tools.

Information fragmentation creates problems for each kind of PIM activity. Where to keep new information? Where to look for (re-find) information already kept? Meta-level activities, such as maintaining and organizing, are also more difficult and time-consuming when different stores on different devices must be separately maintained. Problems of information fragmentation are especially manifest when a person must look across multiple devices and applications to gather together the information needed to complete a project.

== History and background ==
PIM is a new field with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for information preservation. As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the vertical filing cabinet, now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.

With the increasing availability of computers in the 1950s came an interest in the computer as a source of metaphors and a test bed for efforts to understand the human ability to process information and to solve problems. Newell and Simon pioneered the computer&#x27;s use as a tool to model human thought. They produced &quot;The Logic Theorist&quot;, generally thought to be the first running artificial intelligence (AI) program. The computer of the 1950s was also an inspiration for the development of an information processing approach to human behavior and performance.

After the 1950s research showed that the computer, as a symbol processor, could &quot;think&quot; (to varying degrees of fidelity) like people do, the 1960s saw an increasing interest in the use of the computer to help people to think better and to process information more effectively. Working with Andries van Dam and others, Ted Nelson, who coined the word &quot;hypertext&quot;, developed one of the first hypertext systems, The Hypertext Editing System, in 1968. That same year, Douglas Engelbart also completed work on a hypertext system called NLS (oN-Line System). Engelbart advanced the notion that the computer could be used to augment the human intellect. As heralded by the publication of Ulric Neisser&#x27;s book &quot;Cognitive Psychology&quot;, the 1960s also saw the emergence of cognitive psychology as a discipline that focused primarily on a better understanding of the human ability to think, learn, and remember.

The computer as aid to the individual, rather than remote number cruncher in a refrigerated room, gained further validity from work in the late 1970s and through the 1980s to produce personal computers of increasing power and portability. These trends continue: computational power roughly equivalent to that of a desktop computer of a decade ago can now be found in devices that fit into the palm of a hand.
The phrase &quot;Personal Information Management&quot; was itself apparently first used in the 1980s in the midst of general excitement over the potential of the personal computer to greatly enhance the human ability to process and manage information. The 1980s also saw the advent of so-called &quot;PIM tools&quot; that provided limited support for the management of such things as appointments and scheduling, to-do lists, phone numbers, and addresses. A community dedicated to the study and improvement of human–computer interaction also emerged in the 1980s.

As befits the &quot;information&quot; focus of PIM, PIM-relevant research of the 1980s and 1990s extended beyond the study of a particular device or application towards larger ecosystems of information management to include, for example, the organization of the physical office and the management of paperwork. Malone characterized personal organization strategies as &#x27;neat&#x27; or &#x27;messy&#x27; and described &#x27;filing&#x27; and &#x27;piling&#x27; approaches to the organization of information. Other studies showed that people vary their methods for keeping information according to anticipated uses of that information in the future. Studies explored the practical implications that human memory research might carry in the design of, for example, personal filing systems, and information retrieval systems. Studies demonstrated a preference for navigation (browsing, &quot;location-based finding) in the return to personal files, a preference that endures today notwithstanding significant improvements in search support. and an increasing use of search as the preferred method of return to e-mails.

PIM, as a contemporary field of inquiry with a self-identified community of researchers, traces its origins to a Special Interest Group (SIG) session on PIM at the CHI 2004 conference and to a special National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop held in Seattle in 2005.

== Research ==
Much PIM research can be grouped according to the PIM activity that is the primary focus of the research. These activities are reflected in the two main models of PIM, i.e., that primary PIM activities are finding/re-finding, keeping and meta-level activities (see section Activities of PIM) or, alternatively, keeping, managing, and exploiting. Important research is also being done under the special topics: Personality, mood, and emotion both as impacting and impacted by a person&#x27;s practice of PIM, the management of personal health information and the management of personal information over the long run and for legacy.

===Finding/re-finding===
Throughout a typical day, people repeatedly experience the need for information in large amounts and small (e.g., &quot;When is my next meeting?&quot;; &quot;What&#x27;s the status of the budget forecast?&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s in the news today?&quot;) prompting activities to find and re-find.

A large body of research in information seeking, information behavior, and information retrieval relates and especially to efforts to find information in public spaces such as the Web or a traditional library. There is a strong personal component even in efforts to find new information, never before experienced, from a public store such as the Web. For example, efforts to find information may be directed by a personally created outline, self-addressed email reminder or a to-do list. In addition, information inside a person&#x27;s PSI can be used to support a more targeted, personalized search of the web.

A person&#x27;s efforts to find useful information are often a sequence of interactions rather than a single transaction. Under a &quot;berry picking&quot; model of finding, information is gathered in bits and pieces through a series of interactions, and during this time, a person&#x27;s expression of need, as reflected in the current query, evolves. People may favor stepwise approach to finding needed information to preserve a greater sense of control and context over the finding process and smaller steps may also reduce the cognitive burden associated with query formulation. In some cases, there simply is not a &quot;direct&quot; way to access the information. For example, a person&#x27;s remembrance for a needed Web site may only be through an email message sent by a colleague i.e., a person may not recall a Web address nor even keywords that might get be used in a Web search but the person does recall that the Web site was mentioned recently in an email from a colleague).

People may find (rather than re-find) information even when this information is ostensibly under their control. For example, items may be &quot;pushed&quot; into the PSI (e.g., via the inbox, podcast subscriptions, downloads). If these items are discovered later, it is through an act of finding not re-finding (since the person has no remembrance for the information).

Lansdale characterized the retrieval of information as a two-step process involving interplay between actions to &quot;recall&quot; and &quot;recognize&quot;. The steps of recall and recognition can iterate to progressively narrow the efforts to find the desired information. This interplay happens, for example, when people move through a folder hierarchy to a desired file or e-mail message or navigate through a website to a desired page.

But re-finding begins first with another step: &quot;Remember&quot; to look in the first place. People may take the trouble to create Web bookmarks or to file away documents and then forget about this information so that, in worst case, the original effort is wasted.

Also, finding/re-finding often means not just assembling a single item of information but rather a set of information. The person may need to &quot;repeat&quot; the finding sequence several times. A challenge in tool support is to provide people with ways to group or interrelate information items so that their chances improve of retrieving a complete set of the information needed to complete a task.

Over the years, PIM studies have determined that people prefer to return to personal information, most notably the information kept in personal digital files, by navigating rather than searching.

Support for searching personal information has improved dramatically over the years most notably in the provision for full-text indexing to improve search speed. With these improvements, preference may be shifting to search as a primary means for locating email messages (e.g., search on subject or sender, for messages not in view).

However, a preference persists for navigation as the primary means of re-finding personal files (e.g., stepwise folder traversal; scanning a list of files within a folder for the desired file), notwithstanding ongoing improvements in search support. The enduring preference for navigation as a primary means of return to files may have a neurological basis i.e., navigation to files appears to use mental facilities similar to those people use to navigate in the physical world.

Preference for navigation is also in line with a primacy effect repeatedly observed in psychological research such that preferred method of return aligns with initial exposure. Under a &quot;first impressions&quot; hypothesis, if a person&#x27;s initial experience with a file included its placement in a folder, where the folder itself was reached by navigating through a hierarchy of containing folders, then the person will prefer a similar method – navigation – for return to the file later.

There have been some prototyping efforts to explore an in-context creation e.g., creation in the context of a project the person is working on, of not only files, but also other forms of information such as web references and email. Prototyping efforts have also explored ways to improve support for navigation e.g., by highlighting and otherwise making it easier to follow, the paths people are more likely to take in their navigation back to a file.

===Keeping===
Many events of daily life are roughly the converse of finding events: People encounter information and try to determine what, if anything, they should do with this information, i.e., people must match the information encountered to current or anticipated needs. Decisions and actions relating to encountered information are collectively referred to as keeping activities.

The ability to effectively handle information that is encountered by happenstance is essential to a person&#x27;s ability to discover new material and make new connections. People also keep information that they have actively sought but do not have time to process currently. A search on the web, for example, often produces much more information than can be consumed in the current session. Both the decision to keep this information for later use and the steps to do so are keeping activities.

Keeping activities are also triggered when people are interrupted during a current task and look for ways of preserving the current state so that work can be quickly resumed later. People keep appointments by entering reminders into a calendar and keep good ideas or &quot;things to pick up at the grocery store&quot; by writing down a few cryptic lines on a loose piece of paper. People keep not only to ensure they have the information later, but also to build reminders to look for and use this information. Failure to remember to use information later is one kind of prospective memory failure. In order to avoid such a failure, people may, for example, self-e-mail a web page reference in addition to or instead of making a bookmark because the e-mail message with the reference appears in the inbox where it is more likely to be noticed and used.

The keeping decision can be characterized as a signal detection task subject to errors of two kinds: 1) an incorrect rejection (&quot;miss&quot;) when information is ignored that later is needed and should have been kept (e.g., proof of charitable donations needed now to file a tax return) and 2) a false positive when information kept as useful (incorrectly judged as &quot;signal&quot;) turns out not to be used later. Information kept and never used only adds to the clutter – digital and physical – in a person&#x27;s life.

Keeping can be a difficult and error prone effort. Filing i.e., placing information items such as paper documents, digital documents and emails, into folders, can be especially so. To avoid, or delay filing information (e.g., until more is known concerning where the information might be used), people may opt to put information in &quot;piles&quot; instead. (Digital counterparts to physical piling include leaving information in the email inbox or placing digital documents and web links into a holding folder such as &quot;stuff to look at later&quot;.) But information kept in a pile, physical or virtual, is easily forgotten as the pile fades into a background of clutter and research indicates that a typical person&#x27;s ability to keep track of different piles, by location alone, is limited.

Tagging provides another alternative to filing information items into folders. A strict folder hierarchy does not readily allow for the flexible classification of information even though, in a person&#x27;s mind, an information item might fit in several different categories. A number of tag-related prototypes for PIM have been developed over the years. A tagging approach has also been pursued in commercial systems, most notably Gmail (as &quot;labels&quot;), but the success of tags so far is mixed. Bergman et al. found that users, when provided with options to use folders or tags, preferred folders to tags and, even when using tags, they typically refrained from adding more than a single tag per information item. Civan et al., through an engagement of participants in critical, comparative observation of both tagging and the use of folders were able to elicit some limitations of tagging not previously discussed openly such as, for example, that once a person decides to use multiple tags, it is usually important to continue doing so (else the tag not applied consistently becomes ineffective as a means of retrieving a complete set of items).

Technologies may help to reduce the costs, in personal time and effort, of keeping and the likelihood of error. For example, the ability to take a digital photo of a sign, billboard announcement or the page of a paper document can obviate the task of otherwise transcribing (or photocopying) the information.

A person&#x27;s ongoing use of a smartphone through the day can create a time-stamped record of events as a kind of automated keeping and especially of information &quot;experienced by me&quot; (see section, &quot;The senses in which information is personal&quot;) with potential use in a person&#x27;s efforts to journal or to return to information previously experienced (&quot;I think I read the email while in the taxi on the way to the airport...&quot;). Activity tracking technology can further enrich the record of a person&#x27;s daily activity with tremendous potential use for people to enrich their understanding of their daily lives and the healthiness of their diet and their activities.

Technologies to automate the keeping of personal information segue to personal informatics and the quantified self movement, life logging, in the extreme, a &#x27;total capture&quot; of information. Tracking technologies raise serious issues of privacy (see &quot;Managing privacy and the flow of information&quot;). Additional questions arise concerning the utility and even the practical accessibility of &quot;total capture&quot;.

===Maintaining and organizing===
Activities of finding and, especially, keeping can segue into activities to maintain and organize as when, for example, efforts to keep a document in the file system prompt the creation of a new folder or efforts to re-find a document highlight the need to consolidate two folders with overlapping content and purpose.

Differences between people are especially apparent in their approaches to the maintenance and organization of information. Malone distinguished between &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;messy&quot; organizations of paper documents. &quot;Messy&quot; people had more piles in their offices and appeared to invest less effort than &quot;neat&quot; people in filing information. Comparable differences have been observed in the ways people organize digital documents, emails, and web references.

Activities of keeping correlate with activities of organizing so that, for example, people with more elaborate folder structures tend to file information more often and sooner. However, people may be selective in the information forms for which they invest efforts to organize. The schoolteachers who participated in one study, for example, reported having regular &quot;spring cleaning&quot; habits for organization and maintenance of paper documents but no comparable habits for digital information.

Activities of organization (e.g., creating and naming folders) segue into activities of maintenance such as consolidating redundant folders, archiving information no longer in active use, and ensuring that information is properly backed up and otherwise secured. (See also section, &quot;Managing privacy and the flow of information&quot;).

Studies of people&#x27;s folder organizations for digital information indicate that these have uses going far beyond the organization of files for later retrieval. Folders are information in their own right – representing, for example, a person&#x27;s evolving understanding of a project and its components. A folder hierarchy can sometimes represent an informal problem decomposition with a parent folder representing a project and subfolders representing major components of the project (e.g., &quot;wedding reception&quot; and &quot;church service&quot; for a &quot;wedding&quot; project).

However, people generally struggle to keep their information organized and often do not have reliable backup routines. People have trouble maintaining and organizing many distinct forms of information (e.g., digital documents, emails, and web references) and are sometimes observed to make special efforts to consolidate different information forms into a single organization.

With ever increasing stores of personal digital information, people face challenges of digital curation for which they are not prepared. At the same time, these stores offer their owners the opportunity, with the right training and tool support, for &quot;exploitation&quot; of their information in new, useful ways.

Empirical observations of PIM studies motivate prototyping efforts towards information tools to provide better support for the maintenance, organization and, going further, curation of personal information. For example, GrayArea applies the demotion principle of the user-subjective approach to allow people to move less frequently used files in any given folder to a gray area at the bottom end of the listing of this folder. These files can still be accessed but are less visible and so less distracting of a person&#x27;s attention.

The Planz prototype supports an in-context creation and integration of project-related files, emails, web references, informal notes and other forms of information into a simplified, document-like interface meant to represent the project with headings corresponding to folders in the personal file system and subheadings (for tasks, sub-projects, or other project components) corresponding to subfolders. The intention is that a single, useful organization should emerge incidentally as people focus on the planning and completion of their projects.

=== Managing privacy and the flow of information ===
People face a continual evaluation of tradeoffs in deciding what information &quot;flows&quot; into and out of their PSI. Each interaction poses some degree of risk to privacy and security. Letting out information to the wrong recipients can lead to identity theft. Letting in the wrong kind of information can mean that a person&#x27;s devices are &quot;infected&quot; and the person&#x27;s data is corrupted or &quot;locked&quot; for ransom. By some estimates, 30% or more of the computers in the United States are infected. 
However, the exchange of information, incoming and outgoing, is an essential part of living in the modern world. To order goods and services online, people must be prepared to &quot;let out&quot; their credit card information. To try out a potentially useful, new information tool, people may need to &quot;let in&quot; a download that could potentially make unwelcome changes to the web browser or the desktop. Providing for adequate control over the information, coming into and out of a PSI, is a major challenge. Even more challenging is the user interface to make clear the implications for various privacy choices particularly regarding Internet privacy. What, for example, are the personal information privacy implications of clicking the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button for use of social media services such as Facebook.

=== Measuring and evaluating ===
People seek to understand how they might improve various aspects of their PIM practices with questions such as &quot;Do I really need to keep all this information?&quot;; &quot;Is this tool (application, applet, device) worth the troubles (time, frustration) of its use?&quot; and, perhaps most persistent, &quot;Where did the day go? Where has the time gone? What did I accomplish?&quot;. These last questions may often be voiced in reflection, perhaps on the commute home from work at the end of the workday. 
But there is increasing reason to expect that answers will be based on more than remembrance and reflection. Increasingly data incidentally, automatically captured over the course of a person&#x27;s day and the person&#x27;s interactions with various information tools to work with various forms of information (files, emails, texts, pictures, etc.) can be brought to bear in evaluations of a person&#x27;s PIM practice and the identification of possible ways to improve.

=== Making sense of and using information ===
Efforts to make sense of information represent another set of meta-level activity that operate on personal information and the mapping between information and need. People must often assemble and analyze a larger collection of information to decide what to do next. &quot;Which job applicant is most likely to work best for us?&quot;, &quot;Which retirement plan to choose?&quot;, &quot;What should we pack for our trip?&quot;. These and many other decisions are generally based not on a single information item but on a collection of information items – documents, emails (e.g., with advice or impressions from friends and colleagues), web references, etc.
Making sense of information is &quot;meta&quot; not only for its broader focus on information collections but also because it permeates most PIM activity even when the primary purpose may ostensibly be something else. For example, as people organize information into folders, ostensibly to ensure its subsequent retrieval, people may also be making sense and coming to a deeper understanding of this information.

===Personality, mood, and emotion===
Personality and mood can impact a person&#x27;s practice of PIM and, in turn, a person&#x27;s emotions can be impacted by the person&#x27;s practice of PIM.

In particular, personality traits (e.g., &quot;conscientiousness&quot; or &quot;neuroticism&quot;) have, in certain circumstances, been shown to correlate with the extent to which a person keeps and organizes information into a personal archive such as a personal filing system. However, another recent study found personality traits were not correlated with any aspects of personal filing systems, suggesting that PIM practices are influenced less by personality than by external factors such as the operating system used (i.e. Mac OS or Windows), which were seen to be much more predictive.

Aside from the correlation between practices of PIM and more enduring personality traits, there is evidence to indicate that a person&#x27;s (more changeable) mood impacts activities of PIM so that, for example, a person experiencing negative moods, when organizing personal information, is more likely to create a structure with more folders where folders, on average, contain fewer files.

Conversely, the information a person keeps or routinely encounters (e.g., via social media), can profoundly impact a person&#x27;s mood. Even as explorations continue into the potential for the automatic, incidental capture of information (see section Keeping) there is growing awareness for the need to design for forgetting as well as for remembrance as, for example, when a person realizes the need to dispose of digital belongings in the aftermath of a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one.

Beyond the negative feelings induced by information associated with a failed relationship, people experience negative feelings about their PIM practices, per se. People are shown in general to experience anxiety and dissatisfaction with respect to their personal information archives including both concerns of possible loss of the information and also express concerns about their ability and effectiveness in managing and organizing their information.

===Management of personal health information===
Traditional, personal health information resides in various information systems in healthcare institutions (e.g., clinics, hospitals, insurance providers), often in the form of medical records. People often have difficulty managing or even navigating a variety of paper or electronic medical records across multiple health services in different specializations and institutions. Also referred to as personal health records, this type of personal health information usually requires people (i.e., patients) to engage in additional PIM finding activities to locate and gain access to health information and then to generate a comprehensible summary for their own use.

With the rise of consumer-facing health products including activity trackers and health-related mobile apps, people are able to access new types of personal health data (e.g., physical activity, heart rate) outside healthcare institutions. PIM behavior also changes. Much of the effort to keep information is automated. But people may experience difficulties making sense of a using the information later, e.g., to plan future physical activities based on activity tracker data. People are also frequently engaged in other meta-level activities, such as maintaining and organizing (e.g., syncing data across different health-related mobile apps).

== Methods and methodologies of PIM study and tool design ==
The purpose of PIM study is both descriptive and prescriptive. PIM research seeks to understand what people do now and the problems they encounter i.e., in the management of information and the use of information tools. This understanding is useful on its own but should also have application to understand what might be done in techniques, training and, especially, tool design to improve a person&#x27;s practice of PIM.

The nature of PIM makes its study challenging. The techniques and preferred methods of a person&#x27;s PIM practice can vary considerably with information form (e.g., files vs. emails) and over time. The operating system and the default file manager are also shown to impact PIM practices especially in the management of files. A person&#x27;s practice is also observed to vary in significant ways with gender, age and current life circumstances. Certainly, differences among people on different sides of the so-called &quot;digital divide&quot; will have profound impact on PIM practices. And, as noted in section &quot;Personality, mood, and emotion&quot;, personality traits and even a person&#x27;s current mood can impact PIM behavior.

For research results to generalize, or else to be properly qualified, PIM research, at least in aggregate, should include the study of people, with a diversity of backgrounds and needs, over time as they work in many different situations, with different forms of information and different tools of information management.

At the same time, PIM research, at least in initial exploratory phases, must often be done in situ (e.g., in a person&#x27;s workplace or office or at least where people have access to their laptops, smartphones and other devices of information management) so that people can be observed as they manage information that is &quot;personal&quot; to them (see section &quot;The senses in which information is personal&quot;). Exploratory methods are demanding in the time of both observer and participant and can also be intrusive for the participants. Consequently, the number and nature of participants is likely to be limited i.e., participants may often be people &quot;close at hand&quot; to the observer as family, friends, colleagues or other members of the observer&#x27;s community.

For example, the &quot;guided tour&quot;, in which the participant is asked to give an interviewer a &quot;tour&quot; of the participant&#x27;s various information collections (e.g., files, emails, Web bookmarks, digital photographs, paper documents, etc.), has proven a very useful, but expensive method of study with results bound by caveats reflecting the typically small number and narrow sampling of participants.

The guided tour method is one of several methods that are excellent for exploratory work but expensive and impractical to do with a larger, more diverse sampling of people. Other exploratory methods include the use of think aloud protocols collected, for example, as a participant completes a keeping or finding task, and the experience sampling method wherein participants report on their PIM actions and experiences over time possibly as prompted (e.g., by a beep or a text on a smartphone).

A challenge is to combine, within or across studies, time-consuming (and often demographically biased) methods of exploratory observation with other methods that have broader, more economical reach. The exploratory methods bring out interesting patterns; the follow-on methods add in numbers and diversity of participants. Among these methods are:
* Surveys that can potentially reach a large and diverse audience. 
* The automated gathering of data on collections in a PSI e.g., for a personal file system to measure number of folders, depth, and average number of files per folder. 
* The increasing use of activity tracking technology and the nearly round-the-clock use of smartphones creates new opportunities to gather PIM-relevant data with minimal time and trouble (but, of course, with participant permission).

Another method using the Delphi technique for achieving consensus has been used to leverage the expertise and experience of PIM researchers as means of extending, indirectly, the number and diversity of PIM practices represented.

The purview of PIM tool design applies to virtually any tool people use to work with their information including &quot;sticky notes&quot; and hanging folders for paper-based information to a wide range of computer-based applications for the management of digital information, ranging from applications people use every day such as Web browsers, email applications and texting applications to personal information managers.

With respect to methods for the evaluation of alternatives in PIM tools design, PIM researchers again face an &quot;in situ&quot; challenge. How to evaluate an alternative, as nearly as possible, in the working context of a person&#x27;s PSI? One &quot;let it lie&quot; approach would provide for interfaces between the tool under evaluation and a participant&#x27;s PSI so that the tool can work with a participant&#x27;s other tools and the participant&#x27;s personal information (as opposed to working in a separate environment with &quot;test&quot; data). Dropbox and other file hosting services exemplify this approach: Users can continue to work with their files and folders locally on their computers through the file manager even as an installed applet works to seamlessly synchronize the users files and folders with a Web store for the added benefits of a backup and options to synchronize this information with other devices and share this information with other users.

As what is better described as a methodology of tool design rather than a method, Bergman reports good success in the application of a . The user-subjective approach advances three design principles. In brief, the design should allow the following: 1) all project-related items no matter their form (or format) are to be organized together (the subjective project classification principle); 2) the importance of information (to the user) should determine its visual salience and accessibility (the subjective importance principle); and 3) information should be retrieved and used by the user in the same context as it was previously used in (the subjective context principle). The approach may suggest design principles that serve not only in evaluating and improving existing systems but also in creating new implementations. For example, according to the demotion principle, information items of lower subjective importance should be demoted (i.e., by making them less visible) so as not to distract the user but be kept within their original context just in case they are needed. The principle has been applied in the creation of several interesting prototypes.

Finally, a simple &quot;checklist&quot; methodology of tool design&quot;, follows from an assessment of a proposed tool design with respect to each of the six senses in which information can be personal (see section &quot;The senses in which information is personal&quot;) and each of the six activities of PIM (finding, keeping and the four meta-level activities, see section &quot;Activities of PIM&quot;). A tool that is good with respect to one kind of personal information or one PIM activity, may be bad with respect to another. For example, a new smartphone app that promises to deliver information potentially &quot;relevant to me&quot; (the &quot;6th sense&quot; in which information is personal) may do so only at the cost of a distracting increase in the information &quot;directed to me&quot; and by keeping too much personal information &quot;about me&quot; in a place not under the person&#x27;s control.

== Related activities and areas ==
PIM is a practical meeting ground for many disciplines including cognitive psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction (HCI), human information interaction (HII), library and information science (LIS), artificial intelligence (AI), information retrieval, information behavior, organizational information management, and information science.

===Cognitive psychology and cognitive science===
Cognitive psychology, as the study of how people learn and remember, problem solve, and make decisions, necessarily also includes the study of how people make smart use of available information. The related field of cognitive science, in its efforts to apply these questions more broadly to the study and simulation of intelligent behavior, is also related to PIM. (Cognitive science, in turn, has significant overlap with the field of artificial intelligence).

There is great potential for a mutually beneficial interplay between cognitive science and PIM. Sub-areas of cognitive science of clear relevance to PIM include problem solving and decision making. For example, folders created to hold information for a big project such as &quot;plan my wedding&quot; may sometimes resemble a problem-decomposition. To take another example, the signal detection task has long been used to frame and explain human behavior and has recently been used as a basis for analyzing our choices concerning what information to keep and how – a key activity of PIM. Similarly, there is interplay between the psychological study of categorization and concept formation and the PIM study of how people use tags and folders to describe and organize their information.

Now large portions of a document may be the product of &quot;copy-and-paste&quot; operations (from our previous writings) rather than a product of original writing. Certainly, management of text pieces pasted for re-use is a PIM activity, and this raises several interesting questions. How do we go about deciding when to re-use and when to write from scratch? We may sometimes spend more time chasing down a paragraph we have previously written than it would have taken to simply write a new paragraph expressing the same thoughts. Beyond this, we can wonder at what point a reliance on an increasing (and increasingly available) supply of previously written material begins to impact our creativity.

As people do PIM they work in an external environment that includes other people, available technology, and, often, an organizational setting. This means that situated cognition, distributed cognition, and social cognition all relate to the study of PIM.

=== Human–computer and human–information interaction ===
The study of PIM is also related to the field of human–computer interaction (HCI). Some of the more influential papers on PIM over the years have been published in HCI journals and conference proceedings. However, the &quot;I&quot; in PIM is for information – in various forms, paper-based and digital (e.g., books, digital documents, emails and, even, the letter magnets on a refrigerator in the kitchen). The &quot;I&quot; in HCI stands for &quot;interaction&quot; as this relates to the &quot;C&quot; – computers. (An argument has been advanced that HCI should be focused more on information rather than computers.)

===Group information management===
Group information management (GIM, usually pronounced with a soft &quot;G&quot;) has been written about elsewhere in the context of PIM. The study of GIM, in turn, has clear relevance to the study of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). GIM is to CSCW as PIM is to HCI. Just as concerns of PIM substantially overlap with but are not fully subsumed by concerns of HCI (nor vice versa), concerns of GIM overlap with but are not subsumed by concerns of CSCW. Information in support of GIM activities can be in non-digital forms such as paper calendars and bulletin boards that do not involve computers.

Group and social considerations frequently enter into a person&#x27;s PIM strategy. For example, one member of a household may agree to manage medical information for everyone in the household (e.g., shot records) while another member of the household manages financial information for the household. But the collaborative organization and sharing of information is often difficult because, for example, the people working together in a group may have many different perspectives on how best to organize information.

In larger organizational settings, the GIM goals of the organization may conflict with the PIM goals of individuals working within the organization, where the goals of different individuals may also conflict. Individuals may, for example, keep copies of secure documents on their private laptops for the sake of convenience even though doing so violates group (organizational) security. Given drawbacks—real or perceived—in the use of web services that support a shared use of folders, people working in a group may opt to share information instead through the use of e-mail attachments.

=== Data, information, and knowledge management ===
Concerns of data management relate to PIM especially with respect to the safe, secure, long-term preservation of personal information in digital form. The study of information management and knowledge management in organizations also relates to the study of PIM and issues seen first at an organizational level often migrate to the PIM domain.

Concerns of knowledge management on a personal (vs. organizational) level have given rise to arguments for a field of personal knowledge management (PKM). However, knowledge is not a &quot;thing&quot; to be managed directly but rather indirectly e.g., through items of information such as Web pages, emails and paper documents. PKM is best regarded as a useful subset of PIM with special focus on important issues that might otherwise be overlooked such as self-directed efforts of knowledge elicitation (&quot;What do I know? What have I learned?&quot;) and knowledge instillation (&quot;how better to learn what it is I want to know?&quot;)

=== Time and task management ===
Both time management and task management on a personal level make heavy use of information tools and external forms of information such as to-do lists, calendars, timelines, and email exchange. These are another form of information to be managed. Over the years, email, in particular, has been used in an ad hoc manner in support of task management.

=== Personal network management ===
Much of the useful information a person receives comes, often unprompted, through a person&#x27;s network of family, friends and colleagues. People reciprocate and much of the information a person sends to others reflects an attempt to build relationships and influence the behavior of others. As such, personal network management (PNM) is a crucial aspect of PIM and can be understood as the practice of managing the links and connections to other people for social and professional benefits.

<doc id="283402" wikidata="Q4395003" url="?curid=283402" title="Richmond District, San Francisco">
<text>The Richmond District is a neighborhood in the northwest corner of San Francisco, California, developed initially in the late 19th century. It is sometimes confused with the city of Richmond, which is northeast of San Francisco; accordingly, the neighborhood usually is referred to as &quot;the Richmond.&quot;

The Richmond is bordered by Golden Gate Park on the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and Lincoln Park, Mountain Lake Park and the Presidio of San Francisco to the north, bisected by the Presidio Greenbelt.

==Name==
The neighborhood was given its name by Australian immigrant and art dealer George Turner Marsh, one of the neighborhood&#x27;s earliest residents, who called his home &quot;the Richmond House&quot; after Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. In 1917, the district was legally named &quot;Park-Presidio District&quot;, chosen to avoid confusion between the district and the city of Richmond right across the bay. In spite of the official change, San Franciscans continued to use the old name.

The name Park-Presidio remained on the books until January 2009, when newly elected Supervisor Eric Mar introduced legislation that officially renamed the area north of Golden Gate Park and west of Arguello Boulevard the Richmond District.

==History==

The Richmond District, originally an expanse of rolling sand dunes called Outside Lands, was developed initially in the late 19th century. Before this development, the Yelamu Tribe of the Ohlone Nation frequented the coastal sites of the current day district and had a village where the development would take place. In the later 18th century, they were not able to use this land anymore after Spanish explorers arrived and began setting up missions with the intent of converting and displacing the Ohlone people. Adolph Sutro was one of the first large-scale developers of the area. After purchasing the Cliff House in the early 1880s, he built the Sutro Baths on the western end, near Ocean Beach.
After the 1906 earthquake, development increased with the need to provide replacement housing. The last of the sand dunes and coastal scrub that once dominated the area were built over to create a streetcar suburb.

The Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war brought many Anti-Communist White Russian, Orthodox Russian refugees and immigrants into the neighborhood. Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia briefly made its headquarters at Holy Virgin Cathedral on Geary Boulevard.

In the 1950s, and especially after the lifting of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965, Chinese immigrants began to replace the ethnic Jewish and Irish-Americans who had dominated the district before World War II. Chinese of birth or descent now make up nearly the half of residents in the Richmond.

==Location==

Located directly north of Golden Gate Park, &quot;the Richmond&quot; is bounded roughly by Fulton Street to the south, Arguello Boulevard and Laurel Heights to the east, The Presidio, Lincoln Park, and Sea Cliff to the north, and Ocean Beach to the west. The western portion, &quot;Outer Richmond&quot;, and the eastern portion, &quot;Inner Richmond&quot;, are divided by a major thoroughfare, Park Presidio Boulevard (California State Route 1). Geary Boulevard is a major east–west thoroughfare that runs through the Richmond and to downtown. Technically, the Farallon Islands, about 30 miles to the west of mainland San Francisco, are also part of the Richmond District.

The Richmond is easy to access by the 38R (Rapid) or 38 bus, which is around a 35 minutes bus ride from downtown running on a red bus lane. It is around a 15 minutes walk to GG Park taking the 38 bus. The 5 bus goes on Fulton to get to Golden Gate Park directly. The 31 bus runs on Balboa, the 2 bus runs on Clement, and 1 bus runs on California.

==Sub-neighborhoods==
The Richmond has been popularly divided into four parts:

Lake Street is just south of Presidio of San Francisco and north of Inner Richmond. It is an affluent area characterized by its many Victorian/Edwardian mansions. Its boundaries are: the Presidio to the north, Arguello Blvd to the east, California St. to the south, and 25th Ave. to the west. Its name is derived from its proximity to Mountain Lake, one of the few remaining natural lakes in San Francisco, and Lake Street, the neighborhood&#x27;s northernmost east–west artery. Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza ended his second northward expedition at the lake, stopping for two days in 1776. While here he located a site for the Spanish presidio that was later built. A plaque was placed in September 1957 near the point where he stayed.

Inner Richmond sits south of Lake Street. Its boundaries are: California St. to the north, Arguello Blvd to the east, Fulton St. to the south, and Park Presidio Blvd. to the west. The hub of the Inner Richmond is Geary Blvd &amp; Clement St, which are particularly known for Chinese, Thai, Korean, Burmese, and Russian cuisine. The Inner Richmond is a diverse area with sizable Chinese and Russian populations.

Central Richmond is between Inner Richmond (to the east) and Outer Richmond (to the west). It is bounded by Park Presidio Blvd to the east, California St. to the north, Fulton St. to the south, and 32nd Ave. to the west. Its hub is on Geary Blvd. (between Park Presidio Blvd. to 28th Avenue). Within Central Richmond, in the area around Geary between about 17th Ave and 27th Ave, is sometimes called Little Russia.

Outer Richmond is to the west of the Central Richmond. It is bounded by Clement St. to the north, 32nd Ave. to the east, Fulton St. to the south, and Ocean Beach to the west. It borders the Ocean Beach and the Cliff House, currently operating as a restaurant. Lincoln Manor is a small enclave of larger homes within the Outer Richmond. It includes a vibrant merchant corridor on the western portion of Balboa St. from approximately 32nd Ave. to 42nd Ave. called Balboa Village.

==Streets==
The Richmond District and the neighboring Sunset District (on the south side of Golden Gate Park) are often collectively known as &quot;The Avenues&quot;, because a majority of both neighborhoods are spanned by numbered north–south avenues. When the city was originally laid out, the avenues were numbered from 1st to 49th and the east–west streets were lettered A to X. In 1909, to reduce confusion for mail carriers, the east–west streets and 1st Avenue and 49th Avenue were renamed. The east–west streets were named after Spanish explorers in ascending alphabetical order in a southward direction. First Avenue was renamed Arguello Boulevard and 49th Avenue was renamed La Playa Street.

Today, the first numbered avenue is 2nd Avenue, starting one block west of Arguello Boulevard, and the last is 48th Avenue near Ocean Beach. The avenue numbers increase incrementally, with the exception that what would be 13th Avenue is called Funston Avenue named for Frederick Funston, a U.S. Army general, famous for his exploits during the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War, and the 1906 earthquake.

Many of the east–west streets are still named after the Spanish Conquistadors, but there are exceptions. The creation of Golden Gate Park took out the streets previously lettered E through G. The former D Street became Fulton, which is the northern boundary of most of the Park.

North of the Park in the Richmond District, the streets are named Anza, Balboa, and Cabrillo.

==Parks and recreation==
Major parks in the Richmond District include:
* Lincoln Park and Golf Course in the Outer Richmond, also the location of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor art museum. 
*The historic Fort Miley Military Reservation on Point Lobos (San Francisco) is now within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. A portion houses the large San Francisco VA Medical Center. 
*Mountain Lake Park, constructed around the recently restored small lake near the Park Presidio entrance to the San Francisco Presidio park. Mountain Lake is the only natural lake in the entire 80,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and it feeds the Presidio&#x27;s Lobos Creek.
*Rochambeau Park is located between 24th and 25th Avenues, with tennis and basketball courts and play structures.
*Sutro Heights Park, the former site of silver magnate Adolph Sutro&#x27;s estate, is located in the Outer Richmond District above the Cliff House.

==Education==

The Richmond is home to San Francisco Unified School District elementary, middle and high schools. Elementary schools have distinct attendance zones.
; Preschools:
* Argonne Early Education School - Inner Richmond

; Elementary schools:
* Alamo - Established in 1926, in the center of the area.
* Argonne - In Inner Richmond
* Lafayette - In Outer Richmond
* Claire Lilienthal Alternative School (K-2 Madison Campus) - Inner Richmond
* Frank McCoppin Elementary School - Inner Richmond
* George Peabody Elementary School - Inner Richmond
* Sutro Elementary School - Inner Richmond

; Middle schools:
* Roosevelt Middle School
* Presidio Middle School - Outer Richmond

George Washington High School is located in Outer Richmond, at 32nd Avenue and Anza St.

Additionally, Katherine Delmar Burke School, an independent girls&#x27; school for kindergarten through eighth grade, as well as Kittredge School, a small, independent private elementary school serve the district.

The Richmond/Senator Milton Marks Branch and the Anza Branch of the San Francisco Public Library serve the Richmond District. In 1930 voters approved a city charter amendment that would increase funding to the library system so a new library could be built. John Reid, Jr., the architect, designed and landscaped the $57,117.29 new library, which was placed on the site of the former Lafayette School. On April 10, 1932, the Anza Library, the 17th municipal library branch, was dedicated. In May 2009 the library system closed the Anza Branch for repairs. A rebuilt library opened on June 18, 2011. Jing Mo Athletic Association lion dancers provided entertainment at the ceremony.

<doc id="283457" wikidata="Q376176" url="?curid=283457" title="Walter Koenig">
<text>Walter Marvin Koenig (; born September 14, 1936) is an American actor and screenwriter. He began acting professionally in the mid-1960s and quickly rose to prominence for his supporting role as Ensign Pavel Chekov in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (1967–1969). He went on to reprise this role in all six original-cast &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, and later voiced President Anton Chekov in &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023). He has also acted in several other series and films including &quot;Goodbye, Raggedy Ann&quot; (1971), &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; (1974), and &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (1993). In addition to his acting career, Koenig has made a career in writing as well and is known for working on &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; (1974),&quot; Family&quot; (1976), &quot;What Really Happened to the Class of &#x27;65?&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot; (1982).

==Early life==
Koenig was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of businessman Isadore Koenig and his wife Sarah (née Strauss). They moved to the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan when Walter was a child, where he went to school. Koenig&#x27;s parents were Russian Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union; his family had been living in Lithuania when they emigrated, and they shortened their surname from &quot;Königsberg&quot; to &quot;Koenig&quot;.

Koenig&#x27;s father was a communist who was investigated by the FBI during the McCarthy era. Koenig attended Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, with a pre-med major. He transferred to UCLA and received a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. After a professor encouraged Koenig to become an actor, he attended Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City with fellow students Dabney Coleman, Christopher Lloyd, and James Caan.

==Career==

===Early work===
In Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s first television production, the 1963–64 NBC series &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, Koenig played a significant role as noncom Sgt. John Delwyn, who is recommended for Officer Candidates School by the series protagonist, Lt William T. (Tiberius) Rice, played by Gary Lockwood; (in episode 27, &quot;Mother Enemy&quot;, aired on April 4, 1964). The plot twist, at the height of the US–Soviet Cold War, is that Sgt Delwyn&#x27;s visiting mother is a prominent, and politically active, American Communist Party member. This sets up various interesting plot tensions involving Delwyn, Rice, and Rice&#x27;s CO, Capt. Rambridge, played by Robert Vaughn.
In 1964, Koenig portrayed a New York City juvenile gang leader in an adaptation of &quot;Memos from Purgatory&quot; for &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Koenig began playing Ensign Pavel Chekov, navigator on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series in the second season, and continued in the role in all of the films featuring the original cast, including &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;.

Koenig was unfamiliar with science fiction before being cast on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. One of only two actors to audition, he was cast as Chekov almost immediately primarily because of his resemblance to British actor and singer Davy Jones of the Monkees. Show creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that Koenig would increase the show&#x27;s appeal to young people. The studio&#x27;s publicity department, however, falsely ascribed the inclusion of Chekov to an article in &quot;Pravda&quot; that complained about the lack of Russians in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

As the 30-year-old&#x27;s hair was already receding, costume designers fashioned a Davy Jones-style &quot;moptop&quot; hairpiece for him. In later episodes, his own hair grew out enough to accomplish the look with a comb-over.

Roddenberry asked him to &quot;ham up&quot; his Russian accent to add a note of comic relief to the series. Chekov&#x27;s accent has been criticized as inauthentic, in particular Koenig&#x27;s substituting the &quot;w&quot; sound in place of a &quot;v&quot; sound (e.g., &quot;wodka&quot; for &quot;vodka&quot; or most famously &quot;wessel&quot; for &quot;vessel&quot;); Koenig has said the accent was inspired by his father, who had the same difficulty with the &quot;v&quot; sound.

Most of Koenig&#x27;s fan mail came from children, and his popularity with fans contributed to him soon receiving a contract as a regular &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast member; this surprised Koenig, who had initially been told that Chekov would only be a recurring role. When the early episodes for season two of &quot;Star Trek&quot; were filmed, George Takei was absent while completing the movie &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, so Chekov was joined at the &quot;Enterprise&quot; helm by different characters. When Takei returned, the two actors had to share a dressing room and a single script per episode. This reportedly angered Takei to the point where he considered leaving the show, although Koenig observed in a 2016 interview that, while sharing a dressing room with Takei and James Doohan, the three finally recognised their status as supporting players and after that &quot;didn&#x27;t think twice about it&quot;. Koenig and Takei have since become good friends, to the point that Koenig served as best man at Takei&#x27;s wedding in 2008.

The character of Chekov did not appear in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The show&#x27;s producers had declined to hire Koenig for budgetary reasons and the actor wasn&#x27;t even aware that he would not be included in the cast until a fan informed him at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention. Although Roddenberry would hire Koenig as a writer and purchased his script for an episode of the show titled &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot;, Koenig later confessed that he was upset at being left out of the cast of the animated series. &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; makes him the first cast member to write a &quot;Star Trek&quot; story for television.

Koenig received Saturn Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Film for both &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. Koenig reprised the role of Chekov for the fan webseries &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;, &quot;To Serve All My Days&quot;, and the independent Sky Conway/Tim Russ film, &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;, both in 2006, and &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot; in 2015. According to the teaser for &quot;Renegades&quot; episodes 2 and 3, this would be the last time Koenig played the role of Chekov.

In the last episode of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, aired in 2023, Koenig voiced an audio transmission from Federation President Anton Chekov, implied to be Pavel&#x27;s son; the name references Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the J. J. Abrams-directed &quot;Star Trek&quot; films.

===Later work===

Typecast as Chekov, Koenig found a great disparity between the adulation from Trekkies at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions and his obscurity in Hollywood, stating that &quot;people are interested in Chekov, not me&quot;. Before the &quot;Trek&quot; movies started, Koenig found some work as a writer. He submitted freelance scripts to a number of shows, and was the main writer on the show &quot;What Really Happened to the Class of &#x27;65?&quot;.

After Chekov, Koenig had a recurring role as Psi Cop Alfred Bester on the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He was a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; in twelve episodes and, at the end of the third season, the production company applied for an Emmy nomination on his behalf. He was slated to play Bester on the spin-off series &quot;Crusade&quot;, but the series was cancelled before his episode was filmed. The character name of &quot;Alfred Bester&quot; was an homage to the science-fiction writer of the same name.

Koenig played &quot;Oro&quot; in two episodes of the Canadian science fiction television series &quot;The Starlost&quot;, which aired in 1973 on Canada&#x27;s CTV television network. He filmed a few FMV sequences for a re-released copy of the game &quot;Star Trek Starfleet Academy&quot; for PCs. The game was later cancelled, but considerable footage from it was recycled for the film &quot;Game Over&quot;, with Koenig&#x27;s dialogue dubbed over in order to retrofit his performance into the role of a computer hard drive.

Koenig&#x27;s film, stage, and TV roles span fifty years. He has played roles ranging from a teenage gang leader (&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;) to Scandinavian fiancé Gunnar in the &quot;Gidget&quot; episode entitled &quot;Gidget&#x27;s Foreign Policy&quot;, to a Las Vegas entertainer (&quot;I Spy&quot;). He returned to space with a starring role in &quot;Moontrap&quot; and played a futuristic dictator in the video game &quot;Maximum Surge&quot;.

During the early 1990s, he starred in a touring production of the play &quot;The Boys in Autumn&quot;, playing a middle aged Tom Sawyer, who reunites with childhood friend Huckleberry Finn. Fellow &quot;Trek&quot; actor Mark Lenard played Finn.

In addition to acting, he has written several films (&quot;I Wish I May&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Never Alone When You&#x27;re a Schizophrenic&quot;), one-act plays, and a handful of episodes for TV shows: &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;, &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot;.

He has written several books, including &quot;Warped Factors: A Neurotic&#x27;s Guide to the Universe&quot; (an autobiography), &quot;Chekov&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; (a journal kept during the filming of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;) and &quot;Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot&quot; (a science fiction novel), which was re-released in 2006. He created his own comic book series called &quot;Raver&quot;, which was published by Malibu Comics in the early 1990s, and appeared as a &quot;special guest star&quot; in an issue of the comic book &quot;Eternity Smith&quot;, which features him prominently on its cover.

In 2013, he released the graphic novel &quot;Walter Koenig&#x27;s Things To Come&quot; with artist J.C. Baez, published by Bluewater Comics, which compiled the four issues of the miniseries of the same name.

Koenig has taught classes in acting and directing at UCLA, the Sherwood Oaks Experimental Film College, the Actor&#x27;s Alley Repertory Company in Los Angeles, and the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University. In 2002, he directed stage versions of two of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes for Letter Entertainment.

In 1987, Koenig directed his original one-act play &quot;The Secret Life of Lily Langtree&quot; at the Theatre of NOTE in Los Angeles. In 1989, Koenig starred in the science fiction film &quot;Moontrap&quot; as mission commander Colonel Jason Grant.

In 1997, Koenig starred in &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, an independent film about a Wiccan woman who attempts to open a homeless shelter in a small Pennsylvania town. Koenig played Joe Merchant, a local crime lord obsessed with chaos theory who sends his thugs to intimidate her into shutting down the shelter.

In 2004, Koenig co-starred in &quot;Mad Cowgirl&quot;, an independent movie about a meat-packing health inspector dying from a brain disorder, in which he played televangelist Pastor Dylan. The movie played the SF Indiefest and the Silverlake Film Festival, followed by a limited release in major cities. &quot;Mad Cowgirl&quot; was released on DVD on December 5, 2006.

In 2007, he reunited with fellow &quot;Babylon 5&quot; star Bruce Boxleitner for the movie &quot;Bone Eater&quot;.

Koenig received the 2,479th star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on September 10, 2012.

In 2013, Koenig ventured into the steampunk genre, starring in the short film &quot;Cowboys &amp; Engines&quot; alongside Malcolm McDowell and Richard Hatch. He played an evil newspaper tycoon in &quot;Blue Dream&quot; from director Gregory Hatanaka. In 2017, Koenig appeared in the 1980s throwback &quot;Neil Stryker and the Tyrant of Time&quot; from director Rob Taylor, battling puppet goblins as science officer Ray Nabroski.

In 2018, he again appeared opposite Hatch in the science-fiction drama &quot;Diminuendo&quot;, which was Hatch&#x27;s last performance before his death.

== Humanitarian work ==
In 2007, Koenig was asked by the human rights group U.S. Campaign for Burma to help in their grassroots campaign about the humanitarian crisis in Burma. As detailed on his official website, he visited refugee camps along the Burma–Thailand border from July 16 to 25, 2007.

==Personal life==
Koenig married actress Judy Levitt in 1965; she died in 2022. In 1968, they had a son, actor Andrew, who died in 2010. They have a daughter, Danielle, a comedienne and writer, who is married to comedian Jimmy Pardo.

In September 2008, Koenig served as best man at the wedding of his &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star George Takei to Brad Altman.

Koenig was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1982.

<text>The Fashoda Incident, also known as the Fashoda Crisis (French: &quot;Crise de Fachoda&quot;), was the climax of imperialist territorial disputes between Britain and France in East Africa, occurring between 10 July to 3 November 1898. A French expedition to Fashoda on the White Nile sought to gain control of the Upper Nile river basin and thereby exclude Britain from Sudan. The French party and a British-Egyptian force (outnumbering the French by 10 to 1) met on friendly terms. However, in Europe, it became a war scare. Both empires stood on the verge of war with heated rhetoric on both sides. Under heavy pressure, the French withdrew, ensuring Anglo-Egyptian control over the area.

== Background ==

During the late-19th century, Africa was rapidly being claimed and colonised by European colonial powers. After the 1885 Berlin Conference regarding West Africa, Europe&#x27;s great powers went after any remaining lands in Africa that were not already under another European nation&#x27;s influence. This period in African history is usually termed the Scramble for Africa by modern historiography. The principal powers involved in this scramble were Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.

The French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the continent&#x27;s Atlantic coast (modern-day Senegal) eastward, through the Sahel along the southern border of the Sahara, a territory covering modern-day Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Chad. Their ultimate goal was to have an uninterrupted link between the Niger River and the Nile, hence controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the caravan routes through the Sahara. France also had an outpost near the mouth of the Red Sea in French Somaliland (now Djibouti), which could serve as an eastern anchor to an east–west belt of French territory across the continent at its widest point.

The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in Southern Africa (South Africa, Bechuanaland and Rhodesia), with their territories in East Africa (modern-day Kenya), and these two areas with the Nile basin. Sudan, which then included modern-day South Sudan and Uganda, was the key to the fulfilment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This &#x27;red line&#x27; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a proposed railway or road, see Cape to Cairo Railway) through Africa was made famous by the British diamond magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes, who wanted Africa &quot;painted Red&quot; (meaning under British control, since territories held by Britain were often coloured red on maps).

If one draws a line from Cape Town to Cairo (Rhodes&#x27;s dream) and another line from Dakar to French Somaliland (now Djibouti) by the Red Sea in the Horn (the French ambition), these two lines intersect in eastern South Sudan near the town of Fashoda (present-day Kodok), explaining its strategic importance. The French east–west axis and the British north–south axis could not co-exist; the nation that could occupy and hold the crossing of the two axes would be the only one able to proceed with its plan.

Fashoda was founded by the Egyptian army in 1855 in a boggy area and was situated at one of the few places where a boat on the Nile could unload. The area was inhabited by the Shilluk people, and by the mid-1870s, Fashoda was a market town. Wilhelm Junker, one of the first Europeans to arrive in the region described the town in 1876 as &quot;a considerable trading place ... the last outpost of civilization, where travelers plunging into or returning from the wilds of equatorial Africa could procure a few indispensable European wares from the local Greek traders.&quot; When Jean-Baptiste Marchand came to the town in 1898, he found the fort deserted and in ruins.

Fashoda was also bound up in the Egyptian Question, a long-running dispute between the United Kingdom and France over the British occupation of Egypt. Since 1882 many French politicians, particularly those of the &quot;parti colonial&quot;, had come to regret France&#x27;s decision not to join with Britain in occupying the country. They hoped to force Britain to leave, and thought that a colonial outpost on the Upper Nile could serve as a base for French gunboats. These in turn were expected to make the British abandon Egypt. Another proposed scheme involved a massive dam, cutting off the Nile&#x27;s water supply and forcing the British out. These ideas were highly impractical, but they succeeded in alarming many British officials.

Other European nations were also interested in controlling the upper Nile valley. The Italians who had an outpost at Massawa on the Red Sea, made an attempt but their defeat at the Battle of Adwa in March 1896 ended it. In September 1896, King Leopold II, the Sovereign of the Congo Free State, sent a column of 5,000 Congolese troops, with artillery, towards the White Nile from Stanleyville on the Upper Congo River. After five months they reached Lake Albert, about from Fashoda. The soldiers were upset at their treatment and mutinied on 18 March 1897. Many of the Belgian officers were killed and the rest fled.

==Crisis==
===Marchand expedition===

France made its move by sending Captain Jean-Baptiste Marchand, a veteran of the conquest of French Sudan, back to West Africa. He embarked a force composed mostly of West African colonial troops from Senegal on a ship for central Africa. On 20 June 1896, he reached Libreville in the colony of Gabon with a force of only 120 &quot;tirailleurs&quot; plus 12 French officers, non-commissioned officers and support staff—Captain Marcel Joseph Germain, Captain Albert Baratier, Captain Charles Mangin, Captain Victor Emmanuel Largeau, Lieutenant Félix Fouqué, a teacher named Dyé, doctor Jules Emily Major, Warrant Officer De Prat, Sergeant George Dat, Sergeant Bernard, Sergeant Venail and the military interpreter Landerouin.

Marchand&#x27;s force set out from Brazzaville in a borrowed Belgian steamer with orders to secure the area around Fashoda and make it a French protectorate. They steamed up the Ubangi River to its head of navigation and then marched overland (carrying 100 tons of supplies, including a collapsible steel steamboat with a one-ton boiler) through jungle and scrub to the deserts of Sudan. They travelled across Sudan to the Nile. They were to be met there by two expeditions coming from the east across Ethiopia, one of which, from Djibouti, was led by Christian de Bonchamps, veteran of the Stairs Expedition to Katanga.

Following a difficult 14-month trek across the heart of Africa, the Marchand Expedition arrived on 10 July 1898, but the de Bonchamps Expedition failed to make it after being ordered by the Ethiopians to halt, and then suffering accidents in the Baro Gorge. Marchand&#x27;s small force found itself alone, hundreds of miles from any support. The British, meanwhile, were engaged in the Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan, moving upriver from Egypt. On 18 September a flotilla of five British gunboats arrived at the isolated Fashoda fort. They carried 1,500 British, Egyptian and Sudanese soldiers, led by Sir Herbert Kitchener and including Lieutenant-Colonel Horace Smith-Dorrien. Marchand had received incorrect reports that the approaching force consisted of Dervishes; he found himself facing a diplomatic rather than a military crisis.

=== Standoff at Fashoda ===
Both sides insisted on their right to Fashoda but agreed to wait for further instructions from home. The two commanders behaved with restraint and even a certain humour. Kitchener toasted Marchand with whisky, the drinking of which the French officer described as &quot;one of the greatest sacrifices I ever made for my country&quot;. Kitchener inspected a French garden commenting &quot;Flowers at Fashoda. Oh these Frenchmen!&quot; More seriously the British distributed French newspapers detailing the political chaos caused by the Dreyfus affair, warning that France was in no condition to provide serious support for Marchand and his party. News of the meeting was relayed to Paris and London, where it inflamed the pride of both nations. Widespread popular outrage followed, each side accusing the other of naked expansionism and aggression. The crisis continued throughout September and October 1898. The Royal Navy drafted war orders and mobilized its reserves.

=== French withdrawal ===
As the commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army that had just defeated the forces of the Mahdi at the Battle of Omdurman, Kitchener was in the process of reconquering the Sudan in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, and after the battle he opened sealed orders to investigate the French expedition. Kitchener landed at Fashoda wearing an Egyptian Army uniform and insisted in raising the Egyptian flag at some distance from the French flag.

In naval terms, the situation was heavily in Britain&#x27;s favour, a fact that French deputies acknowledged in the aftermath of the crisis. Several historians have given credit to Marchand for remaining calm. The military facts were undoubtedly important to Théophile Delcassé, the newly appointed French foreign minister. &quot;They have soldiers. We only have arguments,&quot; he said resignedly. In addition, he saw no advantage in a war with the British, especially since he was keen to gain their friendship in case of any future conflict with Germany. He therefore pressed hard for a peaceful resolution of the crisis although it encouraged a tide of nationalism and anglophobia. In an editorial published in &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot; on 13 October Victor Henri Rochefort wrote, &quot;Germany keeps slapping us in the face. Let&#x27;s not offer our cheek to England.&quot; As Professor P. H. Bell writes,

The French government quietly ordered its soldiers to withdraw on 3 November and the crisis ended peacefully. Marchand chose to withdraw his small force by way of Abyssinia and Djibouti, rather than cross Egyptian territory by taking the relatively quick journey by steamer down the Nile.

==Aftermath==
Fashoda was a major diplomatic defeat and a national humiliation for France. According to French nationalists, the capitulation was clear evidence that the army had been severely weakened by the traitors who supported Dreyfus. It also inspired intense anti-British sentiment, and some voiced that England might be preparing to attack France. The reopening of the Dreyfus affair in January the following year had done much to distract French public opinion from events in Sudan and people increasingly questioned the wisdom of a war over such a remote part of Africa. Nevertheless it put paid to French ambitions of an equatorial empire stretching from the West coast to the East. Britain meanwhile relished in the success, and although wary of French retaliation her coercive policy had resolved the crisis.

The French also realized that in the long run they needed the friendship of Britain in case of a war between France and Germany.

In March 1899, the Anglo-French Convention of 1898 was signed and it was agreed that the source of the Nile and the Congo rivers should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.

The Fashoda Incident was the last serious colonial dispute between Britain and France, and its classic diplomatic solution is considered by most historians to be the precursor of the Entente Cordiale of 1904. The same year, Fashoda was officially renamed Kodok. It is located in modern-day South Sudan.

===Legacy===
A French colonial officer George de Villebois-Mareuil saw the Anglo-Boer War as a chance to avenge the French humiliation at Fashoda - he was however killed at the Battle of Boshof.

The two main individuals involved in the incident are commemorated in the , a road bridge over the Saône, completed in 1959 in the French city of Lyon.

The incident gave rise to the &#x27;Fashoda syndrome&#x27; in French foreign policy, or seeking to assert French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence. As such it was used as a comparison to other later crises or conflicts such as the Levant Crisis of 1945, the Nigerian Civil War in Biafra in the 1970s and the Rwandan Civil War in 1994.

<doc id="283610" wikidata="Q12294124" url="?curid=283610" title="Juicer">
<text>A juicer, also known as a juice extractor, is a tool used to extract juice from fruits, herbs, leafy greens and other types of vegetables in a process called juicing. It crushes, grinds, and/or squeezes the juice out of the pulp. A juicer clarifies the juice through a screening mesh to remove the pulp unlike a blender where the output contains both the liquids and solids of the processed fruit(s) or vegetable(s).

Some types of juicers can also function as a food processor. Most of the twin gear and horizontal masticating juicers have attachments for crushing herbs and spices, extruding pasta, noodles or bread sticks, making baby food and nut butter, grinding coffee, making nut milk, etc.

==Types==
===Reamers===

Squeezers are used for squeezing juice from citrus such as grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges. Juice is extracted by pressing or grinding a halved citrus along a juicer&#x27;s ridged conical center and discarding the rind. Some reamers are stationary and require a user to press and turn the fruit, while others are electrical, automatically turning the ridged center when fruit is pressed upon.

===Centrifugal juicers===
A centrifugal juicer cuts up the fruit or vegetable with a flat cutting blade. It then spins the produce at a high speed to separate the juice from the pulp.

===Masticating juicers===
A masticating juicer known as cold press juicer or slow juicer uses a single auger to compact and crush produce into smaller sections before squeezing out its juice along a static screen while the pulp is expelled through a separate outlet.

===Triturating juicers===
Triturating juicers (twin gear juicers) have twin augers to crush and press produce.

===Juicing press===

A juicing press, such as a fruit press or wine press, is a larger scale press that is used in agricultural production. These presses can be stationary or mobile. A mobile press has the advantage that it can be moved from one orchard to another. The process is primarily used for apples and involves a stack of apple mash, wrapped in fine mesh cloth, which is then pressed under approx 40 tonnes. These machines are popular in Europe and have now been introduced to North America.

===Steam juice extractor===
A stovetop steam juice extractor is typically a pot to generate steam that is used to heat a batch of berries (or other fruit) in a perforated pot stacked on top of a juice collecting container that is above the steam pot. The juice is extracted without mechanical means so it is remarkably clear and because of the steam heating it is also pasteurized for long term storage.

<text>Jerome Patrick Cavanagh (June 16, 1928 – November 27, 1979) was an American politician who served as the mayor of Detroit, Michigan from 1962 to 1970. Initially a popular figure, his reputation was seriously damaged by the city&#x27;s 1967 riots, the most destructive of any U.S. city that decade. He was the first mayor to reside at the Manoogian Mansion, donated to the city by the industrial baron Alex Manoogian.

==Early life and family==
Jerome P. Cavanagh was born on June 16, 1928, in Detroit, the son of Mary Irene (Timmins) and Sylvester J. Cavanaugh, a boilermaker at Ford Motor Company. He attended the University of Detroit, earning an undergraduate degree in 1950 and a law degree in 1954, and practiced law in Detroit after graduation. He was active in Democratic Party politics while attending school, and afterward served in low-level appointed positions as an administrative assistant at the Michigan State Fair Authority and as a member of the Metropolitan Airport Board of Zoning Appeals. Cavanagh was a Roman Catholic. He is the brother of Mike Cavanagh, a former Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court (1983–2014) and father of eight children, among whom are Mark Jerome Cavanagh, since 1989 a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals, David Peter Cavanagh and Christopher Francis Cavanagh (both former Wayne County Commissioners), and Phil Cavanagh (a former member of the Michigan House of Representatives).

==1961 mayoral campaign==
In his first campaign ever, the 33-year-old Cavanagh entered the 1961 Detroit mayoral race, one of eleven candidates in the nonpartisan primary opposing incumbent Louis Miriani. None of these candidates was seen as serious opposition to Miriani, who had an enormous amount of institutional support and had easily won the mayoral race four years earlier. Cavanagh ran second to Miriani in the primary, earning a slot in the general election, but received fewer than half the primary votes Miriani did. However, Cavanagh campaigned relentlessly, criticizing Miriani&#x27;s handling of Detroit&#x27;s financial affairs and race relations with the city&#x27;s African-American community. Many in the black community believed Miriani condoned police brutality. On election day, black voters turned out in force, and Cavanagh stunned political observers by defeating the incumbent Miriani.

==Mayoralty==
Cavanagh got off to a popular start as mayor, appointing a reformer to be chief of police and implementing an affirmative action program for most city agencies. Unlike Richard J. Daley, who resisted forced implementation of the American civil rights movement, Jerry Cavanagh welcomed Martin Luther King Jr. to Detroit, and marched with him in June 1963 down Woodward Avenue in the 100,000 strong Detroit Walk to Freedom.

Cavanagh was successful in receiving money from the U.S. federal government through the Model Cities Program. New skyscrapers were built downtown. The Model Cities Program was a key component of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society and War on Poverty. Begun in 1966, it operated five-year-long experiments in 150 cities to develop new antipoverty programs and alternative forms of municipal government. The ambitious federal urban aid program succeeded in fostering a new generation of mostly black urban leaders. Detroit was one of the largest Model Cities projects. Mayor Cavanagh was the only elected official to serve on Johnson&#x27;s task force. Detroit received widespread acclaim for its leadership in the program, which used $490 million to try to turn a nine-square-mile section of the city (with 134,000 inhabitants) into a model city. The city&#x27;s political and business elite, and city planners, along with the black middle class, wanted federal funding to assist the economic growth of the entire city. They sought to protect the central business district property values from nearby slums and to construct new revenue-generating structures. However local community organizers and civil rights activists rallied poor residents in opposition to these plans. They said federal renewal funding should be used to replace deteriorating housing stock, whether with new public housing or low-cost housing built by private developers. The Model City program was terminated in Detroit and nationwide in 1974 after major race riots in most of its target cities.

Observers believed that Detroit had extinguished the embers of resentment left over from the 1943 Detroit Race Riot.

For example, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine commented:

The economy of the city also seemed in generally good health. The &quot;National Observer&quot; commented:

Buoyed by this optimism, Cavanagh was reelected overwhelmingly in 1965. In 1966, Cavanagh was elected president of both the United States Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, the only mayor to hold both posts at the same time. He served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors until the following year.

===1967 riots===
However, deeper problems existed under the surface. After World War II, the automobile industry, requiring more lateral space than was available in a city, and desiring to avoid city taxes, decentralized its operations. As with other cities, Detroiters were leaving Detroit for its suburbs by the thousands by 1967. Some 22,000 residents, mostly white, moved to the suburbs in 1966 alone, following new auto plants and new housing, or using the newly constructed Interstate system to commute into Detroit. 

Detroit faced serious financial trouble. Cavanagh had inherited a $28 million budget gap in 1962. To close the gap, and to pay for the new programs he wanted to implement, Cavanagh had pushed through the legislature income and commuter taxes for Detroit, but these proved unpopular with residents and businesses.

On July 23, 1967, a police attempt to break up an illegal party escalated into what would be known as the 12th Street Riot. Feeling a large police presence would make things worse, Cavanagh acted slowly to stop the riots. Late Sunday afternoon, Cavanaugh and city officials met at the 10th precinct with black community leaders and neighborhood activists. When asked why it took so long to call in the guard, Cavanaugh replied &quot;because they&#x27;re all white. Were leery about that.&quot; Rioting lasted for five days, killed 43 people, left over 5,000 people homeless, and required two divisions of federal paratroopers to be put down; these would be the most destructive of the approximately 400 riots that American cities experienced in the 1960s. Cavanagh himself had to admit in July 1967, &quot;Today we stand amidst the ashes of our hopes. We hoped against hope that what we had been doing was enough to prevent a riot. It was not enough.&quot;

The view that Detroit was a “Model City&quot; led to the belief that it might not suffer the same race-related troubles of many other cities. The riots came as a complete shock to Cavanagh. He was, moreover, procedurally limited in his ability to control the riots as it was the role of Governor George Romney to ask for federal assistance once it appeared local resources might not be sufficient. By the time the National Guard had been called in, riots had already reached a massive scale. Cavanagh believed that a prompt federal response may very well have greatly reduced the severity of the riots. Cavanagh chose not to run for reelection in 1969.

==Later career==
The latter part of Cavanagh&#x27;s second term was also difficult for him personally. Cavanagh had run for the United States Senate in 1966 but lost in the Democratic primary to former governor G. Mennen Williams. In July 1967, Cavanagh&#x27;s wife Mary Helen filed for separation, and the couple split the custody of their eight children. In October, Cavanagh counter-sued, and in 1968 the couple went through a contentious and public divorce.

After Cavanagh left office, he returned to his private law practice in Detroit and was also one of the first adjunct professors at the newly created Public Policy Department (later renamed The Gerald Ford Public Policy Institute) at the University of Michigan. In 1974, Cavanagh again ran for office, this time for Governor, but lost in the primary election to Democrat Sander Levin, who later lost in the general election to Republican William Milliken. It was Cavanagh&#x27;s last attempt at political office.

Cavanagh died of a heart attack on November 27, 1979, at St. Joseph Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, while visiting a client in that city. He was 51 years old. He is buried in Mt. Elliott Cemetery in Detroit.

<text>Prince Aly Salomone Khan (13 June 1911 – 12 May 1960), known as Aly Khan, was an Ismaili sayyid, socialite and ambassador for Pakistan. He was the son of the Aga Khan III, and the father of Aga Khan IV.

A socialite, racehorse owner and jockey, he was the third husband of actress Rita Hayworth. After being passed over for succession as Aga Khan, he served as the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations from 1958 to 1960, where he became a vice president of the General Assembly.

The titles of prince and princess, which are claimed by children of the Aga Khan by virtue of their descent from the Qajar king Fath Ali Shah of the Persian Qajar dynasty, were recognized as courtesy titles by the British government in 1938.

==Birth and education==

Aly Khan was born in Turin, Italy, the younger son and only surviving child of the Aga Khan III and Cleofe Catterina Teresa &quot;Ginetta&quot; Magliano. His father was born in Karachi, British India (now in modern-day Pakistan). His mother was Italian. His paternal grandparents were born in Iran. He had two brothers: Mohammed Mahdi Khan, known as &quot;Giuseppe&quot; (who died in 1911) and, by his father&#x27;s third marriage, Sadruddin Aga Khan. Aly Khan was educated by private tutors in India and France during his childhood. He later trained in England as a lawyer. As a 12-year-old boy, he knew Orson Welles, who was approximately four years younger. Years later, each of them would go on to marry Rita Hayworth.

==Military service and honours==
In 1939, Prince Aly Aga Khan joined the French Foreign Legion and served with its cavalry division in Egypt and the Middle East. In 1940, he joined the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, becoming a lieutenant colonel in 1944. That same year, he participated in the Allied landing in the south of France with the United States Seventh Army, serving as a liaison officer with the rank of captain; for this, he was made an officer in the Legion of Honour in 1950.

He also was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the United States Bronze Star Medal.

Prince Aly Khan was installed as the 1st Colonel of the Regiment of the newly raised 4 Cavalry Regiment (1 November 1956), Pakistani Army in a military ceremony during 1957 and he retained this honor until his death.

==Ambassador of Pakistan to the United Nations==
In November 1957 Aly Khan met President Iskander Mirza of Pakistan and was offered a post as the country&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations. The formal announcement of the appointment was made on 6 February 1958.

As a member of the United Nations Political and Security Committee representing Pakistan, Aly Khan&#x27;s brief U.N. posting was viewed with surprise by many observers, some of whom considered him &quot;the Asian-African answer to Irene Dunne&quot;, an American movie star not known for her political skills; Dunne had recently been designated a member of the United States delegation at General Assembly, largely in recognition of her Republican fundraising efforts.

He was elected as vice president of the United Nations General Assembly on 17 September 1958 and also served as chairman of the U.N.&#x27;s Peace Observation Committee.

==Personal life==
Prince Aly Khan was famously a man-about-town in his youth. &quot;I had been involved with several women&quot;, he gamely told a reporter when asked about his life. His list of affairs included high-profile lovers such as the British debutante Margaret Whigham, later Duchess of Argyll, Thelma, Viscountess Furness, an American who was simultaneously involved with the Prince of Wales, British entertainer Joyce Grenfell and British socialite and hostess Pat Marlowe. Of his first wife, he remarked, &quot;I was tired of trouble. Joan was a sane and solid girl, and I thought if I married her, I would stay out of trouble.&quot;

===First marriage===
Aly Khan was named co-respondent in the &quot;Guinness v Guinness and Khan&quot; divorce suit between Joan Barbara Guinness (née Yarde-Buller, 1908–1997; daughter of John Reginald Lopes Yarde-Buller, 3rd Baron Churston), and Group Captain Thomas Loel Guinness MP, a scion of the Guinness Brewery family. In 1935, Guinness sued for divorce, naming Aly Khan as the &quot;third party&quot;, he cited as evidence that his wife and Aly Khan had occupied a hotel room together from 17 May until 20 May 1935, and that his wife had told him that she &quot;had formed an attachment for (Aly Khan) and desired her husband to divorce her&quot;. The case was uncontested, and Aly Khan was ordered to pay all costs.

Aly Khan and Joan Barbara Guinness were married in Paris on 18 May 1936, a few days after Joan Guinness&#x27;s divorce became absolute. Before the wedding, the bride converted to Islam and took the name &quot;Taj-ud-dawlah&quot; or &quot;crown of the realm&quot;. The couple&#x27;s first child, Prince Karim, was born in Geneva seven months later, on 13 December 1936, and is said to have been a premature child. The couple also had a second son, Prince Amyn Muhammad Aga Khan, who was also born premature at seven months the following year. Joan Barbara also had a son by her previous marriage, Patrick Guinness.

Aly Khan and Joan Barbara were divorced in 1949, in part due to his extramarital affairs with, among others, Pamela Churchill. After the divorce, Joan Barbara became the longtime mistress and eventual wife of the newspaper magnate Seymour Berry, 2nd Viscount Camrose. Aly Khan married American actress Rita Hayworth within weeks of his divorce.

===Second marriage and divorce===

On 27 May (civil) and 28 May (religious) 1949, in Cannes, France, Aly Khan married American film star Rita Hayworth, who left her film career to marry him.

Aly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

In 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and his wife had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada, US. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe, Nevada with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on 2 September 1951, on the grounds of &quot;extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature.&quot;

Hayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the Prince said he wanted her raised as a Muslim; Hayworth (who was raised a Roman Catholic) wanted the child to be a Christian.

Aly Khan and Rita Hayworth divorced in 1953. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1,000,000 if she would raise Yasmin in the Muslim faith from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year. Hayworth said:
===Engagement===
While still married to Hayworth, Khan began a relationship with American film and stage actress Gene Tierney, whom he was engaged to marry in 1952; while Tierney mentioned their engagement a few times, it was never formally announced. His father, however, strongly opposed the union with another Hollywood actress. After a year-long engagement, Tierney separated from the Prince and moved back to the United States to tend to her mental health. In the late 1950s Aly was known to start dating the fashion model Simone Micheline Bodin (who called herself Bettina Graziani). She was persuaded by Prince Aly Khan to retire from modelling and settle down. By the 1960s Bettina and the Prince were engaged and expecting a child, whom she miscarried after being in a car accident.

===Inheritance skips a generation===
On 12 July 1957, upon the reading of the will of the Aga Khan III, Aly Khan&#x27;s eldest son, Karim Aga Khan, then a junior at Harvard University, was named Aga Khan IV and 49th Imam of the Ismailis. It was the second time that the descent from father to son was circumvented in the community&#x27;s 1,300-year history. According to the Aga Khan&#x27;s will, a statement of which was presented to the press by his secretary:
==Racehorse owner and breeder==

Prince Aly Khan was a famous owner and breeder of racehorses in France, England and Ireland. Noel Murless the Champion Trainer on multiple occasions in England told his biographer &quot;Apart from his immense charm, Prince Aly was also highly intelligent, a first-class judge of a horse and of form and breeding. It is probably fair to say that, with his experience of international racing, he was the best judge of collateral form in the world, and his flair for pedigrees was unique.&quot;

Aga Khan III was a prominent Racehorse owner and breeder. After the second world war, Aly Khan bought a half share in his father&#x27;s racing interests. Early success for the partnership led to them heading the list of winning breeders from 1947 to 1949 and 1952.

== Death ==

On 12 May 1960, a little more than two years after his appointment as Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the UN, Aly Khan sustained catastrophic head injuries in an automobile accident in Suresnes, France, a suburb of Paris, when the car he was driving collided with another vehicle at the intersection of boulevard Henri Sellier and rue du Mont Valerien, while he and his pregnant fiancée, Bettina, were heading to a party. He died shortly afterward at Foch Hospital (in Suresnes). Bettina survived with a minor injury to her forehead, though the shock of the accident resulted in a miscarriage. The prince&#x27;s chauffeur, who was in the back seat, also survived, as did the driver of the oncoming car.

Aly Khan was buried on the grounds of château de l&#x27;Horizon, his home in the south of France, where it was intended that he would remain until a mausoleum was built for him in Syria. His remains were removed to Damascus, Syria, on 11 July 1972, and he was reinterred in Salamiyah, Syria.

His fortune went almost entirely to his children. The only beneficiaries of his will outside family and employees were Bettina, who received a US$280,000 bequest, Lord Astor (one of his closest friends) and Sybilla Szczeniowska (a woman he met initially in Cairo in 1941) and her son Marek who received $14,000 and $56,000 respectively.

Writing in The Times a few days after his death Lord Astor paid him a tribute. &quot;If one only knew Aly Khan by repute it was easy to preconceive a dislike towards him. When one met him it was impossible not to be stimulated and attracted by his charm, his perfect manners, his vitality, his gaiety and sense of fun. But if you were fortunate enough to know him really well, and have him as a friend, you acquired a friendship which was incomparable - generous, imaginative, enduring and almost passionately warm.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Due to his well-publicized romances, Prince Aly Khan was mentioned in a verse of Noël Coward&#x27;s 1950s lyrics for Cole Porter&#x27;s 1928 song &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It, Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;: &quot;Monkeys whenever you look do it / Aly Khan and King Farouk do it / Let&#x27;s do it, let&#x27;s fall in love.&quot;

Lucille P. Markey, owner of Calumet Farm Thoroughbred racing stable in Lexington, Kentucky, named one of her outstanding colts, &quot;Alydar&quot; in his honor because she always addressed the prince as, &quot;Aly Darling&quot;.

In the 20 May 2012 episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Don Draper mentions that he thought Joan Harris was seeing Aly Khan, given the frequency of flower deliveries to her office. Later on in the episode, Joan Harris receives a bouquet of red roses (purportedly from Don Draper) with a note that says &quot;Your mother did a good job Ali Khan.&quot;

In a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episode titled &quot;The Golfer&quot;, which first aired on 15 October 1955, Alice Kramden when her husband Ralph needs an excuse to not go golfing with his boss exclaims, &quot;Sure, you can always tell him you&#x27;re going tiger hunting with Aly Khan.&quot;

He also appears in Dominick Dunne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Two Mrs. Grenvilles&quot;, published in 1985.

<text>Deep structure and surface structure (also D-structure and S-structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings) are concepts used in linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the Chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar.

The deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures. For example, the sentences &quot;Pat loves Chris&quot; and &quot;Chris is loved by Pat&quot; mean roughly the same thing and use similar words. Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct &quot;surface forms&quot; that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure.

==Origin==
Chomsky coined and popularized the terms &quot;deep structure&quot; and &quot;surface structure&quot; in the early 1960s. American linguist Sydney Lamb wrote in 1975 that Chomsky &quot;probably [borrowed] the term from Hockett&quot;. American linguist Charles Hockett first used the dichotomous pair &quot;deep grammar&quot; vs &quot;surface grammar&quot; in his 1958 book titled &quot;A Course in Modern Linguistics&quot;. Chomsky first referred to these Hockettian concepts in his 1962 paper &quot;The Logical Basis of Linguistic Theory&quot; (later published as &quot;Current Issues in Linguistic Theory&quot; in 1964). In it Chomsky noted that &quot;the difference between observational
and descriptive adequacy is related to the distinction drawn by Hockett (1958) between &#x27;surface grammar&#x27; and &#x27;deep grammar&#x27;, and he is unquestionably correct in noting that modern linguistics is largely confined in scope to the former.&quot; The phrases &#x27;depth grammar&#x27; and &#x27;surface grammar&#x27; had been used by Ludwig Wittgenstein to denote the same ideas in his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (1953).

==In Chomskyan linguistics==
In early transformational syntax, deep structures are derivation trees of a context-free language. These trees are then transformed by a sequence of tree rewriting operations (&quot;transformations&quot;) into surface structures. The terminal yield of a surface structure tree, the surface form, is then predicted to be a grammatical sentence of the language being studied. The role and significance of deep structure changed a great deal as Chomsky developed his theories, and since the mid-1990s deep structure no longer features at all (see minimalist program).

It is tempting to regard deep structures as representing meanings and surface structures as representing sentences that express those meanings, but this is not the concept of deep structure which Chomsky favoured. Rather, a sentence more closely corresponds to a deep structure paired with the surface structure derived from it, with an additional phonetic form obtained from processing of the surface structure. It has been variously suggested that the interpretation of a sentence is determined by its deep structure alone, by a combination of its deep and surface structures, or by some other level of representation altogether (logical form), as argued in 1977 by Chomsky&#x27;s student Robert May. Chomsky may have tentatively entertained the first of these ideas in the early 1960s, but quickly moved away from it to the second, and finally to the third. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the generative semantics movement put up a vigorous defence of the first option, sparking an acrimonious debate, the &quot;Linguistics Wars&quot;.

Chomsky noted in his early years that by dividing deep structures from surface structures, one could understand &quot;slip of the tongue&quot; moments (where someone says something that they did not intend) as instances where deep structures do not translate into the intended surface structure.

==Extension to other fields==
The appeal of the deep structure concept soon led people from unrelated fields (architecture, music, politics, and even ritual studies) to use the term to express various concepts in their own work. In common usage, the term is often used as a synonym for universal grammar—the constraints which Chomsky claims govern the overall forms of linguistic expression available to the human species. This is probably due to the importance of deep structure in Chomsky&#x27;s earlier work on universal grammar, though his concept of universal grammar is logically independent of any particular theoretical construct, including deep structure.

According to Middleton (1990), Schenkerian analysis of music corresponds to the Chomskyan notion of deep structure, applying to a two-level generative structure for melody, harmony, and rhythm, of which the analysis by Lee (1985) of rhythmical structure is an instance.

<text>Chinese folk art or Chinese handcrafts are artistic forms inherited from a regional or ethnic scene in China. Usually there are some variation between provinces. Individual folk arts have a long history, and many traditions are still practiced today. The general definition of folk art incorporates Chinese art forms that are not classified as Chinese fine art.

Chinese folk art is the ancient forms of art that originated in China. Some of these ancient art forms include jade carvings, performance art such as music and their respective instruments, textile art such as basket weaving, paper art and clothing.

== Jade Carving ==
Jade is a semi-rare green mineral found in prominent use in Chinese art since prehistoric times. Carvings using jade have been a common elevated folk art in China. From objects such as masks to animals, jadealong with cheaper wood and bamboofound use in many works of art. At times, the highest quality jade has been esteemed more highly than gold, diamonds, or pearls. Due to the toughness of jade, it is believed that Chinese jade carvings were first carved into weapons such as swords, although it is unclear if the sword carvings were for ceremonial or utilitarian use. As time went on, jade was carved into many different shapes and forms. An important early example of jade carving were the circular disks known as bi, generally understood to represent the heavens in some fashion. By 3000 BC, jade was referred to &quot;yu&quot; (). By 206 BC, Xu Shena Chinese scholar under the Hanlisted the Five Virtues of Jade as benevolence, honesty, wisdom, integrity, and bravery. It further represents love, strength, purity, luck, and gentleness. Jade is also used in fengshui, adding harmony and balance to its space.

==Basket weaving==
Baskets are mainly woven with bamboo or plant stems.
==Chinese kites==
China is the birthplace of the kite, and Weifang is one of the chief places where Chinese kites originated. Kite-flying became prevalent in Weifang in the Song dynasty (960–1279). By the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) kite-flying had become even more popular, and kite fairs on a rather large scale had appeared. Kites were sold not only across Shandong, but also to Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui and other places. The noted English scholar Joseph Needham listed kites in his book &quot;History of Science and Technology in China&quot; as one of the important contributions in science and technology that the Chinese introduced to Europe.
==Food art==
===Sugar===

Sugar painting &quot;tánghuà&quot;) is a form of traditional Chinese folk art using hot, liquid sugar to create two dimensional objects on a marble or metal surface.

Sugar people is a traditional Chinese form of folk art using hot, liquid sugar to create three-dimensional figures.

===Flour figures===
Mian Ren (Flour Figure) are made of coloured flours. Craftsmen used to travel with their tools to villages and towns to make and sell flour figures for a very basic income. Sometimes flour figures are used in dishes together with vegetable carvings.

==Paper art==
The first two forms of paper art began in the Han dynasty with Chinese paper cutting and Chinese paper folding, together with the hand fan and pinwheel (toy).

Chinese paper cutting (, &quot;jianzhi&quot;) is a type of folk art that has roots in China during the 6th century and is attributed to Cai Lun during the Han Dynasty. 

Known to be very intricate with the use of negative space, paper cutting is used for mostly decorative reasons, appearing on mirrors, lanterns, walls, etc. 

In most cities and Chinatowns, paper art will adorn many street corners, business fronts, and inside buildings.

==Performances==
===Puppetry===
One of the oldest forms of folk art is puppetry. Puppeteers use various kinds of puppets, including marionettes, glove puppets, rod puppets, cloth puppets and wire puppets in performances incorporating folk songs and dances over some dialogues. The subject matter is derived mainly from children&#x27;s stories and fables.
===Shadow play===
Shadow plays are a form of puppetry that is performed by moving figures made of animal skins or cardboard held behind a screen lit by lamplight. The subject matter and singing style in shadow plays are closely related to Chinese opera, except without using live actors or actresses. This art style was passed down from master to apprentice until recently. The most common troupe roster is one puppeteer, one singer, and a band of musicians. Shadow puppetry was banned by the government in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution, but allowed back in the late 1970s.

==Textile arts==
===Chinese knot===

Chinese knotting () is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song dynasty (AD 960–1279) in China. It was later popularized in the Ming. The art is also referred to as Chinese traditional decorative knots. One of the more traditional art forms, it creates decorative knot patterns. It was not practiced during the Culture Revolution, but nowadays it is very popular again.

===Tiger-head shoes===
Tiger-head shoes are an example of traditional Chinese folk handicraft used as footwear for children. Their name comes from the toe cap, which looks like the head of a tiger.

==Musical instruments==

Bolang gu, a traditional Chinese pellet drum and toy.
Muyu, a rounded woodblock carved in the shape of a fish, it is played by striking the top with a wooden stick; often used in Buddhist chanting.

<text>Chinese variety art () is a wide range of acrobatic acts, balancing acts and other demonstrations of physical skill traditionally performed by a in China. Many of these acts have a long history in China and are still performed today.

==Circus vs variety art==
While the English term &quot;Chinese circus&quot; has been used to describe Chinese variety arts even in the earliest Western historical texts, the East views the Chinese term &quot;circus&quot; (馬戲) as an altogether separate, Western style of show. Elements such as clowns and large animals belong exclusively to the Western circus. Eastern elements include Shaolin monks, Peking opera characters and the Monkey King, for example.

==History==
Chinese performing arts have a long history. Variety show is known to existed as early as the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC) or possibly earlier. During the Qin and Han periods, &quot;Juedi&quot; (角抵) or &quot;Baixi&quot; (百戲) variety show was popular with the common people. &quot;Juedi&quot; was originally an entertainment where men wearing horns charged at one another like bulls, but became a general term used interchangeably with &quot;Baixi&quot; to describe popular entertainment during the Han dynasty. It consisted of a variety of acts such as conjuring, acrobatics, wrestling, musical performances, dance, martial arts, horsemanship, and juggling. In the Eastern Han dynasty, the scholar Zhang Heng was one of the first to describe the acrobatic theme shows in the royal palaces in his &quot;Ode to the Western Capital&quot; (西京賦). The event featured shows such as &quot;Old Man Huang of the Eastern Sea&quot; (東海黃公), the &quot;Dancing Fish and Dragon&quot; (魚龍蔓衍) and &quot;Assembly of Immortals&quot; (總會仙倡), and Zheng described swallowing knives and spitting fire, creatures that transformed into another, as well as children who performed acrobatics on high poles. A grand acrobatic show was held by Emperor Wu of Han in 108 BC for foreign guests.

The performances became more elaborate and during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), the performing arts became popular in the emperor&#x27;s court, and the acts became more refined. Eventually, the performing arts lost favor in the Imperial Court; they moved back to the common people and most performers performed in the street. During the Song dynasty the variety shows may be performed in the entertainment centres called the &quot;wazi&quot; (瓦子, meaning &quot;tiles&quot;). Towards the end of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the performers came off the street and started performing on stage. During the end of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), it regained popularity with the Imperial Court and has remained a popular art form to this day.

Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the art forms have gained new respectability. Troupes have been established in the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipals with theaters specifically dedicated to the variety arts. Some troupes have become world famous, playing to packed houses at home and on foreign tours.

It wasn&#x27;t until the 1990s, however, that the art form was packaged as a complete theme show. The 1994 show &quot;Golden Wind of the Southwest&quot; (金色西南風) led the way in successfully re-promoting the art as a whole.

==Performances==

Below is a list of performances available in the variety art. Some are more standard, while others are more regional. There is always new innovation taking place.

<text>Qaanaaq (), formerly known as Thule or New Thule, is the main town in the northern part of the Avannaata municipality in northwestern Greenland. The town has a population of 646 as of 2020. The population was forcibly relocated from its former, traditional home, which was expropriated for the construction of a United States Air Force base in 1953. The inhabitants of Qaanaaq speak the local Inuktun language and many also speak Kalaallisut and Danish.

Qaanaaq is one of the northernmost towns in the world. Within Greenland, it is the northernmost major town and the third northernmost public settlement, after nearby Qeqertat and Siorapaluk.

==Geography==

Qaanaaq is located in the northern entrance of the Inglefield Fjord. The village of Qeqertat is located in the Harvard Islands, near the head of the fjord.

== History ==

The Qaanaaq area in northern Greenland was first settled around 2000 BCE by Paleo-Eskimos migrating from the Canadian Arctic. These people were displaced by the Thule culture which followed the same migration route around 1100 CE. By 1600, climatic effects of the Little Ice Age caused the semi-nomadic Thule culture in Greenland to fragment into isolated groups, with inhabitants of the northwest diverging as the Inughuit. As they lost access to open water due to thickening sea ice, they lost the ability to build boats and had limited hunting opportunities.

In 1818, Sir John Ross&#x27;s expedition made first contact with nomadic Inuktun (Polar Eskimos) in the area. James Saunders&#x27;s expedition aboard HMS &quot;North Star&quot; was marooned in North Star Bay 1849–50 and named landmarks. Robert Peary built a support station by a protected harbor at the foot of iconic Mount Dundas in 1892. It served as a base camp for his expeditions and attracted a permanent population. In 1910 explorers Knud Rasmussen and Peter Freuchen established a missionary and trading post there. They called the site &quot;Thule&quot; after classical &quot;ultima Thule&quot;; the Inuit called it &quot;Umanaq&quot; (&quot;heart-shaped&quot;), and the site is commonly called &quot;Dundas&quot; today. The United States abandoned its territorial claims in the area in 1917 in connection with the purchase of the Virgin Islands. Denmark assumed control of the village in 1937.

A cluster of huts known as Pituffik (&quot;the place the dogs are tied&quot;) stood on the wide plain where the base was built in 1951. (A main base street was named Pituffik Boulevard.) The affected locals moved to Thule. However, in 1953 the USAF planned to construct an air defense site near that village, and in order to prevent contact with soldiers in a way deemed &quot;unhealthy&quot;, the Danish government forcibly relocated &quot;Old Thule&quot; with about 130 inhabitants to a newly constructed, modern village north, known as Qaanaaq, or &quot;New Thule&quot;. In a Danish Supreme Court judgment of 28 November 2003 the move was considered an expropriative intervention. During the proceedings it was recognized by the Danish government that the movement was a serious interference and an unlawful act against the local population. The Thule tribe was awarded damages of 500,000 kroner, and the individual members of the tribe who had been exposed to the transfer were granted compensation of 15,000 or 25,000 each. A Danish radio station continued to operate at Dundas, and the abandoned houses remained. The USAF only used that site for about a decade, and it has since returned to civilian use.

Knud Rasmussen was the first to recognize the Pituffik plain as ideal for an airport. USAAF Colonel Bernt Balchen, who built Sondrestrom Air Base, knew Rasmussen and his idea. Balchen led a flight of two Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats to Thule on 24 August 1942 and then sent a report advocating an air base to USAAF chief Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold. However, the 1951 air base site is a few miles inland from the original 1946 airstrip and across the bay from the historical Thule settlement, to which it is connected by an ice road. The joint Danish-American defense area, designated by treaty, also occupies considerable inland territory in addition to the air base itself.

The town of Qaanaaq was established in the winter of 1953 when the United States expanded Pituffik Space Base and forcibly relocated the population of Pituffik and Dundas to the north within four days. The settlement was subsequently moved another to the north.

A 48.6-kilogram (107-pound) fragment of the Cape York meteorite, discovered near Thule in the summer of 1955, is named for the town.

== Culture ==

Ways of living so far north and in such severe climatic conditions are passed on from generation to generation, and this ability to adapt has contributed to the survival of this small settlement. When the sea becomes open sometime around August, large dinghies with powerful engines are used for both hunting trips and ordinary journeys. There is still sunlight twenty-four hours a day at this time—the midnight sun lasts from the middle of April to the end of August. Scarcity of resources requires they use every part of a harvested animal: the skins are used for clothing and covering the kayaks; the flesh and offal are eaten by humans and domestic animals; the narwhal and walrus tusks are carved into finely-worked figures, jewellery and hunting implements; and feathers can be used in handicrafts.

== Education ==
The local school, Avanersuup Atuarfia, has around 120 pupils in forms 1 to 10. There is also a boarding school which holds about 20 students from surrounding settlements. The town kindergarten has a capacity of 34 children while the day nursery can hold up to 12.

== Transport ==

Air Greenland operates fixed-wing aircraft services between Qaanaaq Airport and Upernavik Airport, with further connections to Ilulissat Airport and Qaarsut Airport. Settlement flights operate to Siorapaluk, sporadically to Moriusaq, and to Savissivik via Pituffik Space Base.

There are a few unpaved dirt roads in Qaanaaq. Only one road leaves the town — it connects to Qaanaaq Airport. Pickup trucks and SUVs are found in Qaanaaq, but skis, dogsleds and walking are better alternatives for getting around.

==Medical and emergency services==

There is a small hospital (built in the 1950s and rebuilt in 1996) in Qaanaaq with basic health care offered. More advanced care requires transfer to other medical centers in Greenland by air. Dental care is offered in the form of a dentist who visits the town twice a year. Qaanaaq Hospital falls under the Avannaa health region.

A small local fire brigade is assisted by firefighters from the Pituffik Space Base.

==Government==
The town is part of the region of Avannaata, which is represented by a 17-member council and mayor.

== CTBTO Station ==
Qaanaaq is home to a remote CTBTO infrasound listening station called IS-18, which uses an array of barometric sensors to detect possible nuclear tests around the world. The station is maintained by the Danish Meteorological Institute, and as of 2016 the current operator is Svend Erik Ascanius.

== Population ==
With 646 inhabitants as of 2020, Qaanaaq is the largest settlement in the far north of the country. Its population has been relatively stable with only minor fluctuations since the mid-1990s.

The city, with its relatively low population and tradition of hunting, currently has more huskies than human residents.

==Climate==

Qaanaaq has a cold tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;), and hence it has long, cold winters. July and August are the warmest months, and peak high temperatures rarely exceeding occur in June and July.

<doc id="283764" wikidata="Q671008" url="?curid=283764" title="Thule">
<text>Thule ( ; also spelled as &quot;Thylē&quot;) is the most northerly location mentioned in ancient Greek and Roman literature and cartography. First written of by the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia (modern-day Marseille, France) in about 320 BC, it was often described by later writers as an island north of the British Isles. Modern interpretations have included Orkney, Shetland, Northern Scotland, the Faroe Islands, or Iceland. Other potential locations are the island of Saaremaa (Ösel) in Estonia, or the Norwegian island of Smøla.

In classical and medieval literature, ultima Thule (Latin &quot;farthest Thule&quot;) acquired a metaphorical meaning of any distant place located beyond the &quot;borders of the known world&quot;. By the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, the Greco-Roman Thule was often identified with the real Iceland or Greenland. Sometimes &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; was a Latin name for Greenland, when &quot;Thule&quot; was used for Iceland. By the 19th century, however, &quot;Thule&quot; was frequently identified with Norway, Denmark, the whole of Scandinavia, one of the larger Scottish islands, the Faroes, or several of those locations.

Thule formerly gave its name to real places. In 1910, the explorer Knud Rasmussen established a missionary and trading post in north-western Greenland, which he named &quot;Thule&quot; (later Qaanaaq). It later gave its name to the northernmost United States Air Force base, Thule Air Base, in northwest Greenland. With the transfer of the base to the United States Space Force, its name was changed to Pituffik Space Base on April 6, 2023.

==Classical and medieval accounts==
The Greek explorer Pytheas of the Greek city of Massalia (now Marseille, France) is the first to have written of Thule, after his travels between 330 and 320 BC. Pytheas mentioned going to Thule in his now lost work, &quot;On The Ocean&quot; Τὰ περὶ τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ (&quot;ta peri tou Okeanou&quot;). L. Sprague de Camp wrote that &quot;the city of Massalia... sent Pytheas to scout northern Europe to see where their trade-goods were coming from.&quot; Descriptions of some of his discoveries have survived in the works of later, often skeptical, authors. Polybius in his work &quot;The Histories&quot; (c. 140 BC), Book XXXIV, cites Pytheas as one &quot;who has led many people into error by saying that he traversed the whole of Britain on foot, giving the island a circumference of forty thousand stadia, and telling us also about Thule, those regions in which there was no longer any proper land nor sea nor air, but a sort of mixture of all three of the consistency of a jellyfish in which one can neither walk nor sail, holding everything together, so to speak.&quot;

The first century BC Greek astronomer Geminus of Rhodes claimed that the name Thule went back to an archaic word for the polar night phenomenon – &quot;the place where the sun goes to rest&quot;. Dionysius Periegetes in his &quot;De situ habitabilis orbis&quot; also touched upon this subject, as did Martianus Capella. Avienius in his &quot;Ora Maritima&quot; added that during the summer on Thule night lasted only two hours, a clear reference to the midnight sun.

Strabo, in his &quot;Geographica&quot; (c. AD 30), mentions Thule in describing Eratosthenes&#x27; calculation of &quot;the breadth of the inhabited world&quot; and notes that Pytheas says it &quot;is a six days&#x27; sail north of Britain, and is near the frozen sea&quot;. But he then doubts this claim, writing that Pytheas has &quot;been found, upon scrutiny, to be an arch falsifier, but the men who have seen Britain and Ireland do not mention Thule, though they speak of other islands, small ones, about Britain&quot;. Strabo adds the following in Book 5: &quot;Now Pytheas of Massilia tells us that Thule, the most northerly of the Britannic Islands, is farthest north, and that there the circle of the summer tropic is the same as the Arctic Circle. But from the other writers I learn nothing on the subject – neither that there exists a certain island by the name of Thule, nor whether the northern regions are inhabitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomes the Arctic Circle.&quot; Strabo ultimately concludes, &quot;Concerning Thule, our historical information is still more uncertain, on account of its outside position; for Thule, of all the countries that are named, is set farthest north.&quot; The inhabitants or people of Thule are described in most detail by Strabo (citing Pytheas): &quot;the people (of Thule) live on millet and other herbs, and on fruits and roots; and where there are grain and honey, the people get their beverage, also, from them. As for the grain, he says, since they have no pure sunshine, they pound it out in large storehouses, after first gathering in the ears thither; for the threshing floors become useless because of this lack of sunshine and because of the rains&quot;.

The mid-first century Roman geographer Pomponius Mela placed Thule north of Scythia.

In AD 77, Pliny the Elder published his &quot;Natural History&quot; in which he also cites Pytheas&#x27; claim (in Book II, Chapter 75) that Thule is a six-day sail north of Britain. Then, when discussing the islands around Britain, he writes: &quot;The farthest of all, which are known and spoke of, is Thule; in which there be no nights at all, as we have declared, about mid-summer, namely when the Sun passes through the sign Cancer; and contrariwise no days in mid-winter: and each of these times they suppose, do last six months, all day, or all night.&quot; Finally, in refining the island&#x27;s location, he places it along the most northerly parallel of those he describes: &quot;Last of all is the Scythian parallel, from the Rhiphean hills into Thule: wherein (as we said) it is day and night continually by turns (for six months).&quot;

Cleomedes referenced Pytheas&#x27; journey to Thule, but added no new information.

The Roman poet Silius Italicus (AD 25 – 101) wrote that the people of Thule were painted blue: &quot;the blue-painted native of Thule, when he fights, drives around the close-packed ranks in his scythe-bearing chariot&quot;, implying a link to the Picts (whose exonym is derived from the Latin &quot;pictus&quot; &quot;painted&quot;). Martial (AD 40 – 104) talks about &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;painted Britons&quot;, just like Julius Caesar. Claudian (AD 370 – 404) also believed that the inhabitants of Thule were Picts.

The Roman historian Tacitus, in his book chronicling the life of his father-in-law, Agricola, describes how the Romans knew that Britain (in which Agricola was Roman commander) was an island rather than a continent, by circumnavigating it. Tacitus writes of a Roman ship visiting Orkney and claims the ship&#x27;s crew even sighted Thule. However their orders were not to explore there, as winter was at hand. Some scholars believe that Tacitus was referring to Shetland.

The third-century Latin grammarian Gaius Julius Solinus wrote in his &quot;Polyhistor&quot; that &quot;Thyle, which was distant from Orkney by a voyage of five days and nights, was fruitful and abundant in the lasting yield of its crops&quot;. The fourth-century Virgilian commentator Servius also believed that Thule sat close to Orkney: &quot;Thule; an island in the Ocean between the northern and western zone, beyond Britain, near Orkney and Ireland; in this Thule, when the sun is in Cancer, it is said that there are perpetual days without nights...&quot;

Other late classical writers such as Orosius (384–420) describe Thule as being north and west of both Ireland and Britain, strongly suggesting that it was Iceland.

Solinus (d. AD 400) in his &quot;Polyhistor&quot;, repeated these descriptions, noting that the people of Thule had a fertile land where they grew a good production of crop and fruits.

Early in the fifth century AD Claudian, in his poem, &quot;On the Fourth Consulship of the Emperor Honorius&quot;, Book VIII, rhapsodizes on the conquests of the emperor Theodosius I, declaring that the &quot;Orcades&quot; &quot;ran red with Saxon slaughter; Thule was warm with the blood of Picts; ice-bound Hibernia [Ireland] wept for the heaps of slain Scots&quot;. This implies that Thule was Scotland. But in &quot;Against Rufinias&quot;, the Second Poem, Claudian writes of &quot;Thule lying icebound beneath the pole-star&quot;. Jordanes in his &quot;Getica&quot; also wrote that Thule sat under the pole star.

In the writings of the historian Procopius, from the first half of the sixth century, Thule is a large island in the north inhabited by 25 tribes. It is believed that Procopius is really talking about a part of Scandinavia, since several tribes are easily identified, including the Geats (&quot;Gautoi&quot;) in present-day Sweden and the Sami people (&quot;Scrithiphini&quot;). He also writes that when the Herules returned, they passed the Warini and the Danes and then crossed the sea to Thule, where they settled beside the Geats. Procopius&#x27;s Thule is believed to be the same place as Scandza, as described by Jordanes. Procopius says its inhabitants are pagans who practice human sacrifice. According to Procopius, the sun doesn&#x27;t rise for forty days around the time of the winter solstice in Thule. After the winter solstice, the people of Thule send men to the mountaintops, and when they first glimpse the sun above the horizon, they send word to the people in the valleys below. On hearing the good news, the people of Thule then celebrate their greatest festival.

In the early seventh century, Isidore of Seville wrote in his &quot;Etymologies&quot; that:Ultima Thule (&quot;Thyle ultima&quot;) is an island of the Ocean in the northwestern region, beyond Britannia, taking its name from the sun, because there the sun makes its summer solstice, and there is no daylight beyond (&quot;ultra&quot;) this. Hence its sea is sluggish and frozen.Isidore distinguished this from the islands of Britannia, Thanet (&quot;Tanatos&quot;), the Orkney (&quot;Orcades&quot;), and Ireland (&quot;Scotia&quot; or &quot;Hibernia&quot;). Isidore was to have a large influence upon Bede, who was later to mention Thule.

The Irish monk Dicuil in his &quot;Liber De Mensura Orbis Terrae&quot; (written circa 825) after quoting various classical sources describing Thule, says &quot;It is now thirty years since clerics, who had lived on the island from the first of February to the first of August, told me that not only at the summer solstice, but in the days round about it, the sun setting in the evening hides itself as though behind a small hill in such a way that there was no darkness in that very small space of time, and a man could do whatever he wished as though the sun were there, even remove lice from his shirt, and if they had been on a mountain-top perhaps the sun would never have been hidden from them. In the middle of that moment of time it is midnight at the equator, and thus, on the contrary, I think that at the winter solstice and for a few days about it dawn appears only for the smallest space at Thule, when it is noon at the equator. Therefore those authors are wrong and give wrong information, who have written that the sea will be solid about Thule, and that day without night continues right through from the vernal to the autumnal equinox, and that vice versa night continues uninterrupted from the autumnal to the vernal equinox, since these men voyaged at the natural time of great cold, and entered the island and remaining on it had day and night alternately except for the period of the solstice. But one day&#x27;s sail north of that they did find the sea frozen over. There are many other islands in the ocean to the north of Britain which can be reached from the northern islands of Britain in a direct voyage of two days and nights with sails filled with a continuously favourable wind. A devout priest told me that in two summer days and the intervening night he sailed in a two-benched boat and entered one of them. There is another set of small islands, nearly all separated by narrow stretches of water; in these for nearly a hundred years hermits sailing from our country, Ireland, have lived. But just as they were always deserted from the beginning of the world, so now because of the Northman pirates they are emptied of anchorites, and filled with countless sheep and very many diverse kinds of sea-birds. I have never found these islands mentioned in the authorities&quot;.

===Modern research===
A map of the world voyage done by Sir Francis Drake in 1577-1580 shows Thule (Tile/Tule) as what is likely modern Iceland near Greenland.

The British surveyor Charles Vallancey (1731–1812) was one of many antiquarians to argue that Ireland was Thule, as he does in his book &quot;An essay on the antiquity of the Irish language&quot;. Scottish historian W.F. Skene identified Thule as Kintyre peninsula in 1876 based upon a description given by Solinus.

Another hypothesis, first proposed by Lennart Meri in 1976, holds that the island of Saaremaa (which is often known by the exonym Ösel) in Estonia, could be Thule. That is, there is a phonological similarity between Thule and the root &quot;tule-&quot; &quot;of fire&quot; in Estonian (and other Finnic languages). A crater lake named Kaali on the island appears to have been formed by a meteor strike in prehistory. This meteor strike is often linked to Estonian folklore which has it that Saaremaa was a place where the sun at one point &quot;went to rest&quot;.

Nazi Germany leadership considered Iceland to be the Thule area and the birthplace of the ancient Aryan race, with senior Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler even sending an expedition team to Iceland in 1938 with hopes of finding a temple for Nordic gods like Thor and Odin. 

In 2010, scientists from the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation Science at Technische Universität Berlin claimed to have identified persistent errors in calculation that had occurred in attempts by modern geographers to superimpose geographic coordinate systems upon Ptolemaic maps. After correcting for these errors, the scientists claimed, Ptolemy&#x27;s Thule could be mapped to the Norwegian island of Smøla.

==Namesakes==
In 1775, during his second voyage, Captain Cook named an island in the high southern latitudes of the South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Thule. The name is now used for a group of three southernmost islands in the South Sandwich Islands, one of which is called Thule Island. The island group became a British overseas territory of the United Kingdom, albeit also claimed by Argentina (in Spanish &quot;Islas Tule del Sur&quot;). The Southern Thule islands were occupied by Argentina in 1976. The occupation was not militarily contested by the British until the 1982 Falklands War, during which time British sovereignty was restored by a contingent of Royal Marines. Currently the three islands are uninhabited.

In 1910, the explorer Knud Rasmussen established a missionary and trading post, which he named Thule (Inuit: &quot;Avannaa&quot;) on Greenland. The Thule people, the predecessor of modern Inuit Greenlanders, were named after the Thule region. In 1953, Avannaa became Thule Air Base, operated by United States Air Force. The population was forced to resettle to New Thule (Qaanaaq), to the north ( only 840 NM from the North Pole).
The Scottish Gaelic for Iceland is &quot;Innis Tile&quot;, which literally means the &quot;Isle of Thule&quot;.

Thule lends its name to the 69th element in the periodic table, thulium.

Ultima Thule is the name of a location in the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky, United States. It was formerly the terminus of the known-explorable southeastern (upstream) end of the passage called &quot;Main Cave&quot;, before discoveries made in 1908 by Ed Bishop and Max Kaemper showed an area accessible beyond it, now the location of the Violet City Entrance. The Violet City Lantern tour offered at the cave passes through Ultima Thule near the conclusion of the route.

In March 2018, following a naming competition, the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth, a fly-by target of the NASA probe &quot;New Horizons&quot;, was nicknamed &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;. The fly-by took place on 1 January 2019, and was the most distant encounter between a spacecraft and a planetary body. An official name for the body has since been assigned by the International Astronomical Union.

==Literary references==
===Classical literature===
In the metaphorical sense of a far-off land or an unattainable goal, Virgil coined the term &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; (Georgics, 1. 30) meaning &quot;farthermost Thule&quot;.

Seneca the Younger writes of a day when new lands will be discovered past Thule. This was later quoted widely in the context of Christopher Columbus&#x27; voyages.

A work of prose fiction in Greek by Antonius Diogenes entitled &quot;The Wonders Beyond Thule&quot; appeared c. AD 150 or earlier. (Gerald N. Sandy, in the introduction to his translation of Photius&#x27; ninth century summary of the work,
notes that this Thule most closely matches Iceland.)

The &quot;known world&#x27; of the Europeans came to be viewed as bounded in the east by India and in the west by Thule, as expressed in the &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; (III, 203 = metrus V, v. 7) by Boethius. &quot;For though the earth, as far as India&#x27;s shore, tremble before the laws you give, though Thule bow to your service on earth&#x27;s farthest bounds, yet if thou canst not drive away black cares, if thou canst not put to flight complaints, then is no true power thine.&quot;

===Medieval and early modern literature===
By the Late Middle Ages, scholars were linking Iceland and/or Greenland to the name Thule and/or places reported by the Irish mariner Saint Brendan (in the 6th century) and other distant or mythical locations, such as Hy Brasil and Cockaigne. These scholars included works by Dicuil (see above), the Anglo-Saxon monk the Venerable Bede in &quot;De ratione temporum&quot;, the Landnámabók, by the anonymous &quot;Historia Norwegie&quot;, and by the German cleric Adam of Bremen in his &quot;Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church&quot;, where they cite both ancient writers&#x27; use of Thule as well as new knowledge since the end of antiquity. All these authors also understood that other islands were situated to the north of Britain.

Eustathius of Thessalonica, in his twelfth-century commentary on the &quot;Iliad,&quot; wrote that the inhabitants of Thule were at war with a tribe whose members dwarf-like, only 20 fingers in height. The American classical scholar Charles Anthon believed this legend may have been rooted in history (although exaggerated), if the dwarf or pygmy tribe were interpreted as being a smaller aboriginal tribe of Britain which the people on Thule had encountered.

Petrarch, in the fourteenth century, wrote in his &quot;Epistolae familiares&quot; (&quot;Familiar Letters&quot;) that Thule lay in the unknown regions of the far north-west.

A madrigal by Thomas Weelkes, entitled &quot;Thule&quot; (1600), describes it with reference to the Icelandic volcano Hekla: 

The English poet Ambrose Philips began, but did not complete, a poem concerning &quot;&quot; which he published in 1748.

Thule is referred to in Goethe&#x27;s poem &quot;Der König in Thule&quot; (1774). The King and Kingdom of Thule referenced in the poem have no historical basis, nor did Goethe claim such. Goethe&#x27;s poem was 
famously set to music by Franz Schubert (D 367, 1816), Franz Liszt (S.531) and Robert Schumann (Op.67, No.1), and in the collection &quot;&quot; (1880) by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

===Modern literature===

Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;Dream-Land&quot; (1844) begins with the following stanza: 

John Henry Wilbrandt Stuckenberg wrote on the subject in 1885: 

Kelly Miller, addressing the Hampton Alumni Association in 1899, explained that

&quot;Civilization may be defined as the sum total of those influences and agencies that make for knowledge and virtue. This is the goal, the &quot;ultima Thule,&quot; of all human strivings. The essential factors of civilization are knowledge, industry, culture, and virture.&quot;

&quot;Ultima Thule&quot; is the title of the 1929 novel by Henry Handel Richardson, set in colonial Australia.

Hal Foster&#x27;s protagonist Prince Valiant gets his title from being the son of Aguar, exiled king of Thule who has taken refuge in the Fens during the days of King Arthur. Foster places this kingdom of Thule on the Norwegian mainland, near Trondheim.

&quot;Ultima Thule&quot; is a short story written by author Vladimir Nabokov and published in &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine on April 7, 1973.

Ultima Thule is mentioned in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; by Umberto Eco in reference to an illuminated manuscript that the narrator/character Adso sees when he explores the library labyrinth alone at the end of the third day. &quot;I opened a richly illuminated volume that, by its style, seemed to me to come from the monasteries of Ultima Thule.&quot;

Jorge Luis Borges uses the classic Latin phrase &quot;ultima Thule&quot; in his poem A Reader. He uses the phrase to connect the study of Latin in his younger years to his more recent efforts to read the Icelandic poet Snorri Sturluson.

Bernard Cornwell references Thule in his novel &quot;The Lords of the North&quot;, the third book in the series &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;. The character Uhtred of Bebbanburg calls it, &quot;that strange land of ice and flame&quot;.

Thule is mentioned in &quot;Asterix and the Chieftain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Cassandra Clare&#x27;s &quot;The Shadowhunter Chronicles&quot;, features an alternate dimension called Thule.

Thule is the name of an artificial polar island in Sue Burke&#x27;s sci-fi novel Dual Memory.

==In Nazi ideology==
Some followers of ariosophy in early 20th-century Germany hypothesized a historical Thule, or Hyperborea, as the ancient origin of the &quot;Aryan race&quot; (a term which they believed had been used by the hypothetical Proto-Indo-European people). The Thule Society (&quot;Thule Gesellschaft&quot;), which had close links to the &quot;Deutsche Arbeiter Partei&quot; (DAP), the precursor organization to the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (NSDAP), was, according to its own account, founded on August18, 1918. In his biography of Lanz von Liebenfels (1874–1954), &quot;Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab&quot; (published in Munich, 1985; translated as &quot;The Man who Gave Hitler the Ideas&quot;), the Viennese psychologist and author Wilfried Daim wrote that the Thule Gesellschaft name originated from mythical Thule. In his history of the SA (&quot;Mit ruhig festem Schritt&quot;, 1998 – &quot;With Firm and Steady Step&quot;), Wilfred von Oven, Joseph Goebbels&#x27; press adjutant from 1943 to 1945, confirmed that Pytheas&#x27; Thule was the historical Thule for the &quot;Thule Gesellschaft&quot;.

Much of this interest in Thule was initially due to rumours surrounding the &quot;Oera Linda Book&quot;, claimed to have been found by Cornelis over de Linden in the 19th century. The &quot;Oera Linda Book&quot; was partially translated into German in 1933 by Herman Wirth and was favoured by Heinrich Himmler. The book has since been discredited. Professor of Frisian Language and Literature Goffe Jensma wrote that the three authors of the translation intended it &quot;to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way&quot;.

<text>The Thule ( , ) or proto-Inuit were the ancestors of all modern Inuit. They developed in coastal Alaska by 1000 AD and expanded eastward across northern Canada, reaching Greenland by the 13th century. In the process, they replaced people of the earlier Dorset culture who had previously inhabited the region. The appellation &quot;Thule&quot; originates from the location of Thule (relocated and renamed Qaanaaq in 1953) in northwest Greenland, facing Canada, where the archaeological remains of the people were first found at Comer&#x27;s Midden.

Evidence supports the idea that the Thule (and, to a lesser degree, the Dorset) were in contact with the Vikings, who had reached the shores of Canada in the 11th century as part of the Norse colonization of North America. In Viking sources, these peoples are called the &quot;Skrælingjar&quot;.

Some Thule migrated southward, in the &quot;Second Expansion&quot; or &quot;Second Phase&quot;. By the 13th or 14th century, the Thule had occupied an area inhabited until then by the Central Inuit, and by the 15th century, the Thule had replaced the Dorset.

Intensified contacts with Europeans began in the 18th century. Compounded by the already disruptive effects of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; (1650–1850), the Thule communities broke apart, and the people became known as the Eskimo, and later, Inuit.

==History==
The Thule Tradition lasted from about 200 BC to 1600 AD around the Bering Strait, the Thule people being the prehistoric ancestors of the Inuit. The Thule culture was mapped out by Therkel Mathiassen, following his participation as an archaeologist and cartographer of the Fifth Danish Expedition to Arctic America in 1921–1924. He excavated sites on Baffin Island and the northwestern Hudson Bay region, which he considered to be the remains of a highly developed Eskimo whaling culture that had originated in Alaska and moved to Arctic Canada approximately 1000 years ago. 

There are three stages of development leading up to Thule culture: the Okvik/Old Bering Sea stage, the Punuk stage, and the Birnirk stage. These stages represent variations of the Thule Tradition as it expanded over time. These groups of peoples have been referred to as &quot;Neo-Eskimo&quot; cultures, which are differentiated from the earlier Norton Tradition. The Thule Tradition replaced the Dorset Tradition in the Eastern Arctic and introduced both kayaks and umiaks, or skin covered boats, into the archaeological record. They also developed new uses for iron and copper and demonstrated advanced harpoon technology and use of bowhead whales, the largest animal in the Arctic.

===Old Bering Sea stage, 200 BC to AD 500===

The Old Bering Sea (OBS) stage was first characterized by Diamond Jenness, on the basis of a collection of deeply patinated decorated ivory harpoon heads and other objects dug up by natives on the St. Lawrence and Diomede Islands. Jenness identified the Bering Sea culture as a highly developed Inuit culture of northeastern Asiatic origin and pre-Thule in age.

A strong maritime adaptation is characteristic of the Thule, and the OBS stage, and then can be seen in the archaeological evidence. Both Kayaks and umiaks (large skinned boats) appear in the archaeological record for the first time. The toolkits of the people of the time are dominated by polished-slate rather than flaked-stone artifacts, including lanceolate knives, projectile heads, and the ulu transverse-bladed knife. The people also made a crude form of pottery and there was much use of bone and antlers for heads on harpoons, as well as to make darts, spears, snow goggles, blubber scrapers, needles, awls and mattocks, also walrus shoulder-blade snow shovels.

There are many important innovations that emerged that allowed hunting to be more efficient. Harpoon mounted ice picks were used for seal hunting, as well as ivory plugs and mouthpieces for inflating harpoon line floats, which enabled them to recover larger sea mammals when dispatched. These people relied heavily on seal and walrus for subsistence. It is easy to pick out OBS technology because of the artistic curvilinear dots, circles, and shorter lines that were used to decorate their tools.

The chronological relationship between the Okvik and Old Bering Seas cultures has been the subject of debate and remains largely undecided, based mainly on art styles. Some consider it to be a distinct culture pre-dating Old Bering Sea, but the close similarity and overlapping radiocarbon dates suggest Okvik and Old Bering Sea are best considered as roughly contemporaneous, with regional variants.

A 2019 genetic analysis concluded that between 2,700 and 4,900 years ago, the ancestors of the Thule emerged in Alaska through admixture between the Paleo-Eskimo and the Ocean Bay Tradition and that these ancestors subsequently migrated back to Siberia where they became the Old Bering Sea, only to eventually return to Alaska.

===Punuk and Birnirk stages, c. 800 to 1400===
The Punuk stage is a development of Old Bering Sea stage, with distribution along the major Strait islands and along to shores of the Chukchi Peninsula. The Punuk culture was initially defined by Henry Collins in 1928 from a deep midden on one of the Punuk Islands. Later excavation on St Lawrence Island confirmed Jenness&#x27;s ideas on the Bering Sea culture, and demonstrated a continual cultural sequence on the island from Old Bering Sea, to Punuk, to modern Eskimo culture.

Punuk is differentiated with Old Bering Sea through its artifact styles and house forms, as well as harpoon styles and whale hunting. Punuk settlements were larger and more common than earlier villages. They were subterranean, square or rectangular dwellings with wooden floors. The house was held up by whale jaw-bones, and covered in skins, sod and then snow. These houses were nicely insulated, and would have been only visible to the occupants.

Whaling has a greater emphasis in the Punuk stage. Hunters would use umiaks and kill whales in narrow ice leads as well as in the open sea in the fall. Open sea whaling required skilled leadership, teams of expert boatmen and hunters, and the cooperation of several boats. The whaleboat captain, the umialik, is still a prominent position in Arctic communities today. Chipped stone tools were replaced by ground slate, ivory winged tolls were largely replaced by tridents, and iron-tipped tools were used for engraving. Harpoon styles became simpler and more standardised, as did Punuk art. The Punuk developed their methods of hunting that led to the creation of armor made from bone as well as the technology of the bow and arrow. As well, bone plated wrist guards, the reinforced bow, bird bola, heavy ivory net sinkers, and blunt tipped bird arrows appeared in the Punuk stage.

Birnirk culture is best known along coastal northern and western Alaska. There are three phases of Birnirk culture: Early Birnirk, Middle Birnirk, and Late Birnirk. These phases were primarily distinguishable by gradual changes in harpoon head and arrow styles. Harpoon heads were more often made of antler, rather than ivory, and were characterized by medially-placed, trifurcated spurs during Early Birnirk, bifurcated in Middle Birnirk, and single-laterally-placed spurs in Late Birnirk.

The Birnirk people used many of the same hunting methods and technology as Punuk and Old Bering Sea, but there was no art. There is very little evidence of tool or weapon decoration. The little art that was present in the Birnirk stage was limited to spiral and concentric motifs on clay pots with bone paddles. They did use sledges, of the same basic design as were later used with dog teams. Birnirk people were sea-mammal hunters who engaged in fishing and whaling. Birnirk houses were square shaped, with walls constructed of horizontal logs and single or double posts in each corner. Sleeping areas were at the back of the dwelling and were either built up or at floor level. No interior hearths were found in the house ruins, although heavily encrusted and fire-blackened pottery vessel fragments suggest extensive use of open fires.

===Classic stage, 1100 to 1400===
During this time, eastern Thule spread out throughout the High Arctic and into the south. Thule people were living along the Hudson Strait coasts, in the Hudson Bay region, on the shores of the Foxe Basin, and along the present-day Canadian mainland from the Mackenzie Delta to the Melville Peninsula. The archaeologist Alan McCartney originally coined the term &quot;Classic Thule&quot; with reference to the population that existed between 1100 and 1400 AD.

The Thule people still lived in semi-subterranean winter houses, but in the summer moved into skin tents, the edges held down by circles of stone. The Thule were using iron long before European contact. In the west it was used in small quantities for carving knives and for engraving other tools. The iron came both from meteoric resources and from trade from the Norse expansion; the Thule worked raw iron into tools for their own use. Iron enabled the Thule people to work with more materials to make more wood and bone tools. The only problem they faced was a lack of a steady supply of metal. The Thule were clever with technology. Reports on classic Thule sites lists myriad artifacts used for hunting. Classic Thule did not place much emphasis on art. There were slight artistic details on household things such as combs but it involved very simple, linear designs featuring people without appendages, animals, or symbols that represented the human ties with the supernatural world.

===Post-Classic stage, 1400 to 1600===
Post-Classic Thule tradition existed from 1400 up until European contact in areas where whales were not as prevalent so there is an increase in evidence of other means of subsistence, such as caribou, seal and fish. These settlements show a more gradual settlement of fewer whales and using more subsistence strategies from the west. The redistribution of the Thule people reflects the population pressures of the Classic Thule, but the climate played a more important role. The onset of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; that occurred between 1400 and 1600 limited the use of boats and number of whales present in the area. This shortened the season for open-water whale hunting. By the 16th century, umiak and kayak whale hunting had ceased in the High Arctic. By 1600, the people had moved on and abandoned the High Arctic due to the severe climate changes. The Thule Eskimos who lived near open water were not as affected by the decrease in temperature. It was during this time that local groups such as the Copper Inuit, Netsilik, and Inglulingmuit (Inuit from the Igloolik area) emerged.

===Expansion into West and Eastern Arctic===
Between 900 and 1100, the Thule Tradition spread westward. The efficiency of housing was improved as they spread to the west and hunting methods were improved due to the use of dog sleds, umiaks, and kayaks. This enabled the hunters to travel further to hunt and follow the migration of the large game and sea mammals. After 1000, the practice of using polished slate for tool making continued to spread to the Aleutian Islands. The methods of pottery making also spread and replaced the Norton tradition in Southern Alaska. There were differences between the areas to which the tradition migrated. Houses in the more eastern region were more above ground and round with stone platforms to sleep on. The shape and support for the buildings came from whale bones. Eastern populations preferred soapstone domestic items instead of pottery and developed the use of dogs to pull sleds.

Sometime around the beginning of the 2nd millennium, Thule people began migrating east. As western Thule peoples settled the northern and western coasts of Alaska, other Thule groups migrated eastward across the Canadian Arctic as far as Greenland. Prior to 1000, the central and eastern Canadian Arctic were occupied by people of the Dorset Culture. Within a few centuries, Dorset culture was completely displaced by Thule immigrants from the west. Evidence of contact between Dorset and Thule peoples is scarce and the nature of the Dorset/Thule succession remains poorly understood.

Thule culture was first identified in the Eastern Arctic by interdisciplinary researches of Danish scholars between 1921 and 1924. A team of anthropologists, archaeologists and natural scientists compiled a massive description of the Canadian Arctic on the fifth Thule expedition. Therkel Mathiassen added upon their research and claimed that the tradition had started out in Alaska, and that Thule hunting was based on the dog sled, the large skin boat and the kayak which enabled them to range over a much greater hunting territory, participate in widespread trade, and transport heavier loads. Mathiassen was right about his hypotheses and even mapped out the Thule migration and interaction with Greenland.

There are many different theories as to why the Thule moved out of the Bering Strait. One is the cultural-ecological model developed by R. McGhee. The idea is that the first Thule families to move followed groups of bowhead whales, which were an important source of food, fuel and raw materials. The onset of the Neo-Atlantic climatic episode, a warming trend which occurred between 900 and 1200 in the northern hemisphere, resulted in the lengthened season of open water along the North Alaskan Coast, and an extension of the summer range of bowhead whales into the Beaufort Sea and further east into the Canadian Archipelago. Like other whale species, bowheads tend to avoid ice-choked channels and passages because of the possibility of entrapment and death. General climatic warming may have reduced the extent and severity of pack ice, allowing bowheads and their Thule predators to expand eastward.

Another theory is that warfare in Alaska or a desire to seek out new resources of iron for making tools such as knives may have encouraged people to move eastward. Archaeologists have used the distribution of early Alaskan-style harpoon heads to track the routes taken by Thule people. One route follows the Beaufort Sea coast and Amundsen Gulf, entering the High Arctic via Parry Channel and Smith Sound. A second route led the Thule south, along the western coast of Hudson Bay.

==Culture==

The culture of the Thule people varied greatly from the Dorset. Their success in hunting bowhead whales was facilitated through their use of large boats, and their vast foraging range through the use of dog sleds. In prime whaling areas, known Thule sites regularly contain fifteen to twenty houses, and in one case sixty. Clusters of houses suggest extended family units, and communal structures dedicated to ceremony have also been identified. Some form of hierarchical social structure may be identifiable though variations in dwelling size, form, and content (whaling equipment, non-local goods, etc.) which could point to a difference in social status between families or households. The presence of small quantities of native copper from the western arctic and meteoric iron from north-west Greenland indicate the existence of trade networks taking place in Thule culture.

==Tools==
The different stages of the Thule Tradition are distinguished by their different styles of making tools and art. The later stages, Punuk and Birnirk, have greater representation in the archaeological record and are said to have spread further and lasted longer than their predecessor, the Old Bering Sea Stage. The Thule people are well known for their technological advances in transportation and hunting techniques and tools. The harpoon played a very significant role in whaling and the Thule people made several types of harpoon points out of whale bone. They also made inflated harpoon line floats to help them hunt larger prey. Where available, they used and traded iron from meteorites such as the Cape York meteorite.

==Subsistence==

The Classic Thule tradition relied heavily on the bowhead whale for survival because bowhead whales swim slowly and sleep near the water&#x27;s surface. Bowhead whales served many purposes for the Thule people. The people could get a lot of meat for food, blubber for oil that could be used for fires for light and cooking purposes, and the bones could be used for building structures and making tools. The Thule people survived predominantly on fish, large sea mammals and caribou outside of the whaling communities. Because they had advanced transportation technology, they had access to a wider range of food sources. There is superb faunal preservation in Thule sites due to a late prehistoric date as well as an arctic environment. Most of the bowhead artifacts were harvested from live bowhead whales. The Thule developed an expertise in hunting and utilizing as many parts of an animal as possible. This knowledge combined with their growing wealth of tools and modes of transportation allowed the Thule people to thrive. They whaled together where one person would shoot the whale with the harpoon and the others would throw the floats on it and they all transferred the whale to land to butcher it together to share with the entire community. Their unity played a significant role in the length of time they thrived in the Arctic.

==Sites and projects==
There are several major archaeological research projects that have been conducted on the Thule culture at sites including Torngat Archaeological Project, Somerset Island, The Clachan site, Coronation Gulf, Nelson River, Baffin Island, Victoria Island, the Bell site, Devon Island – QkHn-12, and Cape York.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in August 2014 examined the remains of a large number of Thule people buried between ca. 1050 AD and 1600 AD. The examined individuals belonged overwhelmingly to the maternal haplogroup A2a, while samples of A, A2b and D3a2a were also detected. It was found that the Thule people probably descended from the Birnirk culture of Siberia, and that they were genetically very different from the indigenous Dorset people of northern Canada and Greenland, whom they culturally and genetically completely replaced around 1300 AD. The study found no evidence of genetic mixing between the Thule people and Greenlandic Norse people.

<doc id="283771" wikidata="Q1154986" url="?curid=283771" title="Perfect crime">
<text>A perfect crime is a crime that is undetected, unattributed to an identifiable perpetrator, or otherwise unsolved or unsolvable. The term is used colloquially in law and fiction (especially crime fiction) for both crimes committed as crimes foremost, and those committed as a kind of technical achievement on the part of the perpetrator.

The term perfect crime connotes one that is (or appears likely to be) &quot;unable&quot; to be solved, which distinguishes it from one that has merely not yet been solved, or where everyday chance or procedural matters frustrate a conviction.

In certain contexts, such as a poisoning, some argue the bar must be raised to where the mere detection of a crime having been committed renders it imperfect.

== Overview ==

As used by some criminologists and others who study criminal investigations (including mystery writers), a perfect crime goes unsolved not because of incompetence in the investigation, but because of the cleverness and skill of the criminal.

Would-be perfect crimes are a popular subject in crime fiction and movies. They include &quot;Perfect Crime (play)&quot;, &quot;Rope&quot;, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;Special 26 ,&quot; &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, and &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;.

== Varying definitions ==

A murder committed by somebody who had never before met the victim, has no criminal record, steals nothing, and tells no one might be a perfect crime. According to criminologists and scientists, this casual definition of perfect crime exists. Another possibility is that a crime might be committed in an area of high public traffic, where DNA from a wide variety of people is present, making the sifting of evidence akin to &#x27;finding a needle in a haystack&#x27;.

An intentional killing in which the death is never identified as murder is an example of one of the more rigorous definitions of perfect crime. Other criminologists narrow the range to only those crimes that are not detected at all. By definition, it can never be known if such perfect crimes exist. Many &quot;close calls&quot; have been observed, however—enough to make investigators aware of the possibility of a perfect crime.

=== Unprosecutable crime ===

In 2005, Professor Brian C. Kalt of Michigan State University College of Law put forth an argument that the Vicinage Clause of the United States Constitution – requiring jury selection from the population of the state and court district where the crime is committed – may permit the commission of the &quot;perfect crime&quot; on the technical grounds that a jury trial could not be carried out. Since there are no residents in the portion of Yellowstone National Park that lies within the state of Idaho, and since the entire park has been placed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, there are no residents available to form a jury for crimes committed in this specific &quot;Venn diagram&quot; location.

Similar rationale contributed to the dissolution of Bullfrog County, Nevada, in 1989; because the county was unpopulated, and was not assigned to a judicial district, criminal trials could not legally be held there under Nevada state law.

== Real-life examples ==
In March 2009, a $6.8 million jewel theft in Germany was described as being close to a perfect crime, in that despite having DNA evidence (but no other evidence), the police were unable to bring the case to court since the DNA belonged to one of a pair of identical twins, and faced with denials by both, it could not be proven which of the two was the criminal. Other examples of one, or possibly both, identical twins avoiding punishment include juries unable to reach a verdict in a 2004 Boston rape trial, a 2005 Houston rape trial and a 2009 Malaysia drug-smuggling trial. The infamous 1987 Opera House heist in India by a group of men impersonating CBI officers was described as a perfect crime.

<text>Tourism in India is 4.6% of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other sectors, tourism is not a priority sector for the Government of India. The World Travel and Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated or 5.8% of India&#x27;s GDP and supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even though, these numbers were lower than the pre-pandemic figures; the country&#x27;s economy witnessed a significant growth in 2021 after the massive downturn during 2020. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8% to by 2031 (7.2% of GDP). India has established itself as the 5th largest global &quot;travel healthcare&quot; destination with an estimated market size of around $9 billion in 2019, out of the total global &quot;travel healthcare&quot; industry of $44.8 billion(2019). In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients travelled to India to seek medical treatment.

According to the Ministry of Tourism, over 6.19 million and 1.52 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2022 and 2021 respectively compared to 10.93 million in 2019, representing a -44% degrowth. In 2022, Gujarat Tops India in Foreign Tourism with 20.17% Share in 2022. Gujarat rose as a global tourism hotspot continues with over 15.40 lakh tourists visiting in 2023. In 2023, 2509.63 million Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) were recorded (provisionally) compared to 1731.01 Million DTVs in 2022.

The World Economic Forum&#x27;s &quot;Travel and Tourism Development Index&quot; 2021, which replaced its previous &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report,&quot; ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall. The last edition of the &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report&quot;, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140 countries overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India&#x27;s tourism sector 13th out of 140 countries. It mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), particularly given the country&#x27;s stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country also scored high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel (ranked 8th). The World Tourism Organization reported that India&#x27;s receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries.

The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the process, the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various central ministries/agencies, state governments, union territories and private sector representatives. Concerted efforts are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and eco-tourism. The Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting tourism in India.

==Visa policy of India==
India requires citizens of most countries to hold a valid passport and apply for a travel visa at their local Indian embassy or consulate before their visit. Travellers can apply directly by mail or in person, or through their local travel services company. In 2014, India implemented an online method for citizens of 156 countries to apply for an e-Tourist Visa.

Nationals of Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal do not require a travel visa to enter India. Citizens of Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, DPR Korea, Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nepal, South Africa and Uruguay are not required to pay a fee when obtaining an Indian visa.

During the pandemic year 2020, India had access to just 23 countries for travel, whereas now the Indian passport holders can travel visa-free to 60 countries.

A Protected Area Permit (PAP) is required to enter the states of Nagaland and Sikkim and some parts of the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. A Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is required to enter the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim. Special permits are needed to visit the Lakshadweep islands.

=== e-Tourist Visa ===
As a measure to boost tourism, the Indian Government implemented a new visa policy in November 2014, allowing tourists and business visitors to obtain a &quot;visa on arrival&quot; at 28 international airports, by acquiring an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) online before arrival, without having to visit an Indian consulate or visa centre. In April 2015, the &quot;visa on arrival&quot; scheme was renamed &quot;e-Tourist Visa&quot; (or &quot;e-TV&quot;) to avoid confusion.

The e-Tourist Visa facility requires a tourist to apply online on a secure Government of India website, at least four to thirty days before the date of travel. If approved, the visitor must print and carry the approved visa with their travel documents. The visa allows holders of an ETA to enter and stay anywhere in India for a period of ninety days except for citizens of US, UK, Japan and Canada. Citizens of these countries can stay for up to 180 days at a time. an ETA can be obtained twice in a single calendar year.

India first introduced its &quot;visa on arrival&quot; facility on 27 November 2014, to citizens of the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Djibouti, Fiji, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Laos, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Norway, Oman, Palau, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russia, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, UAE, Ukraine, USA, Vanuatu and Vietnam. On 30 July 2015, the facility was extended to China, Macau and Hong Kong. On 15 August 2015, the facility was further extended to citizens of Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Belgium, Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, East Timor, Guatemala, Hungary, Ireland, Jamaica, Malta, Malaysia, Mongolia, Monaco, Mozambique, the Netherlands, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Seychelles, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Sweden, Taiwan, Tanzania, Turks and Caicos Islands, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Venezuela. The facility should eventually be expanded to about 180 countries.
As a result of the new visa policy, 56,477 tourists arrived on an e-Tourist Visa during October 2015, compared with 2,705 tourist arrivals during October 2014 (just before the facility was introduced), representing a 1987.9% increase. During the period from January to October 2015, a total of 258,182 tourists arrived on an e-Tourist Visa, a 1073.8% increase on the 21,995 tourist arrivals during the same period in 2014 (before the e-Tourist Visa was available).

==Statistics==
===Domestic tourists ===
During 2021, the number of Domestic Tourist Visits to the States/UTs was 67,76,32,981(677 million approx.) as compared to 61,02,16,157(610 million approx.) in 2020 registering a growth of 11.05%.

===Foreign tourist arrivals and foreign exchange earnings===


===Foreign and domestic tourist visits by State===

==World Heritage Sites==
There are 42 World Heritage Sites in India that are recognised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as of August 
2023.

== Responsible tourism in India ==

=== Elephant camps ===
Riding elephants is a popular tourist activity in India. While the total number of elephants used for tourism in India is relatively low compared to other Asian countries (350 in India in 2017 compared to almost 2,200 in Thailand), tourists will still have opportunities to ride elephants at historic sites and watch captive elephants perform in sports and shows and religious rituals.

In early 2019, several prominent responsible tourism businesses including Responsible Travel and Intrepid Travel stopped selling tours including elephant rides citing reasons of animal cruelty and abuse. Later in 2019, The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) updated its animal welfare guidelines, labelling elephant riding as unacceptable.

<text>Canoe polo, also known as kayak polo or polo (to players and fans), is one of the competitive disciplines of kayaking. It incorporates ball-handling skills into a contact team game, wherein group tactics and positional play are as important as individual speed and fitness.

Each team has five players on the pitch (and up to three substitutes), who compete to score in their opponent&#x27;s goal, which is suspended two meters above the water. The ball can be thrown by hand or flicked with the paddle to pass between players and shoot at the goal. Pitches can be set up in swimming pools or any stretch of flat water, which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters.

The kayaks are specifically designed for polo, faster and lighter than typical ones. The paddles are lighter and designed with pulling power and ball control in mind, with rounded blades for safety. Nose and tail boat bumpers, body protection, helmets and faceguards are compulsory.

== History ==
Canoe polo originated in the late 19th century in Great Britain, with &quot;Punch&quot; magazine publishing a picture entitled &quot;Polo on the Sea&quot; in 1875. The modern sport was born in the demonstration event held at the National Canoe Exhibition in the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre of London in 1970.

In response to the interest created at the Crystal Palace event, the first National Canoe Polo subcommittee of the British Canoe Union was formed, and it was this committee that developed the modern framework of the game. The National Championships were held every year at the National Canoe Exhibition, and this activity led to the inclusion of Canoe Polo in the demonstration games at Duisburg, Germany in 1987.

In India, Canoe Polo was initiated by the University of Kashmir, Srinagar in 2008 when the University Aquatics Coach Muhammad Yusuf conducted a promotional match between the University of Kashmir and Islamia College on the waters of Nigeen Lake in Srinagar. Later this event was included in the annual water sports calendar of the university. The J&amp;K Water Sports Association is also promoting this sport in Jammu and Kashmir on a larger scale.

== Features ==
The game is now played in many countries throughout all inhabited continents, for recreation and serious sport. The sport has World Championships every two years and European, Asian, African, and Pan American Continental Championships held every year in between World Championship years. Internationally the sport is organized by the Canoe Polo committee of the International Canoe Federation, as one of the disciplines of the sport of canoeing.



The game is often described as a combination of water polo, basketball and kayaking. The tactics and playing of the game are not unlike basketball or water polo but with the added complexity of the boats, which can be used to tackle an opposition player in possession of the ball, or jostle for position within 6 meters of the goal.

=== Officials ===
There are two referees (one on each side-line) and they are on foot rather than in boats. The score is kept by the scorekeeper and the timekeeper monitors the playing time and sending-off times. The goal lines are monitored by two line judges. Before play commences scrutineers check all kit for compliance with regulations.

=== Pitch ===
Canoe polo is played either indoors in swimming pools or outdoors on a pitch which should measure 35 meters by 23 meters. The boundaries of the pitch are ideally marked using floating ropes (similar to lane markers in swimming), although for smaller venues the edges of the pool are frequently used.

The area approximately 6 meters in front of each the goal can be defined as the Zone. This area is where defending players create formations to defend the goal from attackers.

=== Timing ===
The game is officially played as a 14- to 20-minute game consisting of two 7- to 10-minute halves. The teams change ends at the half-time period, which is 1 to 3 minutes long. Each half begins with a &quot;sprint&quot; where each team lines up against its goal-line and the ball is thrown into the middle of the pitch by the referee. One player from each team sprints to win possession of the ball.

=== Shot clock ===
A shot clock may be used to speed up the game. The attacking team have 60 seconds to have a shot on the goal or they lose possession. The shot clock is reset when the ball is intercepted by the opposing team or the attacking team loses possession. The shot clock is a recent addition to the rules, and due to the expense and complexity of the equipment is not used universally.

== Tactics ==
There are several attacking and defensive tactics all with different variations.

=== Offensive ===
* Overload: 1 or 2 players attack the side of the zone, pushing the defensive players together and creating space for a 3rd player to sprint into the newly created space, receive a pass from the 4th player and take a direct shot on the goal.
* Box player: A player positions themselves directly under the goal, next to the keeper. The aim is to keep this position and to receive a quick pass and then have a short, direct shot at the goal or pass to another player who takes the opportunity to break through the defence.
* Star: The players position themselves around the zone and sprint in consecutively, a defensive player moves to block each player as they sprint in, the attacking team move the ball around as the players sprint in, threatening to take a shot. If done correctly the fifth player is able to sprint into the zone, will have no defensive player to block them, receive the pass from the 4th player and be able to take a direct shot on goal.

=== Defensive ===
* 3–1: Three players form a row above the goal keeper, 1 to each side and 1 directly above the keeper. This formation can provide a very solid defensive line, by protecting the sides and the middle. The remaining player patrols the top of the zone with the aim of pressuring the ball and stopping players running into gaps in the defensive line.
* 2–2: Two players position themselves in front, and to the side of the goal keeper, and block attacking players threatening the goal from the side. The two other players go further forward and toward the middle with the aim of stopping players running in to the zone and to place pressure of the attackers. Looked on from above, it is not dissimilar to a Christmas tree formation. The aim is to force long-shots and errors from the attackers to win the ball back, while protecting the goal.
* Five out: Every player, including the goal keeper, marks a player and pressures the ball and every pass, trying to force a mistake or gain an interception.

== Fouls ==
Most of the rules concern the safety of the players involved or are designed to keep the game fast-paced and exciting to play and watch.
* Illegal substitution and entry into the playing area: Only 5 players are allowed in the playing area at once. During a substitution a player must be completely off the pitch (including all kit) before another player can come on.
* Illegal possession: A player must dispose of the ball within five (5) seconds of gaining possession, either by passing it to another player or by performing one throw causing the ball to travel by at least one metre measured horizontally from the point of release.
* Illegal hand tackle: Types of hand tackle include any hand-tackle where the tackled player does not have possession of the ball or is sharing possession of the ball with another player or any body-contact other than one open hand to the opponents&#x27; back, upper arm or side or any hand tackle which endangers the tackled player.
* Illegal kayak tackle: Any kayak-tackle that results in significant contact between the tackler&#x27;s kayak and the head or body of an opposing player, or endangering a player, tackling a player not within 3 metres of the ball or who is not competing for the ball.
* Illegal use of the paddle: Playing, or attempting to play, the ball with a paddle when the ball is within arm&#x27;s reach of an opponent, contacting an opponent&#x27;s person or any use of a paddle that endangers a player.
* Illegal jostle: When a player is stationary or attempting to maintain a position and their body is moved by more than half a metre by sustained contact from an opponent&#x27;s kayak or jostling the player behind the goal line.
* Illegal screen/obstruction: A player actively or deliberately impeding the progress of an opponent when neither player is within three metres of the ball or a player who is not competing for the ball who actively impedes the progress of an opponent who is competing for the ball on the water and not in the air.
* Illegal holding: A player gaining support or propulsion by placing their hand, arm, body or paddle on an opponent&#x27;s kayak, or holding the opposing player or their equipment or using surrounding pitch equipment (goal, side-lines, pool wall), fending off an opponent.
* Unsporting behaviour: Players showing dissent, retaliation, foul or abusive language, delaying tactics, interference with opponents equipment, bouncing the ball out of play or any action that the referees consider detrimental to the game.

Three general principles can be applied when determining the severity of a foul.

Deliberate foul – A foul where no effort was made to avoid the illegal play. Any deliberate foul should receive a minimum of a green card- either immediately or at the next break in play if playing advantage.

Dangerous foul – Is significant contact with the opponent&#x27;s arm, head or body that may result in personal injury and is illegal.

Significant contact – Any high impact or continuous contact, that may result in equipment damage or personal injury.

== Equipment ==

Specialized equipment is needed to play Canoe polo. Items required are:
* Ball: A water polo ball is constructed of buoyant material to enable it to float on the water. The cover is textured to give players additional grip. The size of the ball is different for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and junior games.
* Buoyancy aids: A buoyancy aid is used to protect the players&#x27; torso from injury, and must provide an inch of foam on the front, sides and back of the player. All buoyancy aids are numbered to make the player identifiable to the other players, referees and spectators. Buoyancy aids are reversible and are colored with the team&#x27;s primary and secondary colors on each side. This allows opponents to reverse their buoyancy aids and play in their away colors if the opposing team&#x27;s primary color is the same or similar.
* Helmet and face guard: Helmets and face-guards are compulsory to protect players head and face from injury caused by accidental contact from paddles or other kayaks.
* Goals: The goals (measuring 1 meter high by 1.5 meters wide) are a frame with a net, suspended 2 meters above the water. A player, acting as goal keeper, defends the goal with their paddle by sticking it up vertically. Special rules concern the goal keeper, such as: the attacking team not being allowed to interfere with or jostle them. The length of the paddles used by the goal keepers are often longer than those used by other players. 
* Kayak: A special kayak is used. They are constructed from carbon-Kevlar or a similarly lightweight material. This makes them faster and more manoeuvrable than other kayaks. They are fitted with an inch of protective foam around both ends of the kayak to prevent injury and damage at high speeds.
* Paddle: A paddle is used to propel the players during the game. The paddle can be used to flick and play the ball. Paddles are strictly forbidden of being played within an arms reach of an opposing player to reduce the risk of injury.
* Spray deck: A spray deck is used to secure the cockpit of the kayak and prevent water filling the kayak during play.

<doc id="283803" wikidata="Q16949164" url="?curid=283803" title="Lotto South">
<text>Lotto South was a lottery game in Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia. It resulted from the September 2001 merger of three smaller jackpot games, one from each of the three lotteries. This was done in an attempt to create larger jackpots. 

Drawings took place at the WTVR-TV studios in Richmond, Virginia, on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 11:00 p.m. ET. Jackpots began at $2 million (annuitized); top-prize winners could choose to be paid either in 30 annual payments, or the cash option. The game was jointly administered by the Georgia Lottery, Kentucky Lottery, and Virginia Lottery.

Sales of the game began on September 9, 2001. 

Its record jackpot was $27 million, won on December 31, 2005.

The game had four prize levels; players needed to match at least three numbers to win. All prizes were paid on a parimutuel basis. The jackpot was paid either in cash or 30 annual payments, according to the winners&#x27; wishes. 

In January 2006, it was announced that the game would be retired; its final drawing took place on February 25, 2006. That jackpot was not won; the lower-tier prizes doubled (instead of rolling down the entire prize pool, which lotteries often do when a jackpot game is retired.) The three lotteries kept the rest of the money. &quot;Lotto South&quot;′s replacement was Win for Life, which ended in 2011 in Kentucky and winter 2014 in Georgia; Win for Life was retired on September 13, 2014, after which Virginia replaced it with $1,000,000 Moneyball. 

Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia began sales of &quot;Decades of Dollars&quot; on January 30, 2011. (Arkansas joined on May 3, 2011.) Decades of Dollars became a Virginia-only game in October 2014, as the other three lotteries were part of the launch of &quot;Monopoly Millionaires&#x27; Club&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="283808" wikidata="Q912415" url="?curid=283808" title="Culture of Denmark">
<text>The culture of [[Denmark]] has a rich artistic and scientific heritage. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), the short stories of Karen Blixen, penname Isak Dinesen, (1885–1962), the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), modern authors such as Herman Bang and Nobel laureate Henrik Pontoppidan and the dense, aphoristic poetry of Piet Hein (1905–1996), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars Von Trier. Denmark has had a strong tradition of movie making and Carl Theodor Dreyer has been recognised as one of the world&#x27;s greatest film directors. The astronomical discoveries of Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Ludwig A. Colding&#x27;s (1815–1888) neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the foundational contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962); in this century Lene Vestergaard Hau (born 1959) in quantum physics involving the stopping of light, advances in nano-technology, and contributions to the understanding of Bose-Einstein Condensates, demonstrate the range and endurance of Danish scientific achievement.

Culture and the arts thrive as a result of the proportionately high amount of government funding they receive, much of which is administered by local authorities so as to involve citizens directly. Thanks to a system of grants, Danish artists are able to devote themselves to their work while museums, theatres, and the film institute receive national support.

Copenhagen, the capital, is home to many famous sites and attractions, including Tivoli Gardens, Amalienborg Palace (home of the Danish monarchy), Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen Cathedral, Rosenborg Castle, Opera House, Frederik&#x27;s Church (Marble Church), Thorvaldsens Museum, Rundetårn, Nyhavn and &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; sculpture.

==&quot;Hygge&quot;==

Similar to other Scandinavian cultures, a fundamental aspect of Danish culture is &quot;hygge&quot;. &quot;Hygge&quot;, meaning &quot;snug&quot;; is a concept that evokes a &quot;cosiness&quot; that cannot be easily described due to being more of a mood, particularly when relaxing with good friends or loved ones. Christmas time is a true moment of &quot;hygge&quot;, as is grilling a &quot;pølse&quot; (Danish sausage) and drinking a beer on a long summer evening. It is suspected the concept of &quot;hygge&quot; is part of the reason Danes and other Scandinavians score high on happiness.

==Danish Christmas==
The Danish word for the Christmas holiday is &quot;Jul&quot;, from the Old Norse &quot;jól&quot;, the term for &quot;midwinter&quot;, itself cognate with the English word, yule.
Midwinter celebrations were an important part of Scandinavian culture since prehistoric times, and the term was retained to refer to &quot;Christmas&quot; after Christianization. In many countries Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, but in Denmark, and in the other Scandinavian countries, the most important day for celebrations is Christmas Eve on the 24th when the family comes together. The morning can be spent in various ways but most often it is the time when preparations are made for the evening.
&quot;Juleaften&quot; (Danish for Christmas Eve) or Yule Eve starts around 6 p.m. when a traditional dinner (&quot;Julemiddag&quot;) is served. 
Afterwards, the candles on the Christmas tree are lit and the family dance around it singing Christmas songs and carols and subsequently exchange presents.

==Folklore==

Danish folklore is made up of folk tales, legends, songs, music, dancing, popular beliefs and traditions, mostly communicated by the inhabitants of towns and villages across the country. Many of these were passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth. As in neighbouring countries, interest in folklore grew with an emerging feeling of national consciousness in 19th-century Denmark. Researchers travelled across the country collecting innumerable folktales, songs and sayings while observing traditional dress in the various regions. Folklore today is part of the national heritage, represented in particular by national and local traditions, songs, folk dances and literature.

Today&#x27;s folk dancing in Denmark dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, when there was renewed interest in the national heritage. A number of groups began to revive the music, dances and costumes of past generations. In 1901, the Society for the Promotion of Danish Folk Dancing (&quot;Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme&quot;) was founded in Copenhagen, leading to local dancing societies throughout the country. Today there are more than 12,000 folk dancers in 219 local clubs, providing courses in music, dancing and dressmaking.

The traditional costumes of Denmark, though varying from region to region, date back roughly to the period between 1750 and 1900 when clothes were often home-made from yarn spun from wool or flax. In rural communities, the fabrication of garments for both family members and servants was an important part of everyday life. The artist Frederik Christian Lund, who had travelled across Denmark as a soldier in the First Schleswig War, took an interest in sketching people in local costumes in various parts of the country. He completed his collection of 31 coloured sketches in 1864, publishing them as coloured lithographs in &quot;Danske Nationaldragter&quot; (Danish National Costumes).

Numerous Danish folktales contain a range of mythical figures such as trolls, elves, goblins and wights as well as figures from Nordic mythology like giants and &quot;lygtemænd&quot; (hobby lanterns). The &quot;nisse&quot; is a particularly well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The &quot;nisse&quot; would be helpful if treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.

Today, nisser are associated with Christmas, with some of them being portrayed as Santa Claus&#x27;s helpers on Greendland. Whilst the superstition regarding the nisse has faded, it is still traditional for households with children to pretend that a nisse lives in the attic, or elsewhere in the house, and to offer it porridge in December. The parents will then, for the duration of the month, play mischievous, but harmless, jokes on the children. The nisse also provides daily gifts, that are laid in a sock, which is hung op on a wall at the start of the month.

==Cuisine==

Perhaps the most typically Danish contribution to the meals of the day is the traditional lunch or &quot;smørrebrød&quot; consisting of open sandwiches, usually on thinly sliced &quot;rugbrød&quot;. The meal usually begins with seafood such as marinated herring, smoked eel, crab, or breaded plaice filets with remoulade and moves on with slices of roast pork or beef, &quot;frikadeller&quot; (meatballs), hams and liver pâté. The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise. The meal is mostly accompanied by beer, on occasion also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.

In the evening, hot meals are usually served. Traditional dishes include fried fish, roast pork with red cabbage, pot-roasted chicken, pot-roast and slow cooked beef, meat balls, or pork chops. Game is sometimes served in the autumn. Steaks are now increasingly popular, but is a modern addition.

A popular traditional Danish dessert, especially around Christmas, consists of &quot;æbleskiver&quot;, rather like small pancake doughnuts which are fried in butter in a special pan and are served hot with jam and sugar. Traditionally, they were made with small pieces of apple in the middle which is why they are called &quot;æbleskiver&quot;, literally &quot;apple slices&quot;.

In recent years, development of the New Danish cuisine based on the rediscovery of local ingredients presented in interesting new recipes has led to a significant number of new, highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the provinces, several with Michelin stars. This in turn has led to new developments in food production with a series of new products based on organic farming.

==Sports==
Sports are popular in Denmark, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. The national sport is football (soccer), with the most notable results being qualifying for the European Championships six times in a row (1984–2004) and winning the Championship in 1992. Other significant achievements include winning the Confederations Cup in 1995 and reaching the quarter-final of the 1998 World Cup.

Denmark&#x27;s numerous beaches and resorts are popular locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking and a broad-range of other water-themed sports.

In speedway racing Denmark has won several world championships, including the Speedway World Cup in 2006 and 2008. Other popular sports include golf, mostly popular among the older demographic; tennis, in which Denmark is successful on a professional level; Danish Rugby Union, which dates back to 1950; and indoor sports such as badminton, handball and various forms of gymnastics.

, the national handball team are the current reigning European champions and the team with most medals won in European championship history on the men&#x27;s side with a total of five medals, those being two gold medals (2008, 2012), and three bronze medals (2002, 2004 &amp; 2006).
And in 2016 Denmark&#x27;s handball team won the gold medal for men at the Olympics in Rio.

===Cycling===


In recent years, Denmark has made a mark as a strong cycling nation, with Bjarne Riis winning Tour de France in 1996, and Michael Rasmussen reaching King of the Mountains status, in the Tour 2005 and 2006. The Tour d’France has been won for two consecutive years (2022 and 2023) by Jonas Vingegaard.

Most Danes are active cyclists, often using their bikes to commute to work or to go off on trips at the weekend. With its well-engineered cycle paths, Copenhagen is especially suited to city cycling. Every day 1.3 million km are cycled in the city, with 36% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle. Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and often quicker way around town than by public transport or car and it is therefore municipal policy for the number of commuters by bike to go up to 40% by 2012 and 50% by 2015.

Odense has been named the &quot;bicycle city of the year&quot; because of the great number of bicycle lanes in the city. A complete network of 350 km all-weather serviced lanes exists in the town.

During the summer months, there are free &quot;City Bikes&quot; stationed at various spots in the downtown area of Copenhagen, Aarhus and Aalborg. The idea is that anyone can take a bike from one of the spots, ride it to one of the other spots and leave it there for the next person. There are many National and regional bicycle routes throughout Denmark. They are all marked and include rest areas with benches and other necessities.

==Fine arts==

===Painting===
Danish painting goes back hundreds of years. Earlier work is often manifested in churches, for example in the form of frescos such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the Elmelunde Master. But it was not until the beginning of the 19th century that the Golden Age of Danish Painting emerged with a marked increase in truly Danish art inspired by the country itself with its lifestyle and traditions. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was an important influence on the following generation&#x27;s study of nature, in which landscape painting came to the fore. He had many successful students, including Wilhelm Bendz (1804–1832), Christen Købke (1810–48), Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848), Constantin Hansen (1804–1880), Jørgen Roed (1808–1888), Wilhelm Marstrand (1810–1873), C. A. Jensen (1792–1870), J. Th. Lundbye (1818–1848), and P. C. Skovgaard (1817–1875).

Some years later, a number of painters including P. S. Krøyer (1851–1909) and Michael (1849–1927) and Anna Ancher (1859–1935) moved to Skagen in the far north of Jylland to paint the natural surroundings and local people. In due course, the town developed into an artists&#x27; colony. A little later, a similar phenomenon developed on Fyn with artists such as Johannes Larsen (1867–1961). Vilhelm Hammershøi is another known painter.

Collections of modern art enjoy unusually attractive settings at the Louisiana Museum north of Copenhagen, at the North Jylland Art Museum in Aalborg and at the ARoS art museum in Aarhus. The National Museum of Art and the Glyptotek, both in Copenhagen, contain treasures of Danish and international art.

===Sculpture===
Danish sculpture as a nationally recognized art form can be traced back to 1752 when Jacques Saly was commissioned to execute King Frederick V of Denmark while on horseback. While Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1844) was undoubtedly the country&#x27;s most prominent contributor of his time, many other sculptors also produced notable works in the areas of Neoclassicism, Realism, and Historicism, the latter resulting from a growing consciousness of a national identity. From modern times, many notable works of Surrealism and Modernism has been produced, inspired by European trends, especially those from Paris. Present notable Danish sculptors includes Michael Kvium, Hein Heinsen and Bjørn Nørgaard, but the field holds many skilled practitioners and the styles has diversified greatly.

===Literature===
The principal contributors to Danish literature are undoubtedly Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), storyteller Karen Blixen (1885–1962), playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754), and modern authors such as Henrik Pontoppidan and Herman Bang.

Among today&#x27;s Danish writers, probably the best-known to international readers is Peter Høeg (Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow; Borderliners). Benny Andersen wrote poems, short stories, and music. Poems by both writers have been translated into English by the Curbstone Press. Klaus Rifbjerg has published over 100 novels as well as poetry, short stories and TV plays. Two of his works have been translated into English: Witness to the Future and War. Kirsten Thorup&#x27;s novel Baby, winner of the 1980 Pegasus Prize, is published in English by the University of Louisiana Press. The psychological thrillers of Anders Bodelsen also appear in English as do some of the novels of intrigue by Leif Davidsen. Suzanne Brøgger and Vita Andersen focus largely on the changing roles of women in society.

===Architecture===
The architecture of Denmark has changed and evolved since prehistoric times, but the oldest buildings to have survived the ravages of time dates to the early Middle Ages when bricks was introduced as building material around 1150 AD and the first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up across the country. Brick is still a locally produced, affordable, durable and widely used building material in today&#x27;s architecture of Denmark. Inspired by French castles and with the assistance of Dutch designers, architecture during the Renaissance flourished with magnificent royal palaces. Neoclassicism came to Denmark from France and, in the 19th century, slowly merged into the National Romantic style when Danish designers came into their own. It was, however, not until the last half of the 20th century that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class designers such as Johann Otto von Spreckelsen who designed the Grande Arche in Paris. Internationally, perhaps the most celebrated of all is the architect who designed the iconic Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon, but within Danish borders, it is the architect Arne Jacobsen who is perhaps held in highest esteem for developing the &#x27;Danish Modern&#x27; style and furniture/interior design, such as the now world-famous and much sought-after Swan and Egg chairs. A new wave of young Danish architects are rising into international prominence, like Bjarke Ingels with works such as the Danish National Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 Expo.

===Photography===

Photography in Denmark has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art in 1839 to some of the strongest contemporary photography in Europe today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century while both artistic and press photographers have since made internationally recognised contributions. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.

===Design===
Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of functionalistic design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards.

The Danish Porcelain Factory (&quot;Royal Copenhagen&quot;), including Bing &amp; Grøndahl, is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen (1914–1972), Finn Juhl (1912–1989), Hans Wegner (1914–2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902–1971), Poul Kjærholm (1929–1980), Poul Henningsen (1894–1967) and Verner Panton (1926–1998). Georg Jensen (1866–1935) is known the world over for modern design in silver.

Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Harald Quistgaard (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements and Ole Wanscher (1903–1985) who had a classical approach to furniture design.

The Danish Museum of Art &amp; Design in Copenhagen exhibits the best in Danish design.

==Performing arts==

===Music===
Denmark&#x27;s most famous composer of classical music is Carl Nielsen who is best known outside of Denmark for his six symphonies, but whose melodies for popular songs are cherished among Danes. Other well-known pieces of his are the incidental music for Adam Oehlenschläger&#x27;s drama Aladdin (Nielsen), the operas Saul og David and Maskarade, the concertos for flute, violin, and clarinet, the Wind Quintet, and the Helios Overture, which depicts the passage of the sun in the sky from dawn to nightfall. The Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of Danish choreographer August Bournonville (1805–79). Hans Abrahamsen, Per Nørgård and Poul Ruders are successful composers of contemporary classical music. Danish interest in classical music is exemplified by the prestigious Opera House completed in 2000. Strategically set on Copenhagen&#x27;s waterfront, it has presented operas and musicals to full houses ever since its opening.

Danes have also distinguished themselves in rhythmical music, with world-famous jazz musicians such as Svend Asmussen, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Niels Lan Doky and Marilyn Mazur. The Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation.

The modern pop and rock scene has produced some bands of note like Aqua, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, D-A-D, The Raveonettes, Michael Learns to Rock, Alphabeat, Medina, Oh Land, Kashmir, Mew, Outlandish and Dúné. All together, Lars Ulrich, drummer of the band Metallica, has become the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===Cinema===

In recent years, Danish films have gained increasing recognition at home and abroad. Gabriel Axel&#x27;s film based on Karen Blixen&#x27;s Babette&#x27;s Feast was awarded an Oscar in 1987. In 1988, Bille August also received an Oscar with Pelle the Conqueror based on the novel by Martin Andersen Nexø. In 1992, August went on to win the Palme d&#x27;Or in Cannes with Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s autobiography, The Best Intentions.

Since the late 1990s, the Dogme movement and figures such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Søren Kragh-Jacobsen and Lone Scherfig have continued to contribute to the international success of Danish cinema. In 2011, Susanne Bier&#x27;s &quot;In a Better World&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

===Theatre===
The theatre in Denmark continues to thrive thanks to the many theatres across the country which put on a wide variety of Danish and foreign performances. The flagship Royal Danish Theatre presents drama, opera, ballet and music. Since the 18th century, Danish playwrights have been successful in attracting wide public interest.

Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) is considered by many to be the founder of the Danish theatre. Satirical comedies such as &quot;Jean de France&quot; and &quot;Jeppe of the Hill&quot; are still performed today.

Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850) introduced romanticism to the Danish theatre. Especially successful was his Earl Hakon the Mighty, premiered in 1808.

The Norwegian Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906) also travelled to Copenhagen where he produced numerous plays such as A Doll&#x27;s House (1879).

In recent years, there has been something of a revival in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and producers have appeared including Astrid Saalbach (born 1955), winner of the Nordic Drama Award in 2004, and Peter Asmussen (born 1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier&#x27;s Breaking the Waves. Danish musicals have also been a particularly successful feature of the modern theatre. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand&#x27;s play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius-Bjerre&#x27;s musical Matador (2007) is based on a successful TV series of the same name.

Another popular Danish theatrical tradition is the revue which has been thriving since the mid-19th century. Today revues are performed every summer to full houses in theatres across Denmark, poking fun at the politics of the day and even the monarchy. Among the most popular are &quot;Circusrevyen&quot; in Copenhagen with Lisbet Dahl, and the &quot;Nykøbing Revy&quot; directed by Flemming Krøll in Nykøbing Falster.

To this day, Denmark also has a large tradition for children and youth theater, as it hosts the largest annual children and youth theater event in the world, Aprilfestivallen, every year.

===Television===
Danish television has also contributed to drama with a number of successful series since the 1970s. Perhaps the most notable domestic and international successes have been the political drama &quot;Borgen&quot; and the three series of &quot;Forbrydelsen (The Killing, 2007–2012)&quot;. &quot;Forbrydelsen&quot; attracted more than a 30% audience share, when originally broadcast in Denmark and both series have been widely sold around the world.

==Science==

Denmark has a long tradition for scientific engagement in all fields, often with fundamental discoveries. The intelligentsia was involved in the European scientific revolution of the renaissance early on, with prominent scientists such as Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), Ole Worm (1588–1655), Nicolas Steno (1638–1686) and Ole Rømer (1644–1710).

The contributions to science has steadily continued through the ages, with the fundamental discoveries of Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), the contributions to linguistics by Rasmus Rask (1787–1832), the neglected articulation of the principle of conservation of energy by Ludwig A. Colding&#x27;s (1815–1888), Vilhelm Thomsen (1842–1927), Otto Jespersen (1860–1943) and others, into modern times with the brilliant contributions to atomic physics of Niels Bohr (1885–1962).
Niels Bohr founded several institutions in relation to quantum physics and both attracted and stimulated an important international and lasting scientific milieu in the country. This has since produced many important discoveries and advancements in physics, astrophysics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering, particularly in the areas of quantum physics, quantum optics and lately nano-technology. Although an international environment, notable Danish scientists from this milieu includes Bengt Strömgren (1908–1987), Aage Bohr (1922–2009), Holger Bech Nielsen (born 1941) and Lene Vestergaard Hau (born 1959).

The sciences of geology and geophysics has benefited from Danish scientists who have been - and are - heavily involved in the description and understanding of the geology of Greenland, one of the most important regions in the world to study the geological evolution of Earth. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) was founded in 1888 and Inge Lehmann (1888–1993) revealed that Earth have a solid inner core in 1936, by the use of seismology. In the 1960s, Willi Dansgaard was the first to understand and describe how to use ice core drills to gain knowledge about Earth&#x27;s paleoclimate, now a widely used method to understand climate changes. Lately, Greenland-born geologist Minik Rosing and his team, unravelled groundbreaking knowledge about the early evolution of life through studies of Greenland&#x27;s geology in the 2000s.

The young science of archaeology, has also benefited from many Danish contributions, with prominent scholars such as Sophus Müller (1846-1934), Georg F.L. Sarauw, J.J.A. Worsaae and Peter Glob. The contributions have often been of a fundamental nature, such as the discoveries of kitchen middens or bog bodies and their great potential for advancing archaeology. Christian Jürgensen Thomsen refined and introduced the now universally recognized three-age system, dividing eras of prehistory into the well-known Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age respectively. Danish archaeologists have contributed with many defining archaeological discoveries, such as the Kongemose culture, Maglemosian culture and the Ertebølle culture of the Nordic Stone Age and of course the Viking Age. With a great international engagement and a long tradition for interdisciplinary collaborations with anthropologists, geologists, zoologists, botanists, antiquarians and historians, Danish archaeologists have been, and still are, involved with all kinds of cultural archaeology around the globe, including the Middle East (Peter Glob, Peter Rowley-Conwy), the Mediterranean region (Peter Oluf Brøndsted, Jörgen Zoega) the Americas (Peter Wilhelm Lund, Frans Blom, Rane Willerslev) and the Arctic region (Therkel Mathiassen, Erik Holtved, Eigil Knuth).

Danes have made significant contributions to the field of computer science. Some notable figures include: Per Brinch Hansen, known for concurrent programming theory; Bjarne Stroustrup, who invented the C++ programming language; Janus Friis, the co-inventor of Skype; Jens and Lars Rasmussen, the co-founders of Google Maps; and Peter Naur, a contributor to ALGOL 60 and a recipient of the Turing Award.

==LGBT==
Social equality, including sexual equality, is relatively high in modern Denmark. Danes are somewhat tolerant towards sexual minorities.

Public displays of affection between gay partners are less likely to provoke disapproval, even as compared to other liberal Western countries. As such, Copenhagen is a popular destination for homosexual and bisexual travellers. The main gay and lesbian festivals of the year are the Copenhagen Pride Parade and the Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival. Copenhagen has been host to the 2009 World Outgames.

In 1989 Denmark became the first country in the world to offer same-sex couples most of the same legal rights as heterosexual couples, in the form of &quot;registered partnerships.&quot;. In March 2009 adoption was legalized for same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage became legal in 2012, after both the parliament and the Church of Denmark voted for it.

<text>The Aletsch Glacier (, ) or Great Aletsch Glacier () is the largest glacier in the Alps. It has a length of about (2014), a volume of (2011), and covers about (2011) in the eastern Bernese Alps in the Swiss canton of Valais. The Aletsch Glacier is composed of four smaller glaciers converging at Konkordiaplatz, where its thickness was measured by the ETH to be still near . It then continues towards the valley before giving birth to the Massa. The Aletsch Glacier is – like most glaciers in the world today – a retreating glacier. As of 2016, since 1980 it lost of its length, since 1870 , and lost also more than of its thickness.

The whole area, including other glaciers is part of the Protected Area, which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.

==Geography==
The Aletsch Glacier is one of the many glaciers located between the cantons of Bern and Valais on the Bernese Alps located east of the Gemmi Pass. The whole area is considered to be the largest glaciated area in western Eurasia. The Fiescher and Aar Glaciers lying on the east have similar extensions.

Except the , all the highest summits of the Bernese Alps are located within the drainage basin of the glacier. The and constitute the northern boundary; the and lie on its east side; finally the culminating point, the () is located on the west side.

Before reaching the maximum flow, four smaller glaciers converge at Konkordiaplatz:

* From the western mouth flows the , which runs along the northern foot of the and . The is supplied from the north by three notable firns: the , the , and the . All of these firns have their starting points at around . From the to the , the is long and is on average about wide. On the west, the connects with the Langgletscher over the high glacier pass, the , into the .
* From the northwestern mouth flows the . This firn in fact represents the straight continuation of the Aletsch Glacier, yet is the shortest of the four tributary glaciers. It has its origin on the southern flank of the and at the eastern flank of the with the in-between. Up to the , the is a scarce long, and returns to flank the in the west and the in the east. At its highest point, it is wide, and further down it is still a good wide.
*From the northern mouth flows the (&quot;Eternal snow field&quot;), where its starting point takes the east flank of the . In an elbow, it flanks from in the west and the and in the east, flowing on to the . Up to here, it is about long and averages about wide. The mouth at the it follows over a rise with a descent from 25 to 30 percent; here, the glacier is sharply split. Against the north is the over the snow-covered pass of the (), connected with the catchment area of the (Wallis German for &quot;Ice Sea&quot;). Through the () between the and the stands a connection to the .
*From the east, the smallest firn arrives at the : the . Its northern arm begins below the (). The southern arm collects its snow and ice in the pot flanked by the , (), and the . Between the peaks and another glacier pass, the (), connects to the . The enters the in a gap between the mountainsides to the north and the to the south. On the western side of the the Konkordia hut (mountain hut) overlooks the whole at an altitude of .

South of Konkordiaplatz, the glacier runs towards the valley of the (Upper Valais); on the east side, near , lies a small glacier lake, (); from the western side used to enter the , but since the end of the 20th century the connection with the Aletsch Glacier has been lost. Further down, until about 1880, the did also enter the Aletsch Glacier at its mouth. But since then both glaciers have been retreating so far that they do not connect anymore (the Upper Aletsch Glacier did retreat about from its connecting point with the Aletsch Glacier), but both serve now only as the source of the river Massa. The river flows through the Lake (a reservoir, and coincidentally representing the glacier&#x27;s mouth region in the 19th century, which is a retreat of more than ) and a gorge of the same name before reaching the near .

==Tourism==
The area of the Aletsch Glacier and some surrounding valleys is on the UNESCO World Heritage list, thus it is protected and the facilities are mostly restricted to the external zones. The region between , and (which is called &quot;Aletsch Region&quot;) in Valais gives access to the lower part of the glacier. The and are popular view points and are accessible by cable car. The river can be crossed since 2008 by a suspension bridge, thus allowing hikes between the left and the right part of the glacier.

The railway station (3,450 m) gives a direct access to the upper Aletsch Glacier as well as the normal route to the . It can be reached only from in the canton Bern. Hiking paths pass the Hut or the Hollandia Hut, eventually reaching other glaciers in the massif.

On the , at 2,065 metres between and the glacier, is located the historic Villa Cassel, former summer residence of many famous and influential guests from the worlds of politics and finance. The house is now one of the centers of the environmental organization Pro Natura, which hosts a permanent exhibition about the site.

==Panorama==

Also at the mouth of the from the east is the small but important (3 km long and averaging 600 m wide). This firn is connected in the over the glacier pass (3280 m high) to the Glacier in the east.

From the , the Aletsch Glacier has a width of approximately 1.5 km and moves at a rate of 180 m per year to the southeast on course with the valley, bordering the in the west and the great in the east. It then takes a great right turn and bends ever closer to the southwest, running through the edge of the and of the Rhône valley. The lowest part of the great Aletsch Glacier is largely covered with detritus of the lateral and medial moraines. The glacier&#x27;s toe currently lies about 1560 m high, far beneath the local tree line. From it springs the Massa stream, which flows through the Massa Canyon and is used to generate hydroelectric power. It continues through the upper half of the , eventually entering into the .
The great Aletsch Glacier shows considerable ice cover. At the Konkordiaplatz, it has an ice cover of more than 900 m, but as it moves to the south, the greater part of the ice melts, gradually decreasing the cover to around 150 m.

The characteristically dark medial moraine, situated almost in the middle of the glacier, runs protracted in two bands from the along the whole length to the glacier&#x27;s toe-zone. This medial moraine is collected from the ice of three large ice fields, which all run together. The westernmost medial moraine has been named the , and the easternmost carries the name .

==Formation and evolution==

The Aletsch Glacier resulted from the accumulation and compaction of snow. Glaciers generally form where snow and ice accumulation exceed snow and ice melt. As the snow and ice thicken it reaches a point where it begins to move due to a combination of gravity and pressure of the overlying snow and ice.

During the last glacial periods, the Aletsch Glacier was much larger than now. 18,000 years ago the lower part of the ridge, between and the glacier, was completely covered by ice. Only the summits of the , and the were above the glacier. After an important retreat, the glacier again advanced 11,000 years ago during the last glacial period. The glacier reached the Rhône valley, and its ice the . Remaining moraines are still visible in the Aletsch Forest.

Since the last glaciation, the glacier generally retreated. However slight climatic changes happened and, in 1860, the glacier was 3 km longer and the ice level 200 m higher.

As for many other glaciers, records show a major longer-term retreat trend. The Aletsch Glacier receded by since 1870, including since 1980. A record retreat of happened in 2006 alone.

Since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 the glacier has lost 20 percent of its ice mass, considerably less than other glaciers in Switzerland, which have lost up to 50 percent. This is explained with the large size of the Aletsch Glacier, which reacts much slower to climate change than smaller glaciers. It is however estimated that, by 2100, the glacier will have only one tenth of its 2018 ice mass.

==Photo opportunity==
On August 18, 2007, photographer Spencer Tunick used hundreds of naked people in a &quot;living sculpture&quot; on the Aletsch Glacier in a photo shoot which he said was intended to draw attention to global warming and the shrinking of the world&#x27;s glaciers. The temperature was about 10 °C (50 °F) at the time of the photo shoot. The 600 participants on the shrinking glacier said that they had volunteered for Tunick (a collaboration with Greenpeace) to let the world know about the effects of global warming on the melting Swiss glaciers.

<text>Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The results are presented as a &quot;mass spectrum&quot;, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.

A mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.
In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample&#x27;s molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.

==History of the mass spectrometer==

In 1886, Eugen Goldstein observed rays in gas discharges under low pressure that traveled away from the anode and through channels in a perforated cathode, opposite to the direction of negatively charged cathode rays (which travel from cathode to anode). Goldstein called these positively charged anode rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot;; the standard translation of this term into English is &quot;canal rays&quot;. Wilhelm Wien found that strong electric or magnetic fields deflected the canal rays and, in 1899, constructed a device with perpendicular electric and magnetic fields that separated the positive rays according to their charge-to-mass ratio (&quot;Q/m&quot;). Wien found that the charge-to-mass ratio depended on the nature of the gas in the discharge tube. English scientist J. J. Thomson later improved on the work of Wien by reducing the pressure to create the mass spectrograph.
The word &quot;spectrograph&quot; had become part of the international scientific vocabulary by 1884. Early &quot;spectrometry&quot; devices that measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions were called &quot;mass spectrographs&quot; which consisted of instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic plate. A &quot;mass spectroscope&quot; is similar to a &quot;mass spectrograph&quot; except that the beam of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen. A mass spectroscope configuration was used in early instruments when it was desired that the effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass spectroscope continued to be used even though the direct illumination of a phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope. The use of the term &quot;mass spectroscopy&quot; is now discouraged due to the possibility of confusion with light spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry is often abbreviated as &quot;mass-spec&quot; or simply as &quot;MS&quot;.

Modern techniques of mass spectrometry were devised by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster and F.W. Aston in 1918 and 1919 respectively.

Sector mass spectrometers known as calutrons were developed by Ernest O. Lawrence and used for separating the isotopes of uranium during the Manhattan Project. Calutron mass spectrometers were used for uranium enrichment at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee Y-12 plant established during World War II.

In 1989, half of the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Hans Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul for the development of the ion trap technique in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 2002, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to John Bennett Fenn for the development of electrospray ionization (ESI) and Koichi Tanaka for the development of soft laser desorption (SLD) and their application to the ionization of biological macromolecules, especially proteins.

==Parts of a mass spectrometer==
A mass spectrometer consists of three components: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. The &quot;ionizer&quot; converts a portion of the sample into ions. There is a wide variety of ionization techniques, depending on the phase (solid, liquid, gas) of the sample and the efficiency of various ionization mechanisms for the unknown species. An extraction system removes ions from the sample, which are then targeted through the mass analyzer and into the &quot;detector&quot;. The differences in masses of the fragments allows the mass analyzer to sort the ions by their mass-to-charge ratio. The detector measures the value of an indicator quantity and thus provides data for calculating the abundances of each ion present. Some detectors also give spatial information, e.g., a multichannel plate.

===Theoretical example===
The following describes the operation of a spectrometer mass analyzer, which is of the sector type. (Other analyzer types are treated below.) Consider a sample of sodium chloride (table salt). In the ion source, the sample is vaporized (turned into gas) and ionized (transformed into electrically charged particles) into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium atoms and ions are monoisotopic, with a mass of about 23 daltons (symbol: Da or older symbol: u). Chloride atoms and ions come in two stable isotopes with masses of approximately 35 u (at a natural abundance of about 75 percent) and approximately 37 u (at a natural abundance of about 25 percent). The analyzer part of the spectrometer contains electric and magnetic fields, which exert forces on ions traveling through these fields. The speed of a charged particle may be increased or decreased while passing through the electric field, and its direction may be altered by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the deflection of the moving ion&#x27;s trajectory depends on its mass-to-charge ratio. Lighter ions are deflected by the magnetic force to a greater degree than heavier ions (based on Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, &quot;F&quot; = &quot;ma&quot;). The streams of magnetically sorted ions pass from the analyzer to the detector, which records the relative abundance of each ion type. This information is used to determine the chemical element composition of the original sample (i.e. that both sodium and chlorine are present in the sample) and the isotopic composition of its constituents (the ratio of 35Cl to 37Cl).

==Creating ions==
The ion source is the part of the mass spectrometer that ionizes the material under analysis (the analyte). The ions are then transported by magnetic or electric fields to the mass analyzer.

Techniques for ionization have been key to determining what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Electron ionization and chemical ionization are used for gases and vapors. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with liquid and solid biological samples include electrospray ionization (invented by John Fenn) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique &quot;Soft Laser Desorption (SLD)&quot; by K. Tanaka for which a Nobel Prize was awarded and as MALDI by M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp).

===Hard ionization and soft ionization===
In mass spectrometry, ionization refers to the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each has advantages and disadvantages for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.

Hard ionization techniques are processes which impart high quantities of residual energy in the subject molecule invoking large degrees of fragmentation (i.e. the systematic rupturing of bonds acts to remove the excess energy, restoring stability to the resulting ion). Resultant ions tend to have &quot;m/z&quot; lower than the molecular ion (other than in the case of proton transfer and not including isotope peaks). The most common example of hard ionization is electron ionization (EI).

Soft ionization refers to the processes which impart little residual energy onto the subject molecule and as such result in little fragmentation. Examples include fast atom bombardment (FAB), chemical ionization (CI), atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric-pressure photoionization (APPI), electrospray ionization (ESI), desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).

===Inductively coupled plasma===
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources are used primarily for cation analysis of a wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most electropositive metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.

===Photoionization mass spectrometry===
Photoionization can be used in experiments which seek to use mass spectrometry as a means of resolving chemical kinetics mechanisms and isomeric product branching. In such instances a high energy photon, either X-ray or uv, is used to dissociate stable gaseous molecules in a carrier gas of He or Ar. In instances where a synchrotron light source is utilized, a tuneable photon energy can be utilized to acquire a photoionization efficiency curve which can be used in conjunction with the charge ratio &quot;m/z&quot; to fingerprint molecular and ionic species. More recently atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) has been developed to ionize molecules mostly as effluents of LC-MS systems.

=== Ambient ionization ===
Some applications for ambient ionization include environmental applications as well as clinical applications. In these techniques, ions form in an ion source outside the mass spectrometer. Sampling becomes easy as the samples don&#x27;t need previous separation nor preparation. Some examples of ambient ionization techniques are Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART),DESI, SESI, LAESI, desorption atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (DAPCI), Soft Ionization by Chemical Reaction in Transfer (SICRT) and desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization DAPPI among others.

===Other ionization techniques===
Others include glow discharge, field desorption (FD), fast atom bombardment (FAB), thermospray, desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), spark ionization and thermal ionization (TIMS).

==Mass selection==

Mass analyzers separate the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. The following two laws govern the dynamics of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields in vacuum:

:formula_1 (Lorentz force law);

:formula_2 (Newton&#x27;s second law of motion in the non-relativistic case, i.e. valid only at ion velocity much lower than the speed of light).

Here F is the force applied to the ion, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the ion, a is the acceleration, &quot;Q&quot; is the ion charge, E is the electric field, and v × B is the vector cross product of the ion velocity and the magnetic field

Equating the above expressions for the force applied to the ion yields:

: formula_3

This differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle&#x27;s initial conditions, it completely determines the particle&#x27;s motion in space and time in terms of &quot;m/Q&quot;. Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as &quot;mass-to-charge spectrometers&quot;. When presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) dimensionless &quot;m/z&quot;, where z is the number of elementary charges (&quot;e&quot;) on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity, although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the charge number, &quot;z&quot;.

There are many types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and magnetic or electric fields, but all operate according to the above differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, there are others designed for special situations.

There are several important analyzer characteristics. The mass resolving power is the measure of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different &quot;m/z&quot;. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the &quot;m/z&quot; measurement error to the true &quot;m/z&quot;. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of &quot;m/z&quot; amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.

===Sector instruments===
A sector field mass analyzer uses a static electric and/or magnetic field to affect the path and/or velocity of the charged particles in some way.
As shown above, sector instruments bend the trajectories of the ions as they pass through the mass analyzer, according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more. The analyzer can be used to select a narrow range of &quot;m/z&quot; or to scan through a range of &quot;m/z&quot; to catalog the ions present.

===Time-of-flight===

The time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer uses an electric field to accelerate the ions through the same potential, and then measures the time they take to reach the detector. If the particles all have the same charge, their kinetic energies will be identical, and their velocities will depend only on their masses. For example, ions with a lower mass will travel faster, reaching the detector first. Ions usually are moving prior to being accelerated by the electric field, this causes particles with the same &quot;m/z&quot; to arrive at different times at the detector. This difference in initial velocities is often not dependent on the mass of the ion, and will turn into a difference in the final velocity. This distribution in velocities broadens the peaks shown on the count vs &quot;m/z&quot; plot, but will generally not change the central location of the peaks, since the starting velocity of ions is generally centered at zero. To fix this problem, time-lag focusing/delayed extraction has been coupled with TOF-MS.

===Quadrupole mass filter===

Quadrupole mass analyzers use oscillating electrical fields to selectively stabilize or destabilize the paths of ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between four parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow a wide range of &quot;m/z&quot; values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.
A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field.
A common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The &quot;triple quad&quot; has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported. Likewise, a triple quad can be made to perform various scan types characteristic of tandem mass spectrometry.

===Ion traps===

====Three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap====

The quadrupole ion trap works on the same physical principles as the quadrupole mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, in which case the ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.

There are many mass/charge separation and isolation methods but the most commonly used is the mass instability mode in which the RF potential is ramped so that the orbit of ions with a mass are stable while ions with mass &quot;b&quot; become unstable and are ejected on the &quot;z&quot;-axis onto a detector. There are also non-destructive analysis methods.

Ions may also be ejected by the resonance excitation method, whereby a supplemental oscillatory excitation voltage is applied to the endcap electrodes, and the trapping voltage amplitude and/or excitation voltage frequency is varied to bring ions into a resonance condition in order of their mass/charge ratio.

====Cylindrical ion trap====
The cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from flat rings rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as the size of a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field near the center of the trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.

====Linear quadrupole ion trap====
A linear quadrupole ion trap is similar to a quadrupole ion trap, but it traps ions in a two dimensional quadrupole field, instead of a three-dimensional quadrupole field as in a 3D quadrupole ion trap. Thermo Fisher&#x27;s LTQ (&quot;linear trap quadrupole&quot;) is an example of the linear ion trap.

A toroidal ion trap can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and connected at the ends or as a cross-section of a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut-shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally, all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.

As with the toroidal trap, linear traps and 3D quadrupole ion traps are the most commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity, tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).

====Orbitrap====
Orbitrap instruments are similar to Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are electrostatically trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode&#x27;s long axis. This oscillation generates an image current in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by Fourier transformation of the recorded image currents.

Orbitraps have a high mass accuracy, high sensitivity and a good dynamic range.

===Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance===
Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (FTMS), or more precisely Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning in the presence of a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion&#x27;s cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is &quot;counted&quot; more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.

Ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to FTMS except that ions are detected with a traditional detector. Ions trapped in a Penning trap are excited by an RF electric field until they impact the wall of the trap, where the detector is located. Ions of different mass are resolved according to impact time.

==Detectors==
The final element of the mass spectrometer is the detector. The detector records either the charge induced or the current produced when an ion passes by or hits a surface. In a scanning instrument, the signal produced in the detector during the course of the scan versus where the instrument is in the scan (at what &quot;m/Q&quot;) will produce a mass spectrum, a record of ions as a function of &quot;m/Q&quot;.

Typically, some type of electron multiplier is used, though other detectors including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. Microchannel plate detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists of a pair of metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.

==Tandem mass spectrometry==

A tandem mass spectrometer is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by some form of molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a mass spectrometer. A collision cell then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A further mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over time, as in a quadrupole ion trap. There are various methods for fragmenting molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced dissociation (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in protein identification.

Tandem mass spectrometry enables a variety of experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM), precursor ion scanning, product ion scanning, and neutral loss scanning.
* In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions over longer dwell-times than could be achieved in a full scan. This increases sensitivity.
* In product ion scans, the first mass analyzer is fixed to select a particular precursor ion (&quot;parent&quot;), while the second is scanned to find all the fragments (&quot;products&quot;, or &quot;daughter ions&quot;) to which it can be fragmented in the collision cell.
* In precursor ion scans, the second mass analyzer is fixed to select a particular fragment ion (&quot;daughter&quot;), while the first is scanned to find all possible precursor ions that could give rise to this fragment.
* In neutral loss scans, the two mass analyzers are scanned in parallel, but separated by the mass of a molecular subunit of interest to the analyst. Ions are detected if they lose that fixed mass during fragmentation. This can be used to look for any chemical that is capable of losing a particular neutral group, for example a sugar residue. Together, neutral loss and precursor ion scans can be used to hunt for chemicals with particular motifs.

Another type of tandem mass spectrometry used for radiocarbon dating is accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), which uses very high voltages, usually in the mega-volt range, to accelerate negative ions into a type of tandem mass spectrometer.

The METLIN Metabolite and Chemical Entity Database is the largest repository of experimental tandem mass spectrometry data acquired from standards. The tandem mass spectrometry data on over 930,000 molecular standards (as of January 2024) is provided to facilitate the identification of chemical entities from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. In addition to the identification of known molecules it is also useful for identifying unknowns using its similarity searching/analysis. All tandem mass spectrometry data comes from the experimental analysis of standards at multiple collision energies and in both positive and negative ionization modes.

==Common mass spectrometer configurations and techniques==
When a specific combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound acronym may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is MALDI-TOF, which refers to a combination of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source with a time-of-flight mass analyzer. Other examples include inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), thermal ionization-mass spectrometry (TIMS) and spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS).

Certain applications of mass spectrometry have developed monikers that although strictly speaking would seem to refer to a broad application, in practice have come instead to connote a specific or a limited number of instrument configurations. An example of this is isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), which refers in practice to the use of a limited number of sector based mass analyzers; this name is used to refer to both the application and the instrument used for the application.

==Separation techniques combined with mass spectrometry==
An important enhancement to the mass resolving and mass determining capabilities of mass spectrometry is using it in tandem with chromatographic and other separation techniques.

===Gas chromatography===

A common combination is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas chromatograph is used to separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer&#x27;s analyzer and are eventually detected. However, the high temperatures (300 °C) used in the GC-MS injection port (and oven) can result in thermal degradation of injected molecules, thus resulting in the measurement of degradation products instead of the actual molecule(s) of interest.

===Liquid chromatography===

Similarly to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray ionization source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion sources are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like laser spray.

===Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry===
Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a technique that combines the liquid separation process of capillary electrophoresis with mass spectrometry. CE-MS is typically coupled to electrospray ionization.

===Ion mobility===
Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS/MS or IMMS) is a technique where ions are first separated by drift time through some neutral gas under an applied electrical potential gradient before being introduced into a mass spectrometer. Drift time is a measure of the collisional cross section relative to the charge of the ion. The duty cycle of IMS (the time over which the experiment takes place) is longer than most mass spectrometric techniques, such that the mass spectrometer can sample along the course of the IMS separation. This produces data about the IMS separation and the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions in a manner similar to LC-MS.

The duty cycle of IMS is short relative to liquid chromatography or gas chromatography separations and can thus be coupled to such techniques, producing triple modalities such as LC/IMS/MS.

==Data and analysis==
===Data representations===

Mass spectrometry produces various types of data. The most common data representation is the mass spectrum.

Certain types of mass spectrometry data are best represented as a mass chromatogram. Types of chromatograms include selected ion monitoring (SIM), total ion current (TIC), and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), among many others.

Other types of mass spectrometry data are well represented as a three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, &quot;m/z&quot; is on the &quot;x&quot;-axis, intensity the &quot;y&quot;-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the &quot;z&quot;-axis.

===Data analysis===
Mass spectrometry data analysis is specific to the type of experiment producing the data. General subdivisions of data are fundamental to understanding any data.

Many mass spectrometers work in either &quot;negative ion mode&quot; or &quot;positive ion mode&quot;. It is very important to know whether the observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates something about the nature of the molecules.

Different types of ion source result in different arrays of fragments produced from the original molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an electrospray source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged. Tandem mass spectrometry purposely produces fragment ions post-source and can drastically change the sort of data achieved by an experiment.

Knowledge of the origin of a sample can provide insight into the component molecules of the sample and their fragmentations. A sample from a synthesis/manufacturing process will probably contain impurities chemically related to the target component. A crudely prepared biological sample will probably contain a certain amount of salt, which may form adducts with the analyte molecules in certain analyses.

Results can also depend heavily on sample preparation and how it was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.

Mass spectrometry can measure molar mass, molecular structure, and sample purity. Each of these questions requires a different experimental procedure; therefore, adequate definition of the experimental goal is a prerequisite for collecting the proper data and successfully interpreting it.

====Interpretation of mass spectra====
Since the precise structure or peptide sequence of a molecule is deciphered through the set of fragment masses, the interpretation of mass spectra requires combined use of various techniques. Usually the first strategy for identifying an unknown compound is to compare its experimental mass spectrum against a library of mass spectra. If no matches result from the search, then manual interpretation or software assisted interpretation of mass spectra must be performed. Computer simulation of ionization and fragmentation processes occurring in mass spectrometer is the primary tool for assigning structure or peptide sequence to a molecule. An &quot;a priori&quot; structural information is fragmented &quot;in silico&quot; and the resulting pattern is compared with observed spectrum. Such simulation is often supported by a fragmentation library that contains published patterns of known decomposition reactions. Software taking advantage of this idea has been developed for both small molecules and proteins.

Analysis of mass spectra can also be spectra with accurate mass. A mass-to-charge ratio value (&quot;m/z&quot;) with only integer precision can represent an immense number of theoretically possible ion structures; however, more precise mass figures significantly reduce the number of candidate molecular formulas. A computer algorithm called formula generator calculates all molecular formulas that theoretically fit a given mass with specified tolerance.

A recent technique for structure elucidation in mass spectrometry, called precursor ion fingerprinting, identifies individual pieces of structural information by conducting a search of the tandem spectra of the molecule under investigation against a library of the product-ion spectra of structurally characterized precursor ions.

==Applications==
Mass spectrometry has both qualitative and quantitative uses. These include identifying unknown compounds, determining the isotopic composition of elements in a molecule, and determining the structure of a compound by observing its fragmentation. Other uses include quantifying the amount of a compound in a sample or studying the fundamentals of gas phase ion chemistry (the chemistry of ions and neutrals in a vacuum). MS is now commonly used in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Quantification can be relative (analyzed relative to a reference sample) or absolute (analyzed using a standard curve method).

As an analytical technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm the presence of suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight, Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, Temporally resolved chemical data.

A few of the disadvantages of the method is that it often fails to distinguish between optical and geometrical isomers and the positions of substituent in o-, m- and p- positions in an aromatic ring. Also, its scope is limited in identifying hydrocarbons that produce similar fragmented ions.

===Isotope ratio MS: isotope dating and tracing===
Mass spectrometry is also used to determine the isotopic composition of elements within a sample. Differences in mass among isotopes of an element are very small, and the less abundant isotopes of an element are typically very rare, so a very sensitive instrument is required. These instruments, sometimes referred to as isotope ratio mass spectrometers (IR-MS), usually use a single magnet to bend a beam of ionized particles towards a series of Faraday cups which convert particle impacts to electric current. A fast on-line analysis of deuterium content of water can be done using flowing afterglow mass spectrometry, FA-MS. Probably the most sensitive and accurate mass spectrometer for this purpose is the accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS). This is because it provides ultimate sensitivity, capable of measuring individual atoms and measuring nuclides with a dynamic range of ~1015 relative to the major stable isotope. Isotope ratios are important markers of a variety of processes. Some isotope ratios are used to determine the age of materials for example as in carbon dating. Labeling with stable isotopes is also used for protein quantification. (see protein characterization below)

==== Membrane-introduction mass spectrometry: measuring gases in solution ====
Membrane-introduction mass spectrometry combines the isotope ratio MS with a reaction chamber/cell separated by a gas-permeable membrane. This method allows the study of gases as they evolve in solution. This method has been extensively used for the study of the production of oxygen by Photosystem II.

===Trace gas analysis===
Several techniques use ions created in a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: selected ion flow tube (SIFT-MS), and proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical ionization dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics without the need for internal standard or calibration.

Another technique with applications in trace gas analysis field is secondary electrospray ionization (SESI-MS), which is a variant of electrospray ionization. SESI consist of an electrospray plume of pure acidified solvent that interacts with neutral vapors.  Vapor molecules get ionized at atmospheric pressure when charge is transferred from the ions formed in the electrospray to the molecules. One advantage of this approach is that it is compatible with most ESI-MS systems.

===Residual gas analysis===
===Atom probe===
An atom probe is an instrument that combines time-of-flight mass spectrometry and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Pharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is not uncommon to use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.

There is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for microdosing studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to animal experimentation.

Recent studies show that secondary electrospray ionization (SESI) is a powerful technique to monitor drug kinetics via breath analysis. Because breath is naturally produced, several datapoints can be readily collected. This allows for the number of collected data-points to be greatly increased. In animal studies, this approach SESI can reduce animal sacrifice. In humans, SESI-MS non-invasive analysis of breath can help study the kinetics of drugs at a personalized level.

===Protein characterization===

Mass spectrometry is an important method for the characterization and sequencing of proteins. The two primary methods for ionization of whole proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). In keeping with the performance and mass range of available mass spectrometers, two approaches are used for characterizing proteins. In the first, intact proteins are ionized by either of the two techniques described above, and then introduced to a mass analyzer. This approach is referred to as &quot;top-down&quot; strategy of protein analysis. The top-down approach however is largely limited to low-throughput single-protein studies. In the second, proteins are enzymatically digested into smaller peptides using proteases such as trypsin or pepsin, either in solution or in gel after electrophoretic separation. Other proteolytic agents are also used. The collection of peptide products are often separated by chromatography prior to introduction to the mass analyzer. When the characteristic pattern of peptides is used for the identification of the protein the method is called peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF), if the identification is performed using the sequence data determined in tandem MS analysis it is called de novo peptide sequencing. These procedures of protein analysis are also referred to as the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, and have also been used to analyse the distribution and position of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation on proteins. A third approach is also beginning to be used, this intermediate &quot;middle-down&quot; approach involves analyzing proteolytic peptides that are larger than the typical tryptic peptide.

===Space exploration===
As a standard method for analysis, mass spectrometers have reached other planets and moons. Two were taken to Mars by the Viking program. In early 2005 the Cassini–Huygens mission delivered a specialized GC-MS instrument aboard the Huygens probe through the atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn. This instrument analyzed atmospheric samples along its descent trajectory and was able to vaporize and analyze samples of Titan&#x27;s frozen, hydrocarbon covered surface once the probe had landed. These measurements compare the abundance of isotope(s) of each particle comparatively to earth&#x27;s natural abundance. Also on board the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft was an ion and neutral mass spectrometer which had been taking measurements of Titan&#x27;s atmospheric composition as well as the composition of Enceladus&#x27; plumes. A Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer mass spectrometer was carried by the Mars Phoenix Lander launched in 2007.

Mass spectrometers are also widely used in space missions to measure the composition of plasmas. For example, the Cassini spacecraft carried the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS), which measured the mass of ions in Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere.

===Respired gas monitor===
Mass spectrometers were used in hospitals for respiratory gas analysis beginning around 1975 through the end of the century. Some are probably still in use but none are currently being manufactured.

Found mostly in the operating room, they were a part of a complex system, in which respired gas samples from patients undergoing anesthesia were drawn into the instrument through a valve mechanism designed to sequentially connect up to 32 rooms to the mass spectrometer. A computer directed all operations of the system. The data collected from the mass spectrometer was delivered to the individual rooms for the anesthesiologist to use.

The uniqueness of this magnetic sector mass spectrometer may have been the fact that a plane of detectors, each purposely positioned to collect all of the ion species expected to be in the samples, allowed the instrument to simultaneously report all of the gases respired by the patient. Although the mass range was limited to slightly over 120 u, fragmentation of some of the heavier molecules negated the need for a higher detection limit.

===Preparative mass spectrometry===
The primary function of mass spectrometry is as a tool for chemical analyses based on detection and quantification of ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. However, mass spectrometry also shows promise for material synthesis. Ion soft landing is characterized by deposition of intact species on surfaces at low kinetic energies which precludes the fragmentation of the incident species. The soft landing technique was first reported in 1977 for the reaction of low energy sulfur containing ions on a lead surface.

<text>Mathura () is a city and the administrative headquarters of Mathura district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is located north of Agra, and south-east of Delhi; about from the town of Vrindavan, and from Govardhan. In ancient times, Mathura was an economic hub, located at the junction of important caravan routes. The 2011 Census of India estimated the population of Mathura at 441,894.

In Hinduism, the birthplace of Krishna, one of the main deities in that religion, is believed to be located in Mathura at the Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex. It is one of the Sapta Puri, the seven cities considered holy by Hindus, also is called Mokshyadayni Tirth. The Kesava Deo Temple was built in ancient times on the site of Krishna&#x27;s birthplace (an underground prison). Mathura was the capital of the kingdom of Surasena, ruled by Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krishna. Mathura is part of the Krishna circuit (Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Govardhan, Kurukshetra, Dwarka and Bhalka). Krishna Janmashtami is grandly celebrated in Mathura every year.

Mathura has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme of Government of India.

==History==
Traditionally it is believed that it was founded by Shatrughna after killing Yadava Lavana at the site of Madhuvana. According to Ramayana it was founded by Madhu (a man of the Yadu tribe). Later on Madhu&#x27;s son Lavanasura was defeated by Satrughana. Madhu says all the territory of Mathura belongs to Abhiras.


Mathura, which lies at the centre of the cultural region of Braj has an ancient history and is also believed to be the homeland and birthplace of Krishna, who belonged to the Yadu dynasty. According to the Archaeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, the city is mentioned in the oldest Indian epic, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. In the epic, the Ikshwaku prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura. The most important pilgrimage site in Mathura was Katra (&#x27;market place&#x27;), now referred to as Krishna Janmasthan (&#x27;the birthplace of Krishna&#x27;). Excavations at the site revealed pottery and terracotta dating to the sixth century BCE, the remains of a large Buddhist complex, including a monastery called Yasha Vihara of the Gupta period, as well as Jain sculptures of the same era.

===Ancient history===
Archaeological excavations at Mathura show the gradual growth of a village into an important city during the Vedic age. The earliest period belonged to the Painted Grey Ware culture (1100–500 BCE), followed by the Northern Black Polished Ware culture (700–200 BCE). Mathura derived its importance as a center of trade due to its location where the northern trade route of the Indo-Gangetic Plain met with the routes to Malwa (central India) and the west coast. Archaeologists have discovered a fragment of Mathura red sandstone from Rakhigarhi - a site of Indus Valley civilisation dated to third millennium BCE - which was used as a grindstone; red sandstone was also a popular material for historic period sculptures.

By the sixth century BCE Mathura became the capital of the Surasena Kingdom. The city was later ruled by the Maurya empire (fourth to second centuries BCE). Megasthenes, writing in the early third century BCE, mentions Mathura as a great city under the name Μέθορα (&quot;Méthora&quot;). It seems it never was under the direct control of the following Shunga dynasty (2nd century BCE) as not a single archaeological remain of a Shunga presence were ever found in Mathura.

The Indo-Greeks may have taken control, direct or indirect, of Mathura some time between 180 BCE and 100 BCE, and remained so as late as 70 BCE according to the Yavanarajya inscription, which was found in Maghera, a town from Mathura. The opening of the 3 line text of this inscription in Brahmi script translates as: &quot;In the 116th year of the Yavana kingdom...&quot; or &#x27;&quot;In the 116th year of Yavana hegemony&quot; (&quot;Yavanarajya&quot;) However, this also corresponds to the presence of the native Mitra dynasty of local rulers in Mathura, in approximately the same time frame (150 BCE—50 BCE), possibly pointing to a vassalage relationship with the Indo-Greeks.

====Indo-Scythians====
After a period of local rule, Mathura was conquered by the Indo-Scythians during the first century BCE. The Indo-Scythian satraps of Mathura are sometimes called the &quot;Northern Satraps&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Western Satraps&quot; ruling in Gujarat and Malwa. However, Indo-Scythian control proved to be short lived, following the reign of the Indo-Scythian &quot;Mahakshatrapa&quot; (&quot;Great Satrap&quot;) Rajuvula, –25 CE. The Mora Well inscription of Mahakshatrapa Rajuvula, of the early decades of the first century CE, found in a village seven miles from Mathura, stated that images &quot;pratima(h)&quot; of the blessed (&quot;bhagavatam&quot;) five Vrishni heroes, were installed in a stone shrine of a person called Tosa. The heroes were identified from a passage in the Vayu Purana as Samkarsana, Vasudev, Pradyumna, Samba, and Aniruddha. The English translation of the inscription read:-

The Mathura inscription of the time of Mahakshatrapa Rajuvula&#x27;s son, Mahakshatrapa Sodasa recorded erection of a &quot;torana&quot; (gateway), &quot;vedika&quot; (terrace) and &quot;chatuhsala&quot; (quadrangle) at the &quot;Mahasthana&quot; (great place) of Bhagavat Vasudeva. Several male torsos representing the Vrisni heroes were also found in a shrine in Mora dating to the time of Mahakshatrapa Sodasa.

====Kushan Empire====
During the rule of the great Kushanas, art and culture flourished in the region and reached new heights and is now famously known as the Mathura School of Art. The Kushans took control of Mathura some time after Mahakshatrapa Sodasa, although several of his successors ruled as Kushans vassals, such as the Indo-Scythian &quot;Great Satrap&quot; Kharapallana and the &quot;Satrap&quot; Vanaspara, both of whom paid allegiance to the Kushans in an inscription at Sarnath, dating to the third year of the reign of the Kushan emperor Kanishka the Great CE. Mathuran art and culture reached its zenith under the Kushan dynasty which had Mathura as one of its capitals. The preceding capitals of the Kushans included Kapisa (modern Bagram, Afghanistan), Purushapura (modern Peshawar, Pakistan) and Takshasila/Sirsukh/ (modern Taxila, Pakistan). Mathura ateliers were most active during the epoch of the great Kushan emperors Kanishka, Huvishka, Vasudeva whose reign represents the Golden Age of Mathura sculpture. During the third century, Nagas ruled Mathura after decline of Kushan Empire.

====Gupta Empire====
In the reign of Chandragupta Vikramaditya, a magnificent temple of Vishnu was built at the site of Katra Keshavadeva. Kalidasa, hailed as the greatest poet and dramatist in Sanskrit, in the fourth-fifth century CE mentioned the groves of Vrindavan and Govardhan hill as:

Chinese Buddhist Monk Faxian mentions the city as a centre of Buddhism about 400 CE. He found the people were very well off, there were no taxes other than for those on farmers who tilled the royal land. He found that people did not kill animals, no one consumed wine, and did not eat onion or garlic. He found that engraved title deeds were issued to land owners. Visiting priests were provided with accommodation, beds, mats, food, drinks and clothes to perform scholarly works.

====Harsha Empire====
Xuanzang, who visited the city in 634 CE, mentions it as Mot&#x27;ulo, recording that it contained twenty Buddhist monasteries and many Hindu temples. Later, he went east to Thanesar, Jalandhar in the eastern Punjab, before climbing up to visit predominantly Theravada monasteries in the Kulu valley and turning southward again to Bairat and then Mathura, on the Yamuna river.

===Medieval History and Islamic Invasions===

====Early Middle Ages====
The famous female Alvar saint, Andal visualised going to a pilgrimage which began at Mathura, then proceeded to Gokul, the Yamuna, the pool of Kaliya, Vrindavan, Govardhan, and finished at Dwarka. The eleventh century Kashmiri poet, Bilhana visited Mathura and Vrindavan after leaving Kashmir en route to Karnataka.

====High Middle Ages====
The city was sacked and many of its temples destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018 CE. The capture of Mathura by Maḥmūd Ibn Sebüktegīn is described by the historian al-Utbi (Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Muhammad al Jabbaru-l &#x27;Utbi) in his work Tarikh Yamini as follows:

The temple at Katra was sacked by Maḥmūd Ibn Sebüktegīn. A temple was built to replace it in 1150 CE. The Mathura &quot;prasasti&quot; (Eulogistic Inscription) dated Samvat (V.S.) 1207 (1150 CE), said to have been found in 1889 CE at the Keshava mound by Anton Fuhrer, German Indologist who worked with the Archaeological Survey of India, recorded the foundations of a temple dedicated to Vishnu at the Katra site:

Jajja was a vassal of the Gahadavalas in charge of Mathura, and the committee mentioned in the &quot;prasasti&quot; could have been of an earlier Vaishnava temple. The temple built by Jajja at Katra was destroyed by the forces of Qutubuddin Aibak, though Feroz Tughlaq (r. 1351–88 CE) was also said to have attacked it. It was repaired and survived till the reign of Sikandar Lodi (r. 1489–1517 CE).

In the twelfth century, Bhatta Lakshmidhara, chief minister of the Gahadavala king Govindachandra (r. 1114–1155 CE), wrote the earliest surviving collection of verses in praise of the sacred sites of Mathura in his work Krtyakalpataru, which has been described as &quot;the first re-statement of the theory of &quot;Tirtha-yatra&quot; (pilgrimage)&quot;. In his Krtyakalpataru, Bhatta Lakshmidhara devoted an entire section (9) to Mathura.

Later on the city was sacked again by Sikandar Lodi, who ruled the Sultanate of Delhi from 1489 to 1517 CE. Sikandar Lodi earned the epithet of &#x27;Butt Shikan&#x27;, the &#x27;Destroyer of Idols&#x27;. Ferishta recorded that Sikandar Lodi was a staunch Muslim, with a passion for vandalising heathen temples:

In Tarikh-i Daudi, of &#x27;Abdu-lla (written during the time of Jahangir) said of Sikandar Lodi:

Vallabhacharya and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu arrived in the Braj region, in search of sacred places that had been destroyed or lost. In &quot;Shrikrsnashrayah&quot;, that make up the &quot;Sodashagrantha&quot;, Vallabha said of his age:

====Late Middle Ages====

The Portuguese, Father Antonio Monserrate (1536 CE-1600 CE), who was on a Jesuit mission at the Mughal Court during the times of Akbar, visited Mathura in 1580–82, and noted that all temples built at sites associated with the deeds of Krishna were in ruins:-

The Keshavadeva temple was rebuilt by the Bundela Rajput Rajah Vir Singh Deo at a cost of thirty-three lakh rupees when the gold was priced at around ₹ 10/- per &quot;tola&quot;. And the grand structure of the temple in Mathura was regarded a &quot;wonder of the age&quot;.

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, built the Shahi-Eidgah Mosque during his rule, which is adjacent to Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi believed to be over a Hindu temple. He also changed the city&#x27;s name to Islamabad. In 1669, Aurangzeb issued a general order for the demolition of Hindu schools and temples, in 1670, specifically ordered the destruction of the Keshavadeva temple. Saqi Mustaid Khan recorded:

The Muslim conquest resulted in the destruction of all Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu temples and monuments in and around Mathura. Buddhism, already in decline, never revived, and for the next four hundred years the Jains and Hindus were unable to erect any temples that were not sooner or later demolished. Many of the sites that had been places of religious importance were abandoned and gradually sank beneath the earth. But some of them were not forgotten, owing to the persistence of oral tradition, the refashioning of a temple into a mosque, or the presence of humble shrines, some of which housed sculptural fragments of earlier buildings. Several of them have survived as places of significance in the modern pilgrimage circuit.

&quot;The rebellion in Mathurá district seems to have gained ground. &#x27;On the 14th Rajab, 1080, [28 November 1669], his Majesty left Dihlí for Akbarábád, and almost daily enjoyed the pleasures of the chase. On the 21st Rajab, whilst hunting, he received the report of a rebellion having broken out at Mauza&#x27; Rewarah, Chandarkah, and Surkhrú. Hasan &#x27;Ali Khán was ordered to attack the rebels at night, which he did, and the firing lasted till 12 o&#x27;clock the next day. The rebels, unable longer to withstand, thinking of the honour of their families, now fought with short arms, and many imperial soldiers and companions of Hasan ’Alí were killed. Three hundred rebels were sent to perdition, and two hundred and fifty, men and women, caught. Hasan ’Alí, in the afternoon, reported personally the result of the fight, and was ordered to leave the prisoners and the cattle in charge of Sayyid Zain ul-&#x27;Abidin, the jágirdár of the place. Çaf Shikan Khán also (who after ’Abdunnabí&#x27;s death had been appointed Faujdár of Mathura) waited on the emperor, and was ordered to tell off two hundred troopers to guard the fields attached to the villages, and prevent soldiers from plundering and kidnapping children. Námdár Khán, Faujdár of Murádábád, also came to pay his respects. Çafshikan Khán was removed from his office, and Hasan &#x27;Ali Khán was appointed Faujdár of Mathura, with a command of Three Thousand and Five Hundred, 2000 troopers, and received a dress of honour, a sword, and a horse. * * * On the 18th Sha&#x27;bán [1st January, 1670), his Majesty entered Agrah. Kokilá Ját, the wicked ringleader of the rebels of District*..., who had been the cause of ’Abdunnabí&#x27;s death and who had plundered Parganah Sa&#x27;dábád, was at last caught by Hasan ’Alí Khán and his zealous peshkár, Shaikh Razíuddin, and he was now sent with the Shaikh to Agrah, where by order of his Majesty he was executed. Kokila&#x27;s son and daughter were given to Jawahir Khán Nazir [a eunuch]. The girl was later married to Shah Quli, the well-known Chelah; and his son, who was called Fázil, became in time so excellent a Hafiz [one who knows the Qorán by heart], that his Majesty preferred him to all others and even chaunted passages to him. Shaikh Razíuddin, who had captured Kokila, belonged to a respectable family in Bhagalpur, Bihár, and was an excellent soldier, administrator, and companion; he was at the same time so learned, that he was ordered to assist in the compilation of the Fatáwá i &#x27;Alamgiri [the great code of Muhammadan laws]. He received a daily allowance of three rupees.&#x27;+ (Haásir i ’Alamgiri, pp. 92 to 91.) Hasan ’Alí Khán retained his office from 1080 to Sha&#x27;bán 1087 (October, 1676), when Sulțán Qulí Khán was appointed Faujdír of Mathurá.&quot;, Asiatic Society of Bengal, &quot;Proceedings&quot;

===Early Modern History===
According the biographer of Raja Jai Singh, Atmaram, when Jai Singh was campaigning against the Jat Raja Churaman Singh, he bathed at Radha &quot;kund&quot; on the full moon of Kartik, went to Mathura in the month of Shravan in 1724, and performed the marriage of his daughter on &quot;Janmashtami&quot;. He then undertook a tour of the sacred forests of Braj, and, on his return to Mathura, founded religious establishments and celebrated Holi.

====Pilgrimage by the Family of Peshwa of Maratha Empire====

During the period of the expansion of Maratha Empire, pilgrimage to the holy places in the north became quite frequent. Pilgrims required protection on the way and took advantage of the constant movement of troops that journeyed to and back from their homeland for military purposes. That is how the practice arose of ladies accompanying military expeditions. The mother of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, Kashitai performed her famous pilgrimage for four years in the north, visiting Mathura, Prayag, Ayodhya, Banaras, and other holy places.

Kankali Tila brought forth many treasures of Jain art. The archaeological findings testify the existence of two Jain temples and stupas. Numerous Jain sculptures, Ayagapatas (tablet of homage), pillars, crossbeams and lintels were found during archaeological excavations. Some of the sculptures are provided with inscriptions that report on the contemporary society and organisation of the Jain community.

Most sculptures could be dated from the second century BC to the 12th century CE, thus representing a continuous period of about 14 centuries during which Jainism flourished at Mathura. These sculptures are now housed in the Lucknow State Museum and in the Mathura Museum.

The Mathura Museum is notable for archaeological artefacts, especially those from the Kushan and Gupta empires. It has sculptures associated with Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.
