<text>Patti Ann LuPone (born April 21, 1949) is an American actress and singer. After starting her professional career with The Acting Company in 1972 she soon gained acclaim for her leading performances on the Broadway and West End stage. Known for playing bold, resilient women in musical theater, she has received numerous accolades, including three Tony Awards, two Olivier Awards and two Grammy Awards in addition to two Emmy Award nominations. She was inducted to the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2006.

She made her Broadway debut in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; in 1973. She went on to receive three Tony Awards: two for Best Actress in a Musical for her roles as Eva Perón in Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Evita&quot; (1980), and Rose in &quot;&quot; (2008) and one for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for playing Joanne in the Stephen Sondheim revival &quot;Company&quot; (2022). She was Tony-nominated for &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; (1975), &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1988), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2006), &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; (2010), and &quot;War Paint&quot; (2017).

For her performances on the West End stage she received two Laurence Olivier Awards: one for Best Actress in a Musical for her performances as Fantine in the original London cast of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and Moll in &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; in 1985, and the second for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical for &quot;Company&quot; in 2019. She was nominated for her role as Norma Desmond in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; in 1993. She has two Grammy Awards for the recording of the 2007 Los Angeles Opera production of &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;.

On television, she starred in the drama series &quot;Life Goes On&quot; (1989–1993) and was Emmy Award-nominated for &quot;The Song Spinner&quot; (1995) and &quot;Frasier&quot; (1998). She appeared in three Ryan Murphy series: &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (2013–2014, 2022), &quot;Pose&quot; (2019), and &quot;Hollywood&quot; (2020). She also acted in &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016), &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (2017), and &quot;Agatha All Along&quot; (2024). LuPone&#x27;s film roles include &quot;1941&quot; (1979), &quot;Witness&quot; (1985), &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999), &quot;State and Main&quot; (2000), and &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; (2023).

==Early life and training==
LuPone was born on April 21, 1949, in Northport, New York, on Long Island, the daughter of Italian-American parents Angela Louise (née Patti), a library administrator at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, and Orlando Joseph LuPone, a school administrator and English teacher at Walt Whitman High School in Huntington, NY. Her great-great aunt was 19th-century Spanish-born Italian opera singer Adelina Patti. Her father&#x27;s side came from Abruzzo, while her mother&#x27;s side is Sicilian. Lucille Ball was a family friend, after attending grade school with LuPone&#x27;s mother. Her older brother Robert LuPone was a Tony-nominated actor, dancer, and director who originated the role of Zach, the director, in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. She grew up Catholic.

LuPone was part of the first graduating class of Juilliard&#x27;s Drama Division (1968–1972: &quot;Group 1&quot;), which also included actors Kevin Kline and David Ogden Stiers. She graduated from Juilliard in 1972 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. According to LuPone, her rigorous Juilliard training has instilled in her &quot;a respect for the craft of acting and the stage&quot;, but maintains that it did little to prepare her for the realties of pursuing a career on Broadway. LuPone has a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and she is known for her strong/high &quot;Broadway&quot; belt singing voice. In a 2008 interview, she maintained that she was &quot;an actor who sings&quot;, and thankful she &quot;had a voice&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1970–1979: Early roles and breakthrough ===
In 1972, LuPone became one of the original members of The Acting Company, formed by John Houseman. The Acting Company is a nationally touring repertory theater company. LuPone&#x27;s stint with the company lasted from 1972 to 1976, and she appeared in many of their productions, such as &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, &quot;Women Beware Women&quot;, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;, &quot;The Hostage&quot;, &quot;Next Time I&#x27;ll Sing to You&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, &quot;Scapin&quot;, &quot;Edward II&quot;, &quot;The Orchestra&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, and &quot;The Way of the World&quot;. She made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; as Irina in 1973. For her work in &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; (1975) she received her first Tony Award nomination, for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. The Acting Company honored LuPone on March 12, 2012, in an event called &quot;Patti&#x27;s Turn&quot; at the Kaye Playhouse.

In 1976, theater producer David Merrick hired LuPone as a replacement to play Genevieve, the title role of the troubled pre-Broadway production of &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The production toured at length but Merrick deemed it unworthy of Broadway and it closed out of town.

Since 1977, LuPone has frequently collaborated with David Mamet, appearing in his plays &quot;The Woods&quot;, &quot;All Men Are Whores&quot;, &quot;The Blue Hour&quot;, &quot;The Water Engine&quot; (1978), &quot;Edmond&quot;, &quot;The Old Neighborhood&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Anarchist&quot; (2012). &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote of LuPone in &quot;The Old Neighborhood&quot;, &quot;Those who know Ms. LuPone only as a musical comedy star will be stunned by the naturalistic fire she delivers here. As Jolly, a part inspired by Mr. Mamet&#x27;s real-life sister and his realized female character, Ms. LuPone finds conflicting layers of past and present selves in practically every line. She emerges as both loving matriarch and wounded adolescent, sentimental and devastatingly clear-eyed.&quot; In 1978, she appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation of Studs Terkel&#x27;s &quot;Working&quot;, which ran for only 24 performances.

=== 1979–1999: &quot;Evita&quot; and Broadway stardom === 

In 1979, LuPone starred in the original Broadway production of &quot;Evita&quot;, the musical based on the life of Eva Perón, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, and directed by Harold Prince. She reportedly won the role over 200 auditionees, including Meryl Streep, Ann-Margret and Raquel Welch. Although LuPone was hailed by critics, she has since said that her time in &quot;Evita&quot; was not an enjoyable one. In a 2007 interview, she stated &quot;&quot;Evita&quot; was the worst experience of my life,&quot; she said. &quot;I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.&quot; Despite the trouble, LuPone won her first Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me, Argentina&quot;, a song she performed for the show, became one of her signature songs throughout her career. It was not until she had reprised the role in a production in Sydney when she had finally enjoyed the part and felt comfortable singing the score. LuPone and her co-star, Mandy Patinkin, remained close friends both on and off the stage.

In 1980, LuPone&#x27;s cabaret act, &quot;Patti LuPone at Les Mouches,&quot; played for 27 consecutive weeks on Saturday evenings at midnight following her 8pm performance in Evita. The New York Daily News reviewed saying, &quot;Anyone who thinks there are no volcanoes in New York should check out Les Mouches any Saturday midnight in March. It is here at the witching hour that Patti LuPone fulminates, thunders, and showers the room with sparks of her debut cabaret act.&quot; In 2008, a restored recording was released as an album by Ghostlight Records.

In 1983, LuPone starred as Rosalind opposite Val Kilmer in &quot;As You Like It&quot; at the Guthrie Theatre, directed by Liviu Ciulei. In May 1983, founding alumni of The Acting Company reunited for an off-Broadway revival of Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s landmark labor musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; at the American Place Theater. It was narrated by John Houseman with LuPone in the roles of Moll and Sister Mister. The production premiered at The Acting Company&#x27;s summer residence at Chautauqua Institution, toured the United States including an engagement at the Highland Park, Illinois&#x27; Ravinia Festival in 1984 and played in London&#x27;s West End. When the run ended, LuPone remained in London to create the role of Fantine in Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s original London production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, in 1985, which premiered at the Barbican Theatre, at that time the London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company. LuPone had previously worked for Mackintosh in a short-lived Broadway revival of &quot;Oliver!&quot; in 1984, playing Nancy opposite Ron Moody as Fagin. For her work in both &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; and &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, LuPone received the 1985 Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.
She returned to Broadway in 1987 to star as nightclub singer Reno Sweeney in the Lincoln Center Theater revival of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. She starred opposite Howard McGillin, and they both received Tony nominations for their performances. The Lincoln Center cast reassembled for a one-night-only concert performance of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; in New York in 2002. Among LuPone&#x27;s film credits are &quot;Fighting Back&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Just Looking&quot;, &quot;The Victim&quot;, &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;, &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot;, &quot;1941&quot;, &quot;Wise Guys&quot;, Nancy Savoca&#x27;s &quot;The 24 Hour Woman&quot; and Savoca&#x27;s &quot;Union Square&quot;, &quot;Family Prayers&quot;, and &quot;City by the Sea&quot;. She has also worked with playwright David Mamet on &quot;The Water Engine&quot;, &quot;State and Main&quot;, and &quot;Heist&quot;. She played Lady Bird Johnson in the TV movie, &quot;&quot; (1987). 

LuPone played Libby Thatcher on the television drama &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, which ran on ABC from 1989 to 1993. In the 1990s she had a recurring role as defense attorney Ruth Miller on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. She has twice been nominated for an Emmy Award: for the TV movie &quot;The Song Spinner&quot; (1995, Daytime Emmy Award nominee), and for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series on &quot;Frasier&quot; in 1998. She had a cameo as herself that year on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Kelsey Grammer. In 1993, LuPone returned to London to create the role of Norma Desmond in the original production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; at the Adelphi Theater. There was much anticipation of LuPone appearing in another Lloyd Webber musical, the first since her performance in &quot;Evita&quot;. Her time in the show was difficult, and she was abruptly fired by Lloyd Webber. Lloyd Webber then selected Glenn Close to open the show in Los Angeles and eventually on Broadway, despite LuPone being contracted to open both productions. She says she was essentially blacklisted in Hollywood after the &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; debacle due to rumors that she had been difficult to work with in New York. 

In November 1995, LuPone starred in her one-woman show, &quot;Patti LuPone on Broadway&quot;, at the Walter Kerr Theatre. For her work, she received an Outer Critics Circle Award. The following year, she was selected by producer Robert Whitehead to succeed his wife, Zoe Caldwell in the Broadway production of Terrence McNally&#x27;s play &quot;Master Class&quot;, based on the master classes given by operatic diva Maria Callas at Juilliard. LuPone received positive reviews, with Vincent Canby writing &quot;Ms. LuPone really is vulnerable here in a way that wasn&#x27;t anticipated: she&#x27;s in the process of creating a role for which she isn&#x27;t ideally suited, but she&#x27;s working like a trouper to get it right.&quot; She appeared in the play in the West End.

=== 2000–2009: Sondheim revivals and acclaim ===

In November 2001, she starred in a Broadway revival of &quot;Noises Off&quot;, with Peter Gallagher and Faith Prince. LuPone has performed in many New York concert productions of musicals including &quot;Pal Joey&quot; with Peter Gallagher and Bebe Neuwirth, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; with Peter Gallagher, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; with George Hearn in both New York and San Francisco, &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with Howard McGillin, &quot;Can-Can&quot; with Michael Nouri for &quot;City Center Encores!&quot;, &quot;Candide&quot; with Kristin Chenoweth, &quot;Passion&quot; with Michael Cerveris and Audra McDonald and &quot;&quot; with Boyd Gaines and Laura Benanti for City Center Encores!. Her performances in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, and &quot;Candide&quot; were recorded and broadcast for PBSs &quot;Great Performances&quot; and were released on DVD. The concert staging of &quot;Passion&quot; was televised as part of &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot;. Since 2001, LuPone has been a regular performer at the Chicago Ravinia Festival. She starred in a six-year-long series of concert presentations of Stephen Sondheim musicals, which began in honor of his seventieth birthday. Her roles here have included Mrs. Lovett in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, Fosca in &quot;Passion&quot;, Cora Hoover Hooper in &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, Rose in &quot;&quot; and two different roles in &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. 

LuPone&#x27;s TV work also included a recurring role on her cousin Tom Fontana&#x27;s HBO series in its final season, &quot;Oz&quot; (2003). She appeared as herself on a February 2005 episode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. She also appeared on the series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; in March 2007 as the mother of Marc St. James (played by Michael Urie). LuPone had a recurring guest role as Frank Rossitano&#x27;s mother on &quot;30 Rock&quot;. LuPone appeared as herself in the season two finale of the television series &quot;Glee&quot;.

She returned to Broadway in October 2005 to star as Mrs. Lovett in John Doyle&#x27;s new Broadway production of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. In this radically different interpretation of the musical, the ten actors on stage also served as the show&#x27;s orchestra, and LuPone played the tuba and orchestra bells as well as performing the score vocally. For her performance, she received a Tony Award nomination as well as Golden Icon Award for Best Female Musical Theater Performance. In August 2006, LuPone took a three-week leave from &quot;Sweeney&quot; in order to play Rose in Lonny Price&#x27;s production of &quot;&quot; at Ravinia. &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; closed in September 2006.

On February 10, 2007, LuPone starred with Audra McDonald in the Los Angeles Opera production of Kurt Weill&#x27;s opera &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; directed by John Doyle. The cast recording of &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; was recognized at the 51st Grammy Awards as Best Classical Album and Best Opera Recording in February 2009.

Following the Ravinia Festival production of &quot;Gypsy&quot;, LuPone and author Arthur Laurents mended a decade-long rift, and she was cast in the City Center Encores! &quot;Summer Stars&quot; production of the show. Laurents directed LuPone in &quot;Gypsy&quot; for a 22-performance run (July 9, 2007 – July 29, 2007) at City Center. This production of &quot;Gypsy&quot; then transferred to Broadway, opening March 27, 2008 at the St. James Theatre. LuPone won the Outer Critics Circle Award, Drama League Award, Drama Desk Award and Tony Award for her performance in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. It closed on January 11, 2009. During the penultimate performance of &quot;Gypsy&quot; on January 10, 2009, LuPone interrupted her performance of &quot;Rose&#x27;s Turn&quot; to address an audience member using a flash camera, a violation of theater etiquette. After the patron was removed, LuPone resumed her performance to applause. This incident, captured on video and widely circulated online, sparked a broader discussion about the impact of audience distractions on live theater.

=== 2010–2019: Career expansion ===

In August 2010, LuPone appeared in a three-day run of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; where she played the title role opposite Patrick Cassidy at the Ravinia Festival, directed by Lonny Price. That same year, LuPone created the role of Lucia in the original Broadway production of &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot;, which opened at the Belasco Theater on November 4, 2010, and closed on January 2, 2011, after 23 preview and 69 regular performances. LuPone was nominated for a Tony and Drama Desk, and an Outer Critics Circle Award for her performance. LuPone&#x27;s memoir recounting her life and career from childhood onwards, was published in September 2010 titled &quot;Patti LuPone: A Memoir&quot;. It was a New York Times Best Seller. 

In 2011, LuPone played the role of Joanne in a four-night limited engagement concert production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Company&quot; at the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Paul Gemignani. The production starred Neil Patrick Harris as Bobby. Harris had previously worked with LuPone in the 2000 and 2001 concert productions of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. The cast of &quot;Company&quot; performed the song &quot;Side by Side by Side&quot; at the 65th Tony Awards on June 12, 2011. LuPone made her New York City Ballet debut in May 2011 in a production of &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett. A piece she had previously performed, LuPone sang the role of Anna in the Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht score. LuPone concluded a 63-performance Broadway engagement of her concert with former &quot;Evita&quot; co-star Mandy Patinkin entitled &quot;An Evening with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin&quot;. The run started on November 21, 2011, at the Ethel Barrymore Theater and ended on January 13, 2012. In late 2012, LuPone appeared with Debra Winger in the premiere of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;The Anarchist&quot;. 

In 2011, the feature film &quot;Union Square&quot;, co-written and directed by the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Jury Award Winner, Nancy Savoca, was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In it, LuPone co-starred with Mira Sorvino, Tammy Blanchard, Mike Doyle, Michael Rispoli and Daphne Rubin-Vega.
LuPone guest starred on &quot;Army Wives&quot; on July 8, 2012. She reunited with fellow guest star Kellie Martin as her mother once again. LuPone appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Parker&quot;, an action-thriller. She voiced the character Yellow Diamond in the animated series &quot;Steven Universe&quot; (2013–2019) and &quot;Steven Universe Future&quot; (2019–2020). In 2013, LuPone was cast in the third season of the FX series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; as Joan Ramsey, a religious mother with a hidden past, and played herself in the third season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Girls&quot;. In 2015, she appeared in several episodes of the Showtime horror series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; as a cantankerous yet powerful white witch. She returned to the show in 2016 in the role of Dr. Seward, an alienist aiding Eva Green&#x27;s character. Seward is an adaptation of John Seward from Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula, and claims to be a descendant of Joan Clayton, the character LuPone portrayed in the second season. Also in 2016, she began appearing in &quot;Steven Universe&quot; as the voice of Yellow Diamond, reprising the role in the movie and the epilogue series &quot;Steven Universe Future&quot;. 

In early 2015, she returned to Los Angeles Opera to perform the role of Samira in a new production of John Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot;, receiving positive reviews. In April 2016, an audio recording of the production was released by Pentatone (PTC 5186538, a 2-SACD album). It won the 2017 Grammy Awards for Best Classical Album and for Best Opera Recording. In June 2015, LuPone appeared in the Douglas Carter Beane play &quot;Shows for Days&quot; at Lincoln Center Theater. LuPone again received media attention for an incident during a &quot;Shows for Days&quot; performance when she confiscated a patron&#x27;s cellphone after they were observed using it during the show; it was returned after the performance. LuPone expressed frustration with audience members who disrupt performances with their phones, stating, &quot;We work hard on stage to create a world that is being totally destroyed by a few, rude, self-absorbed and inconsiderate audience members who are controlled by their phones.&quot; In October 2015, LuPone, along with the current Fantine on the West End, joined her castmates to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

In 2017, LuPone originated the role of Helena Rubinstein in the musical &quot;War Paint&quot; on Broadway, after performing the role in the summer of 2016 in the musical&#x27;s world premiere at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre. Performing opposite Christine Ebersole as Rubinstein&#x27;s longtime competitor Elizabeth Arden, LuPone stayed with the role for &quot;War Paint&quot;&#x27;s entire run at the Nederlander Theatre, from March 7 to November 5, 2017. The show closed prematurely to allow LuPone to undergo hip surgery. LuPone disclosed in an interview that &quot;War Paint&quot; would be her last musical on stage: &quot;I&#x27;m too old. It&#x27;s been hard—it&#x27;s been harder than it&#x27;s ever been. I can&#x27;t do it anymore.&quot; Nevertheless, in September 2017 it was announced that LuPone would star as Joanne in the 2018 London revival of &quot;Company&quot; alongside Rosalie Craig as Bobbie in a gender-swapped production directed by Marianne Elliot. For her performance she received her second Laurence Olivier Award, this time for Outstanding Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical. In August 2019, it was announced that the production would move to Broadway, with LuPone returning as Joanne and Katrina Lenk as Bobbie.

In 2019, LuPone played an antagonistic role in &quot;Pose&quot;, appearing in second season of the series. In 2020, LuPone starred in the Ryan Murphy series Hollywood for Netflix. The following year she teamed up with social media star Randy Rainbow to perform a duet song criticizing Donald Trump three weeks before the 2020 US election.

=== 2020–present ===
A transfer of the successful West End production of &quot;Company&quot; was set to open at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on March 22, 2020, coinciding with Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s 90th birthday, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The production returned, featuring LuPone starring opposite Katrina Lenk, with previews starting on November 15, 2021, before officially opening December 9, 2021. LuPone won her third Tony Award for the role. On May 10, 2022, during a live conversation with the American Theatre Wing and her &quot;Company&quot; co-stars, Patti LuPone publicly addressed a patron who was not wearing their face mask properly, a violation of Broadway League COVID-19 safety protocols. LuPone later explained that the patron had already been warned by theater staff and had responded dismissively. Her passionate response highlighted the importance of adhering to safety guidelines to ensure the continued operation of Broadway. This incident led to increased attention on safety protocols and a subsequent extension of the mask mandate by the Broadway League, from May 31 to June 30, 2022.

In 2023 she played Beau&#x27;s mother, Mona, in the Ari Aster surrealist horror film &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot;. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix, Nathan Lane, Richard Kind, and Amy Ryan. LuPone received critical acclaim for her performance with David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing &quot;[the film] features fabulous performances...most of all, LuPone in all her magnificent, scenery-chomping glory.&quot; Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also praised LuPone performance, comparing her role of an imperious mother to that of Angela Lansbury&#x27;s in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962).

In 2023, LuPone revealed that she would play the role of Lilia Calderu, a centuries-old witch with divination powers, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney+ series &quot;Agatha All Along&quot;. Calderu is a Romani character in the comics. The series received mostly positive reviews from critics, with LuPone&#x27;s performance in her character&#x27;s central episode, &quot;Death&#x27;s Hand in Mine&quot;, being particularly praised. Following the closing of &quot;Company&quot;, LuPone resigned from Actors&#x27; Equity Association, the union for professional stage managers and actors in the United States. It was announced that LuPone would return to Broadway in the Jen Silverman play &quot;The Roommate&quot; starring opposite Mia Farrow at the Booth Theatre in August 2024.

== Solo concerts and tours ==
LuPone performs regularly in her solo shows &quot;Matters of the Heart&quot;; &quot;Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda&quot;; and &quot;The Lady With the Torch&quot; which sold out at Carnegie Hall. For example, she performed her one-woman show &quot;The Gypsy In My Soul&quot; at the Caramoor Fall Festival, New York, in September 2010. She also appears at venues across North America in concerts with Mandy Patinkin, at such venues as the Mayo Center for the Performing Arts in September 2010.

She appeared as the inaugural act at a new cabaret space, 54 Below, in New York City in June 2012. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer, She also appeared as the inaugural act at the Sharon L. Morse Entertainment Center in The Villages, Florida, on April 30, 2015, to a sold-out audience of residents mainly 55 years-of-age and older.

== Artistry and reputation ==
LuPone is widely regarded as one of the greatest Broadway performers of her generation, and one of the most influential actors in musical theater. &quot;The London Times&quot; once nicknamed her the &quot;first lady of the theater&quot;, and American-British journalist Hadley Freeman declared her &quot;the queen of Broadway&quot; and &quot;the goddess of the modern musical&quot;. In 2010, theatre critic Charles McNulty wrote that her stage presence demonstrates a ferocity that, when paired with the right material, resembles &quot;a return to a golden age when powerhouses ruled Broadway&quot;. AllMusic biographer William Ruhlmann noted that, unlike her predecessors Mary Martin and Ethel Merman, LuPone was never afforded the luxury to seamlessly transition between musical productions, instead using lulls in her Broadway career to diversify her endeavors by appearing in plays, films, television, nightclubs, concert tours, and recording solo studio albums. According to Susan Vaughn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, LuPone is mostly known for playing &quot;larger-than-life characters&quot; on stage, whereas Adam Sandel of &quot;The Advocate&quot; observed &quot;she&#x27;s often played women who&#x27;ve fought like hell to overcome obstacles through the sheer force of indomitable will&quot;. She has also played many Jewish women, both on stage and screen, despite not identifying as Jewish herself. LuPone believes she is often cast in ethnic parts because of her Italian heritage and prominent facial features, which allow her to play more interesting female roles. At the same time, she has expressed frustration at frequently being overlooked for roles she believes she is best suited for, often in favor of less qualified actors, and insists she has been bullied by Broadway professionals for much of her career.

Music and theatre critics have described LuPone as a mezzo-soprano, which &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; said can equally &quot;blast a big showtune out of the park, or sweetly murmur a lullaby&quot;. Vocally, she is known for her powerful, emotive style of belting, and according to Nerelle Harper of QNews set a new standard &quot;for a modern generation of high-belt thrill trillers&quot;. To cope with some vocally demanding roles such as &quot;Evita&quot;, during which she lost her voice several times, she remained silent when not performing and limited social activities. After undergoing surgery to treat vocal nodules during the 1990s, she learned how to sing in a more operatic manner to preserve her voice, prior to which she admitted to relying on &quot;sheer guts and willpower&quot; to belt. She credits vocal coach Joan Lader with saving her career and teaching her &quot;a technique to allow me to continue to sing with the strength and the clarity&quot;. LuPone has performed some operatic roles, despite having no formal operatic training. She has performed in several Sondheim musicals, and credits the composer with making her a better singer due to the difficulty of his material. In return, Sondheim has praised her singing, acting, and attention to detail, and thanked her for &quot;enhancing my shows — and everyone else&#x27;s for that matter&quot;. According to Andrew Gans of &quot;Playbill&quot;, LuPone belongs to a handful of singing actors who &quot;are masters of stillness, bringing songs to full life with an inner well of emotions that seep out in unexpected and heartbreaking moments&quot;. However, her trademark diction has been criticized for sounding unclear, including by collaborators Andrew Lloyd Webber and John Houseman, the latter of whom reportedly strangled her over her enunciation. LuPone admitted that her emotional acting choices can compromise her diction. In addition to Sondheim, LuPone has identified performers Edith Piaf, Bette Davis, and David Mamet as influences, and expressed admiration for stage actresses Angela Lansbury, Zoe Caldwell, and Elaine Stritch, all of whose signature roles she would eventually play herself.

The media has described LuPone as a polarizing entertainer, equally praised and criticized for her talent and unfiltered opinions. McNulty observed that critics have alternated between pigeonholing her into specific genres or underappreciating her vibrancy. She has been labeled a diva for much of her career, which journalists attribute to both her talent and high standards, and perceived demanding temperament on and off-stage. Ruhlmann said her reported &quot;cold, dark&quot; persona allowed her to excel playing &quot;the kinds of anti-heroines who peopled the musicals of the later decades of the 20th century&quot;. LuPone has been described by some as difficult to work with, a reputation she attributes to sexism and the way assertive women are often perceived in the industry. Theatre critic Ben Brantley reported that the fallout from &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; damaged LuPone&#x27;s public image and relegated her Broadway appearances to one-woman and non-musical shows, until she returned to musical theater in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, her &quot;Evita&quot; co-star Mandy Patinkin defended her as a sensitive performer who &quot;can&#x27;t let certain feelings go, which is a burden and a blessing. She fights through it all and gives everything, until there&#x27;s nothing left in her&quot;. Her fanbase has been nicknamed &quot;LuPonistas&quot;, and she has often been hired to play exaggerated versions of herself in television and film, representing &quot;the symbol of Broadway musical theater&quot;, according to &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Adam Feldman.

LuPone is known for her candid and outspoken nature, a trait she attributes to her upbringing. She has stated that her forthrightness has occasionally led to professional setbacks, beginning with her time promoting &quot;Evita&quot;. Her unfiltered remarks and actions have often made headlines, including instances of going off-script during performances. A vocal critic of the commercialization of Broadway, LuPone has likened its current state to Las Vegas, arguing that shows should have limited runs to allow space for fresh, innovative productions. She has also expressed a disdain for red carpet events, noting that her tendency to &quot;speak [her] truth&quot; can be at odds with the expected decorum of such occasions. Additionally, LuPone has been outspoken about theater etiquette, frequently voicing concerns over disruptive behavior by some audience members. She is widely regarded as a gay icon, which LuPone attributes to fans recognizing that she has &quot;had to fight, like the LGBTQ community has had to fight for identity. For a simple way to live. For acceptance&quot;.

==Personal life==
LuPone is married to Matthew Johnston. The couple&#x27;s wedding ceremony was on the stage of the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center on December 12, 1988, after filming the TV movie &quot;LBJ&quot;; Johnston was a cameraman. They have one child. They reside in Edisto Beach, South Carolina, and Kent, Connecticut. In the 1970s, LuPone dated actor Kevin Kline for seven years, after the two met as students at Juilliard.

<doc id="291796" wikidata="Q1413869" url="?curid=291796" title="Medical fetishism">
<text>Medical fetishism refers to several sexual fetishes in which participants derive sexual pleasure from medical scenarios including objects, practices, environments, and situations of a medical or clinical nature. In sexual roleplay, a hospital or medical scene involves the sex partners assuming the roles of doctors, nurses, surgeons and patients to act out specific or general medical fetishes. Medical fantasy is a genre in pornography, though the fantasy may not necessarily involve pornography or sexual activity.

Medical fetishism may involve sexual attraction to respiratory therapy involving oxygen supplied via nasal cannula or any sort of mask, medical practitioners, medical uniforms, hospital gowns, anesthesia, intimate examinations (such as rectal examination, gynecological examination, urological examination, andrological examination, rectal temperature-taking), catheterization, diapering, enemas, injections, insertion (such as suppository insertion, menstrual-cup insertion, and prostatic massage), auscultation, medical devices (such as orthopedic casts and orthopedic braces; see also &quot;abasiophilia&quot;), dental objects (such as dental braces, retainers, and headgear), medical restraints, and medical gags.

Anything that involves health, wellness, and the need for a doctor or nurse could potentially play into medical fetishism. Such a diversity makes medical fetishism a common form of BDSM, sexual roleplay, or extreme play for all levels.

== Physical examination ==
Some people eroticize intimate examinations as part of a medical fetish, and as such are a common service offered by professional dominants.

An intimate examination can form part of a scene in medical play where the nurse or doctor (or even or a nun) inflicts one or more embarrassing and humiliating quasi-medical procedures on the patient. Often, frozen or heated objects are introduced to the patient&#x27;s body to simulate the uncomfortable sensations that can occur during a real examination. Examinations may include an examination and intrusion of the anus, urethra, or vagina, as well as handling and manipulation of the penis, testicles, clitoris, and nipples. Quite often, strap-on play is also incorporated, as this can heighten the intimacy and the sensations of the &quot;patient&quot; (recipient). This may be a prelude to masturbation or administration of an enema. Before examination, the patient can be placed in physical restraints and gagged, and wear some form of embarrassing clothing.

== Temperature-taking fetishism ==

Temperature-taking fetish is a sexual fetish for oral and rectal thermometers. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments, or scenarios/situations. The fetish is characterized by sexual arousal from the desire to take another person&#x27;s temperature or have one&#x27;s temperature taken. Although there is also an interest in oral temperature taking, rectal temperature-taking is more prominent and often precedes enema play.

== Enema fetishism ==
Enema fetishism is a sexual fetish for enemas and is a type of klismaphilia, the general enjoyment of enemas, and hence those enjoying enemas are referred to as klismaphiliacs. This fetish includes not only giving and receiving enemas but also sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments, situations, or scenarios. Some may be sexually aroused by the preparations, such as by the feel and smell of a latex rubber or plastic syringe, by the smell of soapsuds enema solution, or by preparing the recipient. Roleplaying often accompanies these activities.

Enemas can cause sexual arousal in both women and men because the bulbospongiosus muscle which starts in front of the anus contributes, in women, to clitoral erection and the contractions of orgasm, and closing the vagina. In men, this muscle correlates to erections, the contractions of orgasm, and ejaculation. Sexual sensation results from distention of the rectum by filling and dilating it with the volume of an enema which in women, puts pressure on the back of the vagina, and in men stimulates the prostate and seminal vesicles. Also, contractions of muscles throughout the abdomen caused by expulsion of an enema can stimulate, in women, the uterus and vagina, and in men, the prostate, seminal vesicle, and internal penis.

Because enemas involve at least partial nudity and the exposure and probing of the anus, many people find them embarrassing. An erotic enema holds the possibility of acting out vulnerability in a primal form. Among the attractions to enema play are psychodrama, power exchange, erotic humiliation, discipline, and so on. BDSM punishment scenes can use extra-large volumes or highly irritating substances to produce pain and cramps. Klismaphiliacs often discover their fetish for enemas after having one administered.

== Medical restraints ==
Medical fetishism can also include the use of medical restraints, including straitjackets, historically associated with the treatment of mentally ill people.

== Anesthesia fetishism ==

Anesthesia fetishism is a sexual fetish for anesthesia. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, substances, effects, environments or situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to administer anesthesia, or the sexual desire for oneself to be anesthetized are two forms in which an individual may exist as an arbiter of the fetish. Older-style anesthesia masks of black rubber, still in occasional use today, are one of the more common elements fetishized, and have earned the nickname &quot;Black Beauty&quot; by many fetishists.

=== Acts, behaviour and rituals ===
Anesthesia fetish is considered edgeplay, as when realized outside the boundaries of fantasy may result in various degrees of harm, or death. Fantasies are elaborated by the viewing of images and reading of stories of anesthetic inductions. Edgeplay may involve obtaining and scening with various anesthesia-related paraphernalia—usually anesthesia masks for breathplay, the acquisition of anesthetics for anesthetizing others or being anesthetized oneself, and the occupation of a medical setting or environment for the same practice.

Some anesthesia fetishists who seek to be anesthetized may feign or induce medical conditions in an attempt to obtain general anesthesia from medical personnel. This is considered safer than playing with anesthetic agents outside of a medical setting.

=== Internet influence ===
The Internet has enabled people with this relatively rare paraphilia to discuss the subject and exchange anesthesia-related multimedia. Anesthesia fetishism has been a relatively obscure fetish for a long time. However, with the advent of the internet, individuals with this fetish have been able to connect with each other and share their experiences and interests. Online forums and discussion boards dedicated to the subject have popped up, allowing individuals to engage in conversations and exchange multimedia related to anesthesia fetishism.

<doc id="291804" wikidata="Q490236" url="?curid=291804" title="Self-contained breathing apparatus">
<text>A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is a respirator worn to provide an autonomous supply of breathable gas in an atmosphere that is immediately dangerous to life or health from a gas cylinder. They are typically used in firefighting and industry. The term &quot;self-contained&quot; means that the SCBA is not dependent on a remote supply of breathing gas (e.g., through a long hose). They are sometimes called industrial breathing sets. Some types are also referred to as a compressed air breathing apparatus (CABA) or simply breathing apparatus (BA). Unofficial names include &quot;air pack&quot;, &quot;air tank&quot;, &quot;oxygen cylinder&quot; or simply &quot;pack&quot;, terms used mostly in firefighting. If designed for use under water, it is also known as a scuba set (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus).

An open circuit SCBA typically has three main components: a high-pressure gas storage cylinder, (e.g., , about 150 to 374 atmospheres), a pressure regulator, and a respiratory interface, which may be a mouthpiece, half mask or full-face mask, assembled and mounted on a framed carrying harness.

A self-contained breathing apparatus may fall into one of three categories: open-circuit, closed-circuit, or continuous-flow.

== History ==
As the fire service began to develop throughout the early 1800s, it became increasingly apparent that firefighters needed protection from the hazardous smoke and toxic gasses that were present when fighting fires. The earliest attempts at this included firefighters growing out long beards, dipping them in water, and then biting down on the beard while breathing through their mouth. The theory behind this was that the wet beard would act as some sort of filter for the smoke. Other early attempts included the French designed &quot;Apparatus Aldini&quot; which was an asbestos and woven wire mask which attempted to provide the user with a small amount of trapped clean air to breath and an English designed closed helmet that pumped clean air across a pane of glass to reduce breathing condensation.

The first real attempt at an SCBA came from a man named James Braidwood. a mask that was connected to a long hose which was then connected to a fire engine. The firefighter would then go inside the building connected to fresh air via the air line. A whistle was also attached to the mask for communications. 

Paul Hashagan also notes that, in 1863, A. Lacour developed and patented the &quot;improved breathing apparatus&quot;. This system provided air to the wearer from two canvas and rubber balloon-like bags which were carried on the wearer&#x27;s back. A pair of bellows would then allow the wearer to pump air to a mouthpiece. The firefighter would also wear goggles and a nose plug to provide further protection from the smoke and heat.

 including a closed-circuit rebreather designed by Bernhard Draeger. The closed circuit system developed by him would not only be used by many fire departments, but also was one of the first working SCUBA systems. Other devices included the Gibbs which was approved for use in 1920 and was developed by MSA and the Proto, which was developed by a German named Siebe Gorman.

Close to the mid 1900s and post WWII, Scott Aviation began developing an SCBA designed specifically for firefighting use. The first SCBA designed by Scott was called the AirPac and introduced in 1945. This was the first version of the modern SCBA as we know it today. As the space race continued throughout the 1900s, SCBA technology would continue to improve allowing the SCBAs to become less cumbersome and for firefighters to carry less weight and more air.

== Types ==
=== Closed-circuit ===

The closed-circuit type, also known as a rebreather, operates by filtering, supplementing, and recirculating exhaled gas. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a big open-circuit air cylinder. Before open-circuit SCBA&#x27;s were developed, most industrial breathing sets were rebreathers, such as the Siebe Gorman Proto, Siebe Gorman Savox, or Siebe Gorman Salvus. An example of modern rebreather SCBAs would be the SEFA.

==== As of 1987, under 30 CFR 11 ====
Duration of closed-circuit SCBAs is somewhere between 1-4 hours. A closed-circuit SCBA system is negative-pressure, increasing the risk of leaks.

There are two types of closed-circuit SCBA according to NIOSH:
* Uses compressed oxygen.
* Uses an oxygen-generating solid. This involves a chemical reaction between potassium superoxide with exhaled water and carbon dioxide. A chlorate candle has to be struck to start the device.
To reduce pressure buildup from use, a pressure-relief valve with saliva trap is included. Closed-circuit SCBAs are also noticeably smaller than open-circuit ones.

Self-contained self-rescue devices are also closed-circuit SCBAs, working on the same principles, being designed for emergency use in mines, and lasting about one hour.

==== 2015 ANSI definition ====
ANSI Z88.2–2015 provides some background information on SCBAs in &quot;Annex A&quot;, which is current and approved as of March 2015. Closed circuit SCBAs scrub carbon dioxide with a chemical; Z88.2 notes sodium hydroxide as an example of one such chemical.

A &quot;demand SCBA&quot;, according to the standard, is where &quot;the facepiece is &quot;negative&quot; during inhalation&quot;. Whereas if the facepiece is positive during inhalation, it is a &quot;pressure-demand SCBA&quot;. Regardless of the type of closed-circuit SCBA, the duration of closed-circuit SCBAs is, according to Z88.2, between &quot;15 minutes to 4 hours&quot;. 

=== Open-circuit ===

==== As of 1987, under 30 CFR 11 ====
An open-circuit SCBA does not recirculate air; it instead allows respired air to be exhausted outside. While 30 CFR 11 does not restrict the gas that can be used (although compressed air is usually chosen), use of compressed oxygen is not allowed due to the system&#x27;s exposure to outside air. Duration is usually limited to 30-60 minutes.

There are two types of open-circuit SCBA according to NIOSH:
* Demand: 2000 psi to the regulator from the main valve, plus a bypass valve in case of failure, with a two-stage regulator reducing pressure to 50-100 psi.
* Pressure-Demand: Similar to demand, but with a spring in the diaphragm, which holds the admission valve open, for continuous air flow to the facepiece.

NIOSH emphasizes that facepieces between both SCBA types cannot be interchanged, but certain SCBAs can be switched to both &#x27;demand&#x27; and &#x27;pressure-demand&#x27; operation. However, both modes require different training.

==== 2015 ANSI definition ====
Z88.2–2015 notes that &quot;open-circuit SCBA are equipped with a full facepiece or tight-fitting hood&quot;, and, like closed-circuit SCBAs, can be configured in pressure-demand or demand mode. Air is not recirculated in an open-circuit SCBA. 

Z88.2 notes that these SCBAs normally use compressed air, but can also use cryogenic air or compressed oxygen. However, the standard warns that &quot;the actual service time is usually less than the NIOSH rated service time&quot;. If compressed air is used, Z88.2 requires the use of &quot;CGA G7.1–2011 Grade D breathing air&quot;.

==== Common traits ====


=== Continuous-flow ===
Escape SCBAs, also known as ESCBAs, come with hoods, are meant for escapes only, and are operated in continuous flow mode.

Escape only SCBAs, designed for escape from IDLH situations, regardless of type, are usually limited to 3-10 minutes.
== Differences under 42 CFR 84 ==
42 CFR 84 replaces the 30 CFR 11 respirator regulation used by NIOSH. As of 2001, quality assurance of SCBA harnesses is required. Labels have been updated to remove MSHA emblems from respirator labels, as MSHA is no longer involved in respirator approval except for respirators approved for mining. As a result, new SCBAs now have to specify whether the SCBA is &quot;intended for mine use&quot;.

==Facepiece==
SCBAs usually come with full-facepieces, but can also come with half-mask or mouthpiece in demand or pressure-demand mode, though use of mouthpieces are limited to escapes only, as of 1987.

Hoods and helmets are limited to continuous flow mode only, and are also used in air-line respirators in addition to escape-only SCBAs.

==Usage==
There are two major application areas for SCBA: firefighting, and industrial use in confined spaces.

For SCBAs used in firefighting, manufacturers typically prioritize fire resistance and weight reduction over cost. SCBAs used by the fire service also incorporate other features such as a PASS (personal alert safety system), which is a device that emits a loud alarm should the firefighter manually activate it or remain motionless for a certain amount of time. Other features may include Bluetooth connection to voice amplifiers or portable radios, digital heads-up displays, built-in infrared cameras, ePAR (electronic personal accountability report) system, point of view video recording, and digital screens allowing the firefighter to more easily check their air supply. Every SCBA used in the fire service also comes with a vibralert system which alerts the firefighter as they get low on air and a UAC (universal air connection), which allows the firefighter to give or receive air to other SCBAs through a trans-fill line by equalizing the pressure in both SCBA cylinders. Some SCBAs also come with a buddy-breather setup which allows both firefighters to connect their SCBAs and breathe while connected to each other.

SCBAs are also used in a variety of industrial settings including mining, petrochemical, chemical, and nuclear industries. In some of the most hazardous conditions, SCBAs can be worn in conjunction with gas tight suits, which also aids in decontamination procedures. In the industrial setting, especially in confined spaces, a user will often be supplied air through a pressurized airline and will only carry compressed air cylinders for emergency escape and decontamination.

==Other regulations and standards==
In the United States and Canada, SCBAs used in firefighting must meet guidelines established by the National Fire Protection Association, NFPA Standard 1981. If an SCBA is labeled as &quot;1981 NFPA compliant&quot;, it is designed for firefighting. The current version of the standard was published in 2018. These standards are revised every five years. Similarly, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a certification program for SCBA that are intended to be used in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) environments.

Any SCBA supplied for use in Europe must comply with the requirements of the Personal Protective Equipment Directive (89/686/EEC). In practice this usually means that the SCBA must comply with the requirements of the European Standard EN 137:2006. This includes detailed requirements for the performance of the SCBA, the marking required, and the information to be provided to the user. Two classes of SCBA are recognised, Type 1 for industrial use and Type 2 for firefighting. Any SCBA conforming to this standard will have been verified to reliably operate and protect the user from -30 °C to +60 °C under a wide range of severe simulated operational conditions.

==Human factors==
SCBA is intended to be personal protective equipment, but its use is not without cost. The weight of the unit and work of breathing affect the work capacity and agility of the wearer, and the full-face mask, while protecting the face and eyes from heat, smoke, and toxic gases, also reduces peripheral vision and awareness of the surroundings. The weight and harness straps may limit tidal volume, ventilation rate, and oxygen consumption, and heart rate may increase in comparison with the same exercise levels without the equipment. Shoulder harness straps of heavy SCBA can reduce free motion of the thorax which affects breathing.

<doc id="291807" wikidata="Q92946" url="?curid=291807" title="Bertrand Meyer">
<text>Bertrand Meyer (; ; born 21 November 1950) is a French academic, author, and consultant in the field of computer languages. He created the Eiffel programming language and the concept of design by contract.

==Education and academic career==
Meyer received a master&#x27;s degree in engineering from the École Polytechnique in Paris, a second master&#x27;s degree from Stanford University, and a PhD from the Université de Nancy. He had a technical and managerial career for nine years at Électricité de France, and for three years was a member of the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

From 2001 to 2016, he was professor of software engineering at ETH Zürich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, where he pursued research on building trusted components (reusable software elements) with a guaranteed level of quality. He was Chair of the ETH Computer Science department from 2004 to 2006 and for 13 years (2003–2015) taught the Introduction to Programming course taken by all ETH computer science students, resulting in a widely disseminated programming textbook, &quot;Touch of Class&quot; (Springer).

He remains Professor emeritus of Software Engineering at ETH Zurich and is currently Professor of Software Engineering and Provost at Constructor Institute of Technology (previously Schaffhausen Institute of Technology (SIT)), a new research university in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.

He has held visiting positions at the University of Toulouse (Chair of Excellence, 2015–16), Politecnico di Milano, Innopolis University, Monash University and University of Technology Sydney. He is also active as a consultant (object-oriented system design, architectural reviews, technology assessment), trainer in object technology and other software topics, and conference speaker. For many years Meyer has been active in issues of research and education policy and was the founding president (2006–2011) of Informatics Europe, the association of European computer science departments.

==Contributions and books on programming languages, programming methodology==
Meyer pursues the ideal of simple, elegant and user-friendly computer languages and is one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of object-oriented programming (OOP). His book &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot;, translated into 15 languages, is one of the earliest and most comprehensive works presenting the case for OOP.

Other books he has written include &quot;Eiffel: The Language&quot; (a description of the Eiffel language), &quot;Object Success&quot; (a discussion of object technology for managers), &quot;Reusable Software&quot; (a discussion of reuse issues and solutions), &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Programming Languages&quot;, &quot;Touch of Class&quot; (an introduction to programming and software engineering) and &quot;Agile! The Good, the Hype and the Ugly&quot; (a tutorial and critical analysis of agile methods). He has authored numerous articles and edited over 60 conference proceedings, many of them in the Springer LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) series.

He has long being interested in techniques of specification and requirements and in 2022 published a treatise and textbook, &quot;Handbook of Requirements and Business Analysis&quot; (Springer).

In 2024 he published, as editor, the volume &quot;The French School of Programming&quot; (Springer), containing chapters by 13 famous French or France-based computer scientists including Patrick Cousot, Thierry Coquand, Gérard Berry and Meyer himself, describing their contributions (abstract interpretation, Coq, Esterel, Eiffel etc.) in which Meyer sees, beyond the wide variety of approaches, a common taste for elegance and simplicity. 

He is the initial designer of the Eiffel method and language and has continued to participate in its evolution, and is the originator of the Design by Contract development method.

His experiences with object technology through the Simula language, as well as early work on abstract data types and formal specification (including the Z notation), provided some of the background for the development of Eiffel.

==Contributions==

Meyer is known among other contributions for the following:
* The concept of Design by Contract, highly influential as a design and programming methodology concept and a language mechanism present in such languages as the Java Modeling Language, Spec#, the UML&#x27;s Object Constraint Language and Microsoft&#x27;s Code Contracts.
* The design of the Eiffel language, applicable to programming as well as design and requirements.
* The early publication (in the first, 1988 edition of his &quot;Object-Oriented Software Construction&quot; book) of such widely used design patterns as the command pattern (the basis for undo-redo mechanisms, i.e. CTRL-Z/CTRL-Y, in interactive systems) and the bridge pattern.
* The original design (in collaboration with Jean-Raymond Abrial and Steven Schuman) of the Z specification language.
* His establishment of the connection between object-oriented programming and the concept of software reusability (in his 1987 paper &quot;Reusability: the Case for Object-Oriented Design&quot;).
* His critical analysis of the pros and cons of agile development and his development of software lifecycle and management models.

==Awards==
Meyer is a member of Academia Europaea and the French Academy of Technologies and a Fellow of the ACM. He has received honorary doctorates from ITMO University in Saint Petersburg, Russia (2004) (returned in 2022) and the University of York, England (2015).

He was the first &quot;senior award&quot; winner of the AITO Dahl-Nygaard award in 2005. This prize, named after the two founders of object-oriented programming, is awarded annually to a senior and a junior researcher who has made significant technical contributions to the field of OOP.

He is the 2009 recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Harlan Mills award &quot;for practical &amp; fundamental contributions to object-oriented software engineering&quot;.

He is an IFIP fellow, as part of the first group to receive this distinction in 2019, and received in 2017 the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Educator Award. He was the recipient of an ERC (European Research Council) Advanced Investigator Grant (2012-2017).

In 2006, Meyer received the ACM Software System Award of the for &quot;impact on software quality&quot; in recognition of the design of Eiffel.

==Wikipedia hoax==
On 28 December 2005, an anonymous user falsely announced Meyer&#x27;s death on the German Wikipedia&#x27;s biography of Meyer. The hoax was reported five days later by the Heise News Ticker and the article was immediately corrected. Many major news media outlets in Germany and Switzerland picked up the story. Meyer went on to publish a positive evaluation of Wikipedia, concluding &quot;The system succumbed to one of its potential flaws, and quickly healed itself. This doesn&#x27;t affect the big picture. Just like those about me, rumors about Wikipedia&#x27;s downfall have been grossly exaggerated.&quot;

<text>James Andrew Innes &quot;Jack&quot; Dee (born 24 September 1961) is an English stand-up comedian, actor, presenter, and writer known for his sarcasm, irony, and deadpan humour. He wrote and starred in the sitcom &quot;Lead Balloon&quot; and hosts the panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

His UK television appearances include being a team captain on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; and hosting &quot;Jack Dee: Live at the Apollo&quot;, which was nominated for a BAFTA in 2006. He also presented &quot;The Jack Dee Show&quot;, &quot;Jack Dee&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Jack Dee&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot;. He won &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 1&quot; in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Jack Dee is the youngest of three children born to Rosemary ( Stamper) and Geoffrey Dee, after Joanna Innes Dee and David Simon Innes Dee. He was born in the Municipal Borough of Bromley, Kent (now within the London Borough of Bromley) and grew up in Petts Wood before moving with his family to Winchester when he was young. His father was a printer and his mother was the daughter of two repertory actors, Henry Lionel Pope Stamper (1906–1985) and Edna May Howard Innes (1904–1969).

Dee was educated at both private and state schools. His first school, The Pilgrims&#x27; School, a preparatory school in Winchester, was followed by the state Montgomery of Alamein School for his secondary education, and for a period he attended Frensham Heights School. He took his A-levels at Peter Symonds&#x27; College, and left with a D and an F grade. Following this, he planned to attend drama college, but his plans were scuppered when his mother persuaded him to get a vocation; as such, he entered the catering industry and became a waiter.

==Career==

Dee&#x27;s first public act was an open-mic gig in 1986 at The Comedy Store, which he went to one evening after work.

Since the 1990s, he has performed sell-out acts at many high-profile venues (including the London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo). After he won the British Comedy Award for Best Stage Newcomer in 1991, Dee was offered his own show; &quot;The Jack Dee Show&quot; first went out on Channel 4 in February 1992. His combination of stand-up routines on television continued with &quot;Jack Dee&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; on ITV, &quot;Jack Dee&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot; in 1997 and later &quot;Jack Dee Live at the Apollo&quot; in 2004 on BBC One.

In 1996, he starred alongside Jeremy Hardy in &quot;Jack and Jeremy&#x27;s Real Lives&quot;, a collection of mockumentaries similar to their previous collaboration, &quot;Jack and Jeremy&#x27;s Police 4&quot;. Each episode focuses on the pair playing bizarre characters from a particular profession. Shot on film and featuring no laugh track, the show failed to catch on. After three episodes, it was moved to air after midnight. Aside from his stand-up career, Dee has made appearances acting in television series. He played the part of Doug Digby in the &quot;Grimleys&quot; pilot (1997) before the role was recast for the series, and made guest appearances on such programmes as &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;.

In 2001, he won &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; (then linked to fundraising for Comic Relief). He has subsequently said that he dislikes the treatment of the housemates by the show and its producers, and has refused all permission for any of the clips to be shown again.

In 2004, he played the role of Steven Sharples MP, the self-styled &#x27;Deputy Home Secretary&#x27;, alongside Warren Clarke and Dervla Kirwan in &quot;The Deputy&quot;. Dee&#x27;s performance was praised, though the film itself received a lukewarm response. Later that year he starred in another one-off drama, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. He was the celebrity advocate in &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot; for &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and presented an hour-long documentary about the series.

In 2005, he co-hosted &quot;Comic Aid&quot;, a one-off gathering of comedians that aimed to raise money for the Asian Tsunami Appeal. In May of the same year he appeared on the &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; segment of the BBC Two series &quot;Top Gear&quot;, achieving a lap time of 1:53.5 (52nd on the Suzuki Liana leader board). His series &quot;Lead Balloon&quot;, which he also co-wrote, began on BBC Four on 4 October 2006. Described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s answer to &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;&quot;, &quot;Lead Balloon&quot; sees Dee play the semi-biographical role of Rick Spleen. A second series of eight episodes was commissioned and was broadcast on BBC Two in 2007, with a third series debuting on Thursday 13 November 2008. A fourth series finished on the BBC on 5 July 2011. He also starred as Harry in the 2005 film &quot;Short Order&quot;.

In February 2009, it was announced that Dee would be one of a trio of hosts to replace the late Humphrey Lyttelton for the summer series of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (the others being Stephen Fry and Rob Brydon). He subsequently became the permanent host from the 52nd series onwards. He is also a frequent guest on &quot;QI&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, which he has guest-presented ten times, and he hosts segments of the BBC&#x27;s biennial Comic Relief telethon. He starred in advertisements for John Smith&#x27;s Bitter in the 1990s, becoming known as &quot;the midget with the widget&quot;. He made his stage debut in 1998, playing Yvan in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s Olivier award-winning &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot;. He later returned as Serge for a 13-week run at the request of the director.

In 2008, Dee took part in the 15th anniversary special of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; where he replaced Will Self as captain of Team A. The show aired on 30 December 2008 on BBC2. Dee returned as team captain in series 6 of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; on 26 August 2009, and again for the 7th series. Over Christmas 2009, Dee played the role of John Tweedledum in &quot;The News at Bedtime&quot;.

In 2010, Dee took part in &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot;, a benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital, filmed live at the O2 Arena in London on 30 March. In 2013, Dee joined Dara Ó Briain, Chelsee Healey, Greg James, Melanie C and Philips Idowu in &quot;Through Hell and High Water&quot;, a Comic Relief challenge which involved celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the Zambezi River. They raised more than £1 million for the charity.

In 2017, Dee co-wrote and starred in &quot;Bad Move&quot;, a sitcom about a middle-aged man and his wife (played by Kerry Godliman) who move from the city to a country cottage in search of the rural dream, which becomes more of a nightmare. A second series was broadcast in 2018.

In May 2024, Dee was announced as a contestant in the eighteenth series of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, competing alongside Andy Zaltzman, Babatunde Aléshé, Emma Sidi, and Rosie Jones. He finished in second place to Zaltzman.

==Personal life==
Dee met Susan Jane Hetherington in 1986, when he was working as a waiter in Fulham and she was a receptionist at a nearby hotel. They married in Winchester, Hampshire, in 1989. The couple divide their time between a family home in Wandsworth, London and a holiday house near Chichester, West Sussex. Together, they have four children.

Dee suffers from depression. He has claimed that his work is the best therapy for his condition, saying &quot;if you have the impulse to be creative, you ignore it at your peril&quot;.

In his twenties, Dee worked at the Ritz in Central London and started drinking heavily. He attended church and attempted to become a priest. After he realised that was not for him he gave it up, and never quit drinking, although he would later describe his condition as &quot;alcohol abuse&quot; rather than alcoholism, which was the diagnosis at the time. Since the 1990s, he has advertised John Smith&#x27;s Bitter, becoming known as &quot;the midget with the widget&quot;.
Following his appearance on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, he had a relapse, though did not attend AA meetings because he did not want paparazzi photographing him leaving the meetings.

In 2007, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported that he was in negotiations with publishers to release his autobiography. He signed with Doubleday in 2008 and the book, &quot;Thanks for Nothing: The Jack Dee Memoirs&quot;, was released in October 2009, along with an audiobook of the same title which he narrates. According to Dee, &quot;it&#x27;s really the story of how I got into comedy... It&#x27;s kind of an autobiography but isn&#x27;t, as it stops about 25 years ago. It goes right up to the first time I do stand up.&quot;

In February 2009, Dee and several other entertainers wrote an open letter to &quot;The Times&quot; supporting Baháʼí leaders, then on trial in Iran.

Dee is a director of &quot;Open Mike Productions&quot;, co-founded with Addison Cresswell, which produces shows for television and radio including &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s Comedy Roadshow&quot; and &quot;Alan Carr: Chatty Man&quot;.

<text>Cave-diving is underwater diving in water-filled caves. It may be done as an extreme sport, a way of exploring flooded caves for scientific investigation, or for the search for and recovery of divers or, as in the 2018 Thai cave rescue, other cave users. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, and ranges from breath hold to surface supplied, but almost all cave-diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies such as sidemount or backmounted twinset. Recreational cave-diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave-diving and cavern-diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified.

Equipment, procedures, and the requisite skills have been developed to reduce the risk of becoming lost in a flooded cave, and consequently drowning when the breathing gas supply runs out. The equipment aspect largely involves the provision of an adequate breathing gas supply to cover reasonably foreseeable contingencies, redundant dive lights and other safety critical equipment, and the use of a continuous guideline leading the divers back out of the overhead environment. The skills and procedures include effective management of the equipment, and procedures to recover from foreseeable contingencies and emergencies, both by individual divers, and by the teams that dive together.

In the United Kingdom, cave-diving developed from the locally more common activity of caving. Its origins in the United States are more closely associated with recreational scuba diving. Compared to caving and scuba diving, there are relatively few practitioners of cave-diving. This is due in part to the specialized equipment and skill sets required, and in part because of the high potential risks due to the specific environment.

Despite these risks, water-filled caves attract scuba divers, cavers, and speleologists due to their often unexplored nature, and present divers with a technical diving challenge. Underwater caves have a wide range of physical features, and can contain fauna not found elsewhere. Several organisations dedicated to cave diving safety and exploration exist, and several agencies provide specialised training in the skills and procedures considered necessary for acceptable safety.

==Environments==
Two types of overhead diving environment are defined in recreational cave diving: Both a cave or a cavern are natural voids under the Earth&#x27;s surface.

The formation and development of caves, known as &quot;speleogenesis&quot;, can occur over the course of millions of years. Caves can vary considerably in size, and are formed by various geological processes. These may involve a combination of chemical processes, erosion by water, tectonic forces, microorganisms, pressure, and atmospheric influences.

Most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution. Caves can be classified in various ways, including a contrast between active and relict, where active caves have water flowing through them and relict caves do not, though water may be retained in them. Types of active caves include inflow caves (&quot;into which a stream sinks&quot;), outflow caves (&quot;from which a stream emerges&quot;), and through caves (&quot;traversed by a stream&quot;). In speleology, a cavern is an enlarged space within a cave, but in cave diving a different use of the terms is common, where cavern implies visual proximity to an exit.

=== Cave ===
The underwater cave environment includes those parts of caves which may be explored underwater. Recreational cave diving can be defined as diving underground beyond the reach of natural daylight, as a way of distinguishing between cave and cavern diving. In this context, while artificially formed underground spaces such as mines are not generally called caves by divers, the activity of diving in them is classed as cave diving for training and certification purposes by diver training agencies.

=== Cavern ===
Cavern diving is an arbitrarily defined, limited scope activity of diving in the naturally illuminated part of underwater caves, where the risk of getting lost is small, as the exit can be seen, and the equipment needed is reduced due to the limited distance to surface air. It is defined as a recreational diving activity as opposed to a technical diving activity on the grounds of low risk and basic equipment requirements.

== Procedures ==

The procedures of cave-diving have much in common with procedures used for other types of penetration diving. They differ from open-water diving procedures mainly in the emphasis on navigation, gas management, operating in confined spaces, and that the diver is physically constrained from direct ascent to the surface during much of the dive.

As most cave-diving is done in an environment where there is no free surface with breathable air allowing an above-water exit, it is critically important to be able to find the way out before the breathing gas runs out. This is ensured by the use of a continuous guideline between the dive team and a point outside of the flooded part of the cave, and diligent planning and monitoring of gas supplies. Two basic types of guideline are used: permanent lines, and temporary lines. Permanent lines may include a main line starting near the entrance/exit, and side lines or branch lines, and are marked to indicate the direction along the line to the nearest exit. Temporary lines include exploration lines and jump lines.

Decompression procedures may take into account that the cave diver usually follows a very rigidly constrained and precisely defined route, both into and out of the cave, and can reasonably expect to find any equipment such as drop cylinders temporarily stored along the guideline while making the exit. In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.

== Skills ==
Most open-water diving skills apply to cave-diving, and there are additional skills specific to the environment, and to the chosen equipment configuration.
*Good buoyancy control, trim and finning technique help preserve visibility in areas with silt deposits. The ability to reverse kick to back out of restrictions where there is no space to turn around is useful.
**Finning skills: Frog kick, which avoids up- and downward directed vortices and are less likely to disturb silt on the bottom or loose material on the ceiling, and modified frog kick, a version which is more suited to narrow spaces; modified flutter kick, a version of flutter kick which minimises downward directed vortices; back kick, which produces thrust towards the feet, used to move backwards along the long axis of the diver, and helicopter turns, which rotate the diver on the spot around a vertical axis, using lower leg and ankle movements.
*The ability to navigate in total darkness using the guideline to find the way out is a safety critical emergency skill. Line management skills required for cave-diving include laying and recovering guide lines using a reel, tie-offs, the use of a jump line to cross gaps or find a lost guide line in silted out conditions, identifying the direction along the guideline leading to the exit, and the skills of dealing with a break in a guideline.
*Emergency skills for dealing with gas supply problems are complicated by the possibility of the emergency occurring in a confined space and low visibility or darkness, and at a considerable horizontal distance from a free surface to the atmosphere.
*Communicating by touch and light signals.
*Providing and receiving emergency breathing gas while swimming through narrow spaces.

=== Line management ===

The essential cave-diving procedure is navigation using a guide line. This includes laying and marking line, following line and interpreting line markers, avoiding entanglement, recovering from entanglement, maintaining and repairing line, finding lost line, jumping gaps, and recovering line, any of which may need to be done in zero visibility, total darkness, tight confined spaces or a combination of these conditions.
*Laying a cave line: the procedure of running line (unreeling line under light tension as one advances) to avoid snagging on the diver and so that it runs fairly straight between s, placing the line so it can all be seen and reached, so it can be followed in good or bad visibility, avoiding s, and securing the line sufficiently at suitable places to keep it in position.
**Making placements - securing the guideline as it is being run and the choice of primary and secondary tie offs.
**Temporary line – line that is laid on the way into parts of a cave without permanent line, and recovered to the reel on the way out.
**Permanent line – line that is thicker, and therefore easier to see, stronger, and more abrasion resistant, and more securely fastened, intended to be left in place for use by other divers. It may be secured to placements at closer intervals to facilitate finding the other end and reconnection in case of a break. It is not recovered during exit, and will generally be marked. 
*** is heavy duty permanent guide line of a bright yellow colour and kernmantle construction that leads to the exit. The colour was chosen to make the line more easily identifiable while remaining highly visible, and a heavier duty line also helps in identification by feel and makes the line more durable. In some regions the consensus among cave diving professionals is to reserve gold line for cavern areas which are used for tours. In some cases the gold line extends to the naturally illuminated zone, while in others it will start inside the dark zone, to avoid tempting incompetent and inadequately equipped divers from following the line into the cave.
*Marking line: Permanent line is marked to indicate the direction to the nearest exit, and to indicate where dive teams have passed but have not yet returned by looping the line onto a line marker, ensuring that a directional marker points in the correct direction, and that all markers are sufficiently securely attached, while remaining easily removable if temporary.
**Directional markers - cave arrows used to indicate the way out along the line.
**Personal markers – cookies – temporary markers to indicate that a diver has passed beyond a point but has not returned yet, particularly where the group leaves the permanent line or makes a jump to a secondary permanent (branch) line. A personal directional marker may be attached to a line to indicate that the owner has gone in that direction, which can happen after divers are separated if one finds the line but not the other divers, and decides to exit independently.
*Following a line – the skills of navigating back out of a cave using the line as a guide, particularly in the dark and low visibility.
*Finding a lost line: although cave-diving procedures are intended to minimize the risk of losing the guide line, it can happen, and as the chance of finding one&#x27;s way out without the line are drastically reduced, losing the line is considered a life-threatening situation, and the diver must be competent in the methods for relocating the line in all reasonably foreseeable circumstances, which include a bad silt-out, total darkness, and loss of contact with the other divers in the team. Methods of search should prevent the diver from drifting away from the vicinity of the line, so the start position for the search should be secured by tying off a search line. In principle, if the diver feels their way around the cross section of the cave orthogonal to the line direction until they get back to the starting point, the guideline should be either found directly, or be within the loop of the search line, but even this is not guaranteed to work, as the shape of the cave and limited breathing gas supplies could make this impossible.
*Fixing a line break, This requires the ability to tie reliable knots, which may have to be done in bad visibility. It also requires the diver to find the other end of the break. On the way into a cave a line break is an inconvenience, as if the other side cannot be found, the divers can still find their way out. On the way out a line break is a life-threatening emergency until the other end is found, as gas supply is limited and there is no infallible way to find the other end while there is enough gas to complete the exit.
*Jumping a gap to a branch line – this involves tying off to the permanent line in a way that is unlikely to come loose, but may be released quickly on the return. Passing a loop on the end of the jump line round the permanent line and over the reel is a standard method. A tag on the end of the loop helps release it quickly. This method cannot be inadvertently released by other divers following the main line.
*Recovering temporary line – this is done by the last diver in line on the way out, so the others can follow the line out of the cave, even in reduced visibility, without risking losing the line. They may prepare the line for the reel operator, by releasing tie-offs, which cuts down on delays. In an emergency exit the reel and line may be temporarily abandoned, as it can be retrieved later. The reel operator keeps a light tension on the line and tries to keep it evenly distributed over the width of the reel while winding in. The divers further ahead on the line can feel the presence of others behind them by line tension and small movements of the line as it is reeled in.

=== Lost line ===

Losing the guide line in a cave is a potentially life-threatening emergency. While following recommended best practice makes it highly unlikely that a diver will lose the line, it can and does happen, and there are procedures which will usually work to find it again. Any reliable information on where the diver is likely to be relative to the last known position of the line may be critical, and the procedure of choice will depend on what is reliably known. In all situations, the diver will attempt to stabilise the situation and avoid getting further lost, and make a thorough visual check in all directions from where they are at the time, taking into account the possibility of the line being in a line trap. If the diver has not also separated from their buddy, the buddy may know where the line is, and can be asked, and if the diver is separated from their buddy, the buddy may be at the line, and the buddy&#x27;s light may be visible.

Stabilising the position is generally done by finding the nearest feasible tie-off point and securely tying off a search line. The direction of the guide line when last seen should be known, and therefore the direction the diver was swimming in before losing the line. If the diver was neutrally buoyant while following the line, the approximate depth can be reconstructed by finding the depth of neutral buoyancy again, without adjusting inflation of BCD or dry suit. Unless the line was lost by the diver not noticing a change of direction, it is likely to be at much the same depth, in much the same direction, and at a similar lateral and vertical distance as when last seen, making it logical to try that direction first. While swimming towards the estimated position of the line and slowly paying out search line, the diver will search visually, and in low visibility or darkness, also by feel, making arm sweeps across the expected direction of the line, while defending the head from impact with the other arm. The distance swum towards the estimated position of the lost line can be measured by the spacing and number of knots paid out on the search line. If the search fails, the diver will return to the tie off and try again in the next best guess for the direction the line may be. The diver may also choose to try a different search method. The best search method for any given situation will depend on the water conditions, the layout of the section of cave, the way the line was laid, the situational knowledge and skills of the diver, and the equipment available – a method that would be ideal for one situation might not work at all for another.

If the line is found, but not the other divers, the diver can tie off their search reel to the guide line as an indicator to other members of the team that they were lost but have found the guide line, and indicate the direction that they intend to proceed along the guideline with a personal directional marker so that others who see it while searching for the lost diver will know whether the diver chose the right direction to exit the cave.

=== Lost buddy ===
This is generally the converse situation to the lost guide line, in that the diver loses contact with their buddy or team but remains in contact with the guide line, so is not themselves lost. Their first priority is to not get lost or disorientated, and in furtherance of this aim would attach a directional line marker to the guide line indicating the direction to the exit before starting a search. The search line can be tied to the directional marker to prevent it from sliding along the line during the search. The direction for the search would depend on the layout of that part of the cave, and where the missing diver should have been in the group. The search party must consider their own safety first, regarding how much gas they can afford to use in a search, which will depend on the stage of the dive when the diver is noticed to be missing. When searching in darkness, the searchers should periodically turn off their lights as this will allow them to see the lost diver&#x27;s light more easily.

=== Gas planning and management ===

Gas planning is the aspect of dive planning which deals with the calculation or estimation of the amounts and mixtures of gases to be used for a planned dive profile. It usually assumes that the dive profile, including decompression, is known, but the process may be iterative, involving changes to the dive profile as a consequence of the gas requirement calculation, or changes to the gas mixtures chosen. Use of calculated reserves based on planned dive profile and estimated gas consumption rates rather than an arbitrary pressure based on a fraction of the initial gas supply is sometimes referred to as rock bottom gas management. The purpose of gas planning is to ensure that for all reasonably foreseeable contingencies, the divers of a team have sufficient breathing gas to safely return to a place where more breathing gas is available. In almost all cases this will be the surface.

Gas planning includes the following aspects:
* Choice of breathing gases to suit the depth at which they will be used,
* Choice of scuba configuration, to conveniently carry the gas, or store it at stage points along the route
* Estimation of gas quantities required for the planned dive, including , , and decompression gases, as appropriate to the profile.
* Estimation of gas quantities for reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Under stress it is likely that a diver will increase breathing rate and decrease swimming speed. Both of these lead to a higher gas consumption during an emergency exit or ascent.
* Choice of cylinders to carry the required gases. Each cylinder volume and working pressure must be sufficient to contain the required quantity of gas.
* Calculation of the pressures for each of the gases in each of the cylinders to provide the required quantities.
* Specifying the critical pressures of relevant gas mixtures for appropriate stages (waypoints) of the planned dive profile (gas matching).
The primary breathing apparatus may be open circuit scuba or rebreather, and bailout may also be open circuit or rebreather. Emergency gas may be shared among the team members, or each diver may carry their own, but in all cases each diver must be able to bail out onto a gas supply of their own for long enough to get to the next planned source of emergency gas. If for any reason this situation no longer applies, there is a single point of critical failure, and the risk becomes unacceptable, so the dive should be turned.

Gas management also includes the blending, filling, analysing, marking, storage, and transportation of gas cylinders for a dive, and the monitoring and switching of breathing gases during a dive, and the provision of emergency gas to another member of the dive team. The primary aim is to ensure that everyone has enough to breathe of a gas suitable for the current depth at all times, and is aware of the gas mixture in use and its effect on decompression obligations and oxygen toxicity risk.

==== Gas management rules of thumb ====

The rule of thirds for gas management is a rule of thumb used by divers to plan dives so they have enough breathing gas remaining in their diving cylinder at the end of the dive to be able to complete the dive safely. This rule mostly applies to diving in overhead environments, such as caves and wrecks, where a direct ascent to the surface is impossible and the divers must return the way they came.

For divers following the rule, one third of the gas supply is planned for the outward journey, one third is for the return journey and one third is a safety reserve. However, when diving with a buddy with a higher breathing rate or a different volume of gas, it may be necessary to set one third of the buddy&#x27;s gas supply as the remaining &#x27;third&#x27;. This means that the turn point to exit is earlier, or that the diver with the lower breathing rate carries a larger volume of gas than he alone requires.

A different option for penetration dives is the Half + 15 bar (half + 200 psi) method, in which the contingency gas for the stage is carried in the primary cylinders. Some divers consider this method to be the most conservative when multi-staging. If all goes to plan when using this method, the divers surface with stages nearly empty, but with all the contingency gas still in their primary cylinders. With a single stage drop, this means the primary cylinders will still be about half-full.

===Special cases===
*High flow sinks. Gas planning is more complicated when the flow in the cave opposes the diver on the exit, as it is then not reasonable to assume that the amount of gas needed for the exit is equal to the amount used for the entry, and the rule of thirds does not apply. A significantly larger reserve will be needed, and the turn pressure will be higher.
*Complex traverses
*Complex circuits
==Training==
Cave-diving training includes equipment selection and configuration, guideline protocols and techniques, gas management protocols, communication techniques, propulsion techniques, emergency management protocols, and psychological education. Cave diver training also stresses the importance of risk management and cave conservation ethics. Most training systems offer progressive stages of education and certification.

*Cavern training covers the basic skills needed to enter the overhead environment. Training will generally consist of gas planning, propulsion techniques needed to deal with the silty environments in many caves, reel and handling, and communication. Once certified as a cavern diver, a diver may undertake cavern diving with a cavern or cave certified &quot;buddy&quot;, as well as continue into cave-diving training.
*Introduction into cave training builds on the techniques learned during cavern training and includes the training needed to penetrate beyond the cavern zone and working with permanent guidelines that exist in many caves. Once intro to cave certified, a diver may penetrate much further into a cave, usually limited by 1/3 of a single cylinder, or in the case of a basic cave certification, 1/6 of double cylinders. An intro cave diver is usually not certified to do complex navigation.
*Apprentice cave training serves as the transition from intro to full certification and includes the training needed to penetrate deep into caves working from permanent guide lines as well as limited exposure to side lines that exist in many caves. Training covers complex dive planning and decompression procedures used for longer dives. Once apprentice certified, a diver may penetrate much further into a cave, usually limited by 1/3 of double cylinders. An apprentice diver is also allowed to do a single jump or gap (a break in the guideline from two sections of mainline or between mainline and sideline) during the dive. An apprentice diver typically has one year to finish full cave or must repeat the apprentice stage.
*Full cave training serves as the final level of basic training and includes the training needed to penetrate deep into the cave working from both permanent guidelines and sidelines, and may plan and complete complex dives deep into a system using decompression to stay longer. Once cave certified, a diver may penetrate much further into a cave, usually limited by 1/3 of double cylinders. A cave diver is also certified as competent to do multiple jumps or gaps (a break in the guideline from two sections of mainline or between mainline and sideline) during the dive.
* Further training may be available in skills for cave surveying and mapping.

===Certification===
Various diver training and certification organizations offer training for cave divers, often based on the three cave zones defined by CMAS. Some organizations offer cavern diving training for recreational divers, (Zone 1). Cave diving involves significant risks, so a self-taught approach is discouraged.

The following training courses are offered by the listed organisations:

In France, courses organized by the national cave diving commission of the FFESSM, are offered to holders of level 2 certification or higher. The French Cave Diving School of the FFS also offers courses open to any autonomous diver.

==Exploration, surveys and mapping==
A significant aspect of cave diving by competent and enthusiastic cave divers is exploration, survey and mapping. Data collected is often shared and may be stored on databases to help optimise the effectiveness of such surveys, and make the information generally available.

Underwater cave mapping is complicated by both a lack of access to the surface for GPS positions, darkness, with short line-of-sight, and limited visibility, which complicate optical measurement. Altitude/depth is relatively simple as accurate depth measurement is available to divers in the form of decompression computers, which log a depth/time record of reasonable accuracy and are available for instantaneous readout at any point, and depth can be referenced to the altitude at the surface. Vertical dimensions can be directly measured or calculated as differences in depth.

Surface coordinates can be collected via GPS and remote sensing, with varying degrees of precision and accuracy depending on the type of entrance. In some caves the water surface is in view of GPS satellites, in others it is a considerable distance along a complex route from the nearest open air. Three dimensional models of varying accuracy and detail can be created by processing measurements collected by whatever methods were available. These can be used in virtual reality models. The usual methods for survey and mapping of underwater caves are dead reckoning and direct measurements of distance, compass direction and depth, by diving teams of two or three scuba divers, who record azimuth of the cave line, measurements of height, width, depth, and slope at intervals along the line, generally using a permanent guide line as a reference baseline, and take photographic records of features and objects of interest. Data are collected on and by digital photography. Hand-held sonar may be used for distance measurement where available. Where the depth or other constraints prevent divers from exploring in person, tethered and untethered remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROUVs) have been used effectively, using sonar technology to scan and map the surroundings, and video to record the appearance.

Features, artifacts, remains, and other objects of interest
are recorded in situ as effectively as possible, generally by photography.

==Hazards==
Cave-diving is one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous kinds of diving and presents many hazards. Cave-diving is a form of penetration diving, meaning that in an emergency a diver cannot swim vertically to the surface due to the cave&#x27;s ceilings, and so must swim the entire way back out. The underwater navigation through the cave system may be difficult and exit routes may be at a considerable distance, requiring the diver to have sufficient breathing gas to make the journey. The dive may also be deep, resulting in potential deep diving risks.

Visibility can vary from nearly unlimited to low, or non-existent, and can go from very good to very bad in a single dive. While a less-intensive kind of diving called cavern diving does not take divers beyond the reach of natural light (and typically no deeper than ), and penetration not further than , true cave-diving can involve penetrations of many thousands of feet, well beyond the reach of sunlight. The level of darkness experienced creates an environment impossible to see in without an artificial source of light even if the water is clear. Caves often contain sand, mud, clay, silt, or other sediment that can further reduce underwater visibility in seconds when stirred up. Consequently, visibility is often worse during exit, and divers rely on the guideline for finding the way out.

The water in caves can have strong flow. Most caves flooded to the surface at the cave mouth are either springs or siphons. Springs have out-flowing currents, where water is coming up out of the Earth and flowing out across the land&#x27;s surface. Siphons have in-flowing currents where, for example, an above-ground river is going underground. Some caves are complex and have some tunnels with out-flowing currents, and other tunnels with in-flowing currents. Inflowing currents can cause serious problems for the diver, as they make the exit more difficult, and the diver is carried to spaces that are unfamiliar and may be dangerous, while outflowing currents generally make the exit quicker and the diver is carried through places they have been before and can be prepared for difficult areas.

Cave-diving has been perceived as one of the more deadly sports in the world. This perception may be exaggerated because the majority of divers who have died in caves have either not undergone specialized training or have had inadequate equipment for the environment. Some cave divers have suggested that cave-diving is statistically much safer than recreational diving due to the much larger barriers imposed by experience, training, and equipment cost, but there is no definitive statistical evidence for this claim.

There is no reliable worldwide database listing all cave-diving fatalities. Such fractional statistics as are available, however, suggest that few divers have died while following accepted protocols and while using equipment configurations recognized as acceptable by the cave-diving community. In the very rare cases of exceptions to this rule there have typically been unusual circumstances.

== Safety ==
Most cave divers recognize five general rules or contributing factors for safe cave-diving, which were popularized, adapted and became generally accepted from Sheck Exley&#x27;s 1979 publication &quot;Basic Cave Diving: A Blueprint for Survival&quot;. In this book, Exley included accounts of actual cave-diving accidents, and followed each one with a breakdown of what factors contributed to the accident. Despite the unique circumstances of each individual accident, Exley found that at least one of a small number of major factors contributed to each one. This technique for breaking down accident reports and finding common causes among them is now called &quot;accident analysis&quot;, and is taught in introductory cave-diving courses. Exley outlined a number of these resulting cave-diving rules, but today these five are the most recognized:
*Training: A safety conscious cave diver does not intentionally exceed the scope of their training. Cave-diving is normally taught in stages, each successive stage focusing on more complex aspects of cave-diving. Each stage of training is intended to be reinforced with actual cave-diving experience to develop competence before starting training at a more complex level. Accident analysis of cave-diving fatalities has shown that academic training without sufficient real world experience is not always enough in the event of an underwater emergency. By systematically building experience the diver can develop the confidence, motor skills and reflexes to remain calm and apply the appropriate procedures in an emergency. An inexperienced diver is more likely to panic than an experienced diver when confronted with a similar situation, all other factors being equal. Experience in dealing successfully with real or simulated problems is of the greatest value, experience of dives where nothing goes wrong reinforces the skills used, but not the skills that were not needed but might be critical in an emergency. When trained to the highest available level, further competence can be developed by practice and gradual extension of range of experience. 
*Guide line: A continuous guide line is maintained at all times between the leader of a dive team and a fixed point selected outside the cave entrance in open water. Often this line is tied off a second time as a backup directly inside the cavern zone. As the dive leader lays the guideline they take great care to ensure there is appropriate tension on the line, and that it does not go into line traps, tying off the line as necessary to keep it leading through a clear route. Other team members remain between the lead diver and the exit, in easy reach of the line at all times. If a silt out occurs, divers can find the line and follow it back to the cave entrance. Failure to use a continuous guide line to open water is cited as the most frequent cause of fatality among untrained, non-certified divers who venture into caves. Greater care to avoid line traps is required for laying permanent line, and more frequent tie-offs would be expected, as a permanent line is more susceptible to breaking over time. 
*Depth rules: Gas consumption, nitrogen narcosis and decompression obligation increase with depth, and the effects of nitrogen narcosis may be more critical in a cave due to the high task loading and presence of combinations of hazards. Cave divers are advised not to dive to depths exceeding the planned depth and the applicable range of their equipment and the breathing gases in use, and to keep in mind this effective difference between open water depth and cave depth. Excessive depth is frequently cited as a contributory factor in fatal incidents involving fully trained cave divers.
*Breathing gas management: The breathing gas supply must last the diver until out of the overhead environment. There are several strategies for gas management. The most common protocol is the &#x27;rule of thirds,&#x27; in which one third of the initial gas supply is used for ingress, one third for egress, and one third to support another team member in the case of an emergency. This is a very simple method, but is not always sufficient. UK practice is to adhere to the rule of thirds, but with an added emphasis on keeping depletion of the separate air systems &quot;balanced&quot;, so that the complete loss of any single gas supply will still leave the diver with sufficient gas to return safely. The rule of thirds makes no allowance for increased air consumption that the stress caused by the loss of an air system may induce. Dissimilar tank sizes among the divers are also not allowed for by the rule of thirds, and a sufficient reserve should be calculated for each dive. UK practice is to assume that each diver is completely independent, as in a typical UK sump there is usually nothing that a buddy can do to assist a diver in trouble. Most UK cave divers dive solo. US sump divers follow a similar protocol. The rule of thirds was devised as an approach to diving Florida&#x27;s caves – they typically have high outflow currents, which help to reduce air consumption when exiting. In a cave system with little or no outflow it is prudent to reserve more air than is provided by the rule of thirds.
*Lights: Each cave diver should have at least three independent sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered backup lights and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that the dive be aborted for all members of the dive team and that they immediately start the exit.

Most cave-diving fatalities are due to running out of gas before reaching the exit. This is often the direct consequence of getting lost, whether the guide line is found again or not, and whether the visibility deteriorates, lights fail, or someone panics. On rare occasions equipment failure is unrecoverable, or a diver becomes inextricably trapped, seriously injured, incapacitated by using an unsuitable gas for the depth, or swept away by strong flow. Getting lost means separation from the continuous guide line to the exit, and not knowing the direction to the exit.

Some cave divers are taught to remember the five key components with the mnemonic: &quot;The Good Divers Always Live&quot; (training, guide, depth, air, light).

In recent years new contributing factors were considered after reviewing accidents involving solo diving, diving with incapable dive partners, video or photography in caves, complex cave dives and cave-diving in large groups. With the establishment of technical diving, the use of mixed gases—such as trimix for bottom gas, and nitrox and oxygen for decompression—reduces the margin for error. Accident analysis suggests that breathing the wrong gas for the depth or not analyzing the breathing gas properly has also led to cave-diving accidents.

Cave-diving requires a variety of specialized procedures, and divers who do not correctly apply these procedures may significantly increase the risk to the members of their team. The cave-diving community works hard to educate the public on the risks they assume when they enter water-filled caves. Warning signs with the likenesses of the Grim Reaper have been placed just inside the openings of many popular caves in the US and Mexico, and others have been placed in nearby parking lots and local dive shops.

Many cave-diving sites around the world include open-water basins, which are popular open-water diving sites. The management of these sites try to minimize the risk of untrained divers being tempted to venture inside the cave systems. With the support of the cave-diving community, many of these sites enforce a &quot;no-lights rule&quot; for divers who lack cave training—they may not carry any lights into the water with them. It is easy to venture into an underwater cave with a light and not realize how far away from the entrance (and daylight) one has swum; this rule is based on the theory that, without a light, divers will not venture beyond daylight.

In the early phases of cave-diving the analysis shows that 90% of accidents were &quot;not&quot; trained cave divers; from the 2000s on the trend has reversed to 80% of accidents involving trained cave divers. Modern cave divers&#x27; capability and available technology allows divers to venture well beyond traditional training limits and into actual exploration. The result is an increase of cave-diving accidents, in 2011 the yearly average of 2.5 fatalities a year tripled. In 2012 fatalities reached the highest annual rate to that date at over 20.

As response to the increase in fatalities during the years 2010 onwards, the International Diving Research and Exploration Organization (IDREO) was created in order to &quot;bring awareness of the current safety situation of Cave Diving&quot; by listing current worldwide accidents by year and promoting a community discussion and analysis of accidents through a &quot;Cave Diver Safety Meeting&quot; held annually.

== Equipment ==


Equipment used by cave divers ranges from fairly standard recreational scuba configurations, to more complex arrangements which allow more freedom of movement in confined spaces, extended range in terms of depth and time, allowing greater distances to be covered in acceptable safety, and equipment which helps with navigation, in what are usually dark, and often silty and convoluted spaces.

Scuba configurations which are more often found in cave-diving than in open water diving include independent or manifolded twin cylinder rigs, side-mount harnesses, sling cylinders, rebreathers and backplate and wing harnesses. Bill Stone designed and used epoxy composite tanks for exploration of the San Agustín and Sistema Huautla caves in Mexico to decrease the weight for dry sections and vertical passages.

Stage cylinders are cylinders which are used to provide gas for a portion of the penetration. They may be deposited on the bottom at the guideline on preparation dives, to be picked up for use during the main dive, or may be carried by the divers and dropped off at the line during the penetration to be retrieved on the way out.
One of the high risk hazards of cave-diving is getting lost in the cave. The use of guide lines is the standard mitigation for this risk. Guide lines may be permanent or laid and recovered during the dive, using cave reels to deploy and recover the line. Permanent branch lines may be laid with a gap between the start of the branch line and the nearest point on the main line. Line used for this purpose is known as cave line. Gap spools with a relatively short line are commonly used to make the jump.

Line arrows are used to point towards the nearest exit, and cookies are used to indicate use of a line by a team of divers.

Silt screws are short lengths of rigid tube (usually plastic) with one sharpened end and a notch or slot at the other end to secure the line, which are pushed into the silt or detritus of the cave floor as a place to tie off a guideline when no suitable natural tie-off points are available.

A simple plastic helmet, such as those used in water sports like whitewater kayaking, is good protection in case of accidental contact with the cave ceiling or stalactites.

Diver propulsion vehicles, or scooters, are sometimes used to extend the range by reducing the work load on the diver and allowing faster travel in open sections of cave. Reliability of the diver propulsion vehicle is very important, as a failure could compromise the ability of the diver to exit the cave before running out of gas. Where this is a significant risk, divers may tow a spare scooter.

Dive lights are critical safety equipment, as it is dark inside caves. Each diver generally carries a primary light, and at least one backup light. A minimum of three lights is recommended. The primary light should last the planned duration of the dive, as should each of the backup lights.

== History ==
One of the earliest known cave dives was a freedive in 1922 by Norbert Casteret in the Montespan cave, France.

Jacques-Yves Cousteau, co-inventor of the first commercially successful open circuit scuba equipment, was the world&#x27;s first open circuit scuba cave diver. However, many cave divers penetrated caves prior to the advent of scuba with surface supplied breathing apparatus through the use of air hoses and compressors. Scuba diving in all its forms, including cave-diving, has advanced in earnest since Cousteau introduced the Aqua-Lung in 1943.

Two regions have had particular influence on cave-diving techniques and equipment due to their very different cave-diving environments. These are the United Kingdom, and the United States, mainly Florida.

===Records===
On January 6, 2024, Xavier Méniscus broke the cave diving record by reaching a depth of 312 metres in the Font Estramar chasm, in Salses-le-Château, France. The previous record of 308 m was held by Frédéric Swierczynski, and before that by Xavier Méniscus at 286m, on 30 December 2019, both also at Font Estramar cave. Before that, Nuno Gomes had descended to 282 metres at Boesmansgat in South Africa.

=== UK history ===

The Cave Diving Group (CDG) was established informally in the United Kingdom in 1935 to organise training and equipment for the exploration of flooded caves in the Mendip Hills of Somerset. The first dive was made by Jack Sheppard on 4 October 1936,
using a home-made drysuit surface fed from a modified bicycle pump, which allowed Sheppard to pass Sump 1 of Swildon&#x27;s Hole. Swildon&#x27;s is an upstream feeder to the Wookey Hole resurgence system. The difficulty of access to the sump in Swildon&#x27;s prompted operations to move to the resurgence, and the larger cave there allowed use of standard diving dress which was secured from the Siebe Gorman company. In UK cave-diving, the term &quot;Sherpa&quot; was used without irony for the people who carry the diver&#x27;s gear although this has gone out of fashion; support is now more normally used, and before the development of SCUBA equipment such undertakings could be monumental operations.

Diving in the spacious third chamber of Wookey Hole led to a rapid series of advances, each of which was dignified by being given a successive number, until an air surface was reached at what is now known as &quot;Chamber 9.&quot; Some of these dives were broadcast live on BBC Radio.

The number of sites where standard diving dress could be used is clearly limited and there was little further progress before the outbreak of World War II reduced the caving community considerably. However, the rapid development of underwater warfare through the war made a lot of surplus equipment available. The CDG re-formed in 1946 and progress was rapid. Typical equipment at this time was a frogman rubber diving suit for insulation (water temperature in the UK is typically 4 °C), an oxygen diving cylinder, soda lime absorbent canister and counter-lung comprising a rebreather air system and an &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Apparatus For Laying Out Line And Underwater Navigation.&quot; The AFLOLAUN consisted of lights, line-reel, compass, notebook (for the survey), batteries, and more.

Progress was typically by &quot;bottom walking&quot;, as this was considered less dangerous than swimming (note the absence of buoyancy controls). The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dive, which was considerably compensated by the extended dive duration. This was the normal diving equipment and methods until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits (which provide both insulation and buoyancy ), twin open-circuit SCUBA air systems the development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins. The increasing capacity and pressure rating of air bottles also extended dive durations.

===US history===
In the 1970s, cave-diving greatly increased in popularity among divers in the United States. However, there were very few experienced cave divers and almost no formal classes to handle the surge in interest. The result was a large number of divers trying to cave dive without any formal training. This resulted in more than 100 fatalities over the course of the decade. The state of Florida came close to banning SCUBA diving around the cave entrances. The cave-diving organizations responded to the problem by creating training programs and certifying instructors, in addition to other measures to try to prevent these fatalities. This included posting signs, adding no-lights rules, and other enforcements.

In the United States, Sheck Exley was a pioneering cave diver who first explored many underwater cave systems in Florida, and many throughout the US and the world. On 6 February 1974, Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the National Speleological Society.

Since the 1980s, cave-diving education has greatly reduced diver fatalities, and it is now rare for an agency trained diver to perish in an underwater cave. Also in the 1980s, refinements were made to the equipment used for cave-diving, most importantly better lights with smaller batteries. In the 1990s, cave-diving equipment configurations became more standardized, due mostly to the adaptation and popularization of the &quot;Hogarthian rig&quot;, developed by several North Florida cave divers, particularly William Hogarth Main, which promotes equipment choices that &quot;keep it simple and streamlined&quot;.

===Australian history===
Four divers using scuba dived from the Right Imperial Cave in the Jenolan system in the Blue Mountains to an upstream chamber on 30 October 1954.

===Europe===
Before the development of underwater breathing equipment, speleologists explored submerged cavities on breathhold (apnea), and with the equipment of the period: swimming underwater in total darkness, and with candles and matches for subsequent exploration.

In 1909, Eugene Fournier explored the Rigole source in Perpignan, diving to a depth of four meters to explore the continuation of the cavity.

In 1924, Norbert Casteret explored the Montespan grotto in Haute-Garonne, where he swam through two successive siphons equipped with candles and matches.

Between 1936 and 1949, Max Cosyns explored various springs in Sainte Engrace, in Pais Vasco, Spain, passing through siphons on breathhold and then continuing the exploration.

After the development of scuba diving, the possibilities of cave diving have expanded. For example:

In 1953, the scouts of the La Verna Clan of Lyon (Letrone, Eppely and Ballandraux) explored the Lamina Zilua spring in Sainte Engrace (Sola), passing through three siphons and stopping at the very narrow entry to the fourth.

The Fernández Rubio brothers developed a new apnea technique for cave diving, which was used in the explorations of the Mairuelegorreta cave in 1959.

In 1965 and 1966, led by Max Cosyns, cave divers from Namur managed to climb the Kakueta Waterfall Cave (Cueva de la Cascada de Kakueta) to a fifth siphon 500 meters from the entrance, which despite diving to a depth of 30 m, they were unable to cross.

In 1973, the cave divers Barroumés and Larribau crossed the Erberua siphon (Labort), and discovered a gallery on the other side with an important archaeological site.

In 1973, the cave diver R. Jean (Fontaine la Tronche Group) crossed the first siphon of the Gouffre des Bourrugues (Larra), at a depth of 305 m below the surface.

In 1980-81 Fred Vergier passed the first 3 siphons of Sima de las Puertas de Illamina (BU-56), reaching a depth of -1338 m. In 1986 divers from the Grupo Studenets Pleven of Bulgaria passed through the fourth siphon, reaching a depth of -1355 meters. In 1987, members of the same club passed the 5th and 6th siphons, subsequently exploring a wide gallery 650 meters long, and reaching the level of -1408 m, at the time the second deepest known chasm.

==Organisations==
Several organisations exist to support caving and cave diving. Some of them also specifically train and certify cave divers to their own standards. There are also organisations dedicated to exploration, survey, and mapping of cave systems, both dry and flooded.

===Cave Divers Association of Australia===
The Cave Divers Association of Australia (CDAA) is a cave diving organisation which was formed in September 1973 to represent the interests of recreational scuba divers who dive in water-filled caves and sinkholes principally in the Lower South East (now called the Limestone Coast) of South Australia (SA) and secondly in other parts of Australia. Its formation occurred after a series of diving fatalities in water-filled caves and sinkholes in the Mount Gambier region between 1969 and 1973 and in parallel to a South Australian Government inquiry into these deaths. The CDAA&#x27;s major achievement has been the dramatic reduction of fatalities via the introduction of a site rating scheme and an associated testing system which was brought in during the mid-1970s. While its major area of operation is in the Limestone Coast region of SA, it administrates and supports cave diving activity in other parts of Australia including the Nullarbor Plain and Wellington, New South Wales.

===Cave Diving Group===
The Cave Diving Group (CDG) is a United Kingdom-based diver training organisation specialising in cave diving.

The CDG was founded in 1946 by Graham Balcombe, making it the world&#x27;s oldest continuing diving club. Graham Balcombe and Jack Sheppard pioneered cave diving in the late 1930s, notably at Wookey Hole in Somerset.

===National Association for Cave Diving===

The National Association for Cave Diving (NACD) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation founded in 1968 with the goal of improving the safety of scuba diving in caves through diver training and education. Its headquarters are in Gainesville, Florida but administration and operations are conducted from High Springs, Florida. The NACD is overseen by a board of directors composed of seven cave divers, four instructors, and three other directors. The elected officers are a president, vice president, secretary/treasurer, and training director. Membership is open to all who have an interest in underwater caves. The NACD publishes a quarterly journal, and various specialised publications, holds seminars, and workshops, and sponsors cave diving projects.

The goals of the NACD are:
* To establish and maintain current guidelines in the form of physical and psychological standards, as well as equipment and techniques necessary for safe cave diving,
* To encourage education and dissemination of safe cave diving information throughout the facilities of the organization and to provide a program of education and advanced training essential for safe cave diving,
* To achieve closer cooperation and understanding among members of the cave and recreational diving communities (and the general public) so they may work together toward the common goal of increasing safety in cavern and cave diving,
* To explore underwater caves and to encourage education and dissemination of information to government, private industry and the general public. To accomplish these goals the NACD is organized to provide the following services

NACD offers training and certification in cavern and cave diving, and instructor courses. The goal is not to encourage cavern or cave diving, but to aid divers in becoming safe cavern and cave divers. The NACD provides training standards to define their technical and philosophical principles of cave and cavern diving, but allows the instructors discretion and freedom use their own knowledge, experience, and teaching style, and acknowledges that many aspects of cave and cavern diving practice, procedure, and equipment configuration remain open to interpretation by equally qualified experts and that it is in the best interest of the student to be presented with differing views.

The NACD philosophy of safe cave diving is based on a system of checks and balances to insure that NACD standards are maintained in each course. The courses available are as described below:

The cavern diving course develops minimum skills, knowledge, dive planning abilities, problem solving procedures and the basic abilities to safely cavern dive. These skills are useful in all types of diving. The course
is taught in over a minimum of two days and includes classroom lectures, field exercises, open water line drills and a minimum of four cavern dives. This course emphasizes planning, procedures, environment, propulsion techniques, buoyancy skills, problem solving, equipment modification and the specialized needs of the cavern diver. The prerequisite qualification is Advanced Open Water Diver or equivalent.

The Introduction to Cave Diving course further develops
cave diving proficiency within the limitations of a single tank. It is taught over a minimum of two days and includes a minimum of four single tank cave dives. The course helps hone the skills learned on the cavern diving course, and teaches new skills and procedures for limited single tank cave penetration. It is considered a recreational cave diving course, and does not include obligatory decompression. The prerequisite qualification is cavern diver or equivalent and 25 logged non-training dives.

The Apprentice Cave Diver course is a training level which expires after a year if the full cave certification is not completed. It is an introduction to jump and gap procedures. The prerequisites are NACD Introduction to Cave or equivalent.

The full Cave Diver course covers is equipment configuration, decompression problem solving, jumps, circuits, traverses, and surveying. The prerequisite is 
NACD Introduction to Cave or equivalent.

NACD offers specialty cave diver training for the fully certified cave diver. Courses offered are:
* Exploration/survey techniques
* Stage diving
* Side mount diving
* Submersible Diver propulsion vehicle techniques
* Photography 
* Videography

Four instructor certification levels are available.
* Cavern Instructor
* Introduction to Cave Instructor
* Cave Instructor
* Specialty Cave Instructor

===National Speleological Society===
The National Speleological Society (NSS) is an organization formed in 1941 to advance the exploration, conservation, study, and understanding of caves in the United States. Originally headquartered in Washington D.C., its current offices are in Huntsville, Alabama. The organization engages in the research and scientific study, restoration, exploration, and protection of caves. It has more than 10,000 members in more than 250 grottos. Since 1974 there has been as cave diving section of the society.

===Quintana Roo Speleological Survey===
The Quintana Roo Speleological Survey (QRSS) was established in 1990 for the safe exploration, survey and cartography of the underwater and dry caves and cenotes of Quintana Roo, Mexico, supported by the National Speleological Society.

The survey principally acts as a data repository for explored sites within the state of Quintana Roo and distributes summary statistical tables through its webpage, which as of February, 2011 included 208 underwater cave systems with a total surveyed length of , and 50 caves above the water table with a total length of .

===Woodville Karst Plains Project===
The Woodville Karst Plain Project (WKPP is a project and organization that maps the underwater cave systems underlying the Woodville Karst Plain, a area from Tallahassee, Florida, U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico which includes several first magnitude springs, including Wakulla Springs, and the Leon Sinks cave system, the longest underwater cave in the United States. The project grew out of a cave diving research and exploration group established in 1985 and incorporated in 1990 (by Bill Gavin and Bill Main, later joined by Parker Turner, Lamar English and Bill McFaden, at the time the chairman of the NACD Exploration and Survey Committee).

==Cave-diving regions==
Cave-diving venues can be found on all continents except Antarctica, where the average temperature is too low for water to remain liquid in caves.

There are few flooded caves in Africa which are known and accessible. There are several in South Africa, a few in Namibia and Zimbabwe, and some large caves recently discovered in Madagascar.

There are a large number of flooded caves in the limestone regions and other regions of Asia, particularly in the karst regions of China and Southeast Asia. Some are accessible for recreational cave-diving, but most have probably not yet been found or explored.

Australia has many spectacular water filled caves and sinkholes, many of them in the Mount Gambier region of South Australia.

Europe has a large number of flooded caves, particularly in the karst regions.

North America has many cave-diving venues, particularly in Florida, USA, and the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico.

South America has some cave-diving venues in Brazil.

The islands of The Bahamas have large number of underwater caves and blue holes found throughout the archipelago. 
== Terminology ==

Caves and caverns as geographical entities are defined differently from cave-diving and cavern-diving, so it is possible to be cavern diving in what is technically a cave, and cave-diving in what is technically a cavern.




===Types of cave dive===
A cave dive can be categorised by the topology of the route, which can be linear, include a circuit, or be a traverse.






===Caves by flow type===
These terms describe flooded cave areas with reference to flow direction. 



===Types of cave by method of formation===









===Types of cave by topology===
*simple, linear, unbranched
*simply branched
*network, complex branched, anastomosed.

<text>The Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named for the &quot;Sazerac de Forge et Fils&quot; brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient. The drink is most traditionally a combination of
cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe. Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word &quot;cocktail&quot; to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.

==Characteristics==
The defining feature of the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent. The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass. Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable. In New Orleans, Herbsaint is most commonly used due to the absence of absinthe in the U.S. market from 1912 until 2007.

==History==
Around 1850, Sewell T. Taylor sold his New Orleans bar, the Merchants Exchange Coffee House, to become an importer of spirits, and he began to import a brand of cognac named &quot;Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils&quot;. Meanwhile, Aaron Bird assumed proprietorship of the Merchants Exchange and changed its name to Sazerac Coffee House.

Legend has it that Bird began serving the &quot;Sazerac Cocktail&quot;, made with Sazerac cognac imported by Taylor, and allegedly with bitters being made by the local apothecary, Antoine Amedie Peychaud. The Sazerac Coffee House subsequently changed hands several times, until around 1870 Thomas Handy became its proprietor. It is around this time that the primary ingredient changed from cognac to rye whiskey, due to the phylloxera epidemic in Europe that devastated the vineyards of France.

At some point before his death in 1889, Handy recorded the recipe for the cocktail, which made its first printed appearance in William T. &quot;Cocktail Bill&quot; Boothby&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Drinks and How to Mix Them&quot; (1908), although his recipe calls for Selner Bitters, not Peychaud&#x27;s. After absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, it was replaced by various anise-flavored liqueurs, most notably the locally produced Herbsaint, which first appeared in 1934.

By the early 20th century, simple cocktails like the Sazerac had become rare, which eventually rekindled their popularity.

The creation of the Sazerac has also been credited to Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a Creole apothecary who emigrated to New Orleans from the West Indies and set up shop in the French Quarter in the early 19th century. He was known to dispense a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe. According to popular myth, he served his drink in the large end of an egg cup that was called a &quot;coquetier&quot; in French, and the Americanized mispronunciation resulted in the name &quot;cocktail&quot;. This belief was debunked when people discovered that the term &quot;cocktail&quot; as a type of drink first appeared in print at least as far back as 1803—and was defined in print in 1806 as, &quot;a mixture of spirits of any kind, water, sugar and bitters, vulgarly called a bittered sling&quot;.

===Official cocktail of New Orleans===
In March 2008, Louisiana state senator Edwin R. Murray (D-New Orleans) filed Senate Bill 6 designating the Sazerac as Louisiana&#x27;s official state cocktail. The bill was defeated on April 8, 2008. After further debate, on June 23, 2008, the Louisiana Legislature agreed to proclaim the Sazerac as New Orleans&#x27; official cocktail.

In 2011, as a writer for the HBO TV series &quot;Treme&quot;, Anthony Bourdain penned a scene in which chef Janette Desautel (played by Kim Dickens) tosses one in the face of restaurant critic and food writer Alan Richman (appearing as himself). Richman had angered many New Orleanians in 2006 with an article in the magazine &quot;GQ&quot;, in which he criticized New Orleans&#x27; food culture post-Hurricane Katrina. Despite reservations, he agreed to participate in the scene and called Sazerac &quot;a good choice of weaponry, because it symbolizes the city&quot;, despite a running feud with Bourdain over, among other things, the review.

==Similar cocktails==
A cocktail named the Zazarack was included in the 1910 version of &quot;Jack&#x27;s Manual&quot;, an early bartender&#x27;s reference written by Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Grohusko, the head bartender at Baracca&#x27;s restaurant in New York. It is essentially the same cocktail as the Sazerac, but called for bourbon (and not rye) instead of cognac.

Later versions of the drink were spelled Zazarac and added rum, and are thought by some to be a variant of the Sazerac, although it might have originated completely independently of the more famous drink.

== Brands ==
&quot;Sazerac&quot; is also a brand of rye whiskey produced by the Sazerac Company.

<text>A bitters (plural also &quot;bitters&quot;) is traditionally an alcoholic preparation flavored with botanical matter for a bitter or bittersweet flavor. Originally, numerous longstanding brands of bitters were developed as patent medicines, but lately are sold as digestifs, sometimes with herbal properties, and as cocktail flavorings.

Since cocktails often contain sour and sweet flavors, bitters are used to engage another primary taste and thereby balance out the drink and make it more complex, giving it a more complete flavor profile.

==Ingredients==
The botanical ingredients used historically in preparing bitters have consisted of aromatic herbs, bark, roots, and/or fruit for their flavor and medicinal properties. Some of the more common ingredients are cascarilla, cassia (Chinese cinnamon), gentian, orange peel, and cinchona bark.

Most bitters contain both water and alcohol, the latter of which functions as a solvent for botanical extracts as well as a preservative. The alcoholic strength of bitters varies widely across brands and styles. Some modern bitters are made with vegetable glycerin instead, allowing those avoiding alcohol to enjoy them.

==History==

The origins of bitters go back to the ancient Egyptians, who may have infused medicinal herbs in jars of wine. This practice was further developed during the Middle Ages, when the availability of distilled alcohol coincided with a renaissance in pharmacognosy, which made possible more-concentrated herbal bitters and tonic preparations. Many of the brands and styles of digestive bitters reflect herbal stomachic and tonic preparations whose roots are claimed to be traceable back to Renaissance era pharmacopoeia and traditions.

By the nineteenth century, the British practice of adding herbal bitters (used as preventive medicines) to Canary wine had become immensely popular in the former American colonies. By 1806, American publications referenced the popularity of a new preparation, termed &quot;cocktail&quot;, which was described as a combination of &quot;a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters&quot;.

Of the commercial aromatic bitters that would emerge from this period, perhaps the best known is Angostura bitters. In spite of its name, the preparation contains no medicinal bark from the angostura tree; instead, it is named after the town of Angostura, later Ciudad Bolívar, in Venezuela. Eventually the factory was moved from Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1875. German physician had compounded a cure for sea sickness and stomach maladies, among other medicinal uses. Siegert subsequently formed the House of Angostura to sell the bitters to sailors.

Another renowned aromatic bitters with nineteenth-century roots is Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters, originally developed by apothecary Antoine Amédée Peychaud in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is most commonly associated with the Sazerac cocktail.

A popular style of bitters that emerged from the period is orange bitters, the flavor of which ranges from dryly aromatic to fruity, and which is commonly made from the rinds of Seville oranges and spices. Orange bitters are often called for in older cocktail recipes. An early recipe for such bitters is in &quot;The English and Australian Cookery Book&quot;: &quot;Make your own bitters as follows, and we can vouch for their superiority. One ounce and a half of gentian-root, one ounce and a half of lemon-peel, one ounce and a half of orange-peel. Steep these ingredients for about a month in a quart of sherry, and then strain and bottle for use. Bitters are a fine stomachic, but they must be used with caution.&quot;

Bitters prepared from the tree bark containing the antimalarial quinine occasionally were included in historical cocktail recipes. It masked the medicine&#x27;s intensely bitter flavor. Trace quantities of quinine are still included as a flavoring in tonic water, which is used mostly in drinks with gin.

Pioneering mixologist Jerry Thomas was largely responsible for an increase in the popularity of bitters in the United States when he released &quot;How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant&#x27;s Companion&quot; in 1862.

==Digestive bitters==
Digestive bitters are typically consumed in many European and South American countries either neat or on the rocks at the end of a meal. Many, including popular Italian-style amaros and German-style Kräuterlikörs, are often used in cocktails as well.

Some notable examples of modern digestive bitters include:

*Alomo Bitters (Ghana, Nigeria)
*Amaro Averna (Caltanissetta, Italy)
*Amaro Lucano (Pisticci, Italy)
*Amaro Montenegro (Bologna, Italy)
*Amaro Ramazzotti (Asti, Italy)
*Amaro Sibilla (Marche, Italy)
*Aperol (Padova, Italy)
*Balsam (Eastern Europe)

==Cocktail bitters==
Cocktail bitters are used for flavoring cocktails in drops or dashes. In the United States, many cocktail bitters are classified as alcoholic non-beverage products (&quot;non-beverage&quot; meaning not consumed like a typical beverage). As alcoholic non-beverage products, they are often available from retailers who do not sell liquor, such as supermarkets in many US states.

Some notable examples of cocktail bitters include:
*Angostura bitters – originally from Venezuela in 1830, currently from Trinidad and Tobago
*Boker&#x27;s Bitters – called for in many cocktails in Jerry Thomas&#x27; drink guide, and essential to the Martinez cocktail
*Meinhard&#x27;s Bitters – a now-defunct bitter with Venezuelan origins
*Peychaud&#x27;s Bitters – originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, but now produced in Kentucky

* Gentian (spirit) – alcoholic drink
* Purl – alcoholic beverage
* Shrub (drink) – fruit liqueur or vinegared syrup cordial
* Swedish bitters – traditional herbal tonic

<text>Sharon Pollock, (19 April 1936 – 22 April 2021) was a Canadian playwright, actor, and director. She was Artistic Director of Theatre Calgary (1984), Theatre New Brunswick (1988–1990) and Performance Kitchen &amp; The Garry Theatre, the latter which she herself founded in 1992. In 2007, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Pollock was one of Canada&#x27;s most notable playwrights, and was a major part of the development of what is known today as Canadian Theatre.

==Early years==
Mary Sharon Chalmers was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on 19 April 1936, to Eloise and George Everett Chalmers. Her mother had been a nurse prior to marrying her father, a prominent local physician and political figure. Sharon was raised in a family and time when appearances and family ties were extremely important; although her mother knew her father was unfaithful to her, she refused to leave him. Sharon had a younger brother, Peter Chalmers, who was born 19 October 1937. When Sharon was younger her parents often took her and her brother on trips, including to Banff, Vancouver, and through the U.S. She had exposure to large scale American musical theatre as the family traveled to New York, where she saw popular musicals such as &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;

As a child, Pollock was not very interested in academics, but enjoyed reading, and at a young age developed a passion for history. She attended Charlotte Street Primary School and, for grades 9 and 10, Fredericton High School, where she was the president of the Drama Club. When she was in grade ten, she and a friend skipped school for three weeks straight to sneak into the local cinema and watch movies. When they were caught, Pollock&#x27;s father sent her to King&#x27;s Hall (Now Bishop&#x27;s College School), an Anglican private school, because he believed that if she could skip school for three weeks and still get good grades, then there was no way her schooling was challenging enough. At this young age Pollock and the same friend, Jane Hickman, created &quot;The Secret Two Club&quot;, for they both shared the desire to be writers, instead of housewives or teachers like the women around them. As well as her interest in drama and writing, Pollock was actively involved in the sports teams at King&#x27;s Hall and was editor of the school magazine.

In Pollock&#x27;s later teenage years her family began to fall apart. Her mother felt stifled in the role of housewife and was worn down by her husband&#x27;s constant unfaithfulness. Eloise Chalmers committed suicide in 1954, when Pollock was 18. The same year, Pollock enrolled in the general arts program at the University of New Brunswick (UNB), where she was also an active member of the Drama Society. She met her future husband, Ross Pollock, at UNB where he was in his fifth year of the environmental forestry program.

The young couple eloped, and by 1956 they had their first child, Jennifer. In the same year they moved to Toronto, where they lived for the next eight years. During this time, the couple had four more children, Kirk (1957), Melinda (1959), Lisa (1961) and Michele (1963).

Pollock joined a theatre group in Toronto, directing a handful of high school kids (1962–63). She referred to this directing stint as &quot;the blind leading the blind&quot;. 

Ross openly abused his wife; Pollock admits attempting to kill him by grinding up high hormone level birth control pills and putting the powder into his food. This attempt at murder was unsuccessful. In 1964, after another violent physical attack by her husband, Pollock left Ross and returned to Fredericton with her five children. She hoped to be with her family, but it was not as she had left it. Her father had remarried and had two more children with his new wife.

==Life in the theatre==

Pollock&#x27;s career in theatre began in 1964. When she returned to Fredericton, she arrived just in time for the new Beaverbrook Playhouse to open. She found a job running the Playhouse Box Office. At the Playhouse, she, along with some of the members from the UNB Drama Society, formed &quot;The Company of Ten&quot;, which performed six shows in the 1964–65 season, then dissolved the following year. During this time Pollock began dating fellow actor Michael Ball. 

Victor Mitchell had been starting up a Drama Department at the University of Calgary and offered Ball a position starting in January 1966.

Pollock followed Ball west, hoping that this move across Canada would allow her and her children the opportunity to start fresh, to leave the emotional baggage of her family behind her. 

The 1960s were a booming time in Canadian theatre. There were regional theatres and festivals popping up all over the country. After their move to Calgary, Pollock and Ball began touring with Mitchell&#x27;s theatre group The Prairie Players. They traveled around small towns in Alberta performing in any space they could find. If they were lucky, the troupe earned $35 a week. Shortly after, in 1967, Pollock joined the MAC 14 Theatre Society, which was the merge of The Musicians and Actors Club of Calgary and a theatre group called Workshop 14. The MAC 14 club was the founding company of Theatre Calgary. 

In this same year, Pollock&#x27;s sixth child, Amanda, was born to Pollock and Ball. The 60s and early 70s were not easy for Pollock and her family. They lived in barely acceptable living conditions, on an extremely scarce income. 

In about 1967–68 Pollock began writing plays. After having the opportunity to experience life as an actress, she wanted to see what it was like to be on the writing and production side of theatre. Her main motivation to write instead of perform was the lack of Canadian playwrights. In expressing her determination to write Canadian plays, she says, &quot;I wanted other actors to stand up and say my words, to speak directly through an experience I shared with those other Albertans and Canadians.&quot; Pollock was becoming frustrated with how even as an actor she rarely felt her voice was heard. She was tired of reproducing others&#x27; work and longed to hear a Canadian voice on stage. The way theatre was in those days, she felt that no one even wanted to hear a Canadian voice, or a Canadian story. Pollock&#x27;s first work was &quot;Split Seconds in the Death of&quot;, a radio play that was broadcast on CBC on 22 November 1970. These were the days of radio, when a radio play drew a bigger audience than a theatre did. Already in this first script Pollock is pushing the boundaries of the realist narrative. She followed this with two other Radioplays, &quot;31 for 2&quot; and &quot;We to the Gods&quot; both in 1971, all for CBC Radio.

==Career as a playwright==

In 1971, Pollock wrote her first full-length play, &quot;A Compulsory Option&quot;, a dark comedy about three men whose paranoia might be realistic. It premiered in 1972 and was the first production by Vancouver&#x27;s New Play Centre. It won an Alberta Culture playwriting competition. In November 1973 Pollock premiered her second full-length play &quot;Walsh&quot; at Theatre Calgary. In this play she dramatizes one of the most disturbing events in Canadian history, that of the injustices done to the Sioux Nation in 1877–1881. In &quot;Walsh&quot;, &quot;The Komagata Maru Incident&quot; and &quot;One Tiger to a Hill&quot;, Pollock examines historic events and tells them in a way that causes the audience to question the reality between the official story and what is shown on stage.

Throughout her career Pollock continued to use history, that of Canada, such as in &quot;Whiskey Six Cadenza&quot; (1983), &quot;Fair Liberty&#x27;s Call&quot; (1993), or &quot;End Dream&quot; (2000); as well as her own personal history in plays such as &quot;Generations&quot; (1980), or &quot;Doc&quot; (1984) as fuel for her plays.

&quot;Blood Relations&quot; (1980) is one of Pollock&#x27;s most well known and influential plays. It premiered at Theatre Three in Edmonton on 12 March 1980. Originally written as &quot;My Name Is Lisbeth&quot; which premiered at Douglas College, &quot;Blood Relations&quot; is the story of Lizzie Borden, based on historical facts. Borden supposedly murdered her father and stepmother. Pollock explores the meaning of the effect that it would have on the community if Lizzie Borden was in fact a murderer. While the play does touch on feminist issues, Pollock was criticized for making it less of a feminist play and more of a general political play.

Throughout Pollock&#x27;s playwright career, her strong opinions about Canadian theatre motivated her to create a theatre of her own. She hoped to create a place for artistic talent to flourish and provide diversity. She wanted the Garry Theatre to be &#x27;created by artists for artists.&#x27;

The Garry Theatre opened in 1995 in the lower income area of Calgary. Pollock was so passionate about theatre that she was adamant that The Garry not pay her royalties. She wanted people from all walks of life to have the opportunity to experience theatre; if people could not afford tickets, they were still invited to view the plays. Prior to the opening of the Garry Theatre, Pollock worked as the artistic director at Theatre Calgary in 1984 and 1985 as well at Theatre New Brunswick in 1988. She left both of these jobs because of a difference of opinions. She strongly disagreed with the &#x27;institutionalization&#x27; of the theatre and the direction it was heading.

Pollock later wrote for the Atlantic Ballet Company. In March 2011 she made her musical theatre debut with Calgary&#x27;s Verb Theatre and their production of Ron Chambers&#x27; acclaimed play &quot;Marg Szkaluba (Pissy&#x27;s Wife)&quot;. In a four star review &quot;The Calgary Sun&quot; wrote, &quot;...So controlled and carefully delineated is Pollock&#x27;s performance that she truly does become this remarkable woman who languished far too long under the belief she was unintelligent, unattractive and undeserving.&quot;

<doc id="291829" wikidata="Q1499557" url="?curid=291829" title="Cash conversion cycle">
<text>In management accounting, the Cash conversion cycle (CCC) measures how long a firm will be deprived of cash if it increases its investment in inventory in order to expand customer sales. It is thus a measure of the liquidity risk entailed by growth. However, shortening the CCC creates its own risks: while a firm could even achieve a negative CCC by collecting from customers before paying suppliers, a policy of strict collections and lax payments is not always sustainable.

==Definition==
&quot;CCC&quot; is days between &quot;disbursing cash&quot; and &quot;collecting cash&quot; in connection with undertaking a discrete unit of operations.

==Derivation==
Cashflows insufficient. The term &quot;Cash Conversion Cycle&quot; refers to the timespan between a firm&#x27;s disbursing and collecting cash. However, the CCC cannot be directly observed in cashflows, because these are also influenced by investment and financing activities; it must be derived from Statement of Financial Position data associated with the firm&#x27;s operations.

Equation describes retailer. Although the term &quot;cash conversion cycle&quot; technically applies to a firm in any industry, the equation is generically formulated to apply specifically to a retailer. Since a retailer&#x27;s operations consist of buying and selling inventory, the equation models the time between
::(1) disbursing cash to satisfy the accounts payable created by purchase of inventory, and
::(2) collecting cash to satisfy the accounts receivable generated by that sale.

Equation describes a firm that buys and sells on account. Also, the equation is written to accommodate a firm that &quot;buys and sells on account&quot;. For a &quot;cash-only firm&quot;, the equation would only need data from sales operations (e.g. changes in inventory), because &quot;disbursing cash&quot; would be directly measurable as &quot;purchase of inventory&quot;, and &quot;collecting cash&quot; would be directly measurable as &quot;sale of inventory&quot;. However, no such 1:1 correspondence exists for a firm that &quot;buys and sells on account&quot;: Increases and decreases in inventory do not occasion cashflows but accounting vehicles (payables and receivables, respectively); increases and decreases in cash will remove these accounting vehicles (receivables and payables, respectively) from the books. Thus, the CCC must be calculated by tracing a change in cash through its effect upon receivables, inventory, payables, and finally back to cash—thus, the term &quot;cash conversion cycle&quot;, and the observation that these four accounts &quot;articulate&quot; with one another.

Taking these four transactions in pairs, analysts draw attention to five important intervals, referred to as conversion cycles (or conversion periods):
*the Cash conversion cycle emerges as interval C→D (i.e. &quot;disbursing cash&quot;→&quot;collecting cash&quot;).
*the Payables conversion period (or &quot;Days payables outstanding&quot;) emerges as interval A→C (i.e. &quot;owing cash&quot;→&quot;disbursing cash&quot;)
*the Operating cycle emerges as interval A→D (i.e. owing cash→collecting cash)
**the Inventory conversion period or &quot;Days inventory outstanding&quot; emerges as interval A→B (i.e. &quot;owing cash&quot;→&quot;being owed cash&quot;)
**the Receivables conversion period (or &quot;Days sales outstanding&quot;) emerges as interval B→D (i.e.&quot;being owed cash&quot;→&quot;collecting cash&quot;)

Knowledge of any three of these conversion cycles permits derivation of the fourth (leaving aside the &quot;operating cycle&quot;, which is just the sum of the &quot;inventory conversion period&quot; and the &quot;receivables conversion period&quot;.)

Hence,

In calculating each of these three constituent conversion cycles, the equation Time = Level/Rate is used (since each interval roughly equals the Time needed for its Level to be achieved at its corresponding Rate).
*Its LEVEL &quot;during the period in question&quot; is estimated as the average of its levels in the two balance-sheets that surround the period: (Lt1+Lt2)/2.
*To estimate its Rate, note that Accounts Receivable grows only when revenue is accrued; and Inventory shrinks and Accounts Payable grows by an amount equal to the COGS expense (in the long run, since COGS actually accrues sometime after the inventory delivery, when the customers acquire it).
**Payables conversion period: Rate = [inventory increase + COGS], since these are the items for the period that can increase &quot;trade accounts payables,&quot; i.e. the ones that grew its inventory.
**:An exception is made when calculating this interval: although a period average for the Level of inventory is used, any increase in inventory contributes to its Rate of change. This is because the purpose of the CCC is to measure the effects of inventory growth on cash outlays. If inventory grew during the period, this would be important to know. 
**Inventory conversion period: Rate = COGS, since this is the item that (eventually) shrinks inventory.
**Receivables conversion period: Rate = revenue, since this is the item that can grow receivables (sales).

==Aims==
The aim of studying cash conversion cycle and its calculation is to change the policies relating to credit purchase and credit sales. The standard of payment of credit purchase or getting cash from debtors can be changed on the basis of reports of cash conversion cycle. If it tells good cash liquidity position, past credit policies can be maintained. Its aim is also to study cash flow of business. Cash flow statement and cash conversion cycle study will be helpful for cash flow analysis. The CCC readings can be compared among different companies in the same industry segment to evaluate the quality of cash management.

<doc id="291836" wikidata="Q3176929" url="?curid=291836" title="Thomas Eagleton">
<text>Thomas Francis Eagleton (September 4, 1929 – March 4, 2007) was an American lawyer who served as a United States senator from Missouri from 1968 to 1987. He was briefly the Democratic vice presidential nominee under George McGovern in 1972. He suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life, resulting in several hospitalizations, which were kept secret from the public. When they were revealed, it humiliated the McGovern campaign, and Eagleton was forced to quit the race. He later became adjunct professor of public affairs at Washington University in St. Louis.

==Early life and political career==
Eagleton was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Zitta Louise (Swanson) and Mark David Eagleton, a politician who had run for mayor. His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his mother had Swedish, Irish, French, and Austrian ancestry.

Eagleton graduated from St. Louis Country Day School, served in the U.S. Navy for two years, and graduated in 1950 from Amherst College, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma chapter). He then attended Harvard Law School. After graduating in 1953, Eagleton practiced law at his father&#x27;s firm and later became associated with Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s legal department.

Eagleton married Barbara Ann Smith of St. Louis on January 26, 1956. A son, Terence, was born in 1959, and a daughter, Christin, in 1963. He was elected circuit attorney of the City of St. Louis in 1956. During his tenure, he appeared on the TV show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (episode #355) as &quot;District Attorney of St. Louis&quot;. (He stumped the panel.) He was elected Missouri Attorney General in 1960 at age 31 (the youngest in the state&#x27;s history). He was elected the 38th lieutenant governor of Missouri in 1964, and won a U.S. Senate seat in 1968, unseating incumbent Edward V. Long in the Democratic primary and narrowly defeating Congressman Thomas B. Curtis in the general election.

Eagleton suffered from depression; he checked himself into hospital three times between 1960 and 1966 for physical and nervous exhaustion, receiving electroconvulsive therapy (shock therapy) twice. He later received a diagnosis of bipolar II from Frederick K. Goodwin.

The hospitalizations, which were not widely publicized, had little effect on his political aspirations. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; noted in 1972, immediately after Eagleton&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination: &quot;He had been troubled with gastric disturbances, which led to occasional hospitalizations. The stomach troubles have contributed to rumors that he had a drinking problem.&quot;

==1972 vice-presidential candidacy==
===&quot;Amnesty, abortion, and acid&quot;===
On April 25, 1972, as George McGovern won the Massachusetts Democratic primary, conservative journalist Robert Novak phoned Democratic politicians around the country. On April 27, 1972, Novak reported in a column his conversation with an unnamed Democratic senator about McGovern. Novak quoted the senator as saying: The people don&#x27;t know McGovern is for amnesty for draft dodgers, abortion, and legalization of pot. Once middle America—Catholic middle America, in particular—finds this out, he&#x27;s dead. Because of the column McGovern became known as the candidate of &quot;amnesty, abortion, and acid&quot;, even though he only supported the decriminalization of marijuana and maintained that legalized abortion fell under the purview of states&#x27; rights.

On July 15, 2007, several months after Eagleton&#x27;s death, Novak said on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that the unnamed senator was Eagleton. Novak was accused in 1972 of manufacturing the quote, but said that to rebut the criticism, he took Eagleton to lunch after the campaign and asked whether he could identify him as the source; Eagleton refused. &quot;Oh, he had to run for reelection&quot;, Novak said. &quot;The McGovernites would kill him if they knew he had said that.&quot; Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton never would have been selected as McGovern&#x27;s running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote. &quot;Boy, do I wish he would have let you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president,&quot; said Shrum. &quot;Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him—were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton was one of the great train wrecks of all time.&quot;

===Selection as vice-presidential nominee===
After a large number of prominent Democrats declined to be McGovern&#x27;s running mate, Senator Gaylord Nelson (who was among those who declined) suggested Eagleton. McGovern chose Eagleton after only a minimal background check, as was customary for vice-presidential selections at the time. Eagleton did not mention his hospitalizations, and in fact decided with his wife to keep them secret from McGovern while he was flying to his first meeting with McGovern.

===Replacement on the ticket===
On July 25, 1972, just over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, Eagleton said that news reports that he had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s were true. McGovern initially said he would back Eagleton &quot;1,000 percent&quot;. McGovern consulted confidentially with preeminent psychiatrists, including Eagleton&#x27;s doctors, who advised him that a recurrence of Eagleton&#x27;s depression was possible and could endanger the country should Eagleton become acting president. On August 1, nineteen days after being nominated, Eagleton withdrew at McGovern&#x27;s request, and after a new search by McGovern, was replaced by Sargent Shriver, former U.S. Ambassador to France, and former (founding) director of the Peace Corps and the Office of Economic Opportunity.

A &quot;Time&quot; poll taken at the time found that 77% of the respondents said &quot;Eagleton&#x27;s medical record would not affect their vote.&quot; Nonetheless, the press made frequent references to his &quot;shock therapy&quot;, and McGovern feared that this would detract from his campaign platform.

McGovern&#x27;s failure to vet Eagleton and his subsequent handling of the controversy gave occasion for the Republican campaign to raise serious questions about his judgment. In the general election, the Democratic ticket won only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.

==Continued Senate career==
Eagleton was reelected to the Senate in 1974 with 60% of the vote against Thomas B. Curtis, who had been his opponent in 1968. In 1980, he was reelected by a closer-than-expected margin over St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary.

During the 1980 election, Eagleton&#x27;s niece Elizabeth Eagleton Weigand and lawyer Stephen Poludniak were arrested for blackmail after they threatened to spread false accusations that Eagleton was bisexual. Eagleton told reporters that the extorted money was to be turned over to the Church of Scientology. Weigand appealed her conviction, arguing that her trial should have been moved out of St. Louis because of extensive publicity that might have prejudiced jurors. The U.S. Supreme Court declined her appeal in 1982.

Eagleton did not seek a fourth term in 1986. Former Republican Governor Kit Bond succeeded him in the Senate.

==Senate career==
In the Senate, Eagleton was active in matters dealing with foreign relations, intelligence, defense, education, health care, and the environment. He was instrumental to the Senate&#x27;s passage of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, and sponsored the amendment that halted the bombing in Cambodia and effectively ended American involvement in the Vietnam War.

Notably, Eagleton was one of only three senators to oppose the nomination of Gerald Ford as vice president in 1973. The other two senators were William Hathaway of Maine and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin.

Eagleton was involved in the unsuccessful attempt to pass the Human Life Amendment, a series of proposals to amend the United States Constitution with the effect of overturning the Supreme Court 1973 decision &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which ruled that abortion bans were unconstitutional. The version of the Human Life Amendment in which Eagleton was most involved, the Hatch-Eagleton Human Life Federalism Amendment, was the only one to receive a formal vote in the Senate.

==Post-Senate career==
In January 1987, Eagleton returned to Missouri as an attorney, political commentator, and professor at Washington University in St. Louis, where until his death he was professor of public affairs. Throughout his Washington University career, Eagleton taught courses in economics with former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors Murray Weidenbaum and with history professor Henry W. Berger on the Vietnam War.

On July 23, 1996, Eagleton delivered a warm introductory speech for McGovern during a promotional tour for McGovern&#x27;s book &quot;Terry: My Daughter&#x27;s Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism&quot; at The Library, Ltd., in St. Louis. At that time, McGovern spoke favorably about Eagleton and reminisced about their short-lived presidential ticket.

During the 2000s, Eagleton served on the Council of Elders for the George and Eleanor McGovern Center for Leadership and Public Service at Dakota Wesleyan University.

In January 2001, he joined other Missouri Democrats to oppose the nomination of former governor and senator John Ashcroft for United States Attorney General. Eagleton was quoted in the official Judiciary Committee record: &quot;John Danforth would have been my first choice. John Ashcroft would have been my last choice.&quot;

In 2005 and 2006, he co-taught a seminar on the U.S. presidency and the Constitution with Joel Goldstein at Saint Louis University School of Law. He was also a partner in the St. Louis law firm Thompson Coburn and a chief negotiator for a coalition of local business interests that lured the Los Angeles Rams football team to St. Louis. Eagleton authored three books on politics. He strongly supported Democratic Senate nominee Claire McCaskill in 2006; McCaskill defeated incumbent Jim Talent.

Eagleton led a group, Catholics for Amendment 2, composed of prominent Catholics who challenged church leaders&#x27; opposition to embryonic stem cell research and supported a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have protected such research in Missouri. The group emailed a letter to fellow Catholics explaining reasons for supporting Amendment 2. The amendment ensures that any federally approved stem cell research and treatments would be available in Missouri. &quot;[T]he letter from Catholics for Amendment 2 said the group felt a moral obligation to respond to what it called misinformation, scare tactics and distortions being spread by opponents of the initiative, including the church.&quot;

Eagleton died in St. Louis on March 4, 2007, of heart and respiratory complications. He donated his body to medical science at Washington University. He wrote a farewell letter to his family and friends months before he died, saying that his dying wishes were for people to &quot;go forth in love and peace—be kind to dogs—and vote Democratic&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
Eagleton threw out the ceremonial first pitch to end the pregame ceremonies of Game 5 of the 1985 World Series.

The 8th Circuit federal courthouse in St. Louis is named after Eagleton. Dedicated on September 11, 2000, it is named the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse.

Eagleton has been honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
Eagleton was a Roman Catholic. He strongly opposed abortion despite his reputation as a liberal. His religion was one of the defining factors of his political career, as religion was an important political issue in Missouri. Eagleton&#x27;s Catholicism increased his appeal to the working class of St. Louis and offset the &quot;elitist stigma&quot; of his private school education. At the same time, Missouri&#x27;s suburbs were staunchly anti-Catholic, which proved a challenge during the 1960 election.

Eagleton believed the Catholic Church was &quot;a vital part of American life, conscience and thought&quot;. He described himself as &quot;a Pope John XXIII and an Archbishop John L. May Catholic&quot;, and considered these two figures his religious mentors. Because of his religion and youth, Eagleton was often compared to John F. Kennedy; in 1972, the &quot;St. Louis Post Dispatch&quot; wrote: &quot;With his good looks, style, youth, liberal views and Catholic religion, Eagleton is the closest thing to a Kennedy Missouri has to offer&quot;. In his 2006 farewell letter, Eagleton wrote: &quot;In the era of a Christian right, we seem to have merged God&#x27;s power into political power&quot;.

Eagleton married Barbara Ann Smith Eagleton in 1956, and the couple had two children together, a son and a daughter. Eagleton was survived by his wife and their children.

<text>In medicine, a catheter ( ) is a thin tube made from medical grade materials serving a broad range of functions. Catheters are medical devices that can be inserted in the body to treat diseases or perform a surgical procedure. Catheters are manufactured for specific applications, such as cardiovascular, urological, gastrointestinal, neurovascular and ophthalmic procedures. The process of inserting a catheter is called &quot;catheterization&quot;.

In most uses, a catheter is a thin, flexible tube (&quot;soft&quot; catheter) though catheters are available in varying levels of stiffness depending on the application. A catheter left inside the body, either temporarily or permanently, may be referred to as an &quot;indwelling catheter&quot; (for example, a peripherally inserted central catheter). A permanently inserted catheter may be referred to as a &quot;permcath&quot; (originally a trademark).

Catheters can be inserted into a body cavity, duct, or vessel, brain, skin or adipose tissue. Functionally, they allow drainage, administration of fluids or gases, access by surgical instruments, and also perform a wide variety of other tasks depending on the type of catheter. Special types of catheters, also called probes, are used in preclinical or clinical research for sampling of lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds, protein-bound and unbound drugs, neurotransmitters, peptides and proteins, antibodies, nanoparticles and nanocarriers, enzymes and vesicles.

==Etymology==
&quot;Catheter&quot; (from Greek &quot;kathetḗr&quot;) comes from the Greek verb &quot;kathíemai&quot;, meaning &quot;to thrust into&quot; or &quot;to send down&quot; because the catheter allowed fluid to be &quot;sent down&quot; from the body.

==Uses==

Placement of a catheter into a particular part of the body may allow:
* Draining urine from the urinary bladder as in urinary catheterization, using intermittent catheters or Foley catheter inserted through urethra. When the urethra is damaged, suprapubic catheterisation is used instead. The suprapubic catheter is inserted through the lower part of the abdomen directly into the urinary bladder.
* drainage of urine from the kidney by percutaneous (through the skin) nephrostomy
* drainage of fluid collections, e.g. an abdominal abscess
* pigtail catheter: used to drain air from around the lung (pneumothorax)
* administration of intravenous fluids, medication or parenteral nutrition with a peripheral venous catheter or central venous catheter
* angioplasty, angiography, balloon septostomy, balloon sinuplasty, cardiac electrophysiology testing, catheter ablation. Often the Seldinger technique is used.
* direct measurement of blood pressure in an artery or vein
* direct measurement of intracranial pressure
* administration of anaesthetic medication into the epidural space, the subarachnoid space, or around a major nerve bundle such as the brachial plexus
* transfer of fertilized embryos, from in vitro fertilization, or sperm, during artificial insemination, into the uterus
* administration of oxygen, volatile anesthetic agents, and other breathing gases into the lungs using a tracheal tube
* subcutaneous administration of insulin or other medications, with the use of an infusion set and insulin pump

==History==
===Ancient inventors===

Ancient Chinese used onion stalks, the Romans, Hindus, and Greeks used tubes of wood or precious metals.

The ancient Egyptians created catheters from reeds.

===Modern===
The earliest invention of the flexible catheter was during the 18th century. Extending his inventiveness to his family&#x27;s medical problems, Benjamin Franklin invented the flexible catheter in 1752 when his brother John suffered from bladder stones. Franklin&#x27;s catheter was made of metal with segments hinged together with a wire enclosed to provide rigidity during insertion.

According to a footnote in his letter in Volume 4 of the Papers of Benjamin Franklin (1959), Franklin credits Francesco Roncelli-Pardino from 1720 as the inventor of a flexible catheter. In fact, Franklin claims the flexible catheter may have been designed even earlier.

An early modern application of the catheter was employed by Claude Bernard for the purpose of cardiac catheterization in 1844. The procedure involved entering a horse&#x27;s ventricles via the jugular vein and carotid artery.

In 1929, Werner Forssman first performed central venous catheterization, work which led to the development of cardiac catherization as a treatment, for which he, André F. Cournand and Dickinson W. Richards would win the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1959. Central venous catheterization allows for continuous administration of medications, fluids and blood products to a large vein, particularly in critically ill patients. Cardiac catheterization is the insertion of a catheter into one of the chambers of the heart, which is used for imaging, diagnosis, and the placement of devices such as stents.

David S. Sheridan invented the modern disposable catheter in the 1940s. Prior to this, some reusable catheters consisted of braided cotton tubes, which were varnished, heat-treated and polished. As these were primarily produced in France, the advent of World War II threatened the supply chain. Sheridan was dubbed the &quot;Catheter King&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 1988. He also invented the modern &quot;disposable&quot; plastic endotracheal tube now used routinely in surgery.

Other reusable catheters consisted of red rubber tubes. Although sterilized prior to reuse, they still posed a high risk of infection and often led to the spread of disease. 

To prevent clotting, catheters that are not in use may be filled with catheter lock solution.

==Materials==
===Urinary catheters===
A range of polymers are used for the construction of catheters, including silicone rubber, nylon, polyurethane, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), latex, and thermoplastic elastomers. Silicone is one of the most common implantable choice because it is inert and unreactive to body fluids and a range of medical fluids with which it might come into contact. On the other hand, the polymer is weak mechanically, and a number of serious fractures have occurred in catheters. For example, silicone is used in Foley catheters where fractures have been reported, often requiring surgery to remove the tip left in the bladder.

===Catheters used in interventional procedures===
Depending on the mechanical characteristics required, assorted polymers and polymer-metal composites can be used to build catheters used for interventional purposes. Common materials include polyamide (nylon), polyether block amide, polyuerathane, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyimides. These materials are often used in combination with each other and are frequently layered on top of stainless steel braiding, laser-cut stainless steel tubing, or other scaffold-like structures to impart desirable handling characteristics to the catheter, all dependent on the intended application. For example, the materials and the architectures used to manufacture vascular catheters for neurological applications might differ significantly from catheters destined for cardiovascular use. 

Guiding catheters (catheters that guides angioplasty balloons and stents) is made up of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) innermost layer which is lubricious, followed by stainless steel braid wire outer layer which helps to provide support for the catheter and prevent kinking while travelling through blood vessels, and Nylon elastomer outermost layer which provides extra support for the catheter and preserve the curvature of the catheter while passing through tortuous vessels.

To enhance ease of insertion, some catheters have a lubricious surface coating to lessen friction. A lubricious coating creates a smooth, slippery film making the catheter easier to insert.

==Interventional procedures==
===Diagnostic catheters===
There are various catheters used in angiography procedures. Diagnostic catheters direct wires through blood vessels. Radiocontrast agent is then injected through the catheter to visualise the vessels via various imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), projectional radiography, and fluoroscopy. Pigtail catheter is a non-selective catheter with multiple side holes that can deliver large volumes of contrast into a blood vessel for imaging purposes. Cobra catheter is a selective catheter used to catheterise downgoing vessels in the abdomen. Cobra catheters move forward by pushing and are removed by pulling. Sidewinder catheter is a selective catheter is used to navigate the aorta. Headhunter, Newton, Simmons, Bentson, and Berenstein catheters are used to navigate the into one of the three branches of the arch of aorta. Yashiro Catheter is a selective, hydrophilic catheter designed for optimal entry into celiac trunk. Whereas endothelial cell sampling through endovascular sampling with coils, stents, stent retrievers, or guidewires suffer from poor selectivity and a low or highly variable cell yield, a micro-3D-printed device adapted for endovascular techniques can harvest endothelial cells for transcriptomic analysis.

===Balloon catheters===

There are also balloon catheters used in angioplasty procedures such as plain balloon catheters that is useful in passing tight vessel stenosis, drug coated balloons that contains paclitaxel on the surface to prevent smooth muscle cells proliferation of the vessel walls, thus reducing the likehood of vessel blockage in the future, high pressure balloons that can open stubborn vessel stenoses in veins and arteriovenous fistula, and cutting balloon angioplasty that contains 3 to 4 small blades on its surface (endotomes) that helps to control the distribution of balloon dilatation more uniformly and cut through resistant stenosis due to fibrous scar tissue.

===Dialysis catheters===

There is no difference in achieving adequacy of blood flow, period of catheter usage, infection, and thromboembolism risk whether the dialysis catheter has step-tip, split-tip, or symmetrical tip. Palidrome catheter is superior to Permcath catheter in terms of maximum blood flow, dialysis adequacy, and annual patency rate. Similar to Permcath, Palidrome catheter has high infection and thromboembolism rate.

==Adverse effects==
In interventional procedures, Teflon catheters (which are hydrophobic) have higher risk of thrombus formation when compared to polyurethene catheters. The longer the duration of the catheter left inside the body, the higher the risk of thrombus formation. Larger catheters increase the risk of thrombus formation around the catheter, because they can block the flow of blood.

&quot;Any foreign object in the body carries an infection risk, and a catheter can serve as a superhighway for bacteria to enter the bloodstream or body&quot;, according to Milisa Manojlovich, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing.

Catheters can be difficult to clean, and therefore harbor antibiotic resistant or otherwise pathogenic bacteria.

<text>Stockholm Pride (styled as STHLM Pride) is an annual LGBT pride festival held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Since the start in 1998, Stockholm Pride has grown. In 2014, some 60,000 participated and 600,000 followed the parade at the streets.

The celebrations normally starts with lectures and exhibitions all over the city on the Monday. Pride House is the festival&#x27;s cultural centre. It is packed with seminars, debates, workshops, exhibitions, film, theatre and other performances.

On the Wednesday it&#x27;s the grand opening of the closed off Pride Park which is the festival arena for tens of thousands of people, and in the park organisation stalls, stages, restaurants, shops, and other attractions are built. Pride Park is open Wednesday through Sunday and every afternoon and evening a wide variety of famous artists and shows appear on the main stage.

Also outside the official Pride Park, there is a green and leafy area where people join up, drink, listen to the music and party into the warm summer night.

Many people have been out on the streets of Stockholm, enjoying the parade that ends in the park.

In addition to the official Stockholm Pride events, the week is noticeable elsewhere in the city. Many of the gay clubs have their own events and themed nights, one of these is Mr Gay Sweden.

<doc id="291844" wikidata="Q550182" url="?curid=291844" title="Shingon Buddhism">
<text>is one of the major schools of Buddhism in Japan and one of the few surviving Vajrayana lineages in East Asian Buddhism. It is a form of Japanese Esoteric Buddhism and is sometimes called &quot;Tōmitsu&quot; (東密 lit. &quot;Esoteric [Buddhism] of Tō-ji&quot;). The word &quot;shingon&quot; is the Japanese reading of the Chinese word (&quot;&quot;), which is the translation of the Sanskrit word mantra.

The Zhēnyán lineage was founded in China (c. 7th–8th centuries) by Indian vajrācāryas (esoteric masters) like Śubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra. These esoteric teachings would later flourish in Japan under the auspices of a Buddhist monk named Kūkai (, 774–835), who traveled to Tang China and received these esoteric transmissions from a Chinese master named Huiguo (746–805). Kūkai established his tradition at Mount Kōya (in Wakayama Prefecture), which remains the central pilgrimage center of Shingon Buddhism. 

The practice of the Shingon school stresses that one is able to attain &quot;buddhahood in this very body&quot; (&quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot;) through its practices, especially those which make use of the &quot;three mysteries&quot; (Jp: &quot;sanmi&quot; 三密) of mudra, mantra and mandala. Another influential doctrine introduced by Shingon was the idea that all beings are originally enlightened, a doctrine that was known as &quot;hongaku&quot;. 

The Shingon school&#x27;s teachings and rituals had an influence on other Japanese traditions, especially those of the Tendai school, as well as Shugendo and Shinto. Its teachings also influenced the ritual repertoire of Japanese Zen, including Soto Zen (through the monk Keizan). Shingon Buddhism also influenced broader Japanese culture, including medieval Japanese aesthetics, art, and craftsmanship. 

== History ==
Shingon Buddhism was founded in the Heian period (794–1185) by a Japanese Buddhist monk named Kūkai (774–835 CE) who traveled to China in 804 to study Esoteric Buddhist practices in the city of Xi&#x27;an (), then called Chang-an, at Qinglong Temple () under Huiguo, a student of the Indian esoteric master Amoghavajra. Kūkai returned to Japan with the teachings and scriptures of Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and founded a new tradition of Japanese Buddhism that became immediately influential with the island&#x27;s elites. Shingon followers usually refer to Kūkai as or , the posthumous name given to him years after his death by Emperor Daigo.

=== Kūkai&#x27;s early days and visit to China ===
Kūkai was born to a family of the aristocratic Saeki clan in Shikoku and received a classical Confucian education at Kyoto&#x27;s college (daigaku). He converted to Buddhism in his 20s and was inspired to practice asceticism in the mountains and wander the countryside as an ascetic hermit (though he also visited cities to study texts). During this time his main meditation was the mantra of bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha found in the &quot;Kokūzō-gumonji no hō&quot; (&quot;Ākāśagarbha Memory-Retention Practice&quot;, Taisho no.1145). While he was practicing in the mountains, he had a vision of the bodhisattva flying at him.

During this early period of intense study, prayer and practice, Kūkai sought the highest truth to be found in Buddhism. One day he dreamt of a man telling him to seek out the &quot;Mahavairocana Sutra&quot;. He was able to obtain a copy in Chinese (and Sanskrit) but large portions of the text were undecipherable to him and thus he decided to go to China to find someone who could explain it to him.

In 804, Kūkai set sail on a fleet of four ships to China. The future Tendai founder Saichō was on the same fleet. When Kūkai first met Huiguo (a student of Amoghavajra) on the fifth month of 805, Huiguo was sixty and on the verge of death. Huiguo exclaimed to Kūkai that he had been waiting for him and immediately initiated him into the esoteric mandalas. In the short space of three months, Huiguo initiated and taught Kūkai everything he knew on the doctrines and practices of esoteric Buddhism. During this time Kūkai also learned Sanskrit from some Indian masters living in China. 

=== Kūkai&#x27;s return ===
Kūkai returned to Japan after Huiguo&#x27;s death in 806. He brought back numerous Buddhist texts, mandalas, ritual items and other books. After returning, Kūkai asked the imperial court for permission to establish a new Buddhist school and waited three years for a response in Kyushu. In 809 Kūkai was allowed to reside at a temple near Kyoto known as Takaosanji (now Jingo-ji). This temple would become his major center of operations near the capital. Kūkai&#x27;s fortunes rose steadily when Emperor Saga became his patron and Kūkai was appointed as the head of Todai-ji in 810. Kūkai began to give esoteric initiations (abhiseka) at this time, including to elite laymen and to Saicho and his students. He also began to organize a new school of esoteric Buddhism centered around Jingo-ji and wrote some key works which outlined the main teachings of Shingon. 

In 818, Kūkai asked emperor Saga to grant him , in present-day Wakayama province, so that he could establish a true monastic center away from the disturbances of the capital and this was soon granted. Kūkai and his disciples soon began to build the new monastic complex, which they imagined and modeled on the two mandalas, the womb and vajra. This mountain center soon became the key center for Shingon study and practice. In his later life, Kūkai continued to actively promote the efficacy of Shingon ritual among the elite even while also working to build Kōyasan into a major center. Kūkai eventually achieved control of Tō-ji for the Shingon school, which was a major temple within the capital. His final request before his death in 832 was to construct a Shingon hall in Imperial palace grounds in order to accommodate the practice of the seven day ritual of chanting the &quot;Sutra of Golden Light.&quot; His request was eventually granted, a year after his death&quot;.&quot;

=== After Kūkai ===
After Kūkai, the main Shingon temples were taken over by key disciples like Jitsue, Shinzen, Shinzai, Eon and Shōhō. The main leadership after his death was Shinnen (804–891) and already at this time there was some conflict between Tō-ji and Kōyasan. Some Shingon monks also followed in Kūkai&#x27;s footsteps and visited China to receive more teachings and texts. Likewise, several Tendai monks also visited China and brought back esoteric teachings, making Tendai esotericism a major competitor to Shingon. 

Under Kangen (853–925), Tō-ji temple rose to become the head temple of Shingon. Mount Kōya experienced a period of decline afterwards, until it recovered in the 11th century through the support of Fujiwara clan nobles like Fujiwara no Michinaga. 

Shingon Buddhism enjoyed immense popularity during the Heian period (), particularly among the nobility, and contributed greatly to the art and literature of the time, influencing other communities such as the Tendai school. 

During the late Heian, Pure Land Buddhism was becoming very popular and Shingon was also influenced by this popular devotional trend. Mount Kōya soon became the center for groups of wandering holy men called Kōya Hijiri&quot;,&quot; who merged Pure Land practices focused on Amida Buddha with devotion to Kūkai and were also involved in raising funds for the rebuilding of many temples. Kōya-san soon became a major center for pilgrimage for all Japanese. 

The Shingon monk Kakuban (1095–1143) was one Shingon scholar who responded to the rise in Pure Land devotionalism. He studied Shingon along with Tendai and also incorporated Pure Land practice into his Shingon system, as well as promoting an esoteric interpretation of nembutsu and Pure Land. Unlike other Pure Land schools, Kakuban held that the Pure Land exists in this very world and he also taught that Vairocana is Amida.

Kakuban, and his faction of priests centered at the soon came into conflict with the leadership at Kongōbu-ji, the head temple at Mount Kōya. Through his connections with high-ranking nobles in Kyoto, Kakuban was appointed abbot of Mount Kōya. The leadership at Kongōbu-ji opposed him and after several conflicts (some of which involved the burning down of temples of Kakuban&#x27;s faction), Kakuban&#x27;s group left the mountain for Mount Negoro to the northwest, where they constructed a new temple complex now known as .

After the death of Kakuban in 1143, attempts to make peace were unsuccessful and after further conflicts, the Negoro faction (led by Raiyu) founded the new Shingi Shingon School based on Kakuban&#x27;s teachings. As such, Shingon became divided into two major sub-schools, , and . Over time, the two Shingon sub-schools also diverged doctrinally on such issues as the attainment of buddhahood through a single mantra and the theory of how the Dharmakāya teaches the Dharma.

Following in Kakuban&#x27;s footsteps, the Koyasan monk Dōhan 道範 (1179–1252) has been seen as a key figure in the promotion of what has been called an “esoteric Pure Land culture”, a Shingon variety of Pure Land Buddhism that became very popular during this period and influenced other figures and schools like Eison of Saidaiji&#x27;s Shingon Risshu. This esoteric pure land culture included esoteric uses and interpretations of the nembutsu along with the popularization and use of the Mantra of Light.

During the Heian period, the adoption of Shinto deities into Buddhism became popular, something that became known as &quot;Shinbutsu-shūgō&quot; (神仏習合, &quot;syncretism of kami and buddhas&quot;). This movement saw local Japanese deities as manifestations of the Buddhas. For example Amaterasu was seen as an emanation of Vairocana in Shingon. This emanation theory was called honji suijaku by Buddhists. Major Shingon centers participated in this development, with key deities like Hachiman being worshipped at temples like Tō-ji for example.

Also during the Heian period, the syncretic religion of Shugendō started to develop and the influence of Shingon was one major element in its development. Shingon was especially influential on the Tōzan branch of Shugendō. which was centered on Mount Kinbu.

=== Kamakura to Sengoku period ===
The Kamakura period (1185 to 1333) saw the rise of another new Shingon tradition, the Shingon-risshū school. This new tradition stressed the importance of keeping the monastic Vinaya, along with esoteric practice. It was promoted by figures like Shunjō (1166–1227) and Eison (叡尊 1201–1290) and centered around Saidai-ji. Ninshō carried on the work of this tradition, which was known for its many public works projects, including building hospitals, hostels for the poor and animal sanctuaries. 

Also during this period, many followers of the Ji sect founded by Ippen (1234–1289) made Kōya-san their home, joining with the Kōya hiriji groups, and many halls for Amida centered Pure Land practice were built on the mountain.

During the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573), the Shingon schools continued to develop, some under the support of elite families or even emperors, like Go-Uda (1267–1324), who entered the priesthood at Tō-ji and helped revitalize the temple as well as Daikaku-ji. Meanwhile, on Kōyasan, Yūkai (1345–1416) was responsible for revitalizing Shingon doctrinal study and also for driving away all of the nembutsu hiriji (now mostly following the Ji sect) who had been living on the mountain. He also purged the tradition of all traces of the heterodox Tachikawa school (even burning their texts). The Tachikawa school was known for teaching a mixed form of esotericism which made use of Daoist and sexual practices.

During the war torn Sengoku period (1467 to 1615), all the Shingon temples in or near the capital were destroyed or stripped of all lands, while the Shingon centers in the mountains like Kōya and Negoro were forced to raise militaries for self defense, though sometimes they used these forces to attempt to expand the lands holdings of their temples. Mount Negoro, the center of Shingi Shingon, was sacked by the &quot;daimyō&quot; in 1585. After this show of force, Kōyasan, the last major Shingon temple left standing at this time, submitted to Hideyoshi, and was spared destruction. 

=== Edo period ===

During the Edo period (1603–1868), the Shingi Shingon monks from Mount Negoro had escaped and took their lineages elsewhere, eventually founding new schools at Hase-dera (the Buzan school) and at Chishaku (the Chisan-ha school). In the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate implemented new religious control measures for the Buddhist community. Tokugawa Ieyasu issued regulations for the Shingon school in 1615, incorporating it into its administrative temple system. Under this new peace, Shingon study was revived in the various temples. Hase-dera became a major center for the broad study of all of Buddhism and also of secular topics. Meanwhile in Kōyasan, the Ji sect hiriji were allowed to return and were incorporated into the Shingon school, though this would lead to conflict later on.

During this period, monks like Jōgen and Onkō (1718–1804) focused on studying and promoting Buddhist precepts and monastic discipline. This renewed interest in precepts study was likely a response to Confucian critiques of Buddhism at the time. Onkō was also a well known scholar of Sanskrit.

=== Meiji period ===
After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the state forced a separation of Shinto and Buddhism (&quot;shinbutsu bunri&quot;) and abolished the Chokusai Hōe (Imperial Rituals). The Shingon school was significantly affected by these changes (since it was closely connected with many Shinto shrines), as well as by the Meiji era anti-buddhist persecutions known as haibutsu kishaku (abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni). Some Shingon temples that were affiliated with Shintō shrines were converted into shrines. Some Shinto monks left the Buddhist priesthood to become Shintō priests, or they returned to secular life. The government enforced the confiscation of temple land and this led to the closure of many Shingon temples. Those who survived had to turn to the regular population for support.

During the Meiji period, the government also adopted the &quot;one sect, one leader&quot; rule which forced all Shingon schools to merge under a single leader which was called a &quot;Chōja&quot; (Superintendent). This led to some internal political conflict among the various sub-schools of Shingon, some of which attempted to form their own separate official sects. Some of these eventually succeeded in attaining independence and eventually the unified Shingon sect split into various sub-sects again.

=== 20th century and post-war period ===
In March 1941, under the government&#x27;s religious policy, Shingon schools were forcibly merged to form the &#x27;Dai-Shingon&#x27; sect. During the second world war, prayers for the surrender of enemy nations were frequently held at various temples. After the war, both Ko-Gyō and Shin-Gyō schools continued to separate, and some established their own unique doctrines and traditions. There are now around eighteen major Shingon schools with their own headquarter temples (honzan) in Japan. Yamasaki estimated the number of Shingon followers at ten million and the number of priests at sixteen thousand in around eleven thousand temples (in his 1988 book). In Japan, there are also several new Shingon influenced groups classified as &#x27;New Religions&#x27;. Some of these new movements include Shinnyo-en, Agon-shu and Gedatsu-kai.

Another recent modern development is the phenomenon of Chinese students reviving Chinese Esoteric Buddhism through studying Japanese Shingon. This “tantric revival movement” (mijiao fuxing yundong 密教復興運動) was mainly propagated by Chinese Buddhists who traveled to Japan to be trained, initiated, and receive dharma transmission as acharyas in the Shingon tradition and who then return home to establish the tradition. Some important figures of this revival include Wang Hongyuan 王弘願 (1876–1937), and Guru Wuguang (悟光上師 (1918–2000), both trained in Shingon and went on to spread Shingon teachings in the Chinese speaking world.

Some of these Chinese acharyas have chosen to officially remain under the oversight of Kōyasan Shingon-shū or Shingon-shu Buzan-ha and minister as Chinese branches of Japanese Shingon, but others have chosen to create independent and distinct schools. Today, these revivalist lineages exist in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. Though they draw mainly from Shingon teachings, they have also adopted some Tibetan Buddhist elements.

A similar phenomenon has occurred in South Korea, where two recent esoteric schools have been founded, the Chinŏn (眞言) and the Jingak Order (眞 覺), both of which are largely based on Shingon teachings.

During the 20th century, Shingon Buddhism also spread to the West, especially to the United States (a move led by the Japanese Diaspora). There are now various temples on the West Coast and Hawaii like Hawaii Shingon Mission (built 1915–1918) and Koyasan Beikoku Betsuin (Los Angeles, founded 1912), Henjyoji Shingon Temple in Portland, Oregon (est. 1949), and the Seattle Koya&#x27;sn Temple in Seattle, Washington.

== Doctrines ==
=== Sources ===
The teachings of Shingon are based on Mahayana texts, and early Buddhist tantras. The key esoteric sources are the , the , and the . Important Mahayana sutras in Shingon include the &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; the &quot;Brahmajāla Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Heart Sutra.&quot; Kūkai wrote commentaries on all three.

Shingon derives form the early period of Indian Vajrayana (then known as Mantrayana, the Vehicle of Mantras). Unlike Tibetan Buddhism, which focuses on the Anuttarayoga Tantras, which are tantras that arose at a later date of Indian Buddhism, Shingon bases itself on earlier works like the &quot;Mahavairocana&quot; which generally lack the antinomian uses of sexual yoga, taboo substances and charnel ground imagery found in the later tantras. Nevertheless, the concept of &quot;great bliss&quot; (tairaku) and the transformation of desire (and other defilements) into wisdom is found in Shingon.

Another important sutra in Shingon is the &quot;Prajñāpāramitānaya-sūtra&quot; (Jp. &quot;Hannyarishukyō&quot;, Taishō vol. 8, no. 243). This is a late &quot;tantric&quot; Prajñaparamita sutra in 150 lines which was translated by Amoghavajra and which contains various verses and seed syllables which encapsulate the Prajñaparamita teaching. The &quot;Hannyarishukyō&quot; is used extensively in Shingon as part of daily recitation and ritual practice. The full Sanskrit title is &quot;Mahāsukhavajra-amoghasamaya-sūtra&quot; (Ch. &quot;Dale jingang bukong zhenshi sanmohe jing&quot;, &quot;Sutra of the Vow of Fulfilling the Great Perpetual Enjoyment and Benefiting All Sentient Beings Without Exception&quot;).

Another important source for the Shingon school is the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot; and a commentary on it called the &quot;On the Interpretation of Mahāyāna&quot; (&quot;Shi Moheyan lun&quot; 釈摩訶衍論, Japanese: &quot;Shakumakaen-ron&quot;, Taisho no. 1668), which was traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna (though it is likely an East Asian composition).

Finally, the works of Kūkai are key sources in Shingon Buddhism, including his various commentaries on the key esoteric texts of Shingon as well as original works like his magnum opus, the ten volume &quot;Jūjū shinron (Treatise on Ten Levels of Mind)&quot; and the shorter summary &quot;Hizō hōyaku (Precious Key to the Secret Treasury)&quot;.

=== The Dharmakaya Mahāvairocana ===

In Shingon, the Buddha Mahāvairocana (Sanskrit for &quot;Great Illuminator&quot;), also known as Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来, &quot;Great Sun Tathagata&quot;) is the universal primordial (&quot;honji-shin&quot;) Buddha that is the basis of all phenomena. Śubhakarasiṃha&#x27;s &quot;Darijing shu&quot; (大日經疏‎, J. &quot;Dainichikyōsho&quot;) states that Mahāvairocana is “the original ground dharmakāya.” (薄伽梵即毘盧遮那本地法身, at Taisho no. 1796:39.580). According to Hakeda, Kūkai identified the Dharmakaya with &quot;the eternal Dharma, the uncreated, imperishable, beginningless, and endless Truth&quot;. 

This ultimate reality does not exist independently of all things, but is immanent in them. Dainichi is worshipped as the supreme Buddha and also appears as the central figure of the Five Wisdom Buddhas. Hakeda also writes that in Shingon, Dainichi is &quot;at the center of a multitude of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and powers; He is the source of enlightenment and the unity underlying all variety. To attain enlightenment means to realize Mahāvairocana, the implication being that Mahāvairocana is originally within man.&quot;

According to Kūkai, the Buddha&#x27;s light illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun (hence his name). The immanent presence also means that every being already has &quot;original enlightenment&quot; &quot;(hongaku)&quot; within. This is also known as the &quot;enlightened mind&quot; (bodhicitta) and the Buddha nature. As Kūkai writes: &quot;Where is the Dharmakaya? It is not far away; it is in our body. The source of wisdom? In our mind; indeed, it is close to us!&quot;

Because of this, there is the possibility of &quot;becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence&quot; &quot;(sokushin jōbutsu)&quot;, even for the most depraved persons. All beings thus have the potential to become Buddhas through their own effort and through the power / grace () of the Buddha. Kūkai thus rejected the idea we lived in an age of Dharma decline and that therefore one had to be reborn in a pure land to attain enlightenment. This also informs his positive view of the natural world, as well as of the arts, all of which he saw as manifestations of the Buddha.

=== Activities and forms of the Dharmakaya ===
Dainichi is the ultimate source of all Buddhas and bodhisattvas, and of the entire cosmos. The centrality of Dainichi is seen in the fact that he appears at the centre of both the Diamond Realm and the Womb Realm mandalas. According to Kūkai, Mahāvairocana is also the Universal Principle which underlies all Buddhist teachings. Thus, other Buddhist deities can be thought of as manifestations of Dainichi, each with their own attributes. As Kūkai writes, &quot;the great Self is one, yet can be many&quot;. 

Like in the school, Shingon sees Dainichi&#x27;s body as being equal to the entire universe. As Dharmakaya (Jpn: &quot;hosshin&quot;, Dharma body), Vairocana also constantly teaches the Dharma in inconceivable ways throughout the universe, including through the secret mysteries of Shingon esotericism. The Dharmakaya is embodied absolute reality and truth and is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as mudras and mantras. Ultimately, the whole phenomenal world itself and all the sounds and movements in it are also considered to be the teaching of Vairocana Buddha, which is identical with the cosmic body of the Buddha. Thus, for Kūkai, the entire universe, together with all actions, persons and Buddhas in it, are all part of Vairocana&#x27;s cosmic sermon to its manifestations. In Shingon, this idea that all phenomena in the universe are constantly revealing the presence of the Dharmakaya Buddha, is part of the doctrine of &quot;the dharmakaya&#x27;s expounding of the Dharma&quot; (&quot;hosshin seppō&quot;). Furthermore, according to the syncretic doctrine of &quot;honji suijaku&quot;, the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu was considered a manifestation of Dainichi Nyorai along with other Shinto deities.

Kūkai explains the Dharmakaya as having four main bodies (&quot;shishu hosshin&quot;):
* Absolute Dharmakaya (&quot;jishō hosshin&quot;) – the ultimate wisdom body of all the Buddhas out which the entire cosmos manifests
* The Dharmakaya in Bliss / Participation (&quot;juyō hosshin&quot;) – it has two aspects: the bliss aspect, a state of absolute samadhi, and the participation aspect, which is how the Dharmakaya appears to the most advanced bodhisattvas as Buddha forms.
* Transformation Dharmakaya (&quot;henge hosshin&quot;) – how the Buddha appears to lower level bodhisattvas, sravakas and ordinary people. This includes the historical Buddha Shakyamuni.
* Emanation Dharmakaya (&quot;tōru hosshin&quot;) – bodies emanating from the Dharmakaya in many forms, including nonhuman beings and hell beings.
Although portrayed through the use of anthropomorphic metaphors, Shingon does not see the Dharmakaya Buddha as a separate or individual personal entity or a God standing apart from the universe. Instead, the Buddha &quot;is&quot; the universe properly understood.

=== The wisdom body of the Dharmakaya ===

Another important feature of the Dharmakaya in Kūkai&#x27;s buddhology is his analysis of Vairocana&#x27;s body of wisdom (&quot;chishin&quot;). According to this teaching, the Dharmakaya has five wisdoms, each one is associated with a Buddha and four of them are associated with a type of mundane consciousness (drawn from the Yogacara system of eight consciousnesses):

# The Wisdom that Perceives the Essential Nature of the World of Dharma (&quot;hokkai taishō chi&quot;): the eternal Source of knowledge and light at the center of all things. It is represented by Mahāvairocana Buddha in the Vajradhatu Mandala.
# Mirrorlike Wisdom (&quot;daienkyō&quot;): the wisdom which reflects things as they are without any distortion. It is represented by Aksobhya Buddha and is associated with the alaya-vijñana (storehouse consciousness).
# Wisdom of Equality (&quot;byōdōshō chi&quot;): the wisdom which sees the identity and sameness of all phenomena and beings. It is represented by Ratnasambhava Buddha and is associated with the ego consciousness (manas).
# Wisdom of Observation (&quot;myōkanzatchi&quot;): the wisdom which is free of discrimination and sees all objects of mind without discrimination / conceptualization. It is represented by Amitabha and is associated with the mental consciousness (manovijñana).
# Wisdom of Action (&quot;jōsosa chi&quot;): the wisdom manifested as actions that help all sentient beings and guide them to Buddhahood. It is represented by Amoghasiddhi and is associated with the five sense consciousnesses.
In the , the illumination of the Buddha&#x27;s body of wisdom is symbolized as a vajra, Indra&#x27;s indestructible adamantine weapon, and it represents the dynamic function of penetrating insight. In the , meanwhile, the Buddha&#x27;s Body of Principle (Jp.: &quot;ri;&quot; Ch.: &quot;li&quot;) is symbolized by a lotus and stands for &quot;compassion, potentiality, growth and creativity&quot; according to Hakeda. For Kūkai, both of these bodies are non-dual. Kūkai writes:That which realizes is Wisdom and that which is to be realized is Principle. The names differ, but they are one in their essential nature.

=== The six great elements, the four mandalas and the three mysteries ===
According to Kūkai, the Dharmakaya can further be explained terms of the &quot;Body of Six Great Elements&quot; (&quot;rokudaishin&quot;). This means that for Kūkai, the Dharmakaya consists of the six great elements which &quot;are interfused and are in a state of eternal harmony&quot;. The great elements (&quot;mahābhūtani&quot;) are earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness, and they are the universal elements out of which all beings and matter are made. These great elements are all in a state of perfect interfusion (&quot;yuanrong&quot;, 圓融, i.e. they are all harmoniously interconnected), a teaching which was first articulated in the Huayan school by patriarchs like Fazang. Like Fazang, Kūkai uses the metaphor of Indra&#x27;s Net to describe the infinite interrelation of all existence, meaning that the Dharmakaya Mahāvairocana and every sentient being in the universe &quot;are not identical but are nevertheless identical; they are not different but are nevertheless different.&quot; 

For Kūkai, the consequence of this doctrine is a complete non-duality between seemingly different phenomena like mind and matter, humanity and nature, sentient and insentient, and so on. Thus, Kūkai writes: &quot;matter is no other than mind; mind is no other than matter. Without any obstruction, they are interrelated.&quot; This interrelation is one of macrocosmic harmony, an eternal natural order (&quot;hōni no dōri&quot;) which is identical with the yoga and samadhi of the Dharmakaya. Sentient beings, as microcosmic manifestations of the Dharmakaya, can tune in to that harmony through practicing samadhi. 

Another perspective with which to understand the Dharmakaya is through the four mandalas (circles, ranges, spheres) which stand for the cosmic Buddha Vairocana&#x27;s extension, intention, communication and action:

* Mahāmandala – the entire physical universe as the body of the Dharmakaya Buddha
* Samayamandala – the ultimate intention of the Dharmakaya Buddha which is omnipresent throughout the universe and is universal compassion
* Dharmamandala – the universal sphere in which the Dharmakaya Buddha&#x27;s preaching and revelation of the Dharma is taking place
* Karmamandala – the universal activities of the Dharmakaya Buddha, i.e. all the movements of the universe

These four mandalas are all said to be deeply interconnected or as Kūkai writes &quot;inseparably related to one another&quot;.

The constant preaching of the Dharmakaya Buddha throughout the cosmos is described in Shingon as the &quot;three mysteries&quot; (sanmi 三密). Hakeda describes these three as &quot;the suprarational activities or functions of the Body, Speech, and Mind of Mahāvairocana.&quot; The three mysteries are found throughout the entire universe as the movements of natural phenomena, natural sounds and as all experiences. Kūkai compares it to a sacred book &quot;being painted by brushes of mountains, by ink of oceans&quot;, which have heaven and earth as the bindings. 

The non-dual nature of all mandalas and the interpenetration of all phenomena embodied as Mahavairocana&#x27;s body and functions is a key Shingon view which also underlies its understanding of the practice of the three secrets. As such, Kūkai explains how Shingon practice enacts the unity of all actions and things in the following important passage: The six symbolic elements interpenetrate without obstruction and are in eternal union.

They are not apart from any of the Four Mandalas. 

Through practice of three-secrets empowerment, they manifest immediately. 

The universal web is what we call this body. 

All things are naturally endowed with bodhisattva wisdom transcending the essential mind, the subsidiary minds [limited aspects of mind], and the objects of the senses. 

Each of the Five Wisdoms is endowed with unlimited wisdom.

Since it is the power of the perfect mirror, this is true enlightened wisdom.As such, through the Shingon &quot;three-secrets yoga&quot; &quot;(sanmitsu yuga)&quot;, a practitioner unifies his body, speech and mind with those of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharmakaya. Kūkai states that &quot;the three secrets bring about the response of empowerment &quot;[kaji]&quot; and he quickly attains great enlightenment&quot;.

=== Buddha&#x27;s power and self-power ===
The three mysteries are also interpreted as tapping into the energy, grace or sustaining power (Skt. , Jp. &quot;kaji&quot;) of the Buddha, which according to Kūkai &quot;indicates great compassion on the part of the Tathagata and faith (Skt. , Jp. &quot;shinjin&quot;) on the part of sentient beings.&quot; Kūkai compares this process to rays of sun (the Buddha&#x27;s power) shining on water (sentient beings) and the water&#x27;s ability to retain the heat of the rays. Kūkai also holds that faith comes through the power of the Buddha; it is not something acquired by one&#x27;s own efforts. Indeed, for Kūkai, the three mysteries are innate in all beings, and the fact that these are united with the macrocosmic three mysteries of the Dharmakaya is what makes faith possible.

However, in Shingon, it is not solely through the Buddha&#x27;s power that one accumulates merit and attains enlightenment; rather, it is through a conjunction of &quot;the three powers&quot; (&quot;sanriki&quot;): the power of Buddha&#x27;s blessing or grace (&quot;nyorai kaji-riki&quot;, which is &quot;other power,&quot; &quot;tariki&quot;); one&#x27;s power of self-merit (&quot;ga kudoku-riki&quot;, i.e. &quot;self-power&quot;, &quot;jiriki&quot;); and the power of the Dharma realm (&quot;hokkai riki)&quot;, the interfused self-nature in which self and Buddha are non-dual. As such, in Shingon, self-power and other-power are not two separate powers but are non-dual. 

Kūkai describes this as &quot;the Buddha entering the self and the self entering the Buddha&quot; (&quot;nyūga ga&#x27;nyū&quot;, literally &quot;entering-self and self-entering&quot;) in his &quot;Dainichi-kyo Kaidai&quot; (&quot;Interpretation of the Mahavairocana Sutra&quot;). Yamasaki calls this &quot;a subtle process of the self, the deity, and the universe&quot; in which &quot;in striving &#x27;upward&#x27;, the individual perceives an energy flowing &#x27;downward&#x27; as if to aid his striving.&quot;

=== Buddhahood ===

According to Shingon doctrine, Buddhahood is not a distant, foreign reality that can take aeons to approach but it is a real possibility within this very life. This is because the buddha-nature / original enlightenment is present within all beings. Kūkai describes this immanent reality within all beings as &quot;the glorious mind, the most secret and sacred&quot;. 

According to Kūkai, the core teaching on enlightenment in the &quot;Mahāvairocana sutra&quot; is found in the following passages:The enlightened mind [bodhicitta] is the cause, great compassion [mahakaruna] is the root, and skillful means [upaya] is the ultimate...enlightenment is to know your own mind as it really is...Seek in your own mind enlightenment and all-embracing wisdom. Why? Because it is originally pure and bright. This means that Buddhahood can be attained because all beings already have enlightenment and &quot;all embracing wisdom&quot; within which is &quot;originally pure and bright&quot; according to Kūkai. With the help of a genuine teacher and through proper training, one can reclaim and liberate this enlightened capacity for the benefit of oneself and others. When cultivated, the luminous enlightened mind manifests as awakened wisdom. 

Kūkai systematized and categorized all Buddhist teachings into ten stages of spiritual realization, from the lowest type of worldly mind to the highest mind of exoteric Buddhism (the view of Huayan/Kegon) to the supreme mind attained through Shingon.

=== The nature of esoteric Buddhism ===
Kūkai wrote at length on the difference between exoteric, that is to say, mainstream (non-tantric) Mahayana Buddhism and esoteric Mantrayana (or Vajrayana) Buddhism. For him, the differences between exoteric and esoteric can be summarised as follows:
#Esoteric teachings are preached by the Dharmakaya Buddha, Vairocana, and are &quot;secret &amp; profound, containing the final truth&quot;. Exoteric teachings are preached by nirmanakaya (emanation) Buddhas, like Shakyamuni, and are &quot;simplified&quot; skillful means. Exoteric Mahayana sutras also contain hidden esoteric meanings which Kūkai discusses in his works. For example, the title of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; is considered a mantra by Kūkai.
#Kūkai held that exoteric doctrines were upāyas (&quot;skillful means&quot;), teachings adapted to the needs of beings according to their capacities and time. The esoteric doctrines, in comparison, are the truth itself—a direct communication of the innermost secrets of the Dharmakaya, and his timeless eternally present samadhi.
#Exoteric teachings are gradual (and may take aeons); esoteric methods are the &quot;sudden approach&quot;—or, at the very least, provide a much faster way to enlightenment. Even the most depraved of beings, the icchantikas, can attain awakening through the simplest esoteric method: recitation of a mantra.
#Esoteric Buddhism contains within it all the teachings of exoteric Buddhism, and more. Exoteric Buddhist schools lack the special methods of esoteric Buddhism, which is the highest expression of Buddhism. These esoteric rituals—involving the use of mantras, mudras, and mandalas—are the direct communication of the Dharmakaya, and provide direct access to the ultimate truth.
#Esoteric Buddhism has the highest view of the ultimate truth, which sees the mind of Mahāvairocana as united with the mind of all beings, and the body of Mahāvairocana as being the body of the universe (which contains all sentient beings).

== Practice ==
The goal of Shingon is the realization that one&#x27;s true nature is identical with the universal Mahāvairocana Buddha, a goal that is achieved through esoteric initiation, and mantrayana ritual practices. Shingon practice thus depends on receiving secret doctrines, methods and instructions, from the school&#x27;s ordained masters. The &quot;Three Mysteries&quot; of body, speech, and mind participate simultaneously in the subsequent process of revealing one&#x27;s nature: the body through devotional gestures (mudra) and the use of ritual instruments, speech through sacred formulas (mantra), and mind through meditation. These methods allow a Shingon contemplative to realize that his body-mind is none other than the body-mind of Mahāvairocana.

=== The Three Mysteries and consecration ===
The essence of Shingon practice is to experience the Dharmakaya, the ultimate reality, by emulating the inner realization of the Dharmakaya through the synchronized meditative ritual use of mantras, mudras (hand gestures) and visualization of mandalas. These are known as the &quot;three modes of action&quot; and are the central methods of Shingon esoteric practice. These three &quot;ritual technologies&quot; are equivalent to the concept of the &quot;three mysteries&quot;, the secrets of body, speech and mind (of the Buddha Vairocana) and these are introduced in the ritual of abhisheka (consecration) where tantric vows (samaya) are undertaken by initiates. As the Indian Shingon patriarch Śubhākarasiṃha states: &quot;the three modes of action are simply the three secrets, and the three secrets are simply the three modes of action. The three [Buddha] bodies are simply the wisdom of tathāgata Mahavairocana.&quot; 

The abhisheka includes entering a prepared ritual space with a mandala while blindfolded and throwing a flower into the mandala, which lands on a specific deity depicted in the mandala. After the consecration, the esoteric initiate is taught how to visualize the deities and mandalas, along with the secret mudras and mantras of his deity, and these secrets are revealed to be none other than the expression of the body-speech-mind of the Buddha. Through the consecration and use of these three mysteries, the initiate is said to ritually replicate the body, speech, and mind of the Buddha, achieving buddhahood in this very existence.

==== Mandala ====
Visualizing a mandala corresponds to the mental activity of the Buddha. The most important Shingon mandalas are known as the Mandala of the Two Realms which are: The Womb Realm (; ) mandala based on the &quot;Mahavairocana Sutra&quot; and the Diamond Realm (; ) mandala based on the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot;. These two mandalas are considered to be a compact expression of the entirety of Buddhahood as well as a representation of the totality of existence. 

According to Yamasaki, the &quot;Great Compassion Womb Repository Birth Mandala&quot;: &quot;represents the enlightened universe from the viewpoint of compassion&quot;. It is also associated with skillful means and the lotus is its key symbol. Regarding the Vajra Realm mandala, Yamasaki writes that it &quot;embodies the vajra-wisdom that illuminates the universe&quot;. This is the Buddha&#x27;s wisdom body which is indestructible like the mythic adamantine weapon (vajra). Yamasaki also adds that while the womb realm generally represents the five material elements, the vajra realm represents the mind and consciousness elements. However, both mandalas are not a duality, but are ultimately seen as non-dual. As such, &quot;the two mandalas together thus signify the indissoluble unity of Truth and Wisdom, the inseparability of Matter and Mind, the resolution of mystical paradox.&quot;

==== Mantra ====

Mantras are another key element of Shingon praxis (corresponding to the speech of the Dharmakaya Buddha). Kūkai understood mantras as the most concentrated form of the teachings of the Dharmakaya Buddha. According to Kūkai, Shingon mantras contain the entire meaning of all the scriptures and indeed the entire universe (which is itself the preaching of the Dharmakaya). Kūkai argues that mantras are effective because: &quot;a mantra is suprarational; it eliminates ignorance when meditated upon and recited. A single word contains a thousand truths; one can realize Suchness here and now.&quot; 

Furthermore, Kūkai also states:By reciting the voiced syllables with clear understanding, one manifests the truth. What is called &quot;the truth of the voiced syllable&quot; is the three secrets in which all things and the Buddha are equal. This is the original essence of all beings. For this reason, Dainichi Nyorai&#x27;s teaching of the true meaning of the voiced syllable will startle into awakening those long sleeping. 

As such, mantras are also not mere incantations, but manifest the power and blessings of the Buddha, being full embodiments of the Buddha. According to the &quot;Commentary to the Mahavairocana Sutra&quot; (&quot;Da Rijing shu&quot; 大日經疏, T. 1796) of Yi Xing:The reason that only the Mantra Gate fulfills the secret is that [ritual is performed] by empowerment with the truth. If mantras are recited only in one&#x27;s mouth, without contemplation of their meaning, then only their worldly effect can be accomplished – but the adamantine body-nature cannot.Mantras (and bījas, or &quot;seed-syllable&quot; mantras) are generally associated with a Buddhist deity; for example, the seed syllable of Mahavairocana in the Garbhadhātu Mandala is &quot;&quot;A&quot;,&quot; while a key mantra of Mahavairocana is . Some deities have multiple seed mantras as well along with different mantras.

In Shingon, mantras (as well as dharanis, vidyas, etc.) are recorded in Sanskrit, using the Siddhaṃ alphabet (JP: &quot;shittan&quot; , or &quot;bonji&quot; ). However, the pronunciation of mantras is in a Sino-Japanese style, not any Indian style of Sanskrit pronunciation.

==== Mudra ====

Mudras (&quot;seals&quot;) are hand gestures which represent the secret of the Buddha&#x27;s body and, as such, symbolize and enact Buddha activity. There are numerous mudras used in the various Shingon practices. According to Yamasaki, mudras &quot;symbolically identify the individual with the universe. In this way, the human body functions as a living symbol of the macrocosm.&quot; The term can have multiple meanings, as well; in some cases, it is a very general term, referring to the Buddha&#x27;s Dharmakaya (whereupon it may be called the &quot;great mudra&quot;, ). As such, the Commentary on the Mahavairocana sutra states: &quot;Mudra is none other than a symbol of the Dharma Realm. Using mudra, one points to the body of the Dharma Realm.&quot; 

The hand gestures themselves are either termed samaya mudra (when it refers to a deity&#x27;s attribute, like a sword, lotus, etc) or karma mudra (when it symbolizes their activity). Each hand and finger has various symbolic associations in Shingon; e.g., the right hand generally represents the Buddha, while the left hand symbolizes ordinary beings, including the yogin themselves. Other associations include: &quot;right hand:&quot; Wisdom, Buddha-Realm, Sun, and Vajra Realm mandala; &quot;left hand:&quot; Truth, Phenomenal Realm, Moon, and Womb Realm mandala. The fingers may represent the five senses and the five elements.

A key mudra is the &quot;añjali mudrā&quot; (Jp: &quot;gasshō&quot;) which symbolizes the unity of the Buddha realm with the world of phenomena and sentient beings. There are actually various forms of the &quot;gasshō&quot; apart from the standard palm to palm version, including the &quot;lotus gasshō&quot; and the &quot;vajra gasshō&quot;. Another important mudra in Shingon (one also used in other traditions such as Zen) is the &quot;Dharmadhatu Samadhi&quot; mudra (&quot;hokkai jō-in&quot;) which symbolizes the union of self with Buddha, the phenomenal world with the Buddha Realm. The &quot;Wisdom Fist&quot; &quot;(chiken-in)&quot; mudra also enacts the unity of Buddha and living beings: in this mudra, the breath of life (symbolized by the index finger on the left hand, which stands for the air element) touches the all-encompassing emptiness (symbolized by the thumb tucked within the right fist, representing the space element), which also symbolizes the Buddha&#x27;s wisdom (itself inseparable from emptiness, and all-pervasive).

=== Ajikan and other contemplative methods ===

Another important meditative practice of Shingon is &quot;Ajikan&quot; () &quot;meditating on the letter A&quot; (Nagari: अ, Siddham: 𑖀) written using the Siddhaṃ alphabet. The letter A is an important symbol in Mahayana and in esoteric Buddhism, which signifies the Dharmakaya, the Buddha Mahavairocana, emptiness, Prajñaparamita, and non-arising (). While the writings of Kukai do discuss the letter A and how it is important for esoteric practice, they do not provide step-by-step meditation instructions. The earliest source for the details of this practice is Jitsue&#x27;s (実恵, 786–849) &quot;Record of Oral Instruction on the Ajikan&quot; (&quot;Ajikan yōjin kuketsu&quot;, 阿字觀用心口決, Taisho no. 2423). It details the contemplation of a letter &quot;A&quot; inside of a white moon disk, which itself sits on a lotus flower. The moon represents the awakened mind (bodhicitta) and the lotus represents the heart (). Since then, over a hundred Ajikan manuals have been written, and Ajikan has become a central practice in the Shingon school.

There are other forms of Shingon practice. For example, in &quot;Gachirinkan&quot; (, &quot;Full Moon Visualization&quot;), an image of the moon (an important symbol of the enlightened mind) is used for visualization. In &quot;Gojigonjingan&quot; (, &quot;Visualization of the Five Elements Arrayed in the Body,&quot; from the ), the focus is on the five elements () as manifestations of the Buddha Vairocana. 

Shingon Buddhist temples also perform liturgical rites which include the chanting of sutras and other liturgy. This may be accompanied by instruments such as the taiko drum. A popular style of Buddhist chanting in Shingon is called shōmyō (声明), a style influenced by traditional Japanese music.

Shingon practice may also include the practice of &quot;nembutsu&quot; or other methods associated with Amitabha and his Pure Land. In Shingon, this practice is understood through the lens of esoteric Buddhism—hence seeing the Buddha Amitabha (who is equated with Mahavairocana) as being immanent in the human &quot;heart-mind&quot;, and the pure land of Sukhavati as being non-dual with this world. &quot;Esoteric Pure Land&quot; practice was taught by Shingon figures such as Kakuban (1095–1143) and Dōhan (1179–1252).

Various Chinese masters also taught dharanis related to Amitabha; for example, Amoghavajra translated the popular &quot;Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Dharani&quot;, along with numerous other texts that teach methods for rebirth in Sukhavati.

=== Ethical precepts ===
Another important element of Shingon practice is the keeping of Buddhist ethical precepts (kai). For Kūkai, keeping Buddhist precepts is essential for meditation and for living in harmony with one&#x27;s true nature. Kūkai writes: &quot;If we aspire to go far, unless we depend on our feet, we cannot advance; if we wish to walk the Way of Buddha, unless we observe the precepts, we cannot reach the goal.&quot; He even goes so far as to say that we should not break the precepts even to save our lives, and that those who do break them are not disciples of the Buddha and he [Kūkai] will not be their teacher.

Shingon ethical teachings rely on the basic Buddhist precepts, Mahayana bodhisattva precepts (from the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot;) along with special mantrayana esoteric samayas (vows). According to Kūkai, &quot;all of these precepts have their foundation in the Ten Precepts&quot;, i.e. the ten wholesome dharma paths (daśa-kuśala-karmapatha). Furthermore, the very essence of all the precepts can be reduced to the fact that &quot;the essential nature of our mind is not distinct from that of the Buddha.&quot;

Regarding the esoteric vows (samayas), there are four main samayas in Shingon:

# Never abandoning the True Dharma. One should master all the teachings of the Buddha without forsaking a single teaching.
# Never giving up bodhicitta, which is understood as both the intention to become a Buddha for the sake of all beings and the originally enlightened mind itself (respectively, they are the subjective and objective aspects of bodhicitta, they are understood as being non-dual). This is the most important samaya for Kūkai.
# Never withholding or being &quot;tight fisted&quot; regarding the teaching of Dharma to others. One must always share Dharma.
# Never avoid benefiting sentient beings (and never harm them), especially through the &quot;four embracing acts&quot; (i.e. the &quot;four ways of attracting&quot;, Skt. &quot;catuhsamgrahavastu&quot;; generosity, loving words, beneficial acts, adapting oneself to other&#x27;s needs).

=== Esoteric transmission ===
Apart from basic meditations, prayers, and the reading and recitation of Mahayana sutras, there are mantras and ritualistic meditative techniques that are available for laypersons to practice on their own under the supervision of a Shingon priest (&quot;ajari&quot; , from Sanskrit: ). However, many esoteric practices require the student to undergo an abhiṣeka initiation (&quot;kanjō&quot; ) into each of these practices under the guidance of a qualified ācārya before they may begin to learn and practice them. As with all schools of Esoteric Buddhism, great emphasis is placed on initiation and oral transmission of teachings from teacher to student.

As such, all Shingon followers who desire to practice the esoteric methods must gradually develop a teacher-student relationship, formal or informal, whereby a teacher permitted to transmit the abhiseka (i.e. a mahācārya, Jp: &quot;dai-ajari&quot;) learns the disposition of the student and teaches esoteric practices accordingly. For lay practitioners, there is no initiation ceremony beyond the &quot;Kechien Kanjō&quot; (), which aims to help create the bond between the follower and Mahavairocana Buddha.

=== Training for ācāryas ===
In the case of disciples wishing to train to become a Shingon  (esoteric master), it is required to undergo a period of academic study and religious discipline—or formal training in a temple for a longer period of time—after having already received novice ordination and monastic precepts; and, as well, full completion of the rigorous four-fold preliminary training and retreat known as &quot;shido kegyō&quot; (), which must be completed under the guidance of a qualified master. The training involves esoteric rites focused on invoking specific buddhas or bodhisattvas (the &quot;honzon&quot; or “principal deity”) and also include pilgrimages to holy sites. According to Robert Sharf: All Shingon rituals and ceremonies are organized as a sequence of smaller liturgical procedures that typically consist of an incantation (a mantra, dharani, hymn, etc.) accompanied by a hand gesture (mudra) and a guided contemplation (kanso). The four initiations that comprise the Shidokegyo—namely the Juhachido (eighteen methods), Kongokai (vajra-realm practice), Taizokai (matrix-realm practice), and Goma (fire ceremony)—consist of hundreds of such segments of varying duration and complexity. These complex rites are taught through oral transmission &quot;(kuden)&quot; between a master and a student, a process aided by numerous ritual manuals and texts. Depending on the lines of transmission &quot;(ryu)&quot;, the specific details of each rite may differ.

An in Shingon is a committed and experienced teacher who is authorized to guide and teach practitioners. In the Kōyasan tradition, one must be an ācārya for a number of years at least before one can request to be tested at Mount Kōya for the possibility to qualify as a , or &quot;great teacher&quot; (&quot;dento dai-ajari&quot; )—the highest rank of Shingon practice.

However, other Shingon schools outside the Kōyasan tradition may use different terminology, and for them, the term &quot;dai-ajari&quot; may have no such special meaning. It is also possible that the creation of the specialized &quot;dai-ajari&quot; rank at Kōyasan may have been a tradition which developed after Kūkai.

=== &quot;Goma&quot; fire ritual ===
The &quot;goma&quot; () fire ritual is an important and recognizable ritual in Shingon. Goma has roots in the Vedic &quot;homa&quot; ritual and this was acknowledged by traditional authors like Yi Xing (8th century). According to Yi Xing:
Buddha created this teaching out of his desire to convert non-Buddhists and allow them to distinguish the true from the false. Thus he taught them the true Goma[...] The Buddha himself taught the very foundation of the Vedas, and in that way manifested the correct principles and method of the true Goma. This is the &quot;Buddha Veda&quot;. 

Thus, while the Goma resembles Vedic rituals, if properly understood, it communicates the true inner intent of the Buddha. According to the &quot;Commentary on the Mahavairocana Sutra:&quot; &quot;The meaning of goma is to burn the firewood of delusion with the wisdom flame, consuming it completely.&quot; 

Goma is performed by qualified priests and acharyas for the benefit of individuals, the state or all sentient beings in general. The consecrated fire is believed to have a powerful cleansing effect, since esoteric Buddhist sources like Yi Xing consider the &quot;goma&quot; fire to be the purifying wisdom of the Buddha; hence, the ritual is performed for the purpose of destroying detrimental thoughts and desires, and for the making of secular requests and blessings. The central deity invoked herein is usually &quot;Acala&quot; ( ). The ritual is performed in most major Shingon temples; larger scale ceremonies often include the constant beating of taiko drums and mass chanting of the mantra of Acala by priests and lay practitioners. 
Adopting the practice from Shingon Buddhism, adherents the syncretic Japanese religion of Shugendō () also practice the &quot;goma&quot; ritual, of which two types are prominent: the &quot;saido dai goma&quot; and &quot;hashiramoto goma&quot; rituals. The &quot;goma&quot; ritual was also adopted by other schools of Japanese Buddhism, and it is still practiced in some Zen temples.

=== Pilgrimage ===
The practice of making pilgrimage to holy sites, especially to mountains which were seen as the homes of deities, developed throughout the history of Shingon and many pilgrimage routes remain a key part of Shingon practice today. One such pilgrimage route is the Shikoku pilgrimage which is associated with devotion to Kūkai and includes a total of 88 locales.

== Pantheon ==

The Shingon pantheon includes numerous Buddhist deities. Many of these deities have vital roles as they are regularly invoked by the practitioner for various rituals like the homa fire ritual and in liturgical services.

In Shingon, divine beings are grouped into six main classes: Buddhas (Butsu ), Bodhisattvas (Bosatsu ), Wisdom Kings (Vidyaraja, Myōō ), Devas (Ten ), Buddha emanations (Sanskrit: nirmāṇakāya&quot;,&quot; Keshin ) and Patriarchs (Soshi ). 

===The Thirteen Buddhas===

The most important set of deities in Shingon is called the , which is actually a grouping of Buddhas, bodhisattvas and Wisdom Kings which are found in the womb-realm and vajra-realm mandalas. 

They are widely invoked in several liturgies and rituals, including the popular Thirteen Buddha Rites (&quot;jūsan butsuji&quot; 十三仏事) that are associated with the deceased and with merit making. Each figure also has their own mantra and seed syllable in Shingon which are used in these rituals. Thirteen Buddha Rites became popular throughout Japanese Buddhism during the Edo Period and . 

The thirteen buddhas (more accurately &quot;thirteen deities&quot;) along with their mantras and seed syllables (bīja) are:

* Wisdom King Acala (Fudō Myōō ), Bīja: Hāṃ; Sanskrit mantra: namaḥ samanta vajrāṇāṃ caṇḍa mahāroṣaṇa sphoṭaya hūṃ traṭ hāṃ māṃ (Shingon transliteration: nōmaku samanda bazaratan senda makaroshada sowataya untarata kanman)
* Gautama Buddha (Shaka-Nyorai ), Bīja: Bhaḥ; Mantra: namaḥ samanta buddhānāṃ bhaḥ (nōmaku sanmanda bodanan baku)

* Amitābha Buddha (Amida-Nyorai ), Bīja: Trāḥ; Mantra: oṃ amṛta teje hara hūṃ (on amirita teisei kara un)
* Akṣobhya Buddha (Ashuku-Nyorai ), Bīja: Hūṃ; Mantra: oṃ akṣobhya hūṃ (on akishubiya un)
* Mahavairocana Buddha (Dainichi-Nyorai ), Bīja: A; Mantra: oṃ a vi ra hūṃ khaṃ vajradhātu vaṃ (on abiraunken basara datoban)
* Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva (Kokūzō-Bosatsu ), Bīja: Trāḥ; Mantra: namo ākāśagarbhāya oṃ ārya kāmāri mauli svāhā (nōbō akyasha kyarabaya on ari kyamari bori sowaka)

=== Other deities ===
The &quot;Five Great Wisdom Kings&quot; (Godai Myō-ō, 五大明王) are wrathful manifestations of the Five Buddhas:

*Acala or Acalanatha (Fudō Myōō ) &quot;The Immovable One&quot; – Manifestation of Buddha Mahavairocana
*Amrtakundalin (Gundari Myōō ) &quot;The Dispenser of Heavenly Nectar&quot; – Manifestation of Buddha Ratnasambhava
*Trailokyavijaya (Gōzanze Myōō ) &quot;The Conqueror of The Three Planes&quot; – Manifestation of Buddha Akshobhya
*Yamāntaka (Daiitoku Myōō ) &quot;The Defeater of Death&quot; – Manifestation of Buddha Amitabha
*Vajrayaksa (Kongō Yasha Myōō ) &quot;The Devourer of Demons&quot; – Manifestation of Buddha Amoghasiddhi
There are numerous Indian Buddhist deities found in the Shingon pantheon and in Shingon mandalas. They include figures like Indra (Taishakuten ), Prthivi (Jiten , Goddess of the Earth), Maheshvara (Daijizaiten or Ishanaten ), Marici (Marishi-Ten ), Mahakala (Daikokuten Patron deity of Wealth) and Saraswati (Benzaiten Patron deity of Knowledge, Art and Music). 

Apart from Indian Buddhist deities, there are also many Shinto deities which were assimilated into Shingon Buddhism, like Hachiman, Inari Ōkami and the sun goddess Amaterasu. 

== Lineage ==

The Shingon lineage is an ancient transmission of esoteric Buddhist doctrine that began in India and then spread to China and Japan. Shingon or Orthodox Esoteric Buddhism maintains that the expounder of the doctrine was originally the Universal Buddha Vairocana, but the first human to receive the doctrine was Nagarjuna in India. Like all major East Asian Buddhist tradition, the Shingon tradition developed a list of &quot;patriarchs&quot; which were considered to be the key figures in the transmission of their lineage. Shingon recognizes two groups of eight great patriarchs – one group of lineage holders and one group of great expounders of the doctrine.

; The Eight Great Doctrine-Expounding Patriarchs (Fuho-Hasso )

<doc id="291852" wikidata="Q244747" url="?curid=291852" title="Tudela, Navarre">
<text>Tudela (in Spanish and oficially) or Tutera (in Basque) is a municipality in Spain, the second largest city of the autonomous community of Navarre and twice a former Latin bishopric. Its population is around 35,000. The city is sited in the Ebro valley. Fast trains running on two-track electrified railways serve the city and two freeways (AP 68 and AP 15) join close to it. Tudela is the capital of the agricultural region of &quot;Ribera Navarra&quot;, and also the seat of the courts of its judicial district.

The city hosts an annual festival in honor of Santa Ana (mother of the Virgin Mary) which begins on 24 July at noon and continues for approximately a week. Street music, bullfights and the running of the bulls are typical events of the festival.

== History ==
Archeological excavations have shown that the area of Tudela has been populated since the Lower Paleolithic era. The town of Tudela was founded by the Romans on Celt-Iberian settlements. Since then the town has been inhabited continuously. The Roman poet Marcus Valerius Martialis (Epigrams Book IV, 55) &quot;recalls in grateful verse&quot; the town of Tutela compared to his native Bilbilis. The city was later taken by the Arabs during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and became the Muslim emirate of Al-Hakam I in 802 under Amrus ibn Yusuf al-Muwalad.

At the beginning of the 9th century, the strategic importance of Tudela as a site on the river Ebro was enhanced by historical and political circumstances. It became the base of the Muwallad Banu Qasi family, local magnates converted to Islam that managed to stay independent of the emirs, establishing an on-off alliance and close ties with the Kings of Pamplona over the next century. With the power of the Banu Qasi fading at the onset of the 10th century, the town fell under the influence of the rising Caliphate of Córdoba and had to come up against a more aggressive policy on the part of the new dynasty ruling in Pamplona, the Ximenes, who had set up close ties with their neighbouring Christian kingdoms.

The town was used by Muslims as a bridgehead to fight against the expanding Kingdom of Navarre. When Christians under Alfonso the Battler conquered Tudela in 1119, three different religious communities were living there: 
* the Muslims, 
* the Mozarabs
* the Jews (see Jews in Tudela)

In the aftermath of the conquest, community relations appear to have been strained and Muslims were forced to live in a suburb outside the town walls, whereas Jews continued to reside inside the walls. The co-existence of different cultures is reflected in Tudela&#x27;s reputation for producing important medieval writers such as Al-Tutili. In 1157 the English scholar Robert of Ketton, first translator of the Koran to a Western tongue (Latin), became a canon of Tudela.

The Jews were banished in 1498 (the expulsion from Navarre occurring slightly later than in the Iberian kingdoms. Muslims and Moriscos were expelled in 1516 and 1610 respectively. There are still examples of Islamic-influenced architecture in the city - the style the Spanish call Mudéjar; but the principal mosque was handed over to the Catholic Church in 1121, and by the end of the 12th century construction of the (future) cathedral of Our Lady of Solitude had begun.

Later Tudela became an important defensive point for the Kingdom of Navarre in battles with Castile and Aragon. Tudela was an Agramont party stronghold and actually the last Navarrese one to surrender to Ferdinand II of Aragon&#x27;s Aragonese troops in the initial 1512 Spanish invasion of Navarre, only doing so to avoid futile bloodshed, Spanish pillaging and further confiscations to town dwellers, after the Navarrese king failed to send a relief force.

At the end of the 17th century, a new public square was built, called &quot;Plaza Nueva&quot; or &quot;Plaza de los Fueros&quot;, which became the main city square. In 1783 the Diocese of Tudela was created, split off from Pamplona.

On 23 November 1808, Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Marshal Lannes won the Battle of Tudela in the Peninsular War. The train station was built in 1861, which, together with the agricultural revolution, resulted in a new period of expansion for the city. The bishopric was merged back into &#x27;Pamplona-Tudela&#x27; in 1851, restored in 1889 and ultimately suppressed in 1984.

== Main sites ==
* The Cathedral of Our Lady of Solitude (12th-13th centuries). It includes examples of Romanesque architecture, such as the &quot;Puerta del Juicio&quot;, or Door of the (Last) Judgement, some Gothic influences and Baroque additions to the building.
* Church of Magdalene (12th century), in Romanesque style
* Church of &quot;San Nicolás &quot;(12th century)
* Church of &quot;San Jorge &quot; (17th century), in Baroque style

== Gastronomy ==
The &quot;Casa Salinas&quot; bakery in Tudela, known for its excellent mantecadas, closed in January 2011 after 138 years in business. Another traditional dessert is manjar blanco.

The Days of Exaltation and Festivals of the Vegetable are celebrated in the Navarra de Tudela locality during ten days, generally in the first fortnight of May or from the end of April. Although the central acts are developed in those ten days, before and after there are acts related to the days. In 2019 they will be from April 12 to May 5.
Its origin is in the &quot;Week of the Vegetable&quot; that began to be organized in the 80s. In the current format it has been developed since 1994 (this year the twentieth edition is celebrated). They were declared Fiestas of National Tourist Interest in the year 2011.
There are hundreds of events that take place before, during and after the Days of Exaltation and Festivals of the Vegetable since Tudela and its fertile orchard allow to enjoy different seasonal products.
From the firing of the announcing rocket until the last day of celebration are hundreds of acts that can be enjoyed: from gastronomic routes with pinchos and menus where the vegetable is the protagonist until popular dinners, contests of stews with vegetables, workshops, talks and even a tweeter encounter called &quot;vegetables &amp; tweets&quot;.
The main events are the weekend with the &quot;General Chapter of the Order of Volatín&quot; which includes the proclamation of the festivities, the appointment of the Knight of Honor and the Prize Exaltation of the Vegetable.

All these acts are completed with the Great Concert of the Days of the Vegetables where a renowned musical group animates the Saturday night.

<doc id="291854" wikidata="Q3567254" url="?curid=291854" title="Wendy Mesley">
<text>Wendy Mesley is a Canadian television journalist, podcaster, and blogger. She worked for CBC News from 1981 to 2021 in roles including national correspondent at the Quebec Legislature and the Ottawa Parliamentary Bureau. She was the anchor of &quot;The National&quot;, host of &quot;Undercurrents&quot;, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, and &quot;Marketplace&quot;, and from 2018 to 2020, she hosted the Sunday morning talk show &quot;The Weekly with Wendy Mesley&quot;.

==Broadcast career==
Mesley enrolled in the journalism program at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute but left before completing her degree, though she later obtained a diploma. In 1979, during her last year of studies, both CBC and CTV interviewed students for summer job opportunities. Mesley received offers from both networks but chose to work for CFCF-TV, the CTV affiliate in Montreal. However, by 1981, she transitioned to CBC.

In 1985, Mesley became CBC&#x27;s first female TV correspondent to cover the Prime Minister, when she joined the parliamentary bureau. Then in 1991, she became CBC&#x27;s national affairs correspondent and started hosting &quot;Sunday Report&quot;.

From 1994 to 2001, Mesley played a pivotal role in the creation and hosting of the media and technology series &quot;Undercurrents&quot;. In 2002, following a brief stint co-hosting the investigative show &quot;Disclosure&quot;, Mesley transitioned to the consumer investigation series &quot;Marketplace&quot;, concurrently serving as a frequent backup anchor for CBC&#x27;s flagship evening news program, &quot;The National&quot;.

In 2004, Mesley hosted a 13-part series called &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot;, and between 2007 and 2008, she co-hosted four episodes of &quot;Test the Nation&quot;, with Brent Bambury, and one with Ron MacLean, which all aired on CBC.

From October 2009, Mesley had a greater presence on &quot;The National&quot;, and in 2010, she became the program&#x27;s regular Friday and Sunday anchor.

In January 2018, she started hosting a new Sunday morning talk show on politics and media, titled &quot;The Weekly with Wendy Mesley&quot;.

On June 9, 2020, Mesley was suspended from &quot;The Weekly with Wendy Mesley&quot; for saying &quot;nigger&quot; in an editorial meeting about a presumed panelist who had tweeted she was repeatedly called that; this occurred mere days after the murder of George Floyd. Mesley immediately apologized. Months earlier, during staff discussions of Quebec&#x27;s Bill 21 prohibiting some civil servants from wearing anything connected to a religious belief, Mesley had referred to the seminal Quebec book &quot;White Niggers of America&quot;, written by Pierre Vallières.

On July 5, 2021, Mesley announced her retirement from CBC. On July 7, 2021, an opinion piece she had written appeared in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, entitled &quot;I made mistakes. But my departure wasn&#x27;t the solution to the CBC&#x27;s problem with racism&quot;, which detailed the issues leading up to her retirement. While Mesley did concede to having made a serious error by using the &quot;n-word&quot; in editorial meetings, she indicated that her second mistake was in trusting CBC management to manage the story appropriately. She also felt that the punishment administered by management was disproportionate, given that on both occasions, her use of the word was not malicious.

In 2022, Mesley, along with Maureen Holloway, created a podcast called &quot;Women of Ill Repute&quot;. She also began writing on Substack.

==Awards==
Mesley has been honored with three Gemini Awards for Best Host in a News or Talk Program or Series. Additionally, in 2006, she was bestowed with the prestigious John Drainie Award by ACTRA, in recognition of her significant contributions to Canadian broadcasting. In 2017, Mesley was the recipient of a Canadian Screen Award for Best Host or Interviewer in a News or Information Program or Series.

==Personal life==
Mesley was born in Montreal, Quebec. Following the dissolution of her parents&#x27; marriage shortly after her birth, her mother, Joan Mesley, relocated them to Toronto in 1958. Joan, who never remarried, provided for Wendy by working as a physiotherapist. Wendy met her father, Gordon Mesley, a radio journalist, for the first time, at the age of eighteen.

At the age of ten, Mesley accompanied her mother to the U.S. consulate to picket in support of Martin Luther King Jr.

Mesley married CBC news anchor Peter Mansbridge in 1989, but the union ended in 1992. She remarried in 1998, with marketing executive Liam McQuade. Together, they have a daughter.

During the fall of 2004, Mesley received a diagnosis of an aggressive form of breast cancer subsequent to the discovery of a lump in her left breast. Shortly thereafter, she found a small, malignant lump in her right breast. In January 2005, she publicly disclosed her diagnosis. Despite reducing her workload, Mesley persevered with her hosting duties on &quot;Marketplace&quot; when she could and as a backup newsreader for &quot;The National&quot;. Following a series of treatments, including two lumpectomies, chemotherapy, and radiation, Mesley resumed her full-time position at CBC in March 2006, albeit under the ongoing care of an oncologist. During her treatment period, Mesley also undertook the filming of a documentary, titled &quot;Chasing the Cancer Answer&quot;, which aired in March 2006.

<doc id="291860" wikidata="Q157609" url="?curid=291860" title="Small tortoiseshell">
<text>The small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae) is a colourful Eurasian butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. Adults feed on nectar and may hibernate over winter; in warmer climates they may have two broods in a season. While the dorsal surface of the wings is vividly marked, the ventral surface is drab, providing camouflage. Eggs are laid on the common nettle, on which the larvae feed.

==Description==

It is a medium-sized butterfly that is mainly reddish orange, with black and yellow markings on the forewings as well as a ring of blue spots around the edge of the wings. It has a wingspan ranging from 4.5 to 6.2 cm.

==Technical description==
A bright foxy red ground-colour; the forewing with 3 black costal spots, whose interspaces are yellow, there being a larger black spot in the middle of the hindmarginal area and two smaller ones in the disc between the 3 radial and 2 median; hindwing with the basal half black; both wings with black submarginal band bearing blue spots. Underside of the forewing ochreous, with the costal spots as above, the apex and distal margin blackish; hindwing brown, basal half black with dentate edge, the whole surface with darker pencilling; at the distal margin of both wings contiguous dull blue lunules.

The small tortoiseshell is the national butterfly of Denmark.

==Range==
It is found throughout temperate Europe, Asia Minor, Central Asia, Siberia, China, Nepal, Sikkim Himalayas in India, Mongolia, Korea and Japan, wherever common nettle, which their larvae feed on, is found. There are a few records from New York City which, however, are believed to be of introduced insects.

The Corsican small tortoiseshell (&quot;Aglais ichnusa&quot;) looks very similar; whether it is a subspecies or a distinct species is yet to be determined. &quot;Nymphalis xanthomelas&quot; and &quot;Nymphalis l-album&quot; are also similar in appearance.

==Decline in population==
Once among the most common butterflies in Europe and temperate Asia, this butterfly is in very rapid decline, at least in Western Europe. This decline cannot be explained by the decline of its host plant, because the nettle is widespread and even enjoys the general eutrophication of the environment. The chrysalis is sometimes eaten by wasps, but these are also in strong regression. The effect of other phenomena are still poorly understood (environmental degradation, air pollution, contamination by pesticides). Scientific evidence shows that the summer drought is a cause of declining populations, because larvae grow normally on drenched leaves (but hatchlings were even rarer the wet summers of 2007 and 2008). However, before 2000, according to data from an English butterfly monitoring programme, there was a good correlation between reproductive success, the abundance of populations of this species and the host plant moisture stress. From 1976 to 1995, the butterfly had more success in summers that were cool and wet at the beginning of summer than when it was hot and dry. This butterfly may then be sensitive to global warming.

===Droughts===
The small tortoiseshell butterfly is severely affected by droughts. During periods of drought, the butterfly experiences a vastly reduced reproductive rate. The drought directly affects the &quot;Urtica&quot; leaves; the higher the nitrogen and water level in the leaves, the more rapid the growth of the larvae. During a drought, both of these levels drop significantly, leaving the tortoiseshell larvae nothing to feed on. The timing of rainfall is also a crucial factor. If there is not adequate rainfall in the early summer, then the plants will not be able to fully develop, leaving the larvae without a suitable source of nutrition. These butterflies actively produce smaller broods under these conditions.

==Life cycle==
As with several nymphalid butterflies, the caterpillars feed on stinging nettles (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;) and small nettle (&quot;Urtica urens&quot;). &quot;Humulus lupulus&quot; has also been recorded as larval food plant. Adults feed on nectar. The species has one of the longest seasons of any Eurasian butterfly, extending from early spring to late autumn. Adults overwinter in hibernation, emerging on the first warm sunny days of the year to mate and breed. In southern parts of the range there may be two broods each year, but northern insects are inhibited by long length of summer days from breeding a second time.

===Hatching===
Tortoiseshell butterflies usually begin to emerge from their pupa from mid-June into August. They begin hibernation sometime in October and immediately show territorial behaviour after hibernation. The tortoiseshell butterflies that are found in the north usually have one brood a season, whereas further south these butterflies can have two broods. The ability to go through three generations of butterflies in a year is due to the tortoiseshell butterflies&#x27; decreased thermal requirement. The larvae of this butterfly are social. These larvae can be found on &quot;Urtica dioica&quot;, which have a high nitrogen content and much water in the leaves.

===Hibernation===
The small tortoiseshell butterfly tends to enter hibernation by mid to late September. Typically this butterfly will try to hibernate in dark sheltered locations. Because of this hibernation, they need to accumulate a lot of fat to survive the winter. The tortoiseshell needs at least 20% of its body weight in lipids in order to survive, making them much slower. Towards the end of their foraging for hibernation, they are much more susceptible to attacks by birds because of their low muscle to body mass ratio. During the first few weeks of hibernation, tortoiseshell butterflies are very susceptible to predator attacks. Up to 50% of the population hibernating in any given area can be eaten. The butterflies that hibernate in areas containing more light, and that are accessible to rodents who can climb, are the most susceptible to this type of predation. During hibernation tortoiseshell butterflies are able to supercool in order to keep from freezing. In sheltered areas, these butterflies can stand up to −21 degrees Celsius without freezing. However, they experience rapid weight loss during unusually mild winters.

==Developmental stages==
==Behaviour==
===Predator defence===
The wings of tortoiseshell butterflies help conceal them extremely well from predators. When closed, their wings look like leaves, helping them to hide. On the ground, it may take birds up to 30 minutes to see them. In addition to this, when discovered, tortoiseshell butterflies will flick their wings open to reveal bright colours. While they don&#x27;t have eyespots like many other butterflies, these bright contrasting colours can often scare a predator, giving the tortoiseshell butterfly ample time to escape. Not only does this colouration tend to frighten birds, it can also act as a warning. The bright red colouration serves as a cautionary sign to the predator about the poor taste of the butterfly. Tortoiseshell butterflies tend to be unpalatable to birds. If a bird sees this bright red colouring, then they will be less likely to eat the butterfly.

The tortoiseshell butterfly is particularly fast. When discovered and attacked by a predator the tortoiseshell butterfly will fly away in a straight line in order to outstrip the predator.

===Territorial defence===
Most butterflies fail to display any territorial behaviour, probably due to selective environmental pressures. The female tortoiseshell butterflies generally are found in concentrated areas, so it is advantageous for males to stay in that particular area to increase their mating opportunities. Male butterflies usually bask and feed until mid-day and then display territorial behaviour until roosting. Males typically defend a certain territory for up to 90 minutes, unless they attempt to follow a female or are ousted by another male. The next day they find a new territory to defend. These territories tend to be in direct sunlight in areas that females choose to lay their eggs. More often than not, two or more males may end up sharing territory if the cost of defending the territory is greater than the benefit gained from monopolising the females.

===Male-male interaction===
In order for one male butterfly to gain dominance over the other, he must reach a position slightly above the other butterfly. The non-dominant male will then attempt a series of dives and climbs to escape the pursuer. After a certain distance travelled from the nest, one butterfly will return to the territory while the other flies along in search of another suitable location.

==Feeding==
For most adult butterflies, including the small tortoiseshell butterfly, nectar is one of the main sources of nutrients. In order to obtain the nectar, the butterfly must be able to recognize distinct floral aromas and colours. The small tortoiseshell butterfly is able to differentiate between various flowers through visual signals. Tortoiseshell butterflies in particular tend to prefer colours at both ends of the visible light spectrum for humans, 400 nm and 600 nm. These correspond to the colours violet and red respectively. This ability comes from their compound eye. The flowers depend on the butterflies for pollination, so it is a mutually beneficial relationship.

==Migratory patterns==
During migration, tortoiseshell butterflies position themselves in accordance with air currents; they only start migration at certain wind speeds. They are able to do this because of an extra sensory organ in their antennae. These butterflies have a developed Johnston&#x27;s organ in their second antennae responsible for determining air currents in a number of other insects. Because their host plants, &quot;Urtica dioica&quot;, grow in widely distributed areas, tortoiseshell butterflies tend to move around more than some other butterflies. These areas tend to be short thickets and shrubs.

<doc id="291861" wikidata="Q1778575" url="?curid=291861" title="Coal dust">
<text>Coal dust is a fine-powdered form of coal which is created by the crushing, grinding, or pulverization of coal rock. Because of the brittle nature of coal, coal dust can be created by mining, transporting, or mechanically handling it. 

Grinding or pulverizing coal to a dust form before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning, which makes the coal easier to handle. However, coal dust is hazardous to workers if it is suspended in air outside the controlled environment of grinding and combustion equipment. It poses the acute hazard of forming an explosive mixture in air and the chronic hazard of causing pulmonary illness in people who inhale excessive quantities of it.

The distribution of the particle-size of coal dust is frequently measured in mesh. The British slang term for cheap fuel consisting of coal dust (slack) containing small lumps of coal (nuts) is .

==Energy generation==
For use in thermal power plants, coal is ground into dust using a device called a powdered coal mill. The resulting product, called powdered coal or pulverized coal, is then generally used in a fossil fuel power plant for electricity generation. Pulverized coal is a significant dust explosion hazard, as large quantities are suspended in air for transfer from the mill to the power plant. Explosions have occurred when the flow drops and flames in the burning chamber pass back along the ductwork delivering fuel.

==Hazards==
Coal dust is a fugitive combustible dust - a dust that is both a pollutant and combustible when dispersed into the air. Due to the small particle size and combustible nature of this dust, there is a risk of an explosion and inhalation. The control of coal dust is difficult due to the coal dust being such a fine particle, allowing it to escape and be suspended in the air for a large amount of time.
===Explosions===

Coal dust suspended in air is explosive—coal dust has far more surface area per unit weight than lumps of coal, and is more susceptible to spontaneous combustion. However, five elements are needed for an explosion to occur: oxygen, an ignition source, coal dust, dispersion of the coal dust, and confinement of the dust. For instance, a nearly empty coal store is a greater explosion risk than a full one. This is due to the increase of space in the store for oxygen and dispersion to take place. 

The worst mining accidents in history have been caused by coal dust explosions, such as the disaster at Senghenydd in South Wales in 1913 in which 439 miners died, the Courrières mine disaster in Northern France which killed 1,099 miners in 1906, the Luisenthal Mine disaster in Germany, which claimed 299 lives in 1962, and the worst: the explosion at Benxihu Colliery, China, which killed 1,549 in 1942. Such accidents were usually initiated by firedamp ignitions, the shock wave of which raised coal dust from the floor of the mine galleries to make an explosive mixture. The problem was investigated by Michael Faraday and Charles Lyell at the colliery at Haswell County Durham of 1844, but their conclusions were ignored at the time.

===Inhalation===
Coalworker&#x27;s pneumoconiosis, or black lung disease, is caused by inhaling coal dust, typically dust produced in coal mining. Government agencies in the United States have set exposure limit guidelines for coal dust inhalation.

== Prevention ==
For safe handling/storage of coal dust, the dust must be controlled, maintained, and protected properly. With the presence of coal dust within multiple industries, such as: mining, energy generation, and concrete production, different approaches are necessary. However, a common procedure to undergo is the three C&#x27;s: contain, capture, and clean. Following this procedure can help prevent unnecessary inhalation or explosions from occurring if following correctly.

=== United states ===

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for coal dust exposure in the workplace as 2.4 mg/m3 (5% SiO2) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3 (measured by MSHA) or 0.9 mg/m3 (measured by ISO/CEN/ACGIH) over an 8-hour workday.

=== Hygiene ===
It is always the best practice to maintain a clean workplace and control any hazardous material, especially with a fugitive combustible dust such as coal dust. Many explosions from combustible dust are due to accumulation on walls, floors, and other surfaces. The accumulation of uncontrolled coal dust in a workplace is a dangerous situation that needs to be eliminated. The control of coal dust can be improved by implementing the use of dust-approved vacuums, dust collection systems, methods to reduce fugitive coal dust, and following general housekeeping procedures.

=== Explosions ===
To prevent explosions, it is best to promote and execute good hygiene practices in the workplace by controlling both the coal dust and any possible ignition sources. Some ignition sources that may need to be controlled or used carefully around coal dust includes heavy machinery, electrical components, and open flames or sparks. The main attempts at preventing explosions due to coal dust include using safety lamps, adding stone dust coffers to mine galleries to dilute the coal dust, watering workings and ensuring efficient ventilation of all the workings.

Another means of preventing explosions is by placing rock dust in the coal mine, which is usually pulverized limestone dust, which absorbs thermal energy from the heated gasses. Rock dusting has been used since the early 1900s, but there have been technological improvements since then. Since then, NIOSH developed a Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM) to test the mixture between coal and rock dust in mines. This field testing process allows miners to gauge the explosibility of their work environment.

<doc id="291865" wikidata="Q4851430" url="?curid=291865" title="P. Ballantine and Sons Brewing Company">
<text>P. Ballantine and Sons Brewing Company was an American brewery founded in 1840, making Ballantine one of the oldest brands of beer founded in the United States. At its peak, it was the 3rd largest brewer in the US. The brand is currently owned and operated by Pabst Brewing Company. Throughout history, it is best known for its Ballantine XXX Ale.

==History==

===Ballantine era===

The company was founded in 1840 in Newark, New Jersey, by Peter Ballantine (1791–1883), who emigrated from Scotland. The company was originally incorporated as the Patterson &amp; Ballantine Brewing Company.

===Frelinghuysen era===
Following the death of the last son of Peter Ballantine, the company was taken over by George Griswold Frelinghuysen, the company&#x27;s vice-president, who was married to Ballantine&#x27;s granddaughter.

Frelinghuysen was the son of Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen and Matilda Elizabeth Griswold. He graduated from Rutgers College in 1870, received his Bachelor of Law from Columbia University Law School in 1872, and was admitted to the New Jersey and New York bars in 1872 and 1876 respectively.

The 18th Amendment took effect in 1920, beginning Prohibition. The company was forced to consolidate, and they manufactured malt syrup to stay in business. The Ballantine family continued to own the brewing company all throughout Prohibition. But by the time the 21st amendment was passed in 1933, the family was ready to sell the company.

===Badenhausen era===
In 1933, after Prohibition was lifted, the Ballantine company was acquired by two brothers, Carl and Otto Badenhausen. The Badenhausens grew the brand through its most successful period of the 1940s and 1950s, primarily through clever advertising. Ballantine Beer was the first television sponsor of the New York Yankees. It was during this period that the brand was elevated to the number three beer in the U.S. It was also during this period that the company grew into one of the largest privately held corporations in the United States. Ballantine Beer enjoyed a high level of success into the early 1960s, however, by the mid-sixties, the brand began losing popularity. In 1965 Carl Badenhausen sold the company but remained at the helm until his retirement in 1969.

===Decline===
In the mid-1960s the company went into decline. It was losing market share to lighter lagers with less alcohol content. Despite advertising efforts to revive the company, the owners agreed to sell the brand, the company, and all their assets to the Falstaff Brewing Corporation in 1972.

The new owners closed the original brewery in Newark, started brewing elsewhere, and did not strictly adhere to Ballantine&#x27;s recipes. Falstaff was successfully sued for violating the terms of the sales contract. The general consensus is that, under the stewardship of Falstaff, the beers remained faithful for a time to their original flavor profile. But Falstaff was doing poorly financially and was sold to Pabst in 1985. At an unknown point during these changes, the original recipes were lost.

Pabst continued to brew some of the Ballantine portfolios throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. They stopped brewing the IPA in 1996, and gradually all of the beers were discontinued with the exception of the flagship Ballantine XXX Ale. Throughout the 2000s and into the 2010s, Pabst continued to brew Ballantine&#x27;s signature ale, but the recipe changed several times. The most notable changes are a markedly lower bitterness, lower alcohol content, fewer hops, and in general a much less assertive aromatic character. The use of distilled hop oil was discontinued until 2014 when Pabst Brewing Company relaunched a new version of Ballantine IPA.

===Revival===
In August 2014, a version of Ballantine IPA was revived by Pabst Brewing Company. Reports indicate that the original recipe has been long lost; however, some pains have been taken to attempt to recreate the palate and distinctive aroma of the original product. The recipe was reverse engineered by Pabst brewmaster Greg Deuhs. Because he had no recipe, he relied on analytical chemistry reports from as far back as the 1930s that tracked the ale&#x27;s attributes (alcohol, bitterness, gravity level). He also researched what ingredients were likely used, historical accounts of the beer and beer lovers&#x27; remembrances.

In an interview in September 2014, brewmaster Greg Deuhs discussed the possibility of bringing back other beers in the Ballantine portfolio: &quot;Just on the Ballantine side we&#x27;re looking at the Brown Stout, they also made a Bock as well as the Burton Ale, which was highly regarded. I would like to bring out the Burton Ale as the true Barleywine Style Ale that it was.[...]Right now our hands are full with the Ballantine relaunch, but yes, we are starting to stoke the fire on what we can bring back.&quot;

On November 13, 2014, Pabst announced that it had completed its sale to Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings, LLC. Blue Ribbon is a partnership between American beer entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and TSG Consumer Partners, a San Francisco–based private equity firm. Prior reports suggested the price agreed upon was around $700 million.

Because Ballantine XXX Ale has in recent years been widely sold in 40-ounce bottles, it is often lumped together with Olde English 800 and other malt liquors in the public mind. This is in direct contradiction with Pabst&#x27;s vision for the brand today. Pabst revived Ballantine India Pale Ale to enter the craft beer market. It is unclear at this time if Pabst will take steps to align Ballantine XXX Ale more with the brand of the relaunched Ballantine IPA.

In July 2015, during an interview with John Holl, Kashper hinted at the possibility of building a small brewery in Newark, NJ, where the company was founded.

On November 16, 2015, Pabst announced that it would be reviving Ballantine Burton Ale for the 2015 holiday season. This new version was reverse engineered by Pabst brewmaster Greg Deuhs as was Ballantine IPA from 2014. This barleywine style ale has 11.3% ABV, 75 IBUs, and a starting gravity of 26.5 Plato. It is no longer aged 10–20 years in oak barrels, but to help recreate the flavor of the original, Pabst ages this reboot for several months in barrels lined with American oak. The major difference is that this rendition will be sold to the general public, while the original was only given as gifts to high ranking executives at the company, friends of the company, and VIPs such as President Harry S. Truman. Pabst says this is a seasonal brew and have made no comment as to any further plans with Ballantine Burton Ale after the 2015 holiday season.

==Logo==

The Ballantine logo is three interlocking rings, a design known as the Borromean rings. According to legend, Peter Ballantine was inspired to use the symbol when he noticed the overlapping condensation rings left by beer glasses on a table; however, this logo was not created until 1879. In some advertising campaigns in the mid-1900s, Peter Ballantine was referred to as &quot;Three-Ring Pete&quot;; however, it is unknown if this was his nickname when he was alive. The rings represent &quot;Purity, Body, and Flavor&quot;. New York Yankees announcer Mel Allen called it &quot;the Three-Ring Sign&quot;.

==Products==
Throughout the years, Ballantine offered a wide range of different products, some of these include:
* The XXX Ale, their flagship product, which is top fermented.
* A light lager
* A dark lager
* An India Pale Ale, which was an intensely bitter and aromatic brew that was aged for a year in wood prior to bottling. 
* A Brown Stout, also aged for a year in wood prior to bottling.
* A Porter, with the XXX designation.
* A Bock beer
* A Burton ale, never commercially sold, it was brewed to be given as a gift to Ballantine distributors, executives, and VIPs. It was a strong brew in the barleywine style, aged from 10 to 20 years in wood prior to bottling. Surviving unopened bottles are still bought, sold, and traded to this day among collectors, more than 60 years after being brewed. Because of the long aging and generous hopping as well as an ABV content comparable to barleywines, the beer had remarkable keeping qualities. Still, it could be argued that since the beer was already long aged prior to bottling, it was probably already at its peak when finally bottled. Reports of modern-day tastings indicate that properly handled vintage bottles of this unique beer can still yield a complex (though somewhat faded) taste experience.

==In popular culture==
===In literature===
* Writer/journalist Hunter S. Thompson mentions drinking Ballantine Ale twice in his novel &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&quot; At the beginning of Chapter 12, Thompson writes &quot;Into the Ballantine Ale now, zombie drunk and nervous.&quot; Later in Chapter 12, Thompson writes &quot;&#x27;Ballantine Ale,&#x27; I said ... a very mystic long shot, unknown between Newark and San Francisco. He served it up, ice-cold. I relaxed. Suddenly everything was going right; I was finally getting the breaks.&quot; Thompson&#x27;s book was based on a trip he took with his attorney in March and April 1971, approximately one year before Ballantine sold to Falstaff.
* The iconic American writer Ernest Hemingway endorsed Ballantine Ale in a print advertisement. This ad was part of a larger campaign featuring authors and novelists, asking them &quot;How would you put a glass of Ballantine Ale into words?&quot; Hemingway was the most prominent writer to participate followed by John Steinbeck. Other writers who were in the campaign include:
**James A. Michener, author of over 40 books, who is best known for &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot; for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1948.

* Alan D. Eames, beer writer and historian, who was considered the &quot;Indiana Jones of beer,&quot; wrote about Ballantine IPA. &quot;Ballantine India Pale Ale. Jesus, this beer is a holy sacrament! Dangerous, high-test, 44 magnum ale, its bitter, woody suds, reeking of spruce sap, overwhelm the nose and palate — God, this is fabulous ale.&quot; Later in the passage he pleads &quot;The American beer industry — take the best ale in America and use all our advertising and packaging skill to render it such that no one in their right mind would ever venture to try it and then, &#x27;let&#x27;s drop it &#x27;cause this brand just ain&#x27;t selling.&#x27;&quot; He concludes with &quot;Oh well — Ballantine India Pale Ale, last bright jewel in the tarnished crown of American brewing, you haunt me still. Neither one of us fit into the scheme of things these days. May God preserve and protect us both.&quot; (1986)

<text>The Compass Players (or Compass Theater) was an improvisational theatre revue active from 1955 to 1958 in Chicago and St. Louis. Founded by David Shepherd and Paul Sills, it is considered to be the first improvisational theater in the United States.

==History==
===Shepherd and Sills===
The Compass Players, founded by David Shepherd and Paul Sills, was the first Improvisational Theatre in America. It began July 8, 1955 as a storefront theater at 1152 E. 55th near the University of Chicago campus. They presented improvised plays.

Shepherd, in Mark Siska&#x27;s documentary &quot;Compass Cabaret ’55&quot;, about the birth of modern improvisation, stated his reasons for founding the Compass Players, “Theater in New York was very effete and based on three-act plays and based on verbiage and there was not much action,” he said. “I wanted to create a theater that would drag people off the street and seat them not in rows but at tables and give them something to drink, which was unheard of in [American] theater.” 

Previously, Shepherd and Sills founded Playwrights Theatre Club, along with Eugene Troobnick, and employed improvisational theater forms, named Theater Games, originally created and developed by Sills&#x27; mother, Viola Spolin. These same games were employed to develop material for the Compass Players. 

===Evolution of Improvisation===

Initially, scenes were presented only once, but some of the players grew interested in polishing material into finished pieces. For example, Mike Nichols and Elaine May created many of their signature scenes in this manner. Shelley Berman also found that he could create solo routines by showing one half of telephone conversations.

===Crystal Palace===
The Compass Players also opened its doors at the Crystal Palace in St. Louis, where Theodore J. Flicker, Nichols and May, along with Del Close, codified a further set of principles to guide improvisational players. 

==Legacy==
Sills would co-found The Second City and Shepherd would return to New York City to create and produce a variety of improv forms including his Improvisation Olympics (ImprovOlympic). 

Nichols and May went on to New York, performing material largely derived from their Compass days. Close was featured in Flickers&#x27; Broadway musical comedy The Nervous Set, and afterwards developed his long-form improvisation the Harold.

<text>Shas () is a Haredi religious political party in Israel. Founded in 1984 under the leadership of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, a former Israeli Sephardi chief rabbi, who remained its spiritual leader until his death in October 2013, it primarily represents the interests of Sephardic and Mizrahi Haredi Jews.

Shas is the third-largest party in the Knesset in 2024. Since 1984, it has been part of most governing coalitions, whether the ruling party was Labor or Likud.

==Name==
The party was originally called &quot;Shom&#x27;rei Torah&quot; (&quot;Guardians of the Torah&quot;), with the acronym ש״ת, pronounced &quot;Shat&quot; or &quot;Shas&quot;. However, Israeli election law requires a party wishing to use letters for their acronym that already appear in the acronym of an existing party to first obtain permission from that party, and the Israeli Labor Party, whose letters are אמת, refused to grant Shas permission to use the ת. Instead, it was named ש״ס, Shas, an acronym for &quot;Shomrei S&#x27;farad&quot;, meaning &quot;Sephardic Guardians&quot;. The name is also a reference to the six orders (&quot;Shisha S&#x27;darim&quot;) of the Mishnah and the Talmud, both of which are often referred to by the same acronym, &quot;Shas&quot;. The party&#x27;s legal name is &quot;Hit&#x27;akhdut ha-S&#x27;pharadim ha-Olamit Shom&#x27;rei Torah&quot; (התאחדות הספרדים העולמית שומרי תורה), meaning &quot;International Union of the Sepharadim, Guardians of the Torah&quot;.

==History==
Shas was founded in 1984, prior to the elections to the eleventh Knesset in the same year, in protest against the small representation of Sephardim in the largely Ashkenazi Agudat Yisrael, through the merger of regional lists which were compiled in 1983. It was originally known as the Worldwide Sephardic Association of Torah Keepers (, &quot;Hitahdut HaSfaradim HaOlamit Shomrei Torah&quot;). The party was formed under the leadership of former Israeli Chief Sephardi Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who established a four-member (including himself) Council of Torah Sages and remained the party&#x27;s spiritual leader until his death. In founding the party, Yosef received strategic help and guidance from Rabbi Elazar Shach, leader of Israel&#x27;s non-Hasidic Haredi Ashkenazi Jews. Yosef founded the party in 1984 on the platform of a return to religion and as a counter to an establishment dominated by Ashkenazi Jews of European extraction.

Not all Shas voters are ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many of its voters are Modern Orthodox and traditional Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews, due to its alignment with the promotion of an &quot;authentic Middle Eastern&quot; Israeli culture, which fits with traditional Zionist beliefs of a revival of authentic, non-Europeanized Jewish culture. However, it still represents the Sephardi and Mizrahi Haredi Jewish sectors in the Knesset. Shas has at times been able to exert disproportionate influence by gaining control of the balance of power in the Knesset within the context of the traditionally narrow margin between Israel&#x27;s large parties. Like its Labor Zionist counterparts (i. e., Labor and Meretz) that gain votes from the kibbutz movement, Shas gains votes and supports from moshavim that are inhabited by Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews, either Orthodox or non-Orthodox. Also, since it became a member of the World Zionist Organization, it gains votes from Orthodox settlers in the West Bank.

In the elections to the eleventh Knesset in 1984, Shas won four seats. Following Aryeh Deri&#x27;s conviction on corruption charges in 1999, Shas gained 17 seats in the 1999 elections, its strongest showing since its formation. Although 26 seats were projected for the following election had it run in 2001, Shas was reduced to 11 seats in the 2003 election because the two-ballot system was amended.

In the 2006 elections, it gained one more seat, after running what the BBC called &quot;an aggressive campaign that targeted the neo-conservative economic policies of the previous government&quot;, and joined Ehud Olmert&#x27;s coalition government, alongside Kadima, Labor, Gil and, between October 2006 and January 2008, Yisrael Beiteinu. In the government, Shas party leader Yishai was Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor and Deputy Prime Minister, while Ariel Atias was Minister of Communications and Meshulam Nahari and Yitzhak Cohen were Ministers without Portfolio.

Following the 2009 elections, in which Shas won eleven seats, it joined Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition government and held four cabinet posts. Eli Yishai, who led the party at that time, was one of four Deputy Prime Ministers and Minister of Internal Affairs.

On 4 December 2011, Shas launched its United States affiliate, American Friends of Shas, based in Brooklyn, New York.

Shas won 11 seats in the 2013 elections, but chose to form part of the Labor opposition to Netanyahu&#x27;s new government. Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party and Naftali Bennett of The Jewish Home, who had won more seats and joined the coalition, both favored conscription of the previously exempt Haredi men into Israel&#x27;s national service and a reduction in state financial support for Haredi families, policies Shas opposes.

In December 2014, Eli Yishai left the Shas party, which he had led for more than a decade. He said he would lead a new religious party in the election scheduled for March 2015. His departure from Shas and Aryeh Deri did not come as a surprise. The party that he formed, Yachad, failed to pass the election threshold.

In the 2015 elections, Shas was accused of tampering with the ballots of Yachad. They were also accused of creating a straw party with the symbols of Otzma Yehudit, which was running on a joint list with Yachad during the election. During the 2015 election, Shas won 7 seats.

In 2017, opinion polling showed that Shas was falling under the election threshold of 3.25%. In response, Shas leaders said that there was a coup attempt in the party. In the same year, a tape was leaked of the party&#x27;s former spiritual leader, criticizing Jerusalem Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar.

On 17 April 2020, a senior Likud minister, speaking on anonymity, told Al-Monitor that Deri was mediating the political coalition talks between Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. It was also reported that Deri &quot;might even be open to a new alliance with Blue and White – now that its anti-clerical component, Yair Lapid, quit the party and went his own way&quot;, and would only commit to remaining with Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition until the next election.

==Ideology==

The stated purpose of the party is to &quot;return the crown to the former glory&quot;, meaning to protect the religious and cultural heritage of Sephardic Jewry and rectify what it sees as the &quot;continued economic and social discrimination against the Sephardic population of Israel&quot;. Focusing on the needs of Sephardic Orthodox Israelis, Shas established its own government-funded religious education system called MaAyan HaHinuch HaTorani, which became popular in poor Sephardic towns, increasing the party&#x27;s popular support.

Shas advocates for the increased influence of Halakha, the Jewish religious law, in Israeli society, and actively engages in the Baal teshuva movement, encouraging non-Orthodox Israelis of Sephardic and Mizrahi-Jewish heritage to adopt an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle. Shas is a Haredi religious party, but it has participated in left-wing governments and is often willing to compromise on both religious and economic issues.

At first, Shas followed a moderate policy on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, after Yosef had declared that lives were more important than territories, but by the 2010s it had moved to the right, opposing any freeze in Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank. In addition, it was skeptical towards the U.S. Obama Administration&#x27;s intentions regarding the Israeli–Palestinian peace process and began to support a consolidation of Israeli settlement interests, especially regarding yeshivas and Jewish holy sites in the West Bank. It further believes in a &quot;United Jerusalem&quot; and supports the Greater Jerusalem plan. In 2010, Shas joined the World Zionist Organization, having made significant changes to its charter.

One of Shas&#x27;s demands is a compensation package for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews who were forced to flee their home countries and leave their property behind.

Shas opposes any form of public expression of homosexuality, including Gay Pride parades, especially in Jerusalem. Shas MK Nissim Ze&#x27;ev accused the homosexual community of &quot;carrying out the self-destruction of Israeli society and the Jewish people&quot;, calling homosexuals &quot;a plague as toxic as bird flu&quot;. However, the party condemns any form of violence against gay people.

==Controversies==

Several Shas MKs, including Aryeh Deri, Rafael Pinhasi, Yair Levy, Ofer Hugi and Yair Peretz, have been convicted of criminal offenses that include fraud and forgery. In addition, MK Shlomo Benizri was convicted of bribery, conspiring to commit a crime and obstruction of justice on 1 April 2008. Benizri resigned was replaced by Mazor Bahaina, who was number thirteen on the Shas list. In 1999, Deri was sentenced to prison time on corruption charges.

In 2010, Ovadia Yosef cursed the Palestinians as &quot;evil, bitter enemies of Israel&quot; and said that, &quot;Abu Mazen and all these evil people should perish from this world. God should strike them with a plague.&quot; Saeb Erekat of the PLO said Yosef&#x27;s remarks were tantamount to a call for &quot;genocide against Palestinians&quot;. Yosef later apologized and wrote to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak: &quot;I support your efforts and praise all the leaders and the peoples — Egyptians, Jordanians and Palestinians — who are partners and wish the success of this important process of achieving peace in our region, and preventing bloodshed. May God grant you longevity and may you succeed in your efforts for peace and may there be peace in our region.&quot; Previously, Yosef had called Arabs &quot;vipers&quot; and called for Israel to &quot;annihilate&quot; them. &quot;It is forbidden to be merciful to them. You must send missiles to them and annihilate them. They are evil and damnable.&quot; A spokesman later clarified that his comments were only aimed at murderers and terrorists and not the entire Arab world.

In 2020, the party was fined ₪7,500 by the Central Elections Committee for giving out prayer cards at polling stations during the 2020 Knesset elections, which were claimed to cure &quot;Corona and every illness and pestilence&quot;.

==Women&#x27;s campaign==
Women activists protested the lack of female representation in Shas by organizing a &quot;No Female Candidate, No Female Vote&quot; campaign. The women said they would not vote for a party that does not include women candidates on its slate and sent an open letter to the Knesset representatives of ultra-Orthodox parties, which was also circulated on social media. Rabbi Mordechai Blau, a senior party member, threatened that women participating in the movement or bucking the party leadership would find their children &quot;banned from Haredi schools&quot; and their employers &quot;boycotted by the community&quot;. Shas announced that it would create a women&#x27;s council within the movement, a step that was welcomed by the campaigners. At the same time, they said: &quot;We will move forward and call on the Haredi factions to enable women to serve as MKs in the Knesset.&quot; Eli Yishai said on Israel Radio: &quot;There is nothing in Jewish law that says you can&#x27;t have a woman as a Knesset member. But our rabbis decide what they decide on every subject and the same goes for this.&quot;

When a group of ultra-Orthodox women created their own party, U&#x27;Bizchutan, Isaac Bezalel, the Shas spokesman, said: &quot;The Haredi public is not yet open to women serving in the Knesset.&quot;

==Knesset members==
Eleven men serve as members of the Knesset for Shas in the twenty-fifth Knesset:

#Aryeh Deri
#Ya&#x27;akov Margi (replaced by Erez Malul on 2 February 2023)
#Yoav Ben-Tzur (replaced by Yonatan Mishraki on 3 January 2023)

<text>Pontevedra (, ) is a city in the autonomous community of Galicia, in northwestern Spain. It is the capital of both the &quot;Comarca&quot; and Province of Pontevedra, and the capital of the Rías Baixas. It is also the capital of its own municipality which is often considered an extension of the actual city.

The city is best known for its urban planning, pedestrianisation and the charm of its old town. Between 2013 and 2020, the city received numerous awards for its urban planning, like the international European Intermodes Urban Mobility Award in 2013, the 2014 Dubai International Best Practices Award for Sustainable Development awarded by UN-Habitat in partnership with Dubai Municipality and the Excellence Award of the center for Active Design in New York City in 2015, among others. The city also won the European Commission&#x27;s first prize for urban safety in 2020.

Surrounded by hills, the city is located on the edge of a ria at the mouth of the Lérez river by the sea, at the end of the Ria de Pontevedra, in the heart of the Rías Baixas. An economic centre and tourist destination, with a population of 83,260 in 2020, it is at the head of a metropolitan area around its ria of more than 200,000 inhabitants comprising the municipalities of Poio, Marín, Sanxenxo, Bueu, Vilaboa, Cerdedo-Cotobade, Ponte Caldelas, Barro and Soutomaior.

Pontevedra has the second most important historic center in Galicia, after Santiago de Compostela. A city of art and history, the city is known as &quot;The Good City&quot; (name attributed by the French author Jean Froissart in his Chronicles in the 14th century) or &quot;The City of the Lérez&quot;. The city is also an important stopover on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago: the circular church of the Pilgrim Virgin, built for the pilgrims in the 18th century, has a floor plan in the shape of a scallop shell and there are scallop shells sculpted in the arches of the medieval Burgo Bridge.

Pontevedra city has an important group of squares of medieval origin and monumental religious buildings, including the Basilica of Saint Mary Major (16th century) with its plateresque Renaissance façade, the Baroque Church of the Pilgrim Virgin (18th century) with its rounded façade, the ruins of the Gothic Convent of San Domingo (13th century), the Gothic Church of San Francisco (13th century), the Baroque Church of San Bartholomew (end of the 17th century) and the Gothic Convent of Santa Clare (14th century). Its old town also contains numerous noble houses with coat of arms (the 15th century House of the Bells or the 18th century García Flórez Palace), mansions – the Mendoza Mansion, Villa Pilar – as well as old palaces such as the 18th century Mugartegui Palace, which is now the headquarters of the Rias Baixas Wine Regulatory Council, or the Counts of Maceda Palace, which is now a Parador. Another major symbol of the city is the Ravachol Parrot, whose statue is in the city centre. The city also has a marina close to its historic centre. At present, Pontevedra is a city in full revival. It has become the flagship city of the network of walkable cities and one of the cities in the world where children live best, known as &quot;The City of Children&quot;.

Pontevedra is an important administrative, political, judicial, military, historical and cultural centre. In the 16th century it was the largest city in Galicia. Nowadays it is marked by a large presence of administrative services (provincial Administrative Complex and provincial branches of the central government), justice (provincial court and provincial judicial complex), political (Pontevedra provincial council, provincial government delegation), military (provincial defence delegation, BRILAT) and cultural (Pontevedra Museum, Pontevedra Auditorium and Convention Centre, Principal Theatre, faculty of Fine Arts, Afundación cultural centre, Café Moderno).

== History ==
=== Name ===
The name of the city is likely a Latin composite of (bridge) and (old, long established). In Galicia, Latin &quot;pons&quot;, a masculine word, became feminine, hence Vulgar Latin &quot;Ponte Vetera&quot;, which became by the 13th century the modern Galician language toponymy &quot;Pontevedra&quot;, &quot;the old bridge&quot;, in reference to an old Roman bridge across the Lérez River which had been located near the 12th century Burgo bridge that remains in place today.
The name of the town derives from the Latin , which means &quot;old bridge&quot; and refers to the first bridge that the Romans built to cross the Lérez River and the Ria de Pontevedra. However, nowadays there are historians who say that since in ancient Latin, ponto (pontus) meant sea and vedra means green, its name could be due to the particular greenness of the sea caused by the seaweed tides, being the meaning of the name of the city &quot;that of the green sea&quot;.

=== Pre-history and antiquity ===
A local legend relates the foundation of Pontevedra to Teucer, hero of the Trojan War, a legend which was reinforced with the suspicion that Greek traders might have arrived to the Rias Baixas area in ancient times. However, historians and archaeologists tend to agree that the initial settlement was probably formed during the integration of Gallaecia (old Galicia) into the Roman Empire (circa 1st century BC)(Reference is required). The current name of the city is a Latin composite, derived from (bridge) and (old), hence , and thence Galician language , &quot;the old bridge&quot;, in reference to the old Roman bridge across Lérez River. Well-connected since Roman times, Pontevedra consolidated itself as an intermediate town during the Suebic period (circa 5th–6th century AD).
=== Medieval and early modern ===
During the 12th century Pontevedra rose as an important commercial centre; it reached its zenith in the 15th century as a trade and communications hub. Pontevedra was the main Galician urban centre. In fact, Pontevedra has the second largest &quot;old town&quot; in Galicia, only after Santiago de Compostela. Pontevedra was on the route of the Way of Saint James, namely its southern or the Portuguese Way. The Church of the Pilgrim Virgin, with its distinctive scallop-shaped floor plan, is a destination for tourists and pilgrims.

In the 16th century it still was a commercial city, with an increase in fishing. At that time, Pontevedra was the largest Galician port, as it was a secure port open to the sea. One of Christopher Columbus&#x27; ships, the carrack &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, originally named &quot;La Gallega&quot; (&quot;The Galician&quot;), was built in Pontevedra. It was in centuries later that the sedimentation caused by Lérez river gradually rendered the harbour unsuitable for large-scale navigation. The end of the 16th century marked the beginning of the decline of the city, a decline which had already started for the rest of Galicia from the end of the 15th century.

=== Late modern ===
The situation would worsen during the 17th and 18th centuries. The port drastically reduced its activity due to the mentioned geographical causes. Furthermore, political decisions and dynastic conflicts provoked a general decay in trade, thus resulting in the depopulation of the city; the population was reduced in half during that time, also affected by epidemics.
In the beginning of the 19th century fishing, arts and crafts kept the economy going. With the establishment of new provincial division in 1833 Pontevedra saw itself transformed into a provincial capital. The city then grew and became an administrative, cultural and commercial centre. The introduction of the railway also reconnected the city with the rest of the country, after having lost its harbour. All in all, Pontevedra sees in this century a cultural, economic and urban revival. It is in Pontevedra when, in 1853, Xoán Manuel Pintos publishes the first book in modern Galician, &quot;A gaita gallega&quot;.
=== 20th century ===
Pontevedra entered the 20th century with great prospects. The city was at the heart of Galician culture and politics. Galicianists – such as Alexandre Bóveda and Castelao – took up residence in the city, where in 1931 they founded the Partido Galeguista (&quot;Galicianist Party&quot;), the origin of contemporary Galician nationalism. However, the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and subsequent Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975) suddenly ended Pontevedra&#x27;s progression. Political repression and economic hardships forced many to emigrate.
In the 1940s–1960s the government of the Franco dictatorship granted a Free Zone and a Development Pole to the neighbouring city of Vigo, a rare case in Spain (for a city that was not a provincial capital), which favoured the economic development of this city in the province of Pontevedra to the detriment of the provincial capital, Pontevedra, becoming rival cities. The recovery of the local economy only partially began in the 1960s, with the introduction of some industrial activity. However, these very activities would later cause serious environmental and health concerns, forcing the eventual closure of some of them.

With the end of the dictatorship in 1975 the construction sector also developed. Improvements in the communications network during the 1980s and 1990s helped Pontevedra to regain weight in the Rias Baixas region, acting again as a trade hub and focusing on its administrative functions as provincial capital. The introduction of university studies in the city during the 1990s contributed further to the growth of the city. Since 1999 Pontevedra has seen intense urban renewal and cultural revival, positively influencing the local economy.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century the city of Pontevedra has undergone both a cultural renaissance and an urban transformation, taking in the pedestrianisation of the city centre, extension of cycle lanes, recovery of the historical and natural heritage, rehabilitation of buildings and public spaces, and an increase in green areas and pedestrian walkways. Unlike the other six large cities of Galicia, which have lost inhabitants to neighboring municipalities, Pontevedra&#x27;s population is currently increasing. It has become one of the most accessible cities for disabled people, receiving a national prize for this in 2006, along with the international European INTERMODES Urban Mobility Award in 2013, the 2014 Dubai International Best Practices Award for Sustainable Development awarded by UN-Habitat in partnership with Dubai Municipality and the Award of the Center of Active Design in New York City in 2015. Pontevedra&#x27;s model for responsible mobility is currently seen as an international reference.

== Geography ==

=== Physical ===
==== Location and subdivisions ====


The municipality of Pontevedra is located between 42°20&#x27; and 42°30&#x27; north and 8°33&#x27; and 8°41&#x27; west, in the southwestern Galician coast, an area popularly known as &quot;Rias Baixas&quot;. The municipality covers and is about wide from north to south.

The city sits at the end of the ria that bears its name, occupying the valleys of the Lérez and Tomeza rivers. It extends southwards to the mouth of river Verdugo in Ponte Sampaio. It is surrounded by four mountainous regions divided by two faults, one stretching north–south and one from northeast to southwest.

To the north it borders the municipalities of Barro, Moraña and Campo Lameiro; to the east, Cotobade and Ponte Caldelas; to the south, Soutomaior, Vilaboa and Marín, and to the west, Poio and the ria, leading to the Atlantic Ocean.

The main &quot;parroquias&quot; (parishes) of Pontevedra are: Alba, Bora, Campañó, A Canicouva, Cerponzóns, Estribela, Lérez, Lourizán, Marcón, Mourente, Ponte Sampaio, Salcedo, San Xosé, Santa María de Xeve, Tomeza, Verducido, Xeve.

The neighbourhoods or main areas of Pontevedra are: the old town, the city centre-Ensanche, O Burgo, Campolongo, A Moureira, Mollavao, Monte Porreiro, A Parda, A Seca, Valdecorvos, Salgueiriños, Gorgullón. The residential area of A Caeira, although officially located in the municipality of Poio, is often considered as just another neighbourhood of Pontevedra since the vast majority of the residents work in Pontevedra and relate to the city.

==== Climate ====
Pontevedra has a humid oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average temperature is , with a daily average of in January and in July. These are unusually mild for a city so far north, and are due to Pontevedra&#x27;s proximity to the sea and to the moderating effect of the ria. Yet, like all the Galician coast, Pontevedra is subject to occasional Atlantic storms in winter. These are characterised by a quick drop in temperature, rain and gales. With eleven of the twelve months above Pontevedra is in the maritime subtropical climate zone under the Trewartha climate classification, a classification it falls short of under the Köppen classification due to the cool summer nights.

Overall Pontevedra, as Galicia, is rainy, especially at the end of autumn and winter, with an annual average precipitation of , and around 134 rainy days per year. Summer is drier, generally speaking, making Pontevedra the sunniest city in Galicia with 2248 hours of sunshine per year.

== Demographics ==
The municipality of Pontevedra is composed of the city of Pontevedra and fifteen rural parishes in close proximity, with a total population of 83,260 (as of 2020). This results in a relative high density of population of 710.1 inhabitants per square kilometre. More than two-thirds of the population live in the city, and less than one-third in the rural parishes.

The population of Pontevedra is aging, with generational replacement is not necessarily assured, although the city&#x27;s population has been gradually growing since 1999. Broken down by age, 15.93% of the population were senior citizens, 69% between 15 and 65 years, and just 15.01% under the 15 years of age. The natality rate (9.8‰) is only +1.8 over the mortality rate (8‰). The migrational balance is slightly positive (+350 people in 2006). According to the local authorities Pontevedra is, since 1999, the fastest growing Galician city, with an average of +1000 more inhabitants per year. Pontevedra is the city with the youngest population in Galicia and northwest Spain and the Galician city that attracts the most people to live in, together with Santiago de Compostela. It is the Galician city with the best rate of natural increase (RNI).

According to the 2001 census, 29.6% of the population have Galician as their mother tongue, where 32.1% speak it &quot;often&quot;. The remaining 38.3% speak Castilian as their native language or speak mostly in Castilian

=== Immigration ===
In 2022, a total of 4818 foreigners resided in the city, of which, by continent, the most important were citizens of America mainly from South America and especially from Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil, although also from Peru, Argentina, Dominican Republic and United States and citizens from Europe, mainly citizens from other European Union countries, such as Portugal, Italy, Romania, United Kingdom, France and Germany. Behind them are African citizens, mainly from Morocco and Senegal, and Asians from China.

== Urban planning and living environment ==
Pontevedra has a pedestrian city centre, which includes the old town and the city centre or first urban expansion area with streets such as General Gutiérrez Mellado and Daniel de la Sota among many others and squares such as Glorieta de Compostela or Concepción Arenal, which, together with parks such as Las Palmeras (the Palm Trees Park) and squares, make the city very pleasant to walk in and give it a high quality of life.
An island on the Lérez, opposite a remarkable cable-stayed bridge dating from 1995 (the Tirantes Bridge, the &quot;Strap Bridge&quot;) and next to the modern Pontevedra Auditorium and Convention Centre shelters the city&#x27;s green lung, the famous Island of Sculptures park. It is a space where international artists such as Robert Morris, Ulrich Rückriem, Anne and Patrick Poirier, Giovanni Anselmo, Richard Long, Ian Hamilton Finlay or Jenny Holzer have left their works.

Another large park, the Xunqueira de Alba, is located near the Burgo district, in front of the tied-arch bridge Currents Bridge, inaugurated in 2012.

=== Pedestrianization ===
The capital of the province of Pontevedra has become one of the most pedestrianised cities in Spain. The old city and much of the city centre are pedestrianized, so that in these neighbourhoods, motorized transport is limited to residents and services.

In 1999 Pontevedra began its transformation process by pedestrianizing its old town. In the following years, the city centre and some other streets on the outskirts of Pontevedra were pedestrianised too. In 2010, Pontevedra was the first provincial capital in Spain to reduce the maximum speed in the city centre to 30 kilometres per hour and in 2019 to 10 kilometres per hour in the city centre.
In Pontevedra, the Metrominuto pedestrian plan was created for urban mobility, which with the urban transformation of the city has won many national and international awards such as the international European INTERMODES Urban Mobility Award in 2013 and the 2014 Dubai International Best Practices Award for Sustainable Development awarded by UN-Habitat in partnership with Dubai Municipality. The Metrominuto is a map based on the aesthetics of metro maps, which marks the pedestrian distances between the most important points of the city and the time it takes to travel them. The Metrominuto has been used as a model in other European cities such as Toulouse in France, Florence, Ferrara Modena and Cagliari in Italy, Poznań in Poland and the Angel district in London. In Spain, it has inspired other cities such Zaragoza, Seville, Cádiz, Salamanca, Granada, Jerez de la Frontera, A Coruña and Pamplona. As a result, 65% of trips in the city centre are made on foot. Pontevedra was recognized in 2016 as one of the 15 best cycling cities in the world. The urban model of the city of Pontevedra follows the models of other European cities such as Amsterdam, Bruges or Copenhagen.
The urban transformation of Pontevedra and measures to reduce motorized traffic in the city centre have reduced by 67% the emissions of from fossil fuels in the capital since 1999 and have been reported by foreign and French television channels such as France 2, France 3, Canal+ or TF1 and the Swiss channel Radio Télévision Suisse RTS and other foreign televisions like Das Erste, NDR1 and ZDF in Germany, MBC TV in South Korea, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Canada or Seven Network in Australia. The city has also been featured in reports by English-language channels and publications such as Bloomberg Television, Fast Company and Outrider (United States) or the Daily Express and The Guardian (United Kingdom).

=== Transport ===
As regards public transport, Pontevedra has two urban bus lines in the city centre:
* Line 1 (red), 8.4 kilometres long, connects the Monte Porreiro neighbourhood, one of the most populated in the city with more than 7,000 inhabitants and where the Regional Centre of the National University of Distance Education (UNED) is located, to the A Xunqueira neighbourhood and to the train and bus stations and has 19 stops.
* Line 2 (blue) is 7.6 kilometres long and connects the Monte Porreiro district with the Montecelo Hospital and Galicia Square in the Campolongo district, with 15 stops.
There is also a high frequency urban bus service between Pontevedra and Marín, which is located in the metropolitan area of Pontevedra and with which the city forms a virtual urban continuum.

Pontevedra is well connected by road and rail. It sits on the A Coruña-Tui railway and motorway corridor. Pontevedra bus station has multiple connections with other cities in Spain, Galicia and abroad. Pontevedra railway station is located between the Galician capital Santiago de Compostela (58 km to the north) and the largest Galician municipality, Vigo (30 km to the south). Renfe also has a Pontevedra-University railway stop in the city to serve the A Xunqueira university campus and the Monte Porreiro, Tafisa and A Seca neighbourhoods. Pontevedra city itself does not have an airport in its municipality but the city is relatively close to the airports of &quot;Lavacolla&quot; to the north (in the municipality of Santiago de Compostela) and &quot;Peinador&quot; to the south (in the municipalities of Redondela, Mos and Vigo). A good network of roads and motorways efficiently connects Pontevedra with the other Galician cities, and also with Portugal (55 km to the south), and inland (100 km to the eastern city of Ourense). Regular bus lines link Pontevedra with other Galician cities and towns, as well as with Madrid, Porto and Lisbon (among others).

The AVE high-speed train (in Spanish &quot;Tren de alta velocidad&quot;, or TAV) reaches Pontevedra and the city is a stop on the &quot;Atlantic Line&quot;, running from the northern Galician city of A Coruña to Lisbon (Portugal). Likewise, Pontevedra will benefit from the high-speed train connecting Galicia and central Spain. That Galician connection will be fully operational in 2022.

Despite the fact that Pontevedra was once the main Galician port, at present the Pontevedra harbour is only used for recreational purposes, not for cargo or passenger transportation. Neighbouring Marín is a major military and commercial harbour 7 km away. The Pontevedra marina is close to the old town and the commercial and fishing port of Marín and Ria de Pontevedra, 5 kilometres west of the city centre.

== Landmarks ==
Thanks to a remarkable old town, the surrounding landscape and its former medieval port, Pontevedra has been defined as a &quot;charming city&quot; and &quot;an authentic Galician city&quot;. Tourist attractions include many religious and civil buildings as well as picturesque medieval squares.

=== Picturesque medieval squares ===

The medieval squares of the old town of Pontevedra and those of its first urban expansion stand out as small rooms with regular and geometric proportions. Many of them evoke with their trade names the activities that took place centuries ago: Plaza of firewood, vegetables, the stone quarry, the blacksmith&#x27;s, the quay...

Plaza de la Herrería 
Blacksmith&#x27;s square is the main square of the city; it is the most popular because of the daily crowds. With arches in two of its ends, with the gardens of the Plaza of Orense and the Herrería fountain at the corner of the church and convent of St. Francis. It is lined with camellias typical of the Rias Baixas. It owes its name to the blacksmiths who, in the 15th century, tempered the iron in the ovens and forges of its arcades for the weapons and paving stones that the Catholic Monarchs had asked them to manufacture. It was the place where the Feira Franca was held, granted to the city by King Henry IV. Here you will find the historic Carabela coffee shop, and other traditional coffees such as Savoy.

Plaza de la Peregrina 
In the heart of the pedestrian centre of Pontevedra, the Pilgrim Virgin Square is the city&#x27;s main meeting point. It is presided over by the Church of the Pilgrim Virgin and was located outside the walls, very close to the Trabancas gate of the old Pontevedra wall. This is where the pillory where the prisoners were executed was located.

Teucer square 

With perfect geometric dimensions and framed by orange trees, it is surrounded by noble buildings, with the 18th century Gago and Montenegro Palace standing out on the north side, where the great coat of arms of 1716 is to be seen on the façade. On the east side, overlooking Royal Street, there is a stone fountain with night lighting.

Plaza de la Leña 
The Firewood Square is the most representative and picturesque typical Galician square in Galicia. With a calvary in its centre and popular houses with arcades on one side and the Baroque houses of the Pontevedra Museum on the other. It owes its name to the firewood that was sold here in the past to heat Pontevedra&#x27;s kitchens.

Plaza de la Verdura 
Regularly proportioned, on the Vegetables square there are houses with coats of arms and a 19th-century forge fountain. This is where the House of Light is located, which commemorates the fact that Pontevedra was the first Galician city to have electricity in the 19th century. Today it is the headquarters of the Pontevedra Tourist Office. The square is very lively, to which the atmosphere of the many Galician taverns and tapas bars contributes.
Plaza de la Pedreira 
The Stone Quarry square is so called because of the stone-cutting activities developed here by stonemasons for the city&#x27;s works and constructions. Also called Plaza of Mugartegui, because of the baroque mansion in its center.
Plaza de Méndez Núñez 
In the centre of the old town, there is the 15th century house with a stone coat of arms (showing the arms of the Lemos, Taboada and Bugarín) of Cru and Montenegro, which crosses Don Gonzalo Street with its pointed arch. In its centre is a bronze statue of Valle-Inclán, the work of the sculptor César Lombera. The sculpture is in this square because it was there that the writer used to meet other intellectuals when he lived in Pontevedra.
Plaza de Curros Enríquez 
Triangular square where you can admire the French attic of the house on the north side and one of the 19th century forge fountains.
Praza do Peirao 
The Quay Square is the name given to the docks of the medieval port of Pontevedra. There is a stone fountain in its centre and a 1930s house on the south side which now belongs to the official school of quantity surveyors.
Praza das Cinco Rúas 
It is so called because it is where the two parts of Isabel II Street and Baron, Charino and San Nicolás Streets meet. Filled with tapas bars. It is worth noting the stone calvary of 1773, decorated at its base with a very expressive representation of the time when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and of the house in which the writer Valle-Inclán lived.

Plaza Alonso de Fonseca (former Plaza de Santa María) 
In the Plaza of Santa Maria there is the Basilica of Santa Maria la Mayor in the background and a stone cross that was originally on the Burgo Bridge, the Mendoza Mansion and a typical 19th century forge fountain in the city. Underneath the square is the Interpretation Centre of the Archbishopric Towers which, until the 19th century, were located on the site currently occupied by the Mendoza Mansion.

Praza de España 
Pontevedra main pedestrian square is the link between the old town and Alameda and the expansion of the official and administrative city of the 19th century (Provincial Council, Government Delegation, Valle-Inclán High School (modernist of the early 20th century) and the City Hall). It has two underground car parks.

Plaza de San José 
It is in the square of St. Joseph that stands the monument to the Tertulia, a bronze monument, officially called the Literary Circle in Modern Coffee, recalling that Pontevedra was the cradle of Galician intellectuals in the early twentieth century, it is formed by several intellectuals drinking coffee. At the top of the former Pontevedra Savings Bank building is a large bronze sculpture, 6 metres high, of the Greek hero Teucer statue, the mythical founder of the city.
It is also remarkable the former sailors&#x27; area of &quot;A Moureira&quot; near Corbaceiras Avenue. Other more modern emblematic squares in the city are the Plaza de Barcelos and the Plaza de Galicia.

== Administration and politics ==
Pontevedra is a provincial and &quot;comarcal&quot; (shire/county, with no administrative role) capital, as well as seat of the district court. The city hosts the headquarters of the provincial government as well as offices of the Galician government, in addition to offices representing the Spanish government. The city provides a wide range of administrative services with an effect reaching far beyond its municipal limits. This makes Pontevedra a focal point for intense political struggles.

=== Governance ===

Since the restoration of democracy in 1977 after the dictatorship, Pontevedra&#x27;s local government had traditionally been controlled by the conservative People&#x27;s Party of Galicia (&quot;Partido Popular de Galicia&quot;, PPdeG-PP). However, after the 1999 elections the office of mayor was won by Miguel Anxo Fernández Lores, representing the Galician Nationalist Bloc (&quot;Bloque Nacionalista Galego&quot;, BNG), in coalition with the Socialists&#x27; Party of Galicia (&quot;Partido Socialista de Galicia&quot;, PSdeG-PSOE), until today. The local corporation is divided into a number of departments, or &quot;concellarias&quot;, each one dealing with a specific issue such as Planning, Environment, Revenue, Mobility and Transportation, Sports, Public Works, or Tourism.

=== Capital city ===

The city is the capital of the province of Pontevedra, and is therefore home to the provincial, autonomous and Central Government administrative bodies.

In the provincial aspect, the Provincial Deputation of Pontevedra stands out, which offers the municipalities of the province different services (fire extinction, sports...) and is in charge of its government and administration.

On an autonomous level, the city has the Xunta de Galicia which, since the last reform of the Autonomous Administration, brings together the representation of all the areas of the Autonomous Government in Pontevedra. Since 2008, the Provincial Offices of the Xunta de Galicia offer their services in a large central building presided over by two twin towers built in the Administrative City in María Victoria Moreno Avenue 43, which agglutinates most of the provincial delegations, except some such as that of Environment, Territory and Infrastructures, located in another building very close to the Xunta de Galicia in Alcalde Hevia street.

Representing the Central Government is the Subdelegation of the Government, the former Civil Government, functionally dependent on the Delegate of the Government in Galicia, located in the Plaza de España, as well as the location in the city of the peripheral services of the State (provincial departments of the different ministries such as the &quot;Defence Department&quot;, provincial service of Shorelines, Provincial Service of Agriculture and Fishing, Provincial Service of Telecommunications (the latter located in the old building of the Bank of Spain).

It also houses other provincial bodies dependent on the Ministry of the Interior such as the Provincial Traffic Headquarters, the Provincial Police Department, the Provincial Headquarters of the Civil Guard as the capital of the province.
== Economy ==
Pontevedra has traditionally been a trading city. In the Middle Ages, guilds thrived in the old town, giving name to streets and squares still preserved today. During the 16thC Pontevedra was the main Galician port, providing for a very intense fishing and sea-trading activity.

In the 1833 territorial division of Spain Galicia was sub-divided into four provinces, and Pontevedra became capital of its own province. The city then became an administrative and commercial centre, in contrast with Vigo, which attracted the industrial activity, after Franco&#x27;s dictatorship gave this city a free-trade zone and a Development Pole in 1947. In fact, the first modern industries to appear in Pontevedra would only do so in the 1960s.

Currently, the tertiary sector employs 65 per cent of the population, while industry employs 17 per cent. Industrial activity is reduced to a handful of companies, namely pulp mills (where the municipal authority is seeking the closure of the ENCE biofactory) and construction. The tertiary sector is not especially dynamic, although a number of policies have been implemented to improve the situation. Tourism is increasing, with visitors coming mostly from Spain and Portugal. The total unemployment rate is 7% (June 2021), according to data from the Xunta de Galicia (Galician Government). Pontevedra was the seat of the &quot;Caixa de Pontevedra&quot; credit union, eventually merged into other entities up to the current Abanca.

=== Service sector ===

The majority of Pontevedra&#x27;s citizens work in the service sector, which is evident when one considers that the city is the head of an area of influence of some 210,000 inhabitants, which means the existence of an important and diversified commercial sector. To this must be added its privileged location in the centre of the Rias Baixas, which makes it a tourist city and gives an important specific weight to the hotel industry in the economy. The city ranks among the Spanish cities with the highest annual income.

The exhaustion of the soil of industrial estate O Campiño and the lack of development of more industrial land in the municipality of Pontevedra has led to the development of estates in areas of metropolitan area of Pontevedra such as Ponte Caldelas, Barro-Meis, Poio or Marín.

An ancient town and medieval port, Pontevedra has been described as a &quot;definitive old Galician town&quot;. Sights include the pilgrim chapel in the &quot;Praza da Peregrina&quot;, the historic &quot;Zona Monumental&quot; (old city), the &quot;Praza de Leña&quot;, the market, and the &quot;Alameda&quot;, a promenade along the ria. Pontevedra has a large pedestrian centre (the old town and surroundings) which, together with a number of parks and public squares, makes the city very pleasant for strolling. In recent years most historical buildings and streets have been either re-built or revamped, providing for a well preserved urban landscape.

<doc id="291874" wikidata="Q3493345" url="?curid=291874" title="SPARK (programming language)">
<text>SPARK is a formally defined computer programming language based on the Ada language, intended for developing high integrity software used in systems where predictable and highly reliable operation is essential. It facilitates developing applications that demand safety, security, or business integrity.

Originally, three versions of SPARK existed (SPARK83, SPARK95, SPARK2005), based on Ada 83, Ada 95, and Ada 2005 respectively.

A fourth version, SPARK 2014, based on Ada 2012, was released on April 30, 2014. SPARK 2014 is a complete re-design of the language and supporting verification tools.

The SPARK language consists of a well-defined subset of the Ada language that uses contracts to describe the specification of components in a form that is suitable for both static and dynamic verification.

In SPARK83/95/2005, the contracts are encoded in Ada comments and so are ignored by any standard Ada compiler, but are processed by the SPARK &quot;Examiner&quot; and its associated tools.

SPARK 2014, in contrast, uses Ada 2012&#x27;s built-in syntax of &quot;aspects&quot; to express contracts, bringing them into the core of the language. The main tool for SPARK 2014 (GNATprove) is based on the GNAT/GCC infrastructure, and re-uses almost all of the GNAT Ada 2012 front-end.

== Technical overview ==
SPARK utilises the strengths of Ada while trying to eliminate all its potential ambiguities and insecure constructs. SPARK programs are by design meant to be unambiguous, and their behavior is required to be unaffected by the choice of Ada compiler. These goals are achieved partly by omitting some of Ada&#x27;s more problematic features (such as unrestricted parallel tasking) and partly by introducing contracts that encode the application designer&#x27;s intentions and requirements for certain components of a program.

The combination of these approaches allows SPARK to meet its design objectives, which are:
* logical soundness
* rigorous formal definition
* simple semantics
* security
* expressive power
* verifiability
* bounded resource (space and time) requirements.
* minimal runtime system requirements

== Contract examples ==
Consider the Ada subprogram specification below:

 procedure Increment (X : in out Counter_Type);

In pure Ada, this might increment the variable codice_1 by one or one thousand; or it might set some global counter to codice_1 and return the original value of the counter in codice_1; or it might do nothing with codice_1.

With SPARK 2014, contracts are added to the code to provide more information regarding what a subprogram actually does. For example, the above specification may be altered to say:

 procedure Increment (X : in out Counter_Type)
 with Global =&gt; null,
 Depends =&gt; (X =&gt; X);

This specifies that the codice_5 procedure uses no (neither update nor read) global variable and that the only data item used in calculating the new value of codice_1 is codice_1 alone.

Alternatively, may be specified:

 procedure Increment (X : in out Counter_Type)
 with Global =&gt; (In_Out =&gt; Count),
 Depends =&gt; (Count =&gt; (Count, X),
 X =&gt; null);

This specifies that codice_5 will use the global variable codice_9 in the same package as codice_5, that the exported value of codice_9 depends on the imported values of codice_9 and codice_1, and that the exported value of codice_1 does not depend on any variables at all and it will be derived from constant data only.

If GNATprove is then run on the specification and corresponding body of a subprogram, it will analyse the body of the subprogram to build up a model of the information flow. This model is then compared against what has been specified by the annotations and any discrepancies reported to the user.

These specifications can be further extended by asserting various properties that either need to hold when a subprogram is called (&quot;preconditions&quot;) or that will hold once execution of the subprogram has completed (&quot;postconditions&quot;). For example, if writing:

 procedure Increment (X : in out Counter_Type)
 with Global =&gt; null,
 Depends =&gt; (X =&gt; X),
 Pre =&gt; X &lt; Counter_Type&#x27;Last,
 Post =&gt; X = X&#x27;Old + 1;

This, now, specifies not only that codice_1 is derived from itself alone, but also that before codice_5 is called codice_1 must be strictly less than the last possible value of its type (to ensure that the result will never overflow) and that afterward codice_1 will be equal to the initial value of codice_1 plus one.

== Verification conditions ==
GNATprove can also generate a set of verification conditions (VCs). These are used to establish whether certain properties hold for a given subprogram. At a minimum, the GNATprove will generate VCs to establish that all run-time errors cannot occur within a subprogram, such as:
* array index out of range
* type range violation
* division by zero
* numerical overflow

If a postcondition or any other assertion is added to a subprogram, GNATprove will also generate VCs that require the user to show that these properties hold for all possible paths through the subprogram.

Under the hood, GNATprove uses the Why3 intermediate language and VC Generator, and the CVC4, Z3, and Alt-Ergo theorem provers to discharge VCs. Use of other provers (including interactive proof checkers) is also possible through other components of the Why3 toolset.

== History ==
The first version of SPARK (based on Ada 83) was produced at the University of Southampton (with UK Ministry of Defence sponsorship) by Bernard Carré and Trevor Jennings. The name &quot;SPARK&quot; was derived from &quot;SPADE Ada Kernel&quot;, in reference to the &quot;SPADE&quot; subset of the Pascal programming language.

Subsequently the language was progressively extended and refined, first by Program Validation Limited and then by Praxis Critical Systems Limited. In 2004, Praxis Critical Systems Limited changed its name to Praxis High Integrity Systems Limited. In January 2010, the company became Altran Praxis.

In early 2009, Praxis formed a partnership with AdaCore, and released &quot;SPARK Pro&quot; under the terms of the GPL. This was followed in June 2009 by the SPARK GPL Edition 2009, aimed at the free and open-source software (FOSS) and academic communities.

In June 2010, Altran-Praxis announced that the SPARK programming language would be used in the software of US Lunar project &quot;CubeSat&quot;, expected to be completed in 2015.

In January 2013, Altran-Praxis changed its name to Altran, which in April 2021 became Capgemini Engineering (following Altran&#x27;s merger with Capgemini).

The first Pro release of SPARK 2014 was announced on April 30, 2014, and was quickly followed by the SPARK 2014 GPL edition, aimed at the FLOSS and academic communities.

== Industrial applications ==

=== Safety-related systems ===
SPARK has been used in several high profile safety-critical systems, covering commercial aviation (Rolls-Royce Trent series jet engines, the ARINC ACAMS system, the Lockheed Martin C130J), military aviation (EuroFighter Typhoon, Harrier GR9, AerMacchi M346), air-traffic management (UK NATS iFACTS system), rail (numerous signalling applications), medical (the LifeFlow ventricular assist device), and space applications (the Vermont Technical College CubeSat project).

=== Security-related systems ===
SPARK has also been used in secure systems development. Users include Rockwell Collins (Turnstile and SecureOne cross-domain solutions), the development of the original MULTOS CA, the NSA Tokeneer demonstrator, the secunet multi-level workstation, the Muen separation kernel and Genode block-device encrypter.

In August 2010, Rod Chapman, principal engineer of Altran Praxis, implemented Skein, one of candidates for SHA-3, in SPARK. In comparing the performance of the SPARK and C implementations and after careful optimization, he managed to have the SPARK version run only about 5 to 10% slower than C. Later improvement to the Ada middle-end in GCC (implemented by Eric Botcazou of AdaCore) closed the gap, with the SPARK code matching the C in performance exactly.

NVIDIA have also adopted SPARK for the implementation of security-critical firmware.

In 2020, Rod Chapman re-implemented the TweetNaCl cryptographic library in SPARK 2014. The SPARK version of the library has a complete auto-active proof of type-safety, memory-safety and some correctness properties, and retains constant-time algorithms throughout. The SPARK code is also significantly faster than TweetNaCl.

<text>Robert Priest (born 10 July 1951, in Walton-on-Thames, England) is a Canadian poet, children&#x27;s author and singer-songwriter. He has written eighteen books of poetry, four children&#x27;s novels, four children&#x27;s albums, and six CDs of songs and poems. Under the alias &quot;Dr Poetry&quot;, he has also written and performed two seasons of poetry on CBC Radio&#x27;s spoken-word show &quot;Wordbeat&quot; and is well known for his aphorisms and the No. 1 Alannah Myles hit &quot;Song Instead of a Kiss&quot;. Of his adult poetry, The Pacific Rim Review has written &quot;He is certainly one of the most imaginatively inventive poets in the country,&quot; while critic Bernice Lever has opined &quot;Robert Priest’s poems will speak to many generations.&quot; Robert&#x27;s children&#x27;s poetry is also much praised. &quot;His poetry for children is almost miraculous&quot; gushed pre-eminent children&#x27;s literature critic Michele Landsberg, &quot;It is almost pure celebration.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described his selected poems as &quot;passionate, cocky, alternately adoring and insulting.&quot; Priest&#x27;s plays, novels and songs have earned him awards and recognition in Canadian literary circles and a growing worldwide readership. His 2022 CD of songs &quot;Love is Hard&quot; produced by Bob Wiseman is currently streaming worldwide and available for download on &#x27;CDbaby&#x27;.

==Biography==
Born in 1951, his family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, at the age of four. His father spent seven years in the British Navy, and his mother, a part-time standup comedian was a member of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), popularly known as the Wrens. Growing up in Scarborough, Priest developed a love of literature from the fanciful stories his mother often told before bedtime and later from the books available to him from the bookmobile – a mobile public library. By the age of eight, Priest says, he had already begun to dream of becoming a writer. In 1970 he entered the University of Waterloo to study mathematics, but, much more compelled to write poetry dropped out after one semester. Since his first book of poetry (&quot;The Visible Man&quot;, 1979), he has published eighteen more books of poetry, four plays, four children&#x27;s/young adult novels and many articles in Toronto&#x27;s Now Magazine. He is also a singer-songwriter of note, having released six rock albums for adults and three collections of children&#x27;s music. He also wrote and performed numerous children&#x27;s songs for CBC radio&#x27;s &quot;Is Anybody Home&quot; and for the long-running television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. A song he cowrote with Nancy Simmonds and Alannah Myles was a number one hit in Canada and is still played all around the world. He lives in Toronto with Marsha Kirzner.

==Awards and recognition==
The author of 23 books of poetry and prose, he won the Milton Acorn Memorial People&#x27;s Poetry Award for &quot;The Mad Hand&quot; (1988). Under his &quot;Dr. Poetry&quot; alias, Robert wrote and performed thirteen segments for CBC radio&#x27;s spoken-word show &quot;Wordbeat&quot;. As a songwriter, he co-wrote (with Alannah Myles and Nancy Simmonds) the hit, &quot;Song Instead of a Kiss&quot; which rose to the top of the charts for two weeks in Canada and maintained that position for six weeks in Quebec earning Robert a SOCAN airplay award. It still receives considerable airplay all around the world. His aphorisms have appeared in the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; and &quot;Colombo&#x27;s Canadian Quotations&quot;. He is the author of four plays, including &quot;The Coming&quot;, which was co-written with Leon Rooke. Priest&#x27;s musical play &quot;Minibugs and Microchips&quot; received a Chalmers Award. His novel, &quot;Knights of the Endless Day&quot; (1993) was the recipient of an Our Choice Award from the Canadian Children&#x27;s Book Centre. Among his volumes of children&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Daysongs Nightsongs&quot; and &quot;The Secret Invasion of Bananas and Other Poems&quot; (2002) are on a recommended reading list compiled by the CBC. His book of poems &quot;Reading the Bible Backwards&quot; (2008 ECW Press) reached number 2 on the Canadian poetry charts its sales exceeded only by those of Leonard Cohen. His 2013 book of poems for children and young adults &quot;Rosa Rose&quot; (Wolsak &amp; Wynn) won a Silver Moonbeam Award and was a book of honour in the Lion and the Unicorn award for poetry in the North American category at Johns Hopkins University while its sequel&quot;The Wolf is Back&quot; won the Gold Moonbeam Award for best book of children&#x27;s poems in the Americas. His fantasy trilogy &quot;Spell Crossed&quot; was the winner of an Our Choice Award and has been described as a modern classic. A collection of songs: &#x27;Love is Hard&#x27; produced by Bob Wiseman was released in 2020 and is available world-wide on the streaming services and through CDbaby. In 2022 Robert co-wrote the lead-off single for Julian Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Beyond the Reservoir&quot;, &quot;S.E.E.D.S.&quot;, which was a top 5 hit on the CBC&#x27;s Music Chart. Robert&#x27;s most recent book of adult poetry &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love the River&quot; was published in the fall of 2022 by ECW Press. 2024 saw the release of the Jaymz Bee produced collection: &quot;People Like You and Me&quot; which featured a mix of poems and songs backed by the cream of Toronto&#x27;s jazz musicians. A new volume of poetry &quot;Accidents After Happening&quot; will be published in Fall of 2025 by ECW Press.

<text>Turbonegro (Turboneger in Norway) is a Norwegian rock band, active from 1989 to 1998 and from 2002 to the present. The band combines glam rock, punk rock, and hard rock into a self-described &quot;deathpunk&quot; musical style.

==History==

===Early years (1989–1994)===
Turbonegro formed in Oslo during the winter of 1988–1989. The initial lineup consisted of Thomas Seltzer (a.k.a. Happy-Tom), Vegard Heskestad, Pål Bøttger Kjærnes, Rune Grønn, Pål Erik Carlin and Tor-Kristian &quot;TK&quot; Jenssen. Seltzer and Heskestad had formerly performed in a band called &quot;De Dype&quot; – a noisy and subversive ensemble inspired by American rock band Butthole Surfers. Early Turbonegro continued that conceptional style.

Turbonegro played their first show in March 1989 at Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen, Denmark. In April, they played their home town of Oslo for the first time. In the following weeks, they recorded their debut single &quot;Route Zero&quot; and additional songs for their &quot;Turboloid&quot; 12&quot; EP. Both records were released by Thomas Seltzer&#x27;s label, Straitjacket Records, which he started in 1983 to release the EP of his first band &quot;Akutt Innleggelse&quot;. The first session was recorded at Nesodden Musikkverksted by Christian Calmeyer. Seltzer played bass and drums on &quot;Route Zero&quot;. An initial pressing of 50 copies came with an exclusive demo tape called &quot;Computech,&quot; featuring a cover of The Stooges&#x27; song &quot;1970&quot;.

The early pre-deathpunk Turbonegro sound featured fairly tormented and distorted noise rock (contemporary reviews compared the band&#x27;s sound to Halo of Flies or early Mudhoney). &quot;Turboloid&quot; was the second and last release by the original lineup. Drummer Carlos Carrasco left to play guitar for Anal Babes.

In 1990, &quot;Route Zero&quot; was reissued by Sympathy for the Record Industry with two additional songs from the &quot;Turboloid&quot; EP. In September of that year, Turbonegro left for a three-week tour of the United States. Hours after their arrival in Minneapolis, Grønn was beaten by local denizens and, as a result, hospitalized. The band continued touring without him, but the tour was unsuccessful. Three weeks after the tour began, the band returned to Oslo.

In the winter of 1990, Seltzer reformed Turbonegro with Kjærnes and Grønn. Norwegian punk veteran Harald Fossberg, who had gained fame in the late 1970s with Norwegian punk pioneers Hærverk, was recruited as the new singer. Bengt &quot;Bingo&quot; Calmeyer soon joined the band on bass guitar. In the summer of 1991, the new lineup released the &quot;Vaya Con Satan&quot; 7&quot; in the U.S., followed by their 1992 debut album of &quot;Hot Cars and Spent Contraceptives&quot; on Big Ball Records. Both the single and the CD introduced the world to deathpunk, Turbonegro&#x27;s self-acclaimed genre.

The musical pre-settings were anticipating later &quot;Ass Cobra&quot; era – dark death-driven punk rock with occasional excursions into hardcore and metal, as well as a tendency to disruptive and sarcastic lyrics. Swedish broadcasting DJ Lars Aldman once described their sound as, &quot;Radio Birdman meets Venom in an institution for sexually abused retards,&quot; and Danish &quot;Moshable&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;One great big hunk of an album that simply barfs up the best in Scandinavian punk rock - and then slam it into overdrive. So fucking punk that it will tear you a new asshole - and then some!&quot;

In December 1992, Turbonegro began a ruinous tour outside Norway. With money left from a grant, they went for one gig confirmed in Ålborg, Denmark, then headed south to Hamburg, Germany, where they became stranded in an unsuccessful search for an opportunity to play. After five days, the band ran out of money, but then they were able to make contacts with Gravy Train Agency, who organized several tours for Turbonegro outside Scandinavia in later years, as well as people from Crypt Records.

In late March 1993, Fossberg played his last show with Turbonegro at Sentrum Scene in Oslo. He quit for health reasons and was replaced by Hans Erik Husby (a.k.a. Hank von Helvete), who would become their best known vocalist. With the new singer, the band was renamed Stierkampf (German for &quot;bullfight&quot;). They opened up for Poison Idea in Oslo and Denmark, as well as the Ramones in August 1993 at the Oslo Rock Festival.

The band&#x27;s only professional release as Stierkampf was the &quot;Grunge Whore&quot; EP on Sympathy for the Record Industry. All songs on this release would resurface on their next album, with the exception of &quot;Six Pack&quot;. Their second album &quot;Never Is Forever&quot; (1994) was recorded by Christian Calmeyer at Nesodden Musikkverksted, and was self-released (limited to 1,200 copies) with a friend at Oslo Musikk Distribusjon. In their own words, this second album was &quot;a tribute to Blue Öyster Cult&quot;, an attempt to dissociate from the lo-fi aesthetics of the garage. &quot;When the rest of the punk oriented world tried hard to be lo-fi and &#x27;real&#x27;, Turbonegro as usual went the opposite way, creating a miniature suburban deathpunk opera. Seldom have pop culture, darkness and desperation blended so well.&quot; The release of this album followed their first full European Tour, which was nicknamed &quot;Nihil Jung&quot; and had 17 shows in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands.

By the winter of 1994–1995, the band had reclaimed the name Turbonegro, but had a new look referred to as the &quot;Al Jolson schtick&quot;, though it did not last long. Happy-Tom summed it up with an anecdote, &quot;So there we were backstage with our black faces and wigs and little hats, smoking pot with our all-time heroes the Bad Brains, and the absurdity just didn&#x27;t cross our minds. I mean, those guys didn&#x27;t mention it, they were probably just embarrassed on our behalf.&quot;

===New look and new sound, rise to success (1995–1997)===
The gag was long gone by May 1995 when they debuted the denim and moustache look. Happy-Tom said, &quot;We feel that denim out-rocks leather at all levels. Leather is for empty, little people. Denim is for us big guys! And the kids love it!&quot; With a new look came a new sound. Calmeyer, their engineer at the time, said, &quot;We decided to make things more raw, trying to convey the power of the live performance, if not the sound.&quot;

The first recordings of the new and improved Turbonegro were the &quot;Denim Demon&quot; and &quot;Bad Mongo&quot; singles in the spring of 1995. That summer, Turbonegro left for their second attempt at a U.S. tour, &quot;Namblin in the 90&#x27;s&quot;. They played only 11 shows. In the words of Happy-Tom, &quot;at least we didn&#x27;t get the shit kicked out of us like we did the last time we were in the USA&quot;. In the fall of 1995, Bingo and Pål left the band, putting Turbonegro on hold. Pål wanted to travel, while Bingo didn&#x27;t like the new musical direction (&quot;less Slayer, more rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot;) Happy-Tom, at the same time, was suffering from stress injuries to his arms after the U.S. tour. Therefore, agreements were made to put the band on hold for a while.

In that same year, Anthony Martin started his new label, Boomba Records, in order to release Turbonegro&#x27;s third album &quot;Ass Cobra&quot;. It did not come out until the spring of 1996 and, by September, they were touring Europe again with a new lineup. Anders Gerner from Angst was added as the new drummer, so Happy-Tom returned to playing bass. Pål was replaced by Knut Schreiner, with whom Happy-Tom had played in The Vikings. Knut (a.k.a. Euroboy) was added to the band to help reshape their sound. The &quot;Prince of the Rodeo&quot; 7&quot; was Euroboy&#x27;s recording debut with Turbonegro.

Also at this time, Pamparius returned from traveling in Thailand to open his &quot;Pamparius&quot; pizza parlor outside Oslo in Kolbotn. He decided to rejoin the band as the keyboard player and dancer. His return would be the final touch in the latest incarnation of the band. The new look, sound and album irritated and fascinated the European underground. People were starting to pay attention to Turbonegro.

In December and January, Turbonegro continued touring with 14 more dates in Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and Denmark. The insignia of their stage performance – the bulging denim, make-up, Hank&#x27;s routine of sticking a lit Roman candle in his butt-crack, Happy-Tom&#x27;s sailor hat, Euroboy&#x27;s lithesome and sultry guitar choreography, and Hank&#x27;s attempts at addressing the audience in their broken native tongue – became Turbonegro&#x27;s trademarks.

=== &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot;, popularity boom and disbanding (1997–1998) ===
In spring 1997, Turbonegro had another lineup change. Christer Engen (a.k.a. Chris Summers, from BigBang) took over on drums, and they were ready to tour Europe again. This time, they opened up with a modified version of a Grand Funk song, &quot;We are a Norwegian Band&quot;. With their next album, &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot;, the band made a musical move into mid-1970s punk and glam territory in the spirit of proto-punk pioneers á la The Dictators, The Ramones or late Iggy &amp; The Stooges, plus a bit of New York Dolls travesty thrown in. As Euroboy explained, &quot;When I came into the band, that added a ’70s rock-n-roll feel that wasn&#x27;t there before...Turbonegro was just as dirty, but they were certainly more punk rock-driven than (before). We brought the Rolling Stones into the Ramones.&quot; It was time to take the new and improved Turbonegro back across the Atlantic with the &quot;Summer of Head&quot; U.S. tour. They were more warmly received this time, but still played only a few shows that were plagued with problems. Nonetheless, after years of stumbling through lineup changes, name changes and various shticks, they finally found themselves.

In the autumn of 1997, their next album &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; – the first part of the so-called Apocalypse trilogy – was recorded at Endless Sound studios in Oslo with producer Pål Klaastad. When Happy-Tom was asked if their new sound and album had anything to do with Euroboy&#x27;s entry into the band, he replied, &quot;Yep, he&#x27;s a genius, and so is our new drummer Chris Summers, The Prince of Drummers. We released the punk album of the millennium with &#x27;Ass Cobra,&#x27; and didn&#x27;t want to make an &#x27;Ass Cobra&#x27; part two, plus we spent two years writing new stuff, so as to make sure that every song is a hit, so we ended up making the rock album of the next millennium.&quot;

The album was released in March 1998 by Boomba Records. However, it was released in Norway exclusively by Virgin. It is regarded among many fans and critics as their best and most successful album. Moshable magazine wrote, &quot;&quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; is the perfect mix of classic 70&#x27;s US punk / rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll like Dictators, Heartbreakers &amp; Ramones... every tune on this release is fucking brilliant&quot;. Jello Biafra said, &quot;The new Turbonegro record is possibly the most important European record ever.&quot;

Turbonegro supported the album by touring the US in the spring and playing 24 sold-out shows throughout Europe. Kåre João Pedersen of Kåre and the Cavemen substituted for Hank on the US tour as the singer was hospitalized in a mental facility. By fall, the band returned for another 16 European dates on the &quot;Darkness Forever&quot; tour, which was for a long time their last, and ultimately the end of Turbonegro. According to Happy-Tom, &quot;Turbonegro broke up in the waiting room of a psychiatric emergency ward in Milan, Italy.&quot; Hank&#x27;s mental indisposition became a serious problem and, as a result, the remainder of the tour was cancelled. They bid their farewell on 18 December 1998, at Mars in their hometown of Oslo. The last song they performed onstage before they broke up was the final encore &quot;I Am in Love with the Destructive Girls&quot;.

===On hiatus (1999–2002)===
On the threshold of what was expected to be a major breakthrough for the band, Turbonegro withdrew from the music business and appeared unlikely to ever return. While there were several reasons, Hank von Helvete&#x27;s drug addiction made it impossible for him to continue. Leaving the band to undergo treatment for heroin dependency, as well as his struggle with depression, von Helvete returned to his childhood town in northern Norway. There, he worked at a Local radio station and as a guide at a Fishing Village Museum. Another reason for Turbonegro&#x27;s hiatus was that the band was stuck in an oppressive record deal with Boomba. The band saw very little money from the arrangement, and cancelling their tour with Nashville Pussy after playing only half the dates added to their financial problems.

In 1999, Bitzcore Records out of Hamburg bought the contracts from Boomba and began to reissue Turbonegro&#x27;s entire back-catalogue of albums. The year 1999 also saw the release of a posthumous live album entitled &quot;Darkness Forever!&quot; It released selections from two of the band&#x27;s shows in Hamburg and Oslo, documenting Turbonegro&#x27;s larger-than-life stage antics. Their appreciation among contemporary artists from diverse musical genres as rock, pop, punk and even black metal was displayed on &quot;Alpha Motherfuckers&quot;, a tribute album to Turbonegro that was compiled over a span of two years and released by Bitzcore in May 2001. The lineup included, among others, Queens of the Stone Age, Nashville Pussy, Therapy?, HIM, Bela B. &amp; Denim Girl (a.k.a. German technopop star Blümchen).

During these four years, the band members would rarely speak; however, the momentum from their previous albums (especially &quot;Ass Cobra&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot;) continued to grow as more and more music fans turned to their music. Unbeknownst to the band, Turbonegro was becoming a cult phenomenon. Fan clubs were established all over the world (see Turbojugend).

The immense following and the tribute album revealed a huge interest that, by audience numbers, hadn&#x27;t existed before they had quit. When Turbonegro was approached by the organizers of the Norwegian Quart Festival about possible participation in 2002, Turbonegro agreed to the reunion. What was initially meant to be a one-off event to provide an opportunity to the many new fans to witness a Turbonegro performance, finally resulted in the band&#x27;s reunion. The festival shows received tremendous response.

===Reforming: new albums, new tours and greater fame (2003–2009)===

Shortly after the Bizarre Festival, the band announced that they signed a record deal for two new albums with Burning Heart Records, an independent record company from Sweden with a long tradition in the punk &amp; hardcore sector. Burning Heart also licensed Turbonegro&#x27;s most successful albums &quot;Ass Cobra&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; from Bitzcore and reissued them as digipak CDs with additional video footage from the recent Res-erection show at Quart. Turbonegro appeared in an episode of Viva La Bam during Season 1. The band plays their concert at Bam&#x27;s West Chester home. Their single, &quot;All My Friends Are Dead&quot;, was also used in some episodes of the show.

Turbonegro played 22 U.S. dates in the spring of 2003, culminating in two U.S. shows at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, the first of which sold out in under an hour.

The band released its highly anticipated album, the second installment of the Apocalypse trilogy, &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; in 2003, complete with artwork of a skull Ouroboros from legendary &quot;Revolver&quot;-designer Klaus Voormann. A U.S. tour with Queens of the Stone Age proved that the American Turbojugend contingent had grown completely out of control, and almost 150 shows later, Turbonegro finished the &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; campaign by selling out the House of Blues in Los Angeles two days in a row in December 2004.

While &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; was recorded at their own Crystal Canyon Studio in Oslo, Turbonegro decided to bring in Steven Shane McDonald as co-producer for &quot;Party Animals&quot;. This follow-up to 2003s &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; and the last installment in the Apocalypse trilogy was released throughout Europe on 9 May (in Norway 2 May). It continued the 1970s and 1980s glam metal and hard rock-influenced party-oriented deathpunk sound that was first introduced on &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot;. &quot;Party Animals&quot; was followed by intense touring throughout Europe and, in October, they visited the U.S. A collection of remixes and rarities appeared in 2005 as &quot;Small Feces&quot;.

Turbonegro went on tour again in 2006 to mostly European locations. In summarizing the band, Happy-Tom said, &quot;Most rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands start as a riot but end up as a parody. We started up as a parody but ended up as a revolution.&quot;

On 8 March 2007, the new single &quot;Do You Do You Dig Destruction&quot; was released in Norway. The single was from the album, &quot;Retox&quot;, released on 13 June 2007.

On 10 July 2007, Turbonegro was one of the warmup bands, alongside &quot;HIM&quot;, at Metallica&#x27;s headlining concert at Valle Hovin Stadium in Oslo, Norway.

The band toured Europe in late summer in 2007, including an appearance at Download Festival and 10 intimate gigs in the United Kingdom.

The Turbonegro official site was completely redesigned for the new album release, and the new site debuted on 11 June 2007.

On 27 October 2007, Rune Rebellion played his last live show with Turbonegro in Stavanger, Norway, and subsequently left the band. He said, &quot;The decision was made this summer, realizing I hadn&#x27;t had time off at all from work or touring for three years.&quot; Despite his departure from the position of rhythm guitar, he was still closely collaborating with the band by running their label, Scandinavian Leather Recordings and managing their itinerary.

On 3 March 2008, it was announced that Chris Summers had been asked to leave the band. He had already been gone from the band for six months due to a broken foot. On the band&#x27;s website, they announced that, &quot;[due to] personal problems and a focus on other projects, we have been forced to ask drummer Chris Summers to resign from Turbonegro.&quot; Chris&#x27; replacement was announced to be The Vikings drummer Thomas Dahl, who had been filling in for Chris since he broke his foot.

In early 2008, guitarist Euroboy also announced that he and Happy-Tom were working on a new album tentatively titled &quot;Tumours&quot;.
They continued their Retox album tour throughout 2008 and 2009, and on 7 August 2008, Turbonegro celebrated the 10-year anniversary of &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; by performing the entire album at the Øya Festival in Oslo, Norway.

After finishing their Retox world tour, the band announced through the Turbojugend-Forum that they were going on hiatus for an unknown amount of time.

===Hank von Helvete&#x27;s departure and replacement (2010–2011)===
On 9 July 2010, Norwegian newspapers announced that Hank had left the band. Subsequently, in early December 2010, news broke that a new band featuring Hank von Helvete on vocals had been formed, called Doctor Midnight &amp; the Mercy Cult, with an album to be released in 2011.

Euroboy stated in an interview with &quot;Lydverket&quot; that Turbonegro would appear with Tony Sylvester as the replacement for Hank von Helvete for the first time in Hamburg on 15 July. Former member Rune Rebellion also rejoined the band as rhythm guitarist, while Rune&#x27;s replacement and former keyboardist Pål Pot went on to become a part-time member, due to family and working commitments.

===Release of new album and tour (2012–present)===

In May 2012, social networks announced that a new Turbonegro album was about to be released. The new album would be titled &quot;Sexual Harassment,&quot; and would be released on 13 June 2012, on the Universal Music label for Norway, Sweden and Finland, and Volcom Entertainment for the rest of the world. This announcement was followed by the release of the album&#x27;s first single &quot;You Give Me Worms&quot; on 4 May. The Album is produced by Matt Sweeney.

In an interview with the Swedish Newspaper Värmlands Folkblad in April 2015, Tony Sylvester says that the band is currently working on new material, but that he can not say when and how the music becomes available.

A later update revealed the album, titled &quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Machine&quot;, would be released in February 2018.

Former frontman Hank von Helvete passed away on 19 November 2021, at the age of 49. His former bandmate Happy-Tom paid tribute to him on social media, as did current Turbonegro frontman Tony &quot;Duke of Nothing&quot; Sylvester, who wrote &quot;I never tried to fill your shoes as that would have been impossible.&quot;.

==Musical style==
Turbonegro&#x27;s lyrics often attack political correctness. For example, the cover of the single &quot;Bad Mongo&quot; depicts Adolf Hitler as mentally retarded, and in the song &quot;Hobbit Motherfuckers&quot;, they complain that there is &quot;not enough suffering&quot; and &quot;not enough natural selection&quot;. Their genre of punk has been self-described as deathpunk. The band has stated that their music superseded existing genres, so they dubbed it &quot;deathpunk&quot; as a way to avoid being pigeonholed into musical groupings they felt they were above. Lyrics referencing the genre choice include &quot;gimme deathpunk baby, and I like it&quot; from the song &quot;Get It On&quot;. Sharing characteristics with certain musical predecessors, (Sex Pistols wearing swastikas, etc.), Turbonegro has been praised by some as playing the most up-to-date form of punk with an anarchic blend of humour, shock and sexuality.

In the &quot;Turbonegro – The Movie&quot; DVD extras, Happy-Tom says that, early on, festival-goers expected Turbonegro to be gothic metal or black metal in the vein of other Norwegian bands. They are notorious for their on-stage gimmicks. An early version of the band wore blackface and wigs onstage in an effort to challenge those watching their shows. On &quot;The Reserection&quot; DVD, the band states that early on they were often driven away from shows they were to play because they were not edgy enough or did not fit the look that the crowd wanted. As a result, the onstage schticks started to become as much of the Turbonegro experience as the music. Following several tours in blackface, the band started an oddball theme of tight denim pants, nautically themed stage props and homosexual innuendo, stylistically similar to the characters of Tom of Finland. A tongue-in-cheek joke, the homosexual/transvestite stage presence found its way into the band&#x27;s music, including songs such as &quot;Prince of the Rodeo&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous with Anus&quot;. Levi&#x27;s jeans endorsements soon followed, and the trucker-cut jacket soon became standard fare among fans.

The band&#x27;s first break-out album, &quot;Ass Cobra&quot; (1996), was widely acclaimed. Jello Biafra would later comment that it was one of the best punk albums of the 1990s. Following &quot;Ass Cobra,&quot; was Turbonegro&#x27;s most critically acclaimed release &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; (1998). &quot;Apocalypse Dudes&quot; introduced a combination of 1970s arena rock, irreverent lyrics, and punk stylings, which brought the band a level of notoriety that they had not achieved at any other point in their career.

Among the band&#x27;s main influences are Black Flag, the Rolling Stones, KISS, Venom, Radio Birdman, AC/DC, Iggy Pop &amp; James Williamson, Circle Jerks, David Bowie, Ramones, the Lewd, Hanoi Rocks, Alice Cooper, Negazione, the Dictators and the Stooges.

==Band name==
Initially, the band had two running ideas for band names: &quot;Nazipenis&quot; and &quot;Turbonegro&quot;. They were advised that a band named Nazipenis would never sell records, so they chose Turbonegro as a more consumer-friendly choice. The band&#x27;s name raised some eyebrows and, for that reason, their first releases were sometimes branded &quot;TRBNGR&quot;, perhaps to preclude backlash against what some consider to be a racist name. However, the band&#x27;s stated motivations are anti-racist, an attempt to change the attitude of racism and nationalism perceived as prevalent in parts of Scandinavia.

According to lead guitarist Euroboy, the band name also has a peculiar origin. &quot;I think Pål saw it spray-painted on a brick wall in a tube-station in a suburb of Oslo back in the day. It&#x27;s actually two Latin words. It means &#x27;fast&#x27; and &#x27;black,&#x27; and we thought that was a cool name for a band. Because our music is very fast and very dark. And also, it&#x27;s a name for a color. In the car industry, it&#x27;s the name for the paint, for the darkest paint. If you want to paint your car black, the most black colour of all is Turbonegro.&quot;

==Turbojugend==


A feature of Turbonegro&#x27;s fan base is the &quot;Turbojugend&quot; (Turbo Youth), the band&#x27;s fan club. In explaining Turbojugend&#x27;s beginnings, Euroboy said, &quot;We thought about how Kiss had the Kiss Army so we thought that Turbonegro should have our own Navy. It started as a joke in Happy-Tom’s apartment. We put his address on the album sleeves and it was all just for laughs. The Jugend blossomed into something way bigger than we ever expected.&quot; The first Turbojugend chapter started in St Pauli, Hamburg, Germany, with later chapters appearing throughout the world, St. Pauli being the unofficial capital. Chapter members identify themselves by wearing specially made denim jackets with the Turbonegro logo and &quot;Turbojugend [name of chapter]&quot; stitched on the back.

The logo of Turbojugend Oslo can be found on almost every album Turbonegro has ever released.

===Welt-Turbojugend-Tage===
Once a year, Turbojugends from all over the world meet in St. Pauli, Germany, to celebrate Turbonegro, themselves, and punk rock in general during a two-day event, called &quot;Welt-Turbojugend-Tage&quot; (in English: &quot;World Turboyouth Days&quot;), with concerts and meetings in different clubs. Welt-Turbojugend-Tage 7, in July 2011, featured the comeback of Turbonegro. The eighth annual event was held in July 2012, and another was scheduled for August 2013.

<text>Kālidāsa (, &quot;Servant of Kali&quot;; 4th–5th century CE) was a Classical Sanskrit author who is often considered ancient India&#x27;s greatest poet and playwright. His plays and poetry are primarily based on Hindu Puranas and philosophy. His surviving works consist of three plays, two epic poems and two shorter poems.

Much about his life is unknown except what can be inferred from his poetry and plays. His works cannot be dated with precision, but they were most likely authored before the 5th century CE during the Gupta era. Kalidas is mentioned as one of the seven Brahma avatars in Dasam Granth, written by Guru Gobind Singh.

==Early life==
Scholars have speculated that Kālidāsa may have lived near the Himalayas, in the vicinity of Ujjain, and in Kalinga. This hypothesis is based on Kālidāsa&#x27;s detailed description of the Himalayas in his &quot;Kumārasambhavam&quot;, the display of his love for Ujjain in &quot;Meghadūta&quot;, and his highly eulogistic descriptions of Kalingan emperor Hemāngada in &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; (sixth &quot;sarga&quot;).

Lakshmi Dhar Kalla (1891–1953), a Sanskrit scholar and a Kashmiri Pandit, wrote a book titled &quot;The birth-place of Kalidasa&quot; (1926), which tries to trace the birthplace of Kālidāsa based on his writings. He concluded that Kālidāsa was born in Kashmir, but moved southwards, and sought the patronage of local rulers to prosper. The evidence cited by him from Kālidāsa&#x27;s writings includes:

* Description of flora and fauna that is found in Kashmir, but not in Ujjain or Kalinga: the saffron plant, the deodar trees, musk deer etc.
* Description of geographical features common to Kashmir, such as tarns and glades
* Mention of some sites of minor importance that, according to Kalla, can be identified with places in Kashmir. These sites are not very famous outside Kashmir, and therefore, could not have been known to someone not in close touch with Kashmir.
* Reference to certain legends of Kashmiri origin, such as that of the Nikumbha (mentioned in the Kashmiri text &quot;Nīlamata Purāṇa&quot;); mention (in &quot;Shakuntala&quot;) of the legend about Kashmir being created from a lake. This legend, mentioned in &quot;Nīlamata Purāṇa&quot;, states that a tribal leader named Ananta drained a lake to kill a demon. Ananta named the site of the former lake (now land) as &quot;Kashmir&quot;, after his father Kaśyapa.
* According to Kalla, &quot;Śakuntalā&quot; is an allegorical dramatization of Pratyabhijna philosophy (a branch of Kashmir Shaivism). Kalla further argues that this branch was not known outside of Kashmir at that time.

Another old legend recounts that Kālidāsa visits Kumāradāsa, the king of Lanka and, because of treachery, is murdered there.

== Period ==
Several ancient and medieval books state that Kālidāsa was a court poet of a king named Vikramāditya. A legendary king named Vikramāditya is said to have ruled from Ujjain around the 1st century BCE. A section of scholars believe that this legendary Vikramāditya is not a historical figure at all. There are other kings who ruled from Ujjain and adopted the title &quot;Vikramāditya&quot;, the most notable ones being Chandragupta II (r. 380 CE – 415 CE) and Yaśodharman (6th century CE).

The most popular theory is that Kālidāsa flourished during the reign of Chandragupta II, and therefore lived around the 4th-5th century CE. Several Western scholars have supported this theory, since the days of William Jones and A. B. Keith. Modern western Indologists and scholars like Stanley Wolpert also support this theory. Many Indian scholars, such as Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi and Rāma Gupta, also place Kālidāsa in this period. According to this theory, his career might have extended to the reign of Kumāragupta I (r. 414 – 455 CE), and possibly, to that of Skandagupta (r. 455 – 467 CE).

The earliest paleographical evidence of Kālidāsa is found in a Sanskrit inscription dated , found at Mandsaur&#x27;s Sun temple, with some verses that appear to imitate Meghadūta Purva, 66; and the Ṛtusaṃhāra V, 2–3, although Kālidāsa is not named. His name, along with that of the poet Bhāravi, is first mentioned the 634 CE Aihole inscription found in Karnataka.

== Theory of multiple Kālidāsas ==

Some scholars, including M. Srinivasachariar and T. S. Narayana Sastri, believe that works attributed to &quot;Kālidāsa&quot; are not by a single person. According to Srinivasachariar, writers from 8th and 9th centuries hint at the existence of three noted literary figures who share the name Kālidāsa. These writers include Devendra (author of &quot;Kavi-Kalpa-Latā&quot;), Rājaśekhara and Abhinanda. Sastri lists the works of these three Kalidasas as follows:

# Kālidāsa alias Mātṛgupta, author of &quot;Setu-Bandha&quot; and three plays (&quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot;, &quot;Mālavikāgnimitram&quot; and &quot;Vikramōrvaśīyam&quot;).
# Kālidāsa alias Medharudra, author of &quot;Kumārasambhavam&quot;, &quot;Meghadūta&quot; and &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot;.
# Kālidāsa alias Kotijit: author of &quot;Ṛtusaṃhāra&quot;, &quot;Śyāmala-Daṇḍakam&quot; and &quot;Śṛngāratilaka&quot; among other works.

Sastri goes on to mention six other literary figures known by the name &quot;Kālidāsa&quot;: Parimala Kālidāsa alias Padmagupta (author of &quot;Navasāhasāṅka Carita&quot;), Kālidāsa alias Yamakakavi (author of &quot;Nalodaya&quot;), Nava Kālidāsa (author of &quot;Champu Bhāgavata&quot;), Akbariya Kalidasa (author of several &quot;samasya&quot;s or riddles), Kālidāsa VIII (author of &quot;Lambodara Prahasana&quot;), and Abhinava Kālidāsa alias Mādhava (author of &quot;Saṅkṣepa-Śaṅkara-Vijayam&quot;).

According to K. Krishnamoorthy, &quot;Vikramāditya&quot; and &quot;Kālidāsa&quot; were used as common nouns to describe any patron king and any court poet, respectively.

==Works==

=== Epic poems ===
Kālidāsa is the author of two mahākāvyas, &quot;Kumārasambhava&quot; (Kumāra meaning Kartikeya, and sambhava meaning possibility of an event taking place, in this context a birth. Kumārasambhava thus means the birth of a Kartikeya) and &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; (&quot;Dynasty of Raghu&quot;).

*&quot;Kumārasambhava&quot; describes the birth and adolescence of the goddess Pārvatī, her marriage to Śiva and the subsequent birth of their son Kumāra (Kārtikeya).
*&quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; is an epic poem about the kings of the Raghu dynasty.

=== Minor poems ===
Kālidāsa also wrote the &quot;Meghadūta&quot; (&quot;The Cloud Messenger&quot;), a &quot;khaṇḍakāvya&quot; (minor poem). It describes the story of a Yakṣa trying to send a message to his lover through a cloud. Kālidāsa set this poem to the mandākrāntā metre, which is known for its lyrical sweetness. It is one of Kālidāsa&#x27;s most popular poems and numerous commentaries on the work have been written.

Kalidasa also wrote the shyamala Dandakam descripting the beauty of Goddess Matangi.

===Plays===
Kālidāsa wrote three plays. Among them, &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; (&quot;Of the recognition of Śakuntalā&quot;) is generally regarded as a masterpiece. It was among the first Sanskrit works to be translated into English, and has since been translated into many languages.
*&quot;Mālavikāgnimitram&quot; (&quot;Pertaining to Mālavikā and Agnimitra&quot;) tells the story of King Agnimitra, who falls in love with the picture of an exiled servant girl named Mālavikā. When the queen discovers her husband&#x27;s passion for this girl, she becomes infuriated and has Mālavikā imprisoned, but as fate would have it, Mālavikā is in fact a true-born princess, thus legitimizing the affair.
*&quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; (&quot;Of the recognition of Śakuntalā&quot;) tells the story of King Duṣyanta who, while on a hunting trip, meets Śakuntalā, the adopted daughter of the sage Kanu and real daughter of Vishwamitra and Menaka and marries her. A mishap befalls them when he is summoned back to court: Śakuntala, pregnant with their child, inadvertently offends a visiting Durvasa and incurs a curse, whereby Duṣyanta forgets her entirely until he sees the ring he has left with her. On her trip to Duṣyanta&#x27;s court in an advanced state of pregnancy, she loses the ring, and has to come away unrecognized by him. The ring is found by a fisherman who recognizes the royal seal and returns it to Duṣyanta, who regains his memory of Śakuntala and sets out to find her. Goethe was fascinated by Kālidāsa&#x27;s &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot;, which became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.
*&quot;Vikramōrvaśīyam&quot; (&quot;Ūrvaśī Won by Valour&quot;) tells the story of King Pururavas and celestial nymph Ūrvaśī who fall in love. As an immortal, she has to return to the heavens, where an unfortunate accident causes her to be sent back to the earth as a mortal with the curse that she will die (and thus return to heaven) the moment her lover lays his eyes on the child which she will bear him. After a series of mishaps, including Ūrvaśī&#x27;s temporary transformation into a vine, the curse is lifted, and the lovers are allowed to remain together on the earth.

====Translations====

Montgomery Schuyler, Jr. published a bibliography of the editions and translations of the drama &quot;Śakuntalā&quot; while preparing his work &quot;Bibliography of the Sanskrit Drama&quot;. Schuyler later completed his bibliography series of the dramatic works of Kālidāsa by compiling bibliographies of the editions and translations of &quot;Vikramōrvaśīyam&quot; and &quot;Mālavikāgnimitra&quot;. Sir William Jones published an English translation of &quot;Śakuntalā&quot; in 1791 CE and &quot;Ṛtusaṃhāra&quot; was published by him in original text during 1792 CE.

=== False attributions and false Kalidasas ===
According to Indologist Siegfried Lienhard:A large number of long and short poems have incorrectly been attributed to Kalidasa, for instance the Bhramarastaka, the Ghatakarpara, the Mangalastaka, the Nalodaya (a work by Ravideva), the Puspabanavilasa, which is sometimes also ascribed to Vararuci or Ravideva, the Raksasakavya, the Rtusamhara, the Sarasvatistotra, the Srngararasastaka, the Srngaratilaka, the Syamaladandaka and the short, didactic text on prosody, the Srutabodha, otherwise thought to be by Vararuci or the Jaina Ajitasena. In addition to the non-authentic works, there are also some &quot;false&quot; Kalidasas. Immensely proud of their poetic achievement, several later poets have either been barefaced enough to call themselves Kalidasa or have invented pseudonyms such as Nava-Kalidasa, &quot;New Kalidasa&quot;, Akbariya-Kalidasa, &quot;Akbar-Kalidasa&quot;, etc.

==Influence==
Kālidāsa&#x27;s influence extends to all later Sanskrit works that followed him, and on Indian literature broadly, becoming an archetype of Sanskrit literature.

Notably in modern Indian literature &quot;Meghadūta&quot;&#x27;s romanticism is found in Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s poems on the monsoons.

== Critical reputation ==
Bāṇabhaṭṭa, the 7th-century CE Sanskrit prose-writer and poet, has written: &quot;nirgatāsu na vā kasya kālidāsasya sūktiṣu, prītirmadhurasārdrāsu mañjarīṣviva jāyate&quot;. (&quot;When Kālidāsa&#x27;s sweet sayings, charming with sweet sentiment, went forth, who did not feel delight in them as in honey-laden flowers?&quot;).

Jayadeva, a later poet, has called Kālidāsa a &quot;kavikulaguru&quot;, &#x27;the lord of poets&#x27; and the &quot;vilāsa&quot;, &#x27;graceful play&#x27; of the muse of poetry.

The Indologist Sir Monier Williams has written: &quot;No composition of Kālidāsa displays more the richness of his poetical genius, the exuberance of his imagination, the warmth and play of his fancy, his profound knowledge of the human heart, his delicate appreciation of its most refined and tender emotions, his familiarity with the workings and counterworkings of its conflicting feelings - in short more entitles him to rank as the Shakespeare of India.&quot;



Philosopher and linguist Humboldt writes, &quot;Kālidāsa, the celebrated author of the Śākuntalā, is a masterly describer of the influence which Nature exercises upon the minds of lovers. Tenderness in the expression of feelings and richness of creative fancy have assigned to him his lofty place among the poets of all nations.&quot;

==Later culture==
Many scholars have written commentaries on the works of Kālidāsa. Among the most studied commentaries are those by Kolāchala Mallinātha Suri, which were written in the 15th century during the reign of the Vijayanagara king, Deva Rāya II. The earliest surviving commentaries appear to be those of the 10th-century Kashmirian scholar Vallabhadeva. Eminent Sanskrit poets like Bāṇabhaṭṭa, Jayadeva and Rajasekhara have lavished praise on Kālidāsa in their tributes. A well-known Sanskrit verse (&quot;Upamā Kālidāsasya...&quot;) praises his skill at &quot;upamā&quot;, or similes. Anandavardhana, a highly revered critic, considered Kālidāsa to be one of the greatest Sanskrit poets. Of the hundreds of pre-modern Sanskrit commentaries on Kālidāsa&#x27;s works, only a fraction have been contemporarily published. Such commentaries show signs of Kālidāsa&#x27;s poetry being changed from its original state through centuries of manual copying, and possibly through competing oral traditions which ran alongside the written tradition.

Kālidāsa&#x27;s &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; was one of the first works of Indian literature to become known in Europe. It was first translated into English and then from English into German, where it was received with wonder and fascination by a group of eminent poets, which included Herder and Goethe.

Kālidāsa&#x27;s work continued to evoke inspiration among the artistic circles of Europe during the late 19th century and early 20th century, as evidenced by Camille Claudel&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Shakuntala&quot;.

Koodiyattam artist and Nāṭya Śāstra scholar Māni Mādhava Chākyār (1899–1990) of Kerala choreographed and performed popular Kālidāsa plays including Abhijñānaśākuntala, Vikramorvaśīya and Mālavikāgnimitra.

The Kannada films &quot;Mahakavi Kalidasa&quot; (1955), featuring Honnappa Bagavatar, B. Sarojadevi and later &quot;Kaviratna Kalidasa&quot; (1983), featuring Rajkumar and Jaya Prada, were based on the life of Kālidāsa. &quot;Kaviratna Kalidasa&quot; also used Kālidāsa&#x27;s Shakuntala as a sub-plot in the movie.V. Shantaram made the Hindi movie &quot;Stree&quot; (1961) based on Kālidāsa&#x27;s Shakuntala. R.R. Chandran made the Tamil movie &quot;Mahakavi Kalidas&quot; (1966) based on Kālidāsa&#x27;s life. Chevalier Nadigar Thilagam Sivaji Ganesan played the part of the poet himself. &quot;Mahakavi Kalidasu&quot; (Telugu, 1960) featuring Akkineni Nageswara Rao was similarly based on Kālidāsa&#x27;s life and work.

Surendra Verma&#x27;s Hindi play &quot;Athavan Sarga&quot;, published in 1976, is based on the legend that Kālidāsa could not complete his epic &quot;Kumārasambhava&quot; because he was cursed by the goddess Pārvatī, for obscene descriptions of her conjugal life with Śiva in the eighth canto. The play depicts Kālidāsa as a court poet of Chandragupta who faces a trial on the insistence of a priest and some other moralists of his time.

&quot;Asti Kashchid Vagarthiyam&quot; is a five-act Sanskrit play written by Krishna Kumar in 1984. The story is a variation of the popular legend that Kālidāsa was mentally challenged at one time and that his wife was responsible for his transformation. Kālidāsa, a mentally challenged shepherd, is married to Vidyottamā, a learned princess, through a conspiracy. On discovering that she has been tricked, Vidyottamā banishes Kālidāsa, asking him to acquire scholarship and fame if he desires to continue their relationship. She further stipulates that on his return he will have to answer the question, &quot;Asti Kaścid Vāgarthaḥ&quot;&quot; (&quot;Is there anything special in expression?&quot;), to her satisfaction. In due course, Kālidāsa attains knowledge and fame as a poet. Kālidāsa begins Kumārsambhava, Raghuvaṃśa and Meghaduta with the words &quot;Asti&quot; (&quot;there is&quot;), &quot;Kaścit&quot; (&quot;something&quot;) and &quot;Vāgarthaḥ&quot; (&quot;spoken word and its meaning&quot;) respectively.

Bishnupada Bhattacharya&#x27;s &quot;Kalidas o Robindronath&quot; is a comparative study of Kalidasa and the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.

&quot;Ashadh Ka Ek Din&quot; is a Hindi play based on fictionalized elements of Kalidasa&#x27;s life.

<text>Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) is a C++ object-oriented library for developing desktop applications for Windows.

MFC was introduced by Microsoft in 1992 and quickly gained widespread use. While Microsoft has introduced alternative application frameworks since then, MFC remains widely used.

== History ==
MFC was introduced in 1992 with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;C/C++ 7.0&quot; compiler for use with 16-bit versions of Windows as an extremely thin object-oriented C++ wrapper for the Windows API. C++ was just beginning to replace C for development of commercial application software at the time. In an MFC program, direct Windows API calls are rarely needed. Instead, programs create objects from Microsoft Foundation Class classes and call member functions belonging to those objects. Many of those functions share their names with corresponding API functions.

One quirk of MFC is the use of &quot;Afx&quot; as the prefix for many functions, macros and the standard precompiled header name &quot;stdafx.h&quot;. During early development, what became MFC was called &quot;Application Framework Extensions&quot; and abbreviated &quot;Afx&quot;. The name Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) was adopted too late in the release cycle to change these references.

MFC 8.0 was released with Visual Studio 2005. MFC 9.0 was released with Visual Studio 2008. On April 7, 2008, Microsoft released an update to the MFC classes as an out-of-band update to Visual Studio 2008 and MFC 9. The update features new user interface constructs, including the ribbons and associated UI widgets, fully customizable toolbars, docking panes which can either be freely floated or docked to any side and document tabs.

MFC was initially a feature of the commercial versions of Visual Studio. As such, it is not included in the freeware Visual C++ Express. The Community edition of Visual Studio, introduced in 2014, however, includes MFC.

Object Windows Library (OWL), designed for use with Borland&#x27;s Turbo C++ compiler, was a competing product introduced by Borland around the same time. Eventually, Borland discontinued OWL development and licensed the distribution of the MFC headers, libraries and DLLs from Microsoft for a short time, though it never offered fully integrated support for MFC. Borland later released Visual Component Library to replace the OWL framework.

== Features ==

MFC is a library that wraps portions of the Windows API in C++ classes, including functionality that enables them to use a default application framework. Classes are defined for many of the handle-managed Windows objects and also for predefined windows and common controls.

At the time of its introduction, MFC provided C++ macros for Windows message-handling (via Message Maps ), exceptions, run-time type identification (RTTI), serialization and dynamic class instantiation. The macros for message-handling aimed to reduce memory consumption by avoiding gratuitous virtual table use and also to provide a more concrete structure for various Visual C++-supplied tools to edit and manipulate code without parsing the full language. The message-handling macros replaced the virtual function mechanism provided by C++.

The macros for serialization, exceptions, and RTTI predated availability of these features in Microsoft C++ by a number of years. 32-bit versions of MFC, for Windows NT 3.1 and later Windows operating systems, used compilers that implemented the language features and updated the macros to simply wrap the language features instead of providing customized implementations, realizing upward compatibility.

The MFC ribbon resource editor allows the developer to design the ribbon graphically instead of having to use the XML-based declarative markup like the RibbonX API. Optionally, ribbon components may be programmed directly by calling a new set of ribbon class methods. The developer may mix graphical and programmatic ribbon development as is convenient. The MFC application wizard has also been upgraded to support the new features, including a check-box to select whether the application will use the ribbon or the docking panes. The new functionality is provided in new classes so that old applications still continue to run. This update builds on top of BCGSoft’s BCGControlBar Library Professional Edition. Microsoft has imposed additional licensing requirements on users of the ribbons. These include a requirement to adhere to Microsoft UI Design Guidelines, and an anti-competition clause prohibiting the use of the UI in applications which compete with Microsoft Office.

MFC can be used by linking a static library or by adding the MFC DLL.

<text>Paul Lewis Quarrington (July 22, 1953 – January 21, 2010) was a Canadian novelist, playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, musician and educator.

==Background==
Born in Toronto as the middle of three sons in the family of four of Bruce Quarrington, he was raised in the district of Don Mills and studied at the University of Toronto but dropped out after less than two years of study.

He wrote his early novels while working as the bass player for the group Joe Hall and the Continental Drift and as the guitar accompanist for Cathy Stewart, a Canadian singer who was popular at the time. One of his novels, &quot;Whale Music&quot;, was called &quot;the greatest rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll novel ever written&quot; by &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. His non-fiction books and journalism were also highly regarded – he earned or co-earned more than 20 gold awards for his magazine articles alone.

Quarrington&#x27;s most consistent musical colleague has been Martin Worthy; their friendship began in high school. He was also a high school friend of songwriter Dan Hill, with whom he reunited toward the end of his life to collaborate on musical projects. Quarrington collaborated with many artists (a defining element of his overall body of work) who achieved recognition in their respective disciplines. These include Nino Ricci, Joseph Kertes, Dave Bidini, Jake MacDonald, John Krizanc, Christina Jennings, Judith Keenan, Michael Burke, Peter Lynch, Ron Mann, Robert Lantos and many others.

Between the publication of his first and second novels, Quarrington also competed in the 1981 Three-Day Novel Contest, writing an unpublished manuscript called &quot;The Man Who Liked to Fall in Love&quot;.

==Novels==

Quarrington&#x27;s novels are characterized by their humour (&quot;King Leary&quot; received the Stephen Leacock Award for Humour in 1988), although they address serious subjects; reviews of his writing have often noted that his books regularly contain elements of both tragedy and comedy. During the promotional push for his 2008 novel &quot;The Ravine&quot;, Anne Collins, his longtime editor at Random House Canada, told &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot; that &quot;Paul uses a comic approach to deal with incredibly sad and troubling and tragic material.&quot;

His protagonists are often faded former celebrities in the worlds of sports, music or film, emotionally crippled antiheroes whose personal demons have led them to withdraw from society. Typically, in Quarrington&#x27;s work, an outside agent of some sort – a young woman in &quot;Whale Music&quot;, ghosts in &quot;King Leary&quot;, a hurricane in &quot;Galveston&quot;, an overtime hockey game in &quot;Logan in Overtime&quot; – challenges the structures of the protagonist&#x27;s life and sets them on a path to moral, spiritual and personal redemption.

His novel &quot;The Ravine&quot; was published in March 2008. At the time of his death, Quarrington had completed a short film adaptation of the work (Pavane, 2008) and was collaborating on a television series adaptation of that novel, which he claimed to be semi-autobiographical. &quot;It&#x27;s about a writer who squanders his talents in television, drinks too much, screws around and ruins his marriage,&quot; Quarrington has said. &quot;The reason it&#x27;s &#x27;semi-autobiographical&#x27; is the guy&#x27;s name is &#x27;Phil.&#x27;&quot;

===Influences===
During his time, Quarrington has been an influential figure in Canadian literature, not only as an author, but also through his participation in teaching (Humber College and University of Toronto), publishing circles, organizations and events. He befriended many Canadian writers, including Timothy Findley. Quarrington and Findley held a mutual admiration for each other; when asked to provide a review quote for &quot;Home Game&quot;, Findley blurbed that Quarrington was &quot;an extraordinary writer with a rare gift for pulling unique characters out of funny hats&quot;.

As a youngster, Quarrington came from a very musical background, and this showed consistently in his writing. Although most of Quarrington&#x27;s biggest successes were as a writer, he reportedly considered himself a musician who also wrote rather than a writer who also made music.

While writing a review blurb for Leonard Cohen&#x27;s book, &quot;The Favourite Game&quot;, he admired Cohen&#x27;s &quot;poetic craftsmanship.&quot; Another time, in typical whimsical Quarrington fashion, he declared, &quot;I seem to like authors named John – John Fowles, John Gardner, John Irving. John Gardner is my favourite – he&#x27;s sadly not so well known these days.&quot;

==Cinema and television==
Quarrington&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Whale Music&quot;, cowritten with director Richard J. Lewis, was nominated for numerous Genie Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, in 1994. Actor Maury Chaykin won best actor for his portrayal of the drug-addled Desmond Howl.

He won the Genie Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1991 for &quot;Perfectly Normal&quot;, a comedy that combined ice hockey and grand opera. &quot;Perfectly Normal&quot; opened the Toronto International Film Festival, at that time called Festival of Festivals, in 1990.

Quarrington has also worked in the television industry, acting as writer and/or producer on such shows as &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;Power Play&quot; and &quot;Moose TV&quot;, the latter winning Best Comedy from the CFTPA Indie Awards 2008.

==Stage==
Quarrington&#x27;s work for the stage includes &quot;Dying is Easy&quot;, &quot;The Invention of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Three Ways from Sunday&quot; and Checkout Time. He was a long-time board member of the Toronto Fringe Festival.

==Music==
In their teens, Quarrington and Hill also occasionally performed together as a folk music duo, billed as Quarrington/Hill. Hill had also auditioned for Quarrington&#x27;s garage band PQ&#x27;s People.

Quarrington/Worthy, a duo with musician Martin Worthy, had a #1 hit on &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary charts the week of January 12, 1980 with their song &quot;Baby and the Blues&quot;.

Quarrington collaborated with the band Rheostatics on the &quot;Whale Music&quot; film soundtrack, including a songwriting credit on the band&#x27;s most successful hit single, &quot;Claire&quot;.

Quarrington was also the lead singer/guitarist for the blues/roots/country ensemble Porkbelly Futures. Their first CD, &quot;Way Past Midnight&quot; was released in late 2005 by Wildflower Records, and spent six months on the &quot;Americana&quot; charts. Their second CD, &quot;Porkbelly Futures&quot;, was released by Cordova Bay Records in April 2008. It contains many of Quarrington&#x27;s original compositions. His songwriting was also featured on the last CD put out by Porkbelly Futures, titled &quot;The Crooked Road&quot; which was recorded and released after his death, and features a photograph of Quarrington on the back cover. Quarrington&#x27;s solo CD called &quot;The Songs&quot; was recorded just prior to his death and was released posthumously in June 2010, also on Cordova Bay Records.

He participated in the collaborative &quot;Canadian Songbook&quot; tour in 2008 with Murray McLauchlan, Stephen Fearing and Catherine MacLellan.

==Final months==
After being diagnosed with lung cancer in May 2009, Quarrington continued his plans to embark on various concert tours with Porkbelly Futures, while continuing to produce his own solo CD and the Porkbellys third release; complete his non-fiction memoir &quot;Cigar Box Banjo: Notes on Life and Music&quot; (Greystone Books, May 2010), deliver multiple screenplays for episodes of a television series for Shaftesbury Films (&quot;Notes on Euphoria&quot;, dir. John L&#x27;Ecuyer) as well as star in a documentary film initiated by friend and colleague Judith Keenan; the film, &quot;Paul Quarrington: Life in Music&quot;, is an adaptation tied to his written memoir.

Rheostatics, who had broken up in 2007, reunited for a live tribute show to Quarrington produced by Humber College for Toronto&#x27;s International Festival of Authors. Also appearing to celebrate his body of work in multiple genres were Christina Jennings, John Krizanc, Michael Burns, Wayson Choy, Nino Ricci, Paul Gross, Alistair McLeod, Joe Hall, Porkbelly Futures with David Gray, and talented family members Christine Quarrington, Tony Quarrington and Joel Quarrington. Michael Burke announced the launch of Quarrington Arts Society / Société des Arts Quarrington, to provide support for working and emerging artists committed to multi-disciplinary practices.

Quarrington&#x27;s final collaboration with Hill and Worthy, a song about his journey with cancer called &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, was completed just ten days before Quarrington&#x27;s death. The song was conceived by Quarrington and film producer Keenan as the focal point for their feature documentary. Many other songs were also conceived and produced by Quarrington during this fertile creative time, including &quot;All the Stars&quot; (created just days after the diagnosis) and &quot;Wherever You Go,&quot; all of which are included on the posthumously released CD.

Quarrington died of lung cancer in Toronto on January 21, 2010, aged 56. His final book, a memoir titled &quot;Cigar Box Banjo: Notes on Music and Life&quot;, was posthumously published later the same year.
He wrote a short story, &quot;The Conversion&quot; which he recited with music some time before his death. That recitation was presented on radio by the CBC Radio show &quot;Tapestry.&quot;

==Awards==

&quot;King Leary&quot; won the Stephen Leacock Award in 1988, and &quot;Whale Music&quot; won the 1989 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction. Quarrington was also nominated for the Leacock Award in 1984 for &quot;Home Game&quot;, in 1986 for &quot;The Life of Hope&quot;, in 1990 for &quot;Whale Music&quot; and in 1998 for &quot;The Boy on the Back of the Turtle&quot;.

&quot;Galveston&quot;, published in the United States as &quot;Storm Chasers&quot;, was nominated for the prestigious Giller Prize. He lost to Alice Munro – which, Quarrington stated afterward, &quot;was hard to feel upset about. It&#x27;s like losing to Chekhov.&quot;

In February 2008, &quot;King Leary&quot; was put forward by Dave Bidini as one of the five books considered on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot;. Bidini ultimately prevailed, and &quot;King Leary&quot; was named the book that everyone in the nation should read.

His short film &quot;Pavane&quot;, adapted from his novel &quot;The Ravine&quot;, garnered a Remi Platinum Award Houston&#x27;s WorldFest, was juried in several other US festivals, and was broadcast in Canada on Bravo!FACT Presents and CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Reflections&quot;. He and the creative team for ShowCase earned the CFPTA Indie Award for Comedy for the series &quot;Moose TV&quot;.

In 2009, the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada awarded Quarrington its Matt Cohen Prize for a distinguished lifetime contribution to Canadian literature.

On June 10, 2010, Quarrington was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Nipissing University. His daughter Carson accepted the award on his behalf.

<doc id="291908" wikidata="Q608956" url="?curid=291908" title="Virusoid">
<text>Virusoids are circular single-stranded RNA(s) dependent on viruses for replication and encapsidation. The genome of virusoids consists of several hundred (200–400) nucleotides and does not code for any proteins.

Virusoids are essentially viroids that have been encapsulated by a helper virus coat protein. They are thus similar to viroids in their means of replication (rolling circle replication) and in their lack of genes, but they differ in that viroids do not possess a protein coat. Both virusoids and viroids encode a hammerhead ribozyme.

Virusoids, while being studied in virology, are subviral particles rather than viruses. Since they depend on helper viruses, they are classified as satellites. Virusoids are listed in virological taxonomy as Satellites/Satellite nucleic acids/Subgroup 3: Circular satellite RNA(s).

== Definition ==
Depending on whether a lax or strict definition is used, the term &quot;virusoid&quot; may also include Hepatitis D virus (HDV). Like plant virusoids, HDV is circular, single-stranded, and supported by a helper virus (Hepatitis B virus) to form virions; however, the virions possess a much larger genome size (~1700 nt) and encode a protein. They also show no sequence similarity with the plant virusoid group.

==History==

The first virusoid was discovered in &quot;Nicotiana velutina&quot; plants infected with Velvet tobacco mottle virus R2 (VTMOV). These RNAs have also been referred to as viroid-like RNAs that can infect commercially important agricultural crops and are non–self-replicating single stranded RNAs. RNA replication of virusoids is similar to that of viroids but, unlike viroids, virusoids require specific &quot;helper&quot; viruses.

==Replication==

The circular structure of virusoid RNA molecules is ideal for rolling circle replication, in which multiple copies of the genome are generated in an efficient manner from a single replication initiation event. Another advantage to circular RNAs as replication intermediates is that they are inaccessible and resistant to exonucleases. Additionally, their high GC content and high degree of self-complementarity make them very stable against endonucleases. Circular RNAs impose constraints on RNA folding by which secondary structures that are favored for replication differ from those assumed during ribozyme-mediated self-cleavage.

Plant satellite RNAs and virusoids depend on their respective helper viruses for replication, while the helper viruses themselves are dependent upon plants to provide some of the components required for replication. Therefore, a complex interaction involving all three major players including satellites, helper viruses and host plants is essential for satellite / virusoid replication.
satLTSV replication has been shown to occur through the symmetric rolling circle mechanism, wherein the satLTSV self-cleaves both (+) and (-) strands. Both the (+) and (-) strands of satLTSV were found to be equally infectious. Nevertheless, since only the (+) strand is packaged in the LTSV particles, the origin of assembly sequence (OAS) / secondary structure is assumed to be present on the (+) strand only.

Gellatly et al., 2011 demonstrated that the entire satLTSV molecule possesses sequence and structural significance wherein any mutations (insertions / deletions) causing disruption in the overall rod-like structure of the virusoid molecule are lethal to its infectivity. Foreign nucleotides introduced into the molecule will only be tolerated if they preserve the overall cruciform structure of the satLTSV. Furthermore, the introduced foreign sequences are eliminated in successive generations to ultimately reproduce the wild-type satLTSV.

Therefore, in satLTSV RNA, the entire sequence seems to be essential for replication. This contrasts with satRNA of TBSV or the defective-interfering RNAs, in which only a small portion of their respective sequences / secondary structures were found to be sufficient for replication.

==Role of ribozyme structures in the self-cleavage and replication of virusoids==

Virusoids structurally resemble the viroids as they possess native secondary structures that form double-stranded rod-like molecules with short terminal branches. They also contain hammerhead ribozymes that are involved in autocatalytic cleavage of satRNA multimers during rolling circle replication. It was proposed that the hammerhead ribozyme structure of satLTSV is formed only transiently, similar to that observed by Song &amp; Miller (2004) with satRPV (&quot;Cereal yellow dwarf polerovirus&quot; serotype RPV) RNA. This hammerhead structure contains a short stem III that is stabilized by only two base-paired nucleotides. This unstable conformation thus suggests that a double hammerhead mode of cleavage takes place. These structures are similar to those reported for CarSV and newt ribozymes, which implies an ancient relationship between these divergent RNAs. The observation by Collins et al., 1998 that the dimer of the satRYMV RNA is more efficiently self-cleaved than the monomer is consistent with the double hammerhead mode of cleavage. The self-cleavage of the satRYMV in the (+) strand and not in the (-) strand implies that the satRYMV replicates through an asymmetric mode of rolling circle replication, similar to other sobemoviral satellites with the exception of satLTSV.

==Evolutionary origin==

Considering properties such as their diminutive size, circular structure and the presence of hammerhead ribozymes, viroids may have had an ancient evolutionary origin distinct from that of the viruses. Likewise, the lack of any sequence similarity between the satellite RNAs and their host viruses, host plants and insect vectors implies that these satellite RNAs have had a spontaneous origin. Alternatively, the siRNAs and microRNAs generated during viral infections may have been amplified by helper virus replicases, whereby these molecules assembled to form satellite RNAs.

Virusoids and viroids have been compared to circular introns due to their size similarity. It has been proposed that virusoids and viroids originated from introns. Comparisons have been made between the (-) strand of viroids and the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNPs), implicating that viroids could be escaped introns. Dickson (1981) also observed such homologies within both the (+) and (-) strands of viroids and virusoids. In particular, virusoids and viroids exhibit several structural and sequence homologies to the group I introns such as the self-splicing intron of &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot;.

A phylogeny based on a manually-adjusted alignment in 2001 suggests that virusoids may form a clade of their own as a sister group to Avsunviroidae, which also possess hammerhead ribozymes. However, the said alignment is not available, making the results hard to reproduce.

Virusoids and other circular RNAs are ancient molecules that are being explored with renewed interest. Circular RNAs have been shown to possess a number of functions, ranging from modulation of gene expression, interactions with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) acting as miRNA sponges and have been linked to a number of human diseases, including aging and cancer.

==Developments==
Abouhaidar et al., 2014 demonstrated the only example of protein translation and messenger RNA activity in the Rice yellow mottle virus small circular satellite RNA (scRYMV). This group suggested that the scRYMV be designated as a virusoid satelliteRNA that could serve as a model system for both translation and replication.

The most promising application of these subviral agents is to make specific vectors that can be used for the future development of biological control agents for plant viral diseases. The vector system could be applied for the overexpression and silencing of foreign genes. The unique example of a foreign expression vector is Bamboo mosaic virus satellite RNA (satBaMV), which possesses an open reading frame that encodes a 20-kDa P20 protein. It was observed that when this nonessential ORF region was replaced with a foreign gene, expression of the foreign gene was enhanced or overexpressed. In the case of gene silencing, various satellite RNA-based vectors can be used for sequence-specific inactivation. Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus (STMV) was the first subviral agent to be developed as a satellite virus-induced silencing system (SVISS).

<doc id="291912" wikidata="Q16743426" url="?curid=291912" title="Introduction to gauge theory">
<text>A gauge theory is a type of theory in physics. The word gauge means a measurement, a thickness, an in-between distance (as in railroad tracks), or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition). Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of fields, e.g., the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and fields that describe forces between the elementary particles. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the density of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.

In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a gauge transformation; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called gauge invariance. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of &quot;color&quot; would show gauge invariance. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a symmetry, gauge invariance is sometimes called gauge symmetry. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.

For example, in electromagnetism the electric field E and the magnetic field B are observable, while the potentials &quot;V&quot; (&quot;voltage&quot;) and A (the vector potential) are not. Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to &quot;V&quot;, no observable change occurs in E or B.

With the advent of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, and with successive advances in quantum field theory, the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces (fundamental interactions) arise from the constraints imposed by &quot;local&quot; gauge symmetries, in which case the transformations vary from point to point in space and time. Perturbative quantum field theory (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called gauge bosons. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the Standard Model, a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except gravity.

==History and importance==

The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s formulation, in 1864–65, of electrodynamics in &quot;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&quot;. The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, David Hilbert had derived Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates, just as Einstein was completing his work. Later Hermann Weyl, inspired by success in Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in 1919 that invariance under the change of scale or &quot;gauge&quot; (a term inspired by the various track gauges of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism. Although Weyl&#x27;s choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name &quot;gauge&quot; stuck to the approach. After the development of quantum mechanics, Weyl, Vladimir Fock and Fritz London modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave phase, and applying it successfully to electromagnetism. Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills in an attempt to describe the strong nuclear forces. This idea, dubbed Yang–Mills theory, later found application in the quantum field theory of the weak force, and its unification with electromagnetism in the electroweak theory.

The importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the quantum-mechanical behavior of electromagnetism, the weak force and the strong force. This gauge theory, known as the Standard Model, accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four fundamental forces of nature.

==In classical physics==

===Electromagnetism===

Historically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical electromagnetism. A static electric field can be described in terms of an electric potential (voltage, formula_1) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or ground. But only &quot;differences&quot; in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a voltmeter must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset. If the potential formula_1 is a solution to Maxwell&#x27;s equations then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential formula_3 is also a solution to Maxwell&#x27;s equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation. Maxwell&#x27;s equations have a gauge symmetry.

Generalizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the magnetic vector potential A, which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto &quot;V&quot;, one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If A is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same E (electric) and B (magnetic) fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials &quot;V&quot; and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore Maxwell&#x27;s equations are still satisfied.

Gauge symmetry is closely related to charge conservation. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge &quot;q&quot; at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy &quot;E&quot;1=&quot;qV&quot;1 and destroying it released &quot;E&quot;2=&quot;qV&quot;2, which would seem natural since &quot;qV&quot; measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, &quot;qV&quot;2-&quot;qV&quot;1, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, &quot;qV&quot;2-&quot;qV&quot;1. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation formula_3, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules &quot;E&quot;1=&quot;qV&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2=&quot;qV&quot;2 for the energies of creation and destruction &quot;would&quot; allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge &quot;q&quot; at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is formula_1 and formula_6 respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.

===General relativity===
As discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) general relativity are arbitrary coordinate transformations. Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being differentiable an arbitrary number of times.

====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====
Some global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, Galileo and Newton introduced the notion of translation invariance, an advancement from the Aristotelian concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.

Suppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.

Recalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was &quot;t&quot;, the time of the modern experiment is &quot;t&quot;+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the Big Bang, and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.

In other words, if in the theory we change the time &quot;t&quot; to &quot;t&quot;+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.

====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein&#x27;s field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====
In Einstein&#x27;s general relativity, coordinates like &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; are not only &quot;relative&quot; in the global sense of translations like formula_7, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as formula_8, where formula_9 has dimensions of time, and yet Einstein&#x27;s equations will have the same form.

Invariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as general covariance, and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein&#x27;s field equation.

==In quantum mechanics==

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields E and B or the potentials &quot;V&quot; and A that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.

===Aharonov–Bohm experiment===

In quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the double-slit experiment is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in constructive interference. The frequency, &quot;f&quot;, of the electron &quot;wave&quot; is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron &quot;particle&quot; via the quantum-mechanical relation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;hf&quot;. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron&#x27;s energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.

But now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field were imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −&quot;eV&quot; added to it, where −&quot;e&quot; is the charge of the electron and &quot;V&quot; the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.

====Explanation with potentials====
It is even possible to have cases in which an experiment&#x27;s results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the Aharonov–Bohm effect, shown in the figure. In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field B to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential A in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials &quot;V&quot; and A that are fundamental, and not the fields E and B, we can see that the gauge transformations, which change &quot;V&quot; and A, have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.

====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====
Note that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the &quot;difference&quot; in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here. If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a &quot;fixed&quot; amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a &quot;varying&quot; amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron&#x27;s &quot;clock&quot; would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

===Summary===
In summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., quantum electrodynamics, gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves. Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a renormalizable theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.

===Types of gauge symmetries===
The description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0≤θ&lt;360°, we force it to &quot;wrap around&quot; into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5° is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365°. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the &quot;wrap-around&quot; property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.

In mathematical terminology, electron phases form an Abelian group under addition, called the circle group or &quot;U&quot;(1). &quot;Abelian&quot; means that addition commutes, so that θ + φ = φ + θ. Group means that addition associates and has an identity element, namely &quot;0&quot;. Also, for every phase there exists an inverse such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.
As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;x&quot; measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.

In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, general relativity states that gravitational fields have energy, and special relativity concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The nuclear forces also have this self-interacting property.

===Gauge bosons===
Surprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom&#x27;s favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice&#x27;s and 0% Betty&#x27;s, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A&#x27;s and 0% B&#x27;s, 0% A&#x27;s and 100% B&#x27;s, or 20% A&#x27;s and 80% B&#x27;s, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(&quot;x&quot;), where an angle θ = 0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θ = 90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum &quot;p&quot; of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by &quot;p&quot; = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;λ&quot;. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by differentiation). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A&#x27;s and 80% B&#x27;s. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20–80 mixture to, say, 21–79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory does not work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.

Again there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(&quot;x&quot;). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum &quot;p&quot; = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;λ&quot;, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of &quot;V&quot; and A.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.

Although the function θ(&quot;x&quot;) describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called gauge bosons, where the term &quot;boson&quot; refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass. This is the case for the gauge bosons that carry the weak interaction: the force responsible for nuclear decay.

<text>The European polecat (Mustela putorius), also known as the common polecat, black polecat and forest polecat, is a mustelid species native to Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. It is of a generally dark brown colour, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, colour mutations including albinos, leucists, isabellinists, xanthochromists, amelanists, and erythrists occur. It has a shorter, more compact body than other &quot;Mustela&quot; species, a more powerfully built skull and dentition, is less agile, and is well known for having the characteristic ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory.

It is much less territorial than other mustelids, with animals of the same sex frequently sharing home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, with pregnancy occurring after mating, following induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to ten kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption.

The European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, with its closest living relatives being the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink. With the two former species, it can produce fertile offspring, though hybrids between it and the latter species tend to be sterile, and are distinguished from their parent species by their larger size and more valuable pelts.

The European polecat is thought to be the sole ancestor of the ferret, which was domesticated more than 2,000 years ago for the purpose of hunting vermin. The species has otherwise been historically viewed negatively by humans. In Britain especially, the polecat was persecuted by gamekeepers, and became synonymous with promiscuity in early English literature. During modern times, the polecat is still scantly represented in popular culture when compared to other rare British mammals, and misunderstandings of its behaviour still persist in some rural areas. Since 2008, it has been classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range and large numbers.

==Etymology and naming==
The word &quot;polecat&quot; first appeared after the Norman Conquest of England, written (in Middle English) as &quot;polcat&quot;. While the second syllable is largely self-explanatory, the origin of the first is unclear. It is possibly derived from the French , meaning &quot;chicken&quot;, likely in reference to the species&#x27; fondness for poultry, or it may be a variant of the Old English , meaning &quot;foul&quot;. In Middle English, the species was referred to as , meaning &quot;foul marten&quot;, in reference to its strong odour. In Old French, the polecat was called , which was derived from the Low German and Scandinavian verb for &quot;to make a disagreeable smell&quot;. This was later corrupted in English as &quot;fitchew&quot; or &quot;fitchet&quot;, which itself became the word &quot;fitch&quot;, which is used for the polecat&#x27;s pelt. The word &quot;fitchet&quot; is the root word for the North American fisher, which was named by Dutch colonists in America who noted similarities between the two species. In some countries such as New Zealand, the term &quot;fitch&quot; has taken on a wider use to refer to related creatures such as ferrets, especially when farmed for their fur.

A 2002 article in The Mammal Society&#x27;s &quot;Mammal Review&quot; contested the European polecat&#x27;s status as an animal indigenous to Britain on account of a scarce fossil record and linguistic evidence. Unlike most native British mammals, the polecat&#x27;s Welsh name (, derived from the Middle English ) is not of Celtic origin, much as the Welsh names of invasive species such as the European rabbit and fallow deer (, derived from the Middle English and , derived from the Old French , respectively) are of Middle English or Old French origin. Polecats are not mentioned in Anglo-Saxon or Welsh literature prior to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, with the first recorded mention of the species in the Welsh language occurring in the 14th century&#x27;s &quot;Llyfr Coch Hergest&quot; and in English in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Pardoner&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1383). In contrast, attestations of the Welsh word for pine marten (), date back at least to the 10th century Welsh Laws and possibly much earlier in northern England.

===Local and indigenous names===
====Dialectal English names====

===Latin name===
As well as the several indigenous names referring to smell (see above), the scientific name &quot;Mustela putorius&quot; is also derived from this species&#x27; foul smell. The Latin translates to &quot;stench&quot; or &quot;stink&quot; and is the origin of the English word &quot;putrid&quot;.

==Evolution==
The earliest true polecat was &quot;Mustela stromeri&quot;, which appeared during the late Villafranchian. It was considerably smaller than the present form, thus indicating polecats evolved at a relatively late period. The oldest modern polecat fossils occur in Germany, Britain and France, and date back to the Middle Pleistocene. The European polecat&#x27;s closest relatives are the steppe polecat and black-footed ferret, with which it is thought to have shared &quot;Mustela stromeri&quot; as a common ancestor. The European polecat is, however, not as maximally adapted in the direction of carnivory as the steppe polecat, being less specialised in skull structure and dentition. The European polecat likely diverged from the steppe polecat 1.5 million years ago based on IRBP, though cytochrome b transversions indicate a younger date of 430,000 years. It is also closely related to the European mink, with which it can hybridise.

===Domestication===

Morphological, cytological and molecular studies confirm the European polecat is the sole ancestor of the ferret, thus disproving any connection with the steppe polecat, which was once thought to have contributed to the ferret&#x27;s creation. Ferrets were first mentioned by Aristophanes in 425 BC and by Aristotle in 350 BC. Greek and Roman writers in the first century AD were the first to attest on the ferret&#x27;s use in bolting rabbits from their burrows. The first accurate descriptions of ferrets come from Strabo during 200 AD, when ferrets were released onto the Balearic Islands to control rabbit populations. As the European rabbit is native to the Iberian Peninsula and northwest Africa, the European polecat likely was first domesticated in these regions.

The ferret and European polecat are similar in both size and portions, to the point that dark-coloured ferrets are almost indistinguishable from their wild cousins, though the ferret&#x27;s skull has a smaller cranial volume, and has a narrower postorbital constriction. Compared to the European polecat, the ferret has a much smaller brain, though this comparison has not been made with Mediterranean polecats, from which ferrets likely derive. The theory of a Mediterranean origin is further strengthened because the ferret is less tolerant of cold than northern polecat subspecies. Unlike other subspecies, which are largely solitary, the ferret will readily live in social groups. The ferret is also slower in all its movements than the polecat, and hardly ever makes any use of its anal scent glands. Overall, the ferret represents a neotenous form of polecat.

===Subspecies===
, seven subspecies are recognised.
==Description==

===Build===
The appearance of the European polecat is typical of members of the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;, though it is generally more compact in conformation and, although short-legged, has a less elongated body than the European mink or steppe polecat. The tail is short, about one-third its body length. The eyes are small, with dark brown irises. The hind toes are long and partially webbed, with weakly curved 4 mm-long, nonretractable claws. The front claws are strongly curved, partially retractable, and measure 6 mm in length. The feet are moderately long and more robust than in other members of the genus. The polecat&#x27;s skull is relatively coarse and massive, more so than the mink&#x27;s, with a strong, but short and broad facial region and strongly developed projections. In comparison to other similarly sized mustelids, the polecat&#x27;s teeth are very strong, large and massive in relation to skull size. Sexual dimorphism in the skull is apparent in the lighter, narrower skull of the female, which also has weaker projections. The polecat&#x27;s running gait is not as complex and twisting as that of the mink or stoat, and it is not as fast as the mountain weasel (&quot;solongoi&quot;), stoat or least weasel, as it can be outrun by a conditioned man. Its sensory organs are well developed, though it is unable to distinguish between colours.

The dimensions of the European polecat vary greatly. The species does not conform to Bergmann&#x27;s rule, with the pattern of size variation seeming to follow a trend of size increase along an east–west axis. Males measure in body length and females are . The tail measures 115–167 mm in males and 84–150 mm in females. Adult males in middle Europe weigh and females . Gigantism is known among polecats, but specimens exhibiting this are likely the products of polecat-mink hybridisation.

===Fur===

The winter fur of the European polecat is brownish black or blackish brown, the intensity of which is determined by the colour of the long guard hairs. On the back and flanks, the dark tone is brightened by bright whitish-yellowish, sometimes yellowish-greyish underfur which shows through. The lightly coloured underfur is not equally visible on different parts of the body. On the back and hindquarters, the underfur is almost completely covered by the dark guard hairs. On the flanks, though, the lightening is well defined, and contrasts sharply with the general tone of the back. The throat, lower neck, chest and abdomen are black or blackish brown. The limbs are pure black or black with brown tints, while the tail is black or blackish brown, completely lacking light underfur. The area around and between the eyes is black-brown, with a longitudinal stripe of similar colour along the top of the nose. The ears are dark brown and edged with white. The summer fur is short, sparse and coarse. It is greyer, duller and lacking in the lustre of the winter fur. The underfur is more weakly developed in the summer fur, and has a brownish-grey or rusty-grey colour. The polecat is a good swimmer, but its fur is not as well insulated against cold water as the American mink&#x27;s; while a mink will take 118 minutes to cool in a water temperature of , the polecat cools down much faster at 26–28 minutes.

Polecats were found in two major phenotypes a typic one and a dark fur one with no black mask. Colour mutations include albinos, leucists, isabellinists, xanthochromists, amelanists, and erythrists. In typical erythristic individuals, the underfur is usually bright reddish. The guard hairs on the trunk are bright reddish or reddish brown. Black guard hairs are absent on the lower body and head. In some rare cases, the guard hairs are so light, they are almost indistinguishable from the pale-yellow underfur. These individuals are called &quot;amelanistic&quot;. In these cases, the whole animal is a very light golden-yellow colour. These individuals are called &quot;isabelline&quot; or &quot;xanthochromistic&quot;.

==Behaviour==
===Social and territorial behaviour===
The European polecat has definite home ranges that vary according to season, habitat, sex and social status. Breeding females settle in discrete areas, whereas breeding males and dispersing juveniles have more fluid home ranges, and are more mobile. Both males and females share home ranges with other members of the same sex; males have larger home ranges than females, but evidence of territorial marking is sparse.

European polecats use several den sites distributed throughout their home ranges and are often most active around rabbit warrens. Some European polecats use farm buildings or haystacks as daytime resting sites in winter. Occasionally, European polecats use abandoned European badger or red fox burrows. Like other mustelids, the polecat is usually a silent animal, though it will growl fiercely when angered, and squeak when distressed. It also emits a low, mewling cry to its mate or offspring.

===Reproduction and development===
The European polecat is a seasonal breeder, with no courtship rituals. During the mating season, the male grabs the female by the neck and drags her about to stimulate ovulation, then copulates for up to an hour. The species is polygamous, with each male polecat mating with several females. The gestation period lasts 40–43 days, with litters usually being born in May-early June. Each litter typically consists of five to ten kits. At birth, the kits weigh and measure in body length; they are blind and deaf. At the age of one week, the kits are covered in silky, white fur, which is replaced with a cinnamon brown-greyish woolly coat at the age of 3–4 wk. Weaning begins at three weeks of age, while the permanent dentition erupts after 7–8 wk. The kits become independent after two to three months. Females are very protective of their young, and have even been known to confront humans approaching too closely to their litters.

==Ecology==
===Diet===

The European polecat&#x27;s diet consists of mouse-like rodents, followed by amphibians and birds. Its most frequent prey item in the former Soviet Union is the common vole and rarely the red-backed vole. In large river floodlands, water vole are common prey. In spring and winter, amphibians (especially grass frogs and green toads) become important food items. Selective predation on male frogs by the polecat decreases the occurrence of polyandry in frog populations. However, because amphibians have little calorific value, the polecat never grows fat on them, no matter how many it consumes. In Central Europe, the diet in winter months is dominated by birds including quail, grey partridges, grouse, chickens, pigeons and passerines. Seasonal changes in the activity rhythm is synchronised with the activity of the main prey. Some species only rarely preyed upon by the polecat include European hedgehogs, asp vipers, grass snakes, lizards and insects. In Britain, it commonly kills brown rats and European rabbits, and is capable of killing larger prey, such as geese and hares. One polecat was reported to frequently wait at a riverbank and catch eels, which it took back to its burrow.
The European polecat hunts its prey by stalking it and seizing it with its canine teeth, killing the animal with a bite to the neck. This killing method is instinctive, but perfected with practice. The polecat sometimes caches its food, particularly during seasonal gluts of frogs and toads. Sometimes, the polecat does not kill these, but bites them at the base of the skull, thus paralyzing them and keeping them fresh for later consumption. Although they are normally shy around humans, naturalist Alfred Brehm in his &quot;Brehms Tierleben&quot; mentions an exceptional case in which three polecats attacked a baby in Hesse. During winter, some European polecats raid beehives and feed on honey.

===Enemies and competitors===
Although the European polecat can coexist with the European mink, it suffers in areas where the invasive American mink also occurs, as the latter species feeds on the same mammals as the polecat much more frequently than the European mink, and has been known to drive the polecat out of wetland habitats. In areas where the European polecat is sympatric with the steppe polecat, the two species overlap greatly in choice of food, though the former tends to consume more household foods and birds, while the latter preys on mammals more frequently. There is at least one record of a beech marten killing a polecat. The European polecat may prey on the much smaller least weasel.

==Hybridisation==
In some parts of Britain, the abandonment of domestic ferrets has led to ferret-polecat crossbreeds living in the wild. Ferrets were likely first brought to Britain after the Norman Conquest of England, or as late as the fourteenth century. Crossbreeds between the two animals typically have a distinct white throat patch, white feet and white hairs interspersed among the fur. Typically, first generation crossbreeds between polecats and ferrets develop their wild parents&#x27; fear of humans if left with their mothers during the critical socialisation period between 7½ and 8½ weeks of age.

The European polecat can hybridise with the European mink, producing offspring termed &quot;khor&#x27;-tumak&quot; by Russian furriers and &quot;khonorik&quot; by fanciers. Such hybridisation is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where the European mink population is in decline. A polecat-mink hybrid has a poorly defined facial mask, yellow fur on the ears, grey-yellow underfur and long, dark brown guard hairs. It is fairly large, with a male attaining the peak sizes known for European polecats weighing and measuring in length; a female is much larger than a female European minks weighing and measuring in length. The majority of polecat-mink hybrids have skulls bearing greater similarities to those of polecats than to minks; they can swim well and burrow for food like polecats, but are difficult to tame and breed, as males are sterile. The first captive polecat-mink hybrid was created in 1978 for fur, but breeding of these hybrids declined as European mink populations decreased. Studies on the behavioural ecology of free-ranging polecat-mink hybrids in the upper reaches of the Lovat River indicate that hybrids stray from aquatic habitats more readily than minks, and tolerate both parent species entering their territories, though the hybrid&#x27;s larger size, especially the male&#x27;s deters intrusion. During summer, the diets of wild polecat-mink hybrids are more similar to those of minks than to the polecats, as they feed predominantly on frogs. During winter, their diets overlap more with those of polecats, and will eat a larger proportion of rodents than in the summer, though they still rely heavily on frogs and rarely scavenge ungulate carcasses as polecats do.

The European polecat can also hybridise with the Asian steppe polecat or the domestic ferret to produce fertile offspring. European-steppe polecat hybrids are very rare, despite their sympatry in several areas. Nevertheless, hybrids have been recorded in southern Ukraine, the Kursk and Voronezh Oblasts, the Trans-Carpathians and several other localities.

==Range, history and conservation==
The European polecat is widespread in the western Palaearctic to the Urals in the Russian Federation, though it is absent from Ireland, northern Scandinavia, and much of the Balkans and eastern Adriatic coast. It occurs only marginally in northern Greece. It is found in Morocco in the Rif Mountains, from sea level to . Its domesticated form, the ferret, was introduced in Britain, and some Mediterranean islands and New Zealand.

===Britain===

In Britain, the European polecat was regarded as a serious poultry predator prior to the introduction of wire netting, therefore eliminating it was considered the only option to protect stock. This extreme enmity does not appear to have been universal however. Speaking of Merioneth (Gwynedd) Peter Hope Jones reported that &quot;for a county supposedly well-placed within the known past distribution of this species, Merioneth has relatively very few records of Polecats amongst its parish bounty payments. Perhaps this animal was not generally considered to be an important pest, but whatever the real reason, in only two parishes are direct references made to this species by the name by which we know it today. In the years from 1729 to 1732 about twenty were killed in Towyn parish, where 2/6 was paid for a full-grown polecat and half this sum for a young &#x27;kittin&#x27;. Records for Llanfor... show that only 42 were killed in the 39-year period from 1720 to 1758, the payment being exactly half the going rate for a fox, i.e. 2/6 for a full-grown polecat, and 1/3 for a young animal&quot;.

In Kent, for example, at least 42 parishes paid bounties for polecats, of which three extended into the 19th century, though by this time only single individuals were recorded, and usually after gaps of many years. In the Kingdom of Scotland, during the reign of David II, an export duty of 4d. was imposed on each polecat fur trimmer, which was raised to 8d. in 1424. The species held an important place in Scotland&#x27;s fur markets; the annual Dumfries Fur Fair (1816–1874) sold 400 polecat pelts in 1829 and 600 in 1831. The following year, a contemporary account described polecat skins as &quot;a drug on the market&quot;. In 1856, the number of sold pelts decreased to 240, 168 in 1860, 12 in 1866 and none in 1869. The decline was halted with the decrease in the intensity of gamekeeping during the 20 year interval between the First and Second World Wars.

The European polecat is afforded both national and European protection; it is listed on Schedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Regulation 41 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 and is listed on Annex V of the Habitats Directive. A survey carried out by the Vincent Wildlife Trust in 2015 found that the polecat had spread into areas (such as East Anglia and South Yorkshire) where they had not been seen for 100 years. Naturalist Chris Packham termed the spread &quot;...one of the great natural recoveries.&quot;

The New Forest in Hampshire also now has a small polecat population, a fact discovered after scientists set up cameras to film pine martens.

===France===
The European polecat is present in all of France&#x27;s territories, excepting Corsica, and has been in a state of decline for several decades. Nevertheless, it is listed as Least Concern on France&#x27;s Red Data Book. The European polecat is rare in numerous regions or départements. In the Rhone-Alps region, its population has undergone a sizeable decline since the 1990s, largely as a consequence of poisoning campaigns against muskrats. A 1999 study on the decline of polecats in this region indicated the species has little chance of surviving there. Elsewhere, it is considered either rare or sporadic in 22 districts and absent or extirpated in 22 others. In Drôme, for example, polecat populations have been decreasing since 1975, and have disappeared in 27 communes in Isère. Its numbers are declining in Morvan and Ariège, and is thinly distributed in Brittany. Although present in Aquitaine, its numbers have been dropping since the 1950s, and is very rare in the mountain regions. In Normandy, the speed of the polecat&#x27;s decline has somewhat decreased. In the alpine départements, its range is limited by altitude, as the species relies on more Mediterranean climates to thrive. It is, however, especially abundant in the irrigated Crau, but is absent on the eastern part of the area, apparently being restricted by the valleys of the Durance and Rhone Rivers. The largest populations occur in Northern France: Pas de Calais, Central France; Alsace, Lorraine and the areas of the Loire with the Vendée, which holds the largest record of polecat observations. It is common in all the départements of Champagne-Ardenne.

===Former Soviet Union===
The western border of the European polecat&#x27;s range in the former Soviet Union begins from the mouth of the Danube in the south approximately to northwest of Suoyarvi, on the Finnish border in the north. In Karelia, its northern border extends from the former point towards the southeast to the Spassk Bay of Lake Onega, thereby passing around the West Karelian uplands from the south and then, passing around these uplands from the east, it suddenly ascends directly to the north passing in particular, near the western shore of Segozer and reaches Rugozer. From there, the border line turns northeast, crossing the Lakhta and reaching Kem on the White Sea. From Archangelsk, the border reaches Mezen, thus attaining the species&#x27; most northerly range. From the Mezen River&#x27;s mouth, the border abruptly returns south, approaching closer to the upper Mezen near 64° lat. From there, the polecat&#x27;s northern border goes on to the upper Vychegda River, and descends further on southwards and in the Urals. Its eastern range apparently extends along the Urals, embracing Sverdlovsk from the west. It is probably absent in the southern Urals, where the steppe polecat occurs. The southern border of the polecat&#x27;s range starts in the west of the Danube&#x27;s mouth and extends eastward along the coast of the Black Sea reaching the mouth of the Dnepr, from which it moves back from the shore of the Azov Sea and, along it, goes to the mouth of the Don. From the mouth and lower course of the Don, its range passes into the steppe region of western and middle Ciscaucasia. The European polecat is absent from the Saratov steppes of Transvolga, instead being encountered only in the extreme lower Bolshoy and Maly Irgiz Rivers. Further on, the border goes to the north along the Volga River. It steeply returns east somewhat south at the Samara bend, passing around Obshchy Syrt, reaching the Urals at the latitude of Magnitogorsk. The range of the polecat within the former Soviet Union has expanded northwards. From 1930 to 1952 for example, the polecat colonised northwestern Karelia and southern Finland.

Prior to the First World War, the Russian Empire produced more than 50% of global polecat skins. The harvesting of polecats in Russia increased substantially after the October Revolution, which coincided with Western Europe&#x27;s decline in polecat numbers. The Russian population of polecats decreased somewhat after the Second World War, and their hunting was subsequently discouraged, as polecats were acknowledged to limit harmful rodent populations.

==Diseases and parasites==
The European polecat may suffer from distemper, influenza, the common cold and pneumonia. Occasionally, it is affected by malignant tumours and hydrocephaly. It commonly has broken teeth and, on rarer occasions, fatal abscesses on the jaw, head and neck. In mainland Europe, it is a carrier of trichinosis, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and adiaspiromycosis. Incidences of polecats carrying rabies are high in some localized areas.

Ectoparasites known to infest polecats include flea species such as &quot;Ctenocephalides felis&quot;, &quot;Archaeospylla erinacei&quot;, &quot;Nosopsyllus fasciatus&quot; and &quot;Paraceras melis&quot;. The tick &quot;Ixodes hexagonus&quot; is the polecat&#x27;s most common ectoparasite, which is sometimes found in large numbers on the neck and behind the ears. Another, less common species to infest polecats is &quot;I. canisuga&quot;. The biting louse &quot;Trichodectes jacobi&quot; is also known to infest polecats.

Endoparasites carried by polecats include the cestodes &quot;Taenia tenuicollis&quot; and &quot;T. martis&quot; and the nematodes &quot;Molineus patens&quot;, &quot;Strongyloides papillosus&quot;, &quot;Capilliaria putorii&quot;, &quot;Filaroides martis&quot; and &quot;Skjrabingylus nasicola&quot;.

==Relationships with humans==

===Hunting and fur use===
European polecat hunting was once a favourite sport of the Westmorland dalesmen and the Scots, who hunted them at night in midwinter. However, the majority of polecat deaths caused by humans have been accidental, having mostly been caused by steel traps set for rabbits. Hunting polecats by moonlight was also a popular diversion among midland schoolboys. Until the mid-19th century, polecats in Britain were hunted from early February to late April with mixed packs of hunting dogs on the Welsh hills and Lakeland fells, though otterhounds were used on the fells, the Border country and the Scottish Lowlands. John Tucker Edwardes, the creator of the Sealyham terrier, used captured wild male polecats to test the gameness of yearling terriers. In the former Soviet Union, polecats are hunted chiefly in late autumn and early winter with guns and hunting dogs, as well as foothold traps and wooden snares. However, even in season, hunters rarely catch more than 10–15 polecats. The species does not constitute an important element in former Soviet commercial hunting, and is usually only caught incidentally.

The European polecat is a valuable fur bearer, whose pelt (fitch) is more valuable than the steppe polecat&#x27;s. Its skin is used primarily in the production of jackets, capes and coats. It is particularly well suited for trimmings for women&#x27;s clothing. The tail is sometimes used for the making of paintbrushes. One disadvantage of polecat skin, however, is its unpleasant odour, which is difficult to remove. The European polecat was first commercially farmed for its fur in Great Britain during the 1920s, but was only elevated to economic importance in Finland in 1979. It never became popular in the United States and Canada, due to import laws regarding non-native species. It did gain economic importance in the USSR, though.
===Tameability===
Unlike the stoat and least weasel, the European polecat is easy to breed in captivity. According to Aubyn Trevor-Battye, the European polecat is difficult to tame, but is superior to its domesticated form, the ferret, in bolting rats from their holes due to its greater agility. It is prone to attempting escape once finished bolting rats, but can be easily outrun. Polecat kits can be successfully raised and suckled by mother cats. According to &quot;Owen&#x27;s Welsh Dictionary&quot;, the Gwythelians (early Irish settlers in northern Wales) kept polecats as pets. Attempts to tame the European polecat are generally hampered by the adult&#x27;s nervous and unsociable disposition. First generation hybrids between polecats and ferrets, conceived to improve the latter&#x27;s bloodlines, produce animals with personalities similar to their wild parent&#x27;s.

===In culture===
In Britain, the polecat historically has had a negative reputation. References to the polecat in early English literature are often vilifying, usually being synonymous with prostitutes and generally immoral people, as is the case in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;: &quot;Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you polecat, you runyon!&quot; In some rural areas, the belief persists that the polecat chews off the ears of sleeping sheep and can paralyse or kill men by jumping on them from behind and biting their necks. However, in some regions, it was widely believed among farmers that allowing a polecat to nest in a chicken coop would ensure the animal would not kill the poultry out of gratitude, and instead kill vermin. Cases in which polecats did kill poultry were attributed to animals which were guests at other farms. In Wales, polecats were widely believed to migrate in large numbers every spring to the great peat bog of Tregaron to feed on the breeding frogs there. This was later proven to be incorrect, as the climate in Tregaron is too wet for the European polecat, and it does not hold large frog populations. Compared to other British carnivores, such as otters and badgers, the polecat has received little exposure in popular media. A study conducted on rural school children showed only 3.8% of the surveyed children could identify polecats in photographs, whereas 83.7% correctly identified otters.
