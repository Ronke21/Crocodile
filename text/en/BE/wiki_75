<text> (; ; ; abbreviated as INC) is an independent nontrinitarian Christian church founded in 1913 and registered by Felix Manalo in 1914 as a sole religious corporation of the Insular Government of the Philippines.

The INC describes itself to be the one true church and the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus, whereby all other Christian churches are apostatic. According to INC doctrine, the official registration of the church with the Philippine government was on July 27, 1914, by Felix Y. Manalo—who is upheld by members to be the last messenger of God—was an act of divine providence and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy concerning the re-establishment of the original church of Jesus in the Far East concurrent with the coming of the seventh seal marking the end of days.

By the time of Manalo&#x27;s death in 1963, INC had become a nationwide church with 1,250 local chapels and 35 cathedrals. As his successor, Manalo&#x27;s son, Eraño Manalo, led a campaign to grow and internationalize the church until his death on August 31, 2009. His son, Eduardo V. Manalo, succeeded him as Executive Minister. The 2020 Philippine census reported that 2.8 million were adherents of the INC, placing it third behind the Roman Catholic Church and Islam.

==History==
During the American colonial era of the Philippines, there were a variety of rural anti-colonial movements, often with religious undertones, and American Protestant missionaries introduced several alternatives to the Catholic Church, the established church during the Spanish colonial period.

===Felix Y. Manalo===
Felix Y. Manalo, born on May 10, 1886, in Taguig, Philippines, was baptized into the Catholic Church. Manalo became dissatisfied with Catholic theology in his teenage years. According to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the establishment of the Philippine Independent Church (also called the Aglipayan Church) was his major turning point. Still, Manalo remained uninterested since its doctrines were mainly Catholic. In 1904, he joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, entered the Methodist seminary, and became a pastor for a while. He also explored various Christian denominations, including the Presbyterian Church, Christian Mission, and finally the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1911. Manalo left Adventism in 1913 and associated himself with atheist and agnostic peers.

In November 1913, Manalo secluded himself with religious literature and unused notebooks in a friend&#x27;s house in Pasay, instructing everyone in the home not to disturb him. He emerged from seclusion three days later with his new-found doctrines. Manalo, together with his wife, went to Punta, Santa Ana, Manila, in November 1913 and started preaching. He left the congregation in the care of his first ordained minister and returned to his native Taguig to evangelise; there, he was ridiculed and stoned at his meetings with locals. He later baptized a few converts, including some of his persecutors. He later registered his new-found religion as the Iglesia ni Cristo (English: Church of Christ; Spanish: Iglesia de Cristo) on July 27, 1914, at the Bureau of Commerce as a corporation sole, with himself as the first executive minister. Expansion followed as INC started building congregations in the provinces in 1916, with Pasig (then in Rizal province) having two locals established. The first three ministers were ordained in 1919.

By 1924, INC had about 3,000 to 5,000 adherents in 43 or 45 &quot;congregations&quot; in Manila and six nearby provinces. By 1936, INC had 85,000 members. This figure grew to 200,000 by 1954. A Cebu congregation was built in 1937—the first to be established outside of Luzon, and the first in the Visayas. The first mission to Mindanao was commissioned in 1946. Meanwhile, its first concrete chapel was built in Sampaloc, Manila, in 1948. Adherents fleeing for the provinces away from Manila, where the Japanese forces were concentrated during World War II, were used for evangelization. As Manalo&#x27;s health began to fail in the 1950s, his son Eraño began taking leadership of the church. Manalo died on April 12, 1963.

===Reaching the Far West and expansion===
On July 27, 1968, Eraño Manalo officiated the inaugural worship service of the church in Ewa Beach, Honolulu, Hawaii—the first mission of the church outside the Philippines. The following month, INC established the San Francisco congregation. INC reached Europe through the United Kingdom in 1971 and Canada in 1973. INC established its first congregation in South Africa in 1978. INC established congregations in Rome, Italy, on July 27, 1994; Jerusalem, Israel, on March 31, 1996; and Athens, Greece, on May 10, 1997. In 1998, INC has established 543 congregations and missions in 74 countries outside the Philippines.

In 1965, INC launched its first resettlement and land reform program in Barrio Maligaya, Laur, Nueva Ecija. INC started operating a radio station in 1969; its first television program aired in 1983. The Ministerial Institute of Development, renamed as &quot;Iglesia ni Cristo (Church Of Christ) School for Ministers&quot;, was founded in 1974 in Quiapo, Manila, and moved in Quezon City in 1978. In 1971, the INC Central Office building was built in Quezon City. In 1984, the 7,000-seat Central Temple was added to the complex. The Tabernacle, a multipurpose tent-like building that can accommodate up to 4,000 people, was finished in 1989. The complex also includes the New Era University, a tertiary education institution run by INC. Eraño G. Manalo died on August 31, 2009. His son, Eduardo V. Manalo, succeeded him as executive minister upon his death.

===21st century===

On July 21, 2014, former president Benigno Aquino III and INC executive minister Eduardo V. Manalo led the inauguration of Ciudad de Victoria, a 140-hectare tourism zone in Bocaue and Santa Maria, Bulacanq, where the Philippine Arena is also located. The Philippine Arena, a 55,000-seat multi-purpose structure owned by the INC, currently holds the Guinness World Record for the largest mixed-used indoor theater.

The Philippine government declared 2014 the &quot;Iglesia ni Cristo Centennial Year&quot; through Proclamation 815. On July 27 of the same year, the government announced a special non-working holiday to commemorate the 100th founding anniversary of Iglesia ni Cristo.

The INC celebrated its centennial anniversary at Ciudad de Victoria, with the Philippine Arena as the main venue, and in about 1,180 worship buildings worldwide through live video feed. The week-long celebration consisted of pyro-musical displays, a worship service led by Manalo, an oratorio, a musical presentation, a theatrical play, a quiz show, and an evangelical mission. The worship service for the INC centennial secured two Guinness World Records: the largest gospel choir with 4,745 members, and the largest mixed-use indoor theater for the Philippine Arena, which had 51,929 attendees. On July 26, 2015, INC capped its centennial year through activities such as International Unity Games, a worship service led by Manalo, and a Closing Centennial Celebration held in Washington D.C., United States, and the Philippine Arena.

On October 4, 2015, INC, through VIVA Films, conducted the world premiere of &quot;Felix Manalo&quot;, a film depicting the origin of the INC and the life of its first executive minister, which was held at the Philippine Arena.

According to the resolution passed by the Senate of the Philippines to commemorate INC&#x27;s 104th anniversary in 2018, the INC had established more than 7,000 congregations in 151 countries and territories worldwide.

==Beliefs and core values==

Iglesia ni Cristo believes that it is the true church established by Jesus Christ in the first century, and that its registration in the Philippines is the fulfillment of biblical prophecies that Christ&#x27;s church would re-emerge in the Far East. Because of a number of similarities, INC&#x27;s doctrines have been described as restorationist in outlook and theme.

===Bible===
The Iglesia ni Cristo believes that the Bible is the only book inspired by God, and thus it is the sole basis of all their beliefs and practices.

===God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit===
The Iglesia ni Cristo believes that God the Father is the creator deity and the only true God. INC rejects the traditional Christian belief in the Trinity as heresy, adopting a version of unitarianism. They believe that this position is attested by Jesus Christ and the Apostles.

The church believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the mediator between God the Father and humanity, and was created by God the Father. God sanctified him to be without sin, and bestowed upon him the titles &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Son of God&quot;. The church sees Jesus as God&#x27;s highest creation, believe that he is a Man and denies the deity of Jesus. Adherents profess Jesus&#x27; substitutionary role in the redemption of humankind. He is believed to have been &quot;foreordained before the foundation of the world&quot; and sent by God &quot;to deal with sin&quot;. Members &quot;are saved by Christ&#x27;s blood&quot; who died because of his &quot;self-sacrificing love&quot;.

INC believes that the Holy Spirit is the power of God and also not a deity, being sent by God the Father and Jesus Christ to guide God&#x27;s people.

===One true church===

The Iglesia ni Cristo believes that it is the one true church founded by Jesus Christ and was restored by Felix Manalo in the last days. They believe that the first century church apostasized in that century, or in the 4th century due to false teachings. INC says that this apostate church is the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, its reestablishment is seen as the signal for the end of days.

They believe that the Iglesia ni Cristo is the fulfillment of the Bible verse, Isaiah 43:5, where &quot;east&quot; refers to the Philippines where the Church of Christ would be founded. INC teaches that its members constitute the &quot;elect of God&quot; and there is no salvation outside the Iglesia ni Cristo. Faith alone is insufficient for salvation. The Iglesia ni Cristo says that the official name of the true church is &quot;Church of Christ or Iglesia ni Cristo (in Tagalog)&quot;. The two passages often cited by INC to support this are Romans 16:16 &quot;Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you&quot;,
and the George Lamsa translation of Acts 20:28: &quot;Take heed therefore ... to feed the church of Christ which he has purchased with his blood.&quot;

===Felix Manalo as the founder===
According to INC, Manalo is the &quot;angel from the east&quot; mentioned in Revelation 7:1–3 who started preaching about the INC coincide the outbreak of the World War I. This is the start of the period according to INC being referred to in the Bible as the ends of the earth
(cf Is 41:9-10; 43:5-6) the time when the end of the world is near, even at the very doors (cf. Mt. 24:3, 33), which began with the outbreak of a war of global proportions (cf. Mt. 24:6-7) Manalo is from the Philippines, which they say is in the &quot;center&quot; of the Far East. The ‘four winds’ in Revelation 7:1-3, they say refers to World War I and the four angels are the four leaders known as the big four (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando) who they say worked on the prevention of the war to continue.

Manalo is also portrayed as the fulfillment of several passages in Isaiah and other books of the Bible.

As the one who sent by God to restore INC, Manalo became the first executive minister and spiritual leader of the church. As such, he taught that what is written in the Bible was the ultimate authority in all aspects of the church, and effectively as a messenger of God, Manalo is &quot;the foremost Biblical authority for all humanity and the divinely designated leader of a reestablished Church of Christ in the modern world.&quot;

===Baptism===
The church believes that baptism is done by immersion baptism or Believer&#x27;s baptism by adults in water, and that it is necessary that people be baptised in the Iglesia ni Cristo to become disciples of Jesus Christ. The church rejects infant baptism. Newborn children of members are instead dedicated to God through a congregational prayer, led by an ordained minister of the INC.

===Expulsion===
Members who are not living in accordance with the doctrines taught in the INC are admonished. Those who continue in violation of INC doctrines after being admonished are expelled from the INC, thus losing salvation. As such, the church does not believe in the perseverance of the saints. Certain violations, such as eating blood, having too long of an absence from church services without a solid reason, drinking alcohol, or having a romantic relationship (including marriage) with a non-member, may result in mandatory expulsion.

===Eschatology and resurrection ===

INC believes that a person is composed of a body (&quot;vehicle&quot;), soul (&quot;individual&quot;) and spirit (&quot;life&quot; or fuel). Members believe that when a person dies, their body and soul both die and go into the grave where both will remain until the Second Coming of Christ, whereas the spirit will go back to God. Upon Christ&#x27;s return, all dead servants of God, from the time of the patriarchs up to the last days, would be resurrected to join living faithful and loyal INC members. They will be rewarded by living in the Holy City or New Jerusalem, together with God the Father, and Jesus Christ. At the right time chosen by God, a second resurrection would occur, and non-INC members will experience second death which is the Lake of Fire &quot;(Dagát-dagatang Apóy&quot;).

The church believes that God set a day where he will judge all people. They believe that this day is also the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

===Membership in labor organizations===
INC does not believe members should join labor unions. The policy comes from an interpretation of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians where members of the church should not join organizations with non-members. The legality of a closed shop firing INC members based on their religious convictions reached the Supreme Court in 1974.

==Practices==
===Worship and prayer===

The church conducts regular worship services, one during the week, and one during the weekend, conducted in the local languages (providing sign language interpreters and translators in some congregations). It consists of singing of hymns, prayers, studies of the bible, collection of voluntary offerings, and benediction. Both God the Father and Jesus are worshiped. The ministers of every congregation in a given worship service use the same sermon outline prepared by the executive minister. Deacons and Deaconesses guide worshipers to their seats and collect voluntary offerings. The singing of hymns is led by the locale&#x27;s choir. The first hymnbook, termed &quot;Ang Himnario ng Iglesia ni Cristo&quot;, which consists of over 300 songs, was published in 1937. Children&#x27;s worship services (Tagalog: &quot;Pagsamba ng Kabataan&quot;, or &quot;PNK&quot;) are held every weekend. They use similar lessons as the standard worship services taught using the Socratic method (question and answer). The church teaches that willfully forsaking the worship service is a grievous sin, thus members are expected to attend the congregational worship services twice a week without fail.

The church encourages its members to make prayer a part of everyday life. Thus, prayer before various activities, such as taking meals and going to sleep, are commonly practiced. Prayers recited in rote repetition are not observed.

===Evangelism===
Since February 1939, the church has been publishing &quot;Pasugo&quot; (&#x27;God&#x27;s Message&#x27;) in both Tagalog and English. Filipino has been the only language used since its inception in 1939 until 1953. Currently, about two-thirds of its pages are devoted to the English-speaking population. Felix Manalo wrote its first editorial where he stated the publication&#x27;s purpose, including the propagation of the faith. Issues contain articles which detail INC doctrines and refute doctrines which it considers as heresy, such as the Trinity. It also features information on church history, educational programs and missionary achievements, including lists and photographs of newly dedicated chapels. In 2001, it had a monthly circulation of 235,000 copies. For the year 2009, there were more than four million copies of &quot;Pasugo&quot; distributed worldwide.

In the Philippines, through the Christian Era Broadcasting Service International Incorporated (CEBSI Incorporated), INC broadcasts programs that discuss Bible
teachings over the radio and television. These programs are aired by about 60 other radio stations all over the Philippines (i.e. INC Radio- DZEM 954kHz) and several more in the US and Australia. INCTV 48, which is carried on all cable providers in the Philippines and some channels in the US Direct TV ch 2068, telecast the INC&#x27;s religious programs. These programs can also be seen in the Internet via one of the organisation&#x27;s news website.

INC holds religious gatherings called evangelical missions regularly which aim to attract more followers. On February 28, 2012, INC held its largest Philippine-wide evangelical missions simultaneously on 19 sites across the country. In Manila site alone, more than 600,000 people attended the event. On April 13, 2013, INC launched &quot;Lingap-Pamamahayag&quot; under its project &quot;Kabayan Ko, Kapatid Ko&quot; (English: My Countrymen, My Brethren), which incorporates outreach missions to its evangelical missions. On September 26, 2015, INC held its first worldwide evangelical mission at the Philippine Arena as the main venue and in 2,125 sites throughout the world through video conferencing. It was officiated by INC executive minister, Eduardo Manalo.

===Outreach===
On November 19, 1981, INC has launched the &quot;Lingap sa Mamamayan&quot; (&#x27;Aid To Humanity&#x27;) Program. The program aims to provide relief goods, health care, and other services to the needy, especially those who are afflicted by calamities and disasters. It also provides seminars for disaster preparedness, first aid, and family planning. Other humanitarian activities such as blood donation and community clean up drives were also conducted in different parts of the world where the Iglesia ni Cristo is established.

Felix Y. Manalo (FYM) Foundation, the INC&#x27;s arm in executing the &quot;Lingap sa Mamamayan&quot; and other related programs, was formally registered in the Philippines on February 4, 2011, and in the United States on May 17, 2012. The institution is also recognized in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Russia.

INC also established the Unlad International, Inc in 2012.

On July 7, 2012, the INC Lingap sa Mamamayan was conducted in the slums of Parola in Tondo, Manila and was awarded three Guinness world records for breaking records in the most people involved in a dental health check; the most blood pressure readings taken in 8 hours; and the most blood glucose level tests in 8 hours. On April 29, 2016, four more Guinness world records were broken by the INC. These records are the largest collection of clothes for recycle/donation, the most shoes donated to charity in 24 hours, the most medical ultrasound examinations in eight hours, and the most medical risk assessment in eight hours which was also held in Tondo, Manila.

On February 15, 2014, INC bagged another two Guinness world records when they conducted a worldwide charity walk simultaneously on 135 different sites scattered in 29 countries. INC holds the records for the largest charity walk on a single venue when 175,509 members of the church finished the 1.6 km walk in Manila; and for the largest charity walk in 24 hours (multiple venues) when a total of 519,521 participants finished the charity walk in different parts of the world. The proceeds were used for the housing and livelihood projects of super Typhoon Haiyan survivors. INC also broke the same records on May 6, 2018, for its Worldwide Walk to Fight Poverty with 283,171 people in single venue, and 773,136 people in multiple venues for its African missions and outreach.

On February 22, 2014, INC conducted another Lingap sa Mamamayan at its first resettlement project in Barrio Maligaya in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija. Coinciding with the barrio&#x27;s 49th anniversary, INC bagged another world record after setting the record for the most hunger relief packs distributed within eight hours. A total of 302,311 hunger relief packages were given.

On March 14, 2014, after conducting a worship service in Tacloban, Leyte, INC executive minister Eduardo V. Manalo, led the groundbreaking ceremony of the EVM Self-Sustainable Community Rehabilitation Project in Sitio New Era, a 3000-hectare property of the church in Brgy. Langit, Alang-alang, Leyte. The project, which costs more than one billion pesos, includes at least 1,000 housing units for the survivors of super typhoon Haiyan. Garments and dried fish factories, and eco-farming project are also included to provide livelihood to the community. More than 150,000 hunger relief packages were also given which contains 3 kilos of rice, canned goods and instant noodles aside from the free medical and dental services conducted that day. On January 23, 2015, Manalo inaugurated the livelihood and housing project.

On November 9, 2015, Manalo inaugurated a community project for Kabihug tribe, an indigenous group in Camarines Norte. The project is situated in a 100-hectare land which includes 300 housing units, calamansi orchard, ecological farm, dried fish factory, garments factory, clinic, learning center, and an INC worship building. After 6 months, another housing and eco-farming community project was inaugurated by the church on May 27, 2016, for the B&#x27;laan tribe in Bgy. Danlag, Tampakan South, South Cotabato in southern Philippines.

==Administration and organization==


Iglesia ni Cristo has had three Executive Ministers () who lead the Church Administration in overseeing the faith of the members. Eduardo V. Manalo, as the current Executive Minister, serves as the church&#x27;s leader, and, in this capacity, manages the administration of the church. Along with other senior ministers which comprises the Church Economic Council (), the Executive Minister forms the Central Administration of Iglesia ni Cristo.

The Central Office in Quezon City, built in 1971, is Iglesia ni Cristo&#x27;s headquarters. The Central Office is one of several structures inside the INC Central Office Complex. It houses the permanent offices of the central administration and some of the church&#x27;s departments. It is here where about a thousand INC professionals and volunteers hold office. It was located in Manila during its early years, then in San Juan, and later in Makati, before moving to its present site. INC also has three main offices outside the Philippines; in Burlingame, California; Washington D.C.; and in Heathrow, London.

Administration and ministerial work are delegated into ecclesiastical districts (termed &quot;divisions&quot; until 1990) which are led by District Ministers (formerly, &quot;division ministers&quot;). Ecclesiastical districts comprise 40 congregations (referred to as locales) on average. All locales were directly managed by Felix Y. Manalo until 1924 when the first ecclesiastical district was organized in Pampanga.

==Architecture==

Iglesia ni Cristo church buildings primarily serve as places of worship and are used for other religious functions. These are described by &quot;Culture and Customs of the Philippines&quot;, a book published by Greenwood Publishing Group, as structures &quot;which employ exterior neo-Gothic vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, interlocking trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as tower and spires.&quot; There are multiple entrances leading to the main sanctuary, where males and females sit on either side of the aisle facing a dais where sermons are made. The choir loft is located behind the dais, and in larger churches, a baptistry with pools for immersion baptism is located at the back of the church. Meanwhile, Fernando Nakpil-Zialcita, an anthropologist from Ateneo de Manila University, said that INC churches can be uniquely identified for &quot;its exuberant use of fanciful forms and ornaments [and a] brilliant white facade whose silhouette is a cusped Gothic arch or a flattened Saracenic arch.&quot; The distinctive spires represent &quot;the reaching out of the faithful to God.&quot; Prominent architects, such as Juan Nakpil (a National Artist of the Philippines for architecture) and Carlos A. Santos-Viola, had been involved in designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of INC, established in 1971, oversees the uniformity in design of church buildings.

The first chapel was built on Gabriela Street in Tondo, Manila in 1918, fashioned out of (woven leaf panels), nipa and wood, typified the style and materials of the early chapels. After World War II, INC began to build concrete chapels, the first of these in Washington (Maceda), Sampaloc, Manila completed in 1948. Next came the chapel and former official residence of the executive minister in San Juan, Rizal (now San Juan City, part of Metropolitan Manila), designed by Juan Nakpil. The Central Temple, which opened on July 27, 1984, can accommodate up to 7,000 persons, and was designed by Carlos A. Santos-Viola. It features octagonal spires, &quot;fine latticework&quot; and ribbed windows. Recent buildings are variations on the designs of the Central Temple. These are designed to accommodate 250 to 1,000 persons while larger churches in Metro Manila and provincial capitals can accommodate up to 3,000 persons.

INC churches outside the Philippines which were acquired from different religions undergo intensive renovations to meet the standard of INC worship services.

==Political influence in the Philippines==
The Iglesia ni Cristo is close to fundamentalist style and supports conservative politicians. It is known for its practice of bloc voting during elections. During the 2016 presidential election, INC communities in Agusan del Sur, Nueva Ecija, Rizal, Dasmariñas, and Quezon City delivered 98% to 100% of the total votes to the endorsed candidates. The church supported the candidacy of Benigno &quot;Noynoy&quot; Aquino III during the 2010 presidential elections, and also voted for Rodrigo Duterte in the 2016 presidential elections. In the 2022 elections, Iglesia ni Cristo endorsed the candidacies of Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte for president and vice president respectively.

On June 12, 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9645, declaring July 27 as &quot;Iglesia ni Cristo Day&quot;, a special national working holiday. On February 13, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte appointed INC&#x27;s executive minister, Eduardo Manalo, as special envoy for overseas Filipino concerns. Manalo was again reappointed by President Bongbong Marcos as Special Envoy for Overseas Filipino Concerns; Manalo&#x27;s tenure lasted from September 2, 2023 to September 1, 2024. On October 31, 2024, President Bongbong Marcos issued Proclamation No. 729, declaring July 27, 2025 as &quot;Iglesia ni Cristo Day,&quot; a special non-working holiday. 

The INC on December 4, 2024 has announced that it plans to hold a rally to oppose the impeachment efforts concurring with President Marcos&#x27; stance in November 2024 that efforts to remove Vice President Sara Duterte from office is unconstructive. On January 13, 2025, more than 1.5 million INC members went to the &quot;National Rally for Peace&quot; at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila; 12 other sites also staged the rally across the country.

==Controversies==

=== Loans ===
Despite the strict instructions of the previous leaders of the church namely Brothers Felix Y. Manalo and Erano G. Manalo against church-initiated loans and against pawning of church properties, the Iglesia ni Cristo in 2014 under the administration of Eduardo Manalo obtained billions of loans from two Philippine banks, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company and from Asia United Bank. According to loan documents, the loans were meant to partially fund the construction and completion of Philippine Arena, this despite the initial pronouncements of church leaders that the project was fully funded by INC members’ offerings. In order to secure the loans, the church mortgaged its properties located in Metro Manila, Cavite, Nueva Ecija and Baguio. The church also used 317 residential units of its LIG Condominium, a housing for church ministers and church workers that is based beside the church headquarters in Barangay Central, Quezon City as part of the loan collaterals.

=== Leadership controversy ===
During mid 2015, internal conflicts challenged the century-old church. Felix Nathaniel &quot;Angel&quot; Manalo, the brother of current executive minister, Eduardo V. Manalo, as well as their mother, Cristina &quot;Tenny&quot; Manalo, the widow of former executive minister Eraño G. Manalo, uploaded a video to YouTube alleging that the INC administration had threatened their lives and that there has been a mass kidnapping of ministers. The INC, however, denied the claims of kidnapping. On July 23, 2015, Eduardo expelled his two brothers, one of three sisters, and mother, for allegedly trying to create a schism in the church and take over the church&#x27;s leadership.

Former INC ministerial worker Lowell Menorca II stated that his life and that of his family were threatened by the INC administration, leading the Canadian government to grant him asylum: &quot;When the panel considers the links between the INC and the law enforcement authorities in the Philippines…[t]he panel is satisfied Menorca would be unable to avail himself of state protection, from the risks that he fears in that country.&quot; The Immigration and Refugee Board has found that the Philippines-based church &quot;is motivated by a vendetta&quot; and has &quot;both the means and the motivation to seriously harm or kill&quot; him, should he return to the Philippines.

In response to these issues, the Church Administration launched the program “&quot;Tunay&quot; &quot;Na Defenders Of The Faith” (The True Defenders Of The Faith)&quot; on March 31, 2018, on YouTube and Facebook, dismissing allegations made by the expelled.

=== Suppression of critics ===
Rovic Gloria Canono was arrested in November 2016 over a case allegedly filed under the direction of INC leaders and INC Legal Department. Canono was allegedly behind the critical Facebook page &quot;Sher Lock” and blog &quot;Silent No More&quot; which accuses corruption within the church&#x27;s ranks. Canono fled the Philippines after being charged with various cases by church members, including a libel case by the church&#x27;s top leader Eduardo V. Manalo. Canono arrived and applied for asylum in Canada in December 2016. In a hearing in February 2017, his claim was accepted by the Immigration and Refugee Board on the basis of religious persecution as mandated by the United Nations Convention on Refugees of 1951. Like Menorca, Canono is now a resident of Canada. Rotary Philippines now gives an award named after Canono, known as &quot;The Rovic Canono Human Rights Award&quot;, in honor of Canono&#x27;s work as an advocate of human rights.

====Death of Lito Fruto ====

Another figure in the 2015 church crisis was a U.S. citizen living in the Philippines. American Lito Fruto was expelled from the INC in the early part of 2015 because of his critical statements against the church leadership, which had been rocked by corruption scandals and allegations of abductions supposedly perpetrated by top INC officials. He was initially under the witness protection program by the Philippine government in April 2015, as he claimed to have received threats due to his allegations against the INC leadership. In November 2015, he filed a complaint against members of the INC&#x27;s top administrative body, the Sanggunian, accusing them of coercion, harassment, threats, and arbitrary detention. Fruto said that he had been forcibly taken at gunpoint from his Caloocan residence based on a complaint of alleged rape against him, which he said was fabricated by INC. Fruto believed that they were held by the INC against their will because of their supposed exposes against the church. He also said the judge in the rape case, who also issued Fruto a hold departure order, was a member of the INC.

Fruto was shot several times by an unidentified gunman as he was driving along Cavitex Exit in Barangay Marulas, Kawit, Cavite, around 1:30 am on May 24, 2017. Several excommunicated INC members allege that the killing may have been perpetrated by church officials, whom Fruto has publicly spoken out against.

====Abductions and murders====
A few days after Danilo Patungan was abducted, Felix Villocino disappeared as well. Villocino had long been delivering food supplies to the Manalo residence in Tandang Sora, Quezon City. Several former members of the church believed that these disappearances were a repeat of the suspected abductions, allegedly committed by the church against its own ministers in 2015 when the feud between the current INC leader Eduardo V. Manalo and his siblings Angel V. Manalo and Lottie Manalo-Hemedez became public knowledge.
Villocino was expelled after he openly supported Angel Manalo by delivering food supplies for the besieged Manalo siblings. Villocino&#x27;s bullet-riddled body was found the following day in a grassy portion of Barangay Malamig, Bustos, Bulacan.

=== &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; coverage ===
On November 11, 2018, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot;, hosted by Bob McKeown, featured INC on an episode entitled &quot;The Church of Secrets,&quot; which followed the story of a widow of a murder victim allegedly killed by INC members after a series of verbal altercations, as well as the story of excommunicated ministerial worker Lowell Menorca II, who sought refugee status in Canada. The news crew also attempted to land an interview with Eduardo V. Manalo after an event in Sacramento but were denied. During their attempt to land the interview, their vehicle&#x27;s tires were slashed, which McKeown suspected was an act of intimidation by INC. An INC member denied the allegation. In February 2019, the CBC and &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; were sued by INC for defamation, with officials calling the show &quot;slanderous&quot; and &quot;without evidence&quot;. CBC News responded by stating they stand behind the story.

==Reception from other religions ==
Karl Keating, the founder of Catholic Answers, said in 1990 that the INC engages in anti-Catholicism and anti-Protestantism in its &quot;God&#x27;s Message&quot; magazine. Keating views the church as being built on a set of anti-Catholic doctrines, and that their lessons, as well as their &quot;God&#x27;s Message&quot; magazine are dedicated more to debunking Catholic and Protestant beliefs and doctrines than to explaining their own positions.

Let Us Reason Ministries, an online apologetics research group, has challenged the Iglesia ni Cristo&#x27;s doctrines that one can only receive salvation if they are a member of the INC, and for saying that the INC has the sole authority from God to interpret and preach the Bible, while other religions do not. They also say that the Iglesia ni Cristo fallaciously misinterprets Biblical passages in order to suit their doctrines.

James White, of Alpha and Omega Ministries, challenged the theology of the Iglesia ni Cristo in a public debate. White and Jose Ventilacion of the Iglesia ni Cristo met for a debate on April 21, 2017, in Rapid City, South Dakota.

A book-length Catholic treatment of INC history and teachings is: Elesterio, Fernando, &quot;The Iglesia Ni Kristo: Its Christology and Ecclesiology&quot;, Quezon City, Philippines: Cardinal Bea Studies, Cardinal Bea Institute, Loyola School of Theology, Ateneo de Manila University, 1976.

<text>Puerto Rican cuisine consists of the cooking style and traditional dishes original to Puerto Rico. It has been primarily a fusion influenced by the ancestors of the Puerto Rican people: the indigenous Taínos, Spanish Criollos and sub-Saharan African slaves. As a territory of the United States, the culinary scene of Puerto Rico has also been moderately influenced by American cuisine.

==History==
Puerto Rican cuisine is a product of diverse cultural influences, including Taíno Arawak, Spanish Criollos, and Africans. It is characterized by a unique blend of Spanish seasonings and ingredients, which makes it similar to Spanish and other Latin American cuisines. Locally, it is known as cocina criolla.

The roots of traditional Puerto Rican cuisine can be traced back to the 15th century. In 1848, the first restaurant, &quot;La Mallorquina&quot;, was opened in Old San Juan. The island&#x27;s first cookbook, &quot;El Cocinero Puerto-Riqueño o Formulario&quot;, was published in 1859.

===Taíno influence===

&quot;See: Indigenous cuisine of the Americas&quot;

Many of the arrowroots and root vegetables used in Puerto Rican cuisine, collectively known as &quot;viandas&quot;, have their roots in the diets of the indigenous Taíno people. These include cassava (Spanish: y&quot;uca&quot;) and three kinds of tannier (Spanish: &quot;yautía)&quot; which are staples in traditional Puerto Rican dishes. Other popular root vegetables include sweet corn root (Spanish: &quot;lerén&quot;), sweet potato (Spanish: &quot;batata mameya&quot;&quot;)&quot;, celeriac (Spanish: &quot;apio criollo&quot;), white sweet potato 
(Spanish: &quot;batata&quot;) this potato has purple skin and white flesh and yambee (Spanish: yambi&quot;&quot;)&quot;, all of which are cultivated in the mountain regions of the island. 

It is hypothesized that Taínos used cooking methods that resemble what is called barbecue today. By some counts, the earliest recorded use of the term barbecue can be traced back to a journal entry made by a Spanish settler upon landing in the Caribbean. The term was used by the indigenous Taino people, who referred to the practice of slow-cooking food over a raised wooden platform as &quot;barabicu&quot;, which means &quot;sacred pit&quot; in their language. While the Tainos likely slow-roasted fish due to the region and their diet at the time, this cooking method may have given rise to what is today known as barbecue.
The Taíno ate a variety of spices, herbs, fruits and foods, including squash, allspice, avocado (fruit and leaves), chili, beans, peppers, papaya (fruit, leaves, and seeds used as a spice), guava (fruit and leaves, wood was used for fire and cooking), soursop (fruit and leaves), corn, lippia, peanuts, and culantro. Some of these foods are still part of Puerto Rican cooking today. The Taínos hunted birds, reptiles, and small mammals, such as hutia and gathered snails, eggs, honey, clams, oysters, and mussels. They also captured manatees and turtles.

===African influence===
&quot;See: African cuisine&quot;

While the contributions made by people of African descent are often overlooked in Puerto Rico, their cultural contributions to the island are significant. Several popular Puerto Rican dishes date back to African influences including mofongo, bacalaitos, funche, and pasteles. 

Africans transformed the ceramic cooking tool used by native Tainos to make casaba (yuca-based flatbread) into an iron griddle called “burén.” The tool is used for cooking coconut-based candies wrapped in banana leaf, mondongo, sancocho, coconut rice, gandinga, cazuela, and many plates they brought to the Puerto Rican culinary culture.
Important ingredients such as bananas, plantains, yams, orégano brujo, pigeon peas, and maybe even rice were introduced by Africans through the slave trade. Africans also brought spices and used the native spice annatto in food. Before then annatto was used by Tainos for body paint and a repellent against the sun.

The slave trade brought guinea fowl to the Caribbean from West Africa in the 1500s. Guinea fowl is a traditional Puerto Rican dish that can be prepared as a fricassee in lemon zest, sofrito, wine, raisins, olives, and other ingredients. Roasted and marinated traditionally in adobo, orégano brujo, sazón, citrus, and vinegar and often stiffed with mofongo or arroz junto (rice, beans, and pork).

A traditional and typically meal in the Caribbean is braised fish, meat, vegetables, and beans that derived from the African cuisine. In Puerto Rico these braised dishes called guisadas are served over rice, mofongo, or funche. In Puerto Rico guisadas are typically made with olives, capers, cumin, annatto oil, bay leaves, recaito, lippia micromera, coriander seeds with tomato sauce, potato and pig feet to thicken the sauce. Chicken can be made with bits of ham and beer while beef switches out beer and ham for wine, mushrooms and adds roasmerry, both have carrots and sweet peas. Beans like black, red or pink are cooked with additional squash and also bits of ham or salchichón (Puerto Rican salami) in water or broth. Salted cod fish guisadas is also a popular dish with no pork included cooked in white wine, cream and/or coconut milk and served with guanimes (Taino dish similar to tamal).

===Spanish influence===

&quot;See: Spanish cuisine&quot;
Chorizo is a sausage brought over from Spain that is used in a variety of Puerto Rican dishes. Arroz con pollo is frequently made with chorizo; other chorizo dishes include asopao con pollo y chorizo (rice soup with chicken and chorizo), arroz mamposteao (Puerto Rican fried rice with chorizo), chorizo potato salad, and classic breakfast chorizo with chayote and eggs.

As in Spain, bakeries function as social hubs. These local bakeries were first established by Spanish settlers. Major desserts include flan, a favorite among Hispanic families. There are many flavors of coffee, coquito, orangelo, soursop, piña colada, cassava, sweet plantain, and countless others throughout the island. Originally from Spain, Brazo gitano is a typical dessert in the south of the island but can be found in bakeries all over Puerto Rico. Brazo gitano is a simple thin sponge filled with cream cheese and another ingredient (such as guava, mango, lemon, corn, passionfruit, papaya, carrots with sweet potato and spices, pistachio, or nutella) and rolled up.
Mallorcas are a fluffy, yeasted sweet bread made with lard and topped with confectioners’ sugar, commonly found in Puerto Rican bakeries all over the island. Pastry is not native to tropical Puerto Rico; it is a tradition inherited from the Spaniards during the 405 years our island was a Spanish colony. During the four centuries of Spanish rule, ships loaded with imported wheat flour docked in Old San Juan, and lard was rendered from non-native domesticated pigs to make the rich pastries adored by the criollo population. The recipe for mallorcas was similarly imported, arriving in the 1800s with waves of immigration from the Balearic Islands. Puerto Rican mallorcas are named after the island of Mallorca in Spain, where bakers prepare a similar pastry called ensaïmada, from saïm, meaning “lard”. (The ensaïmada came to contain lard when Jewish bakers in 14th century Mallorca were persecuted and decided to modify their oil and butter-based breads to “prove” they had converted their religion.) It was Mallorcan immigrants who started the oldest and most famous mallorca bakery in Puerto Rico: La Bombonera (San Juan) Puig y Abraham, founded in 1902.

Balearic pastry traditions have adapted well to the humid and warm climate of Puerto Rico — the mallorca dough has a strong gluten network to withstand a vigorous rise in warm conditions without overproofing. Over time, the Puerto Rican mallorca has diverged from the original to suit the local palate: It is more similar in texture to brioche with a tighter, cakier crumb, whereas the Balearic version is incredibly light and fluffy with a crispy exterior from the lard. And while the Spanish make variations on the mallorca (like with candied squash filling, for example), in Puerto Rico they are eaten simply with powdered sugar and sometimes stuffed with ham and cheese.
Breadfruit was introduced to Puerto Rico by Captain William Bligh in 1793 and has since become a naturalized part of the island&#x27;s landscape. This fruit is used as a replacement for plantains as it is used the same way. It is a favorite among Puerto Ricans and frequently paired with fish and coconut or as a dessert with coconut and banana. Mofongo de pana, breadfruit flan, alcapurria de pana, tostones de pana (re-fried breadfruit), pastele de pana, pastelón de pana (breadfruit casserole), ralleno de pana (breadfruit version of papa rellena), and cazuela replacing cassava with breadfruit. Breadfruit flour is widely available throughout the island and used to make cookies, empanada dough, fry batter, bread, pancakes, and waffles.

==Regional==
===Arecibo===
Arecibo is the biggest municipality in Puerto Rico by area and is located on the northern coast. In the Río Grande de Arecibo, whitebait called &quot;cetí&quot; is caught.

==Basic ingredients==
===Seafood and shellfish===
On some coastal towns of the island, such as Luquillo, Fajardo, and Cabo Rojo, seafood is quite popular.

* &quot;Cetí&quot; – Cetí or whitebait is a tiny immature transparent fish that lives in the Río Grande de Arecibo. During the annual migration from July through December, cetí becomes abundant in the Arecibo area and is widely used in local cuisine. This tiny transparent fish is just about an inch long, and it is the most delicious when deep-fried and eaten whole.

The Arecibo region is also famous for its pasteles filled with cetí. Usually, Puerto Rican pasteles are cooked with meat, however, they taste even better with fish. The recipe includes cetí, squash, yuca, yautía, and coconut milk. Pasteles are always wrapped in banana leaf and grilled. It is one of the delicacies served during the Christmas holidays. Cetí is also used in mofongo, alcapurrias, empanadas and other Puerto Rican dishes.
* &quot;Chillo&quot; – Red snapper is a favorite among the locals.
* &quot;Codfish&quot; and &quot;Dried and salted cod&quot; – Codfish has been a part of Puerto Rican cuisine for a long time, with a history that dates back to European exploration and trade. Salted cod was a staple food for European sailors and explorers because it was a non-perishable source of protein. It was also cheap labor food for slaves during the Atlantic slave trade. Salted codfish is cheap, easily accessible, and eaten daily in Puerto Rico. While most Puerto Ricans enjoy bacalao guisado, bacalaíto, buñuelos de bacalao (cod fritters replacing potato with yuca, batata, or sweet plantain), alcapurria stuffed with cod, arroz con bacalao (one-pot rice with salted codfish), croquettes de bacalao, serenata de bacalao, bacalao con viandas, caldo santo (sancocho made with coconut milk, codfish, and shellfish), and the famous codfish ice cream from Lares Ice Cream Parlor.

===Seasoning===
Traditional cooking on the island uses more fresh and local ingredients such as citrus to make &quot;mojo&quot; and &quot;mojito isleño&quot; and especially fresh herbs, vegetables and peppers to make &quot;recaíto&quot; and &quot;sofrito&quot;.

The base of many Puerto Rican main dishes involves &quot;sofrito&quot;, similar to the &quot;mirepoix&quot; of French cooking, or the &quot;trinity&quot; of Creole cooking. A proper &quot;sofrito&quot; is a sauté of freshly ground garlic, yellow onions, culantro, cilantro, red peppers, cachucha and cubanelle peppers. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with tomato paste or sauce, oil or lard, and cured pork. A mix of stuffed olives and capers called alcaparrado are usually added with dry spices. Adobo in Puerto Rico most traditional refers to a wet rub known as &quot;adobo mojado&quot; (wet seasoning) of Caribbean oregano, salt, black pepper, garlic, shallot, vinegar, citrus juice and zest. 

&quot;Adobos&quot; come in two forms dry (&quot;adobo seco&quot;) and wet (&quot;adobo mojado&quot;). Both use the same garlic, onion, salt, black pepper, lippia (orégano), and citrus. While &quot;adobo seco&quot; uses dry ingredients and the option of citrus zest &quot;adobo mojado&quot; uses fresh ingredients mixed with olive oil, vinegar, and citrus juice. 
Both of these forms of adobo are typically rubbed on meats and fish. &quot;Adobo seco&quot; is considered more of an all purpose seasoning used for all typically Puerto Rican dishes. 

&quot;Sazón&quot; like adobo is widely used in Puerto Rican cuisine traditionally made with cumin, salt, annatto powder, coriander seeds, with the option of paprika, turmeric, crushed bay leaves or avocado leaves. 

&quot;Sorfito&quot; and &quot;recaíto&quot; are used in the same way but with minor differences, as recaito is heavier on the herb culantro known as recao on the island thus giving its name recaito. The base is a puree made with a large amount or both cilantro and culantro, green bell peppers, garlic, yellow onions or scallions, oregano brujo, cachucha and recently parsely. 

Annatto oil is made from steeping annatto seeds with oil or lard with olive oil used mostly and sometimes steeped with bay leaves. It is used for signature dishes adding a bright yellow-orange color and smoky peppery taste to pasteles, arroz con gandlues, alcapurrias, arroz junto, used to sear meats for stews and soups.

==Puerto Rican dishes==
Although Puerto Rican diets can vary greatly from day to day, there are some markedly similar patterns to daily meals. Dinners almost invariably include a meat, and rice and beans. 

Codfish and taro is also a popular dish.

===Thanksgiving dishes===

Puerto Rico is an island colonized by the United States and which is called a commonwealth. Cultural influence from the United States has spread Thanksgiving to Puerto Rico (). Puerto Rican Thanksgiving traditions are similar to those on the mainland, and include turkey, &quot;arroz con gandules&quot; or &quot;arroz con maiz&quot;, &quot;pasteles&quot; stuffed with turkey, spicy cranberry sauce, cornbread, squash 
and/or batata &quot;coquito&quot;, &quot;pastelón&quot;, potato salad, and &quot;morcilla&quot;. 

The meal often includes stuffing the turkey with bread, which can be mixed with mofongo or replaced entirely with it. The dish is called pavochon, which is a combination of the words pavo, meaning turkey, and lechón, referring to roasted suckling pig. Pavochón is essentially a turkey that is seasoned and cooked like roasted pork. 

Desserts and sweets are often the same as Christmas or any other holiday that includes, &quot;arroz con dulce&quot;, bead pudding, flan, cheese cake, &quot;tembleque&quot;, and &quot;cazuela&quot;. Pumpkin, batata, sweet potato and pumpkin spices can be incorporated into these classic desserts. 

===Christmas dishes===
Puerto Rican culture can be seen and felt all year-round, but it is on its greatest display during Christmas when people celebrate the traditional &quot;aguinaldo&quot; and &quot;parrandas&quot; – Puerto Rico&#x27;s version of carol singing. Puerto Rican food is a main part of this celebration. &quot;Pasteles&quot; for many Puerto Rican families, the quintessential holiday season dish is &quot;pasteles&quot;, a soft dough-like mass wrapped in a banana leaf and boiled, and in the center chopped meat, raisins, capers, olives, and chick peas. Puerto Rican &quot;pasteles&quot; are made from milk, broth, plantain, green bananas, and tropical roots. The wrapper in a Puerto Rican &quot;pastele&quot; is a banana leaf. Many other dishes include &quot;arroz con gandules&quot;, roasted pork, potato salad with apples and chorizo, &quot;escabeche&quot; made with green banana and chicken gizzards, &quot;hallaca&quot; are the cassava version of &quot;pasteles&quot;, among other dishes. &quot;Coquito&quot; is a spiced coconut eggnog typically served in a shot glass, recipes vary from family to family. Desserts include flan, natillas, cream cheese spiced bread pudding made with currants and either guava or sweet plantains, coconut spiced rice pudding, &quot;tembleque&quot; a coconut pudding.

===Beverages===
The history of Puerto Rican drinks includes the production of rum, pitorro the creation of the piña colada, and the evolution of the coquito. 

Coffee production in Puerto Rico was first introduced in 1736, when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony. At first, the industry thrived. By the beginning of the 1800s, civil wars in coffee producing countries had caused an increase in the price of the commodity worldwide. This paved the way for a surge in production. In combination with the arrival of new technologies and European immigrants, who both acquired and worked the land, Puerto Rico became the fourth-largest coffee producer in the Americas. The nineteenth century was a golden era of coffee for Puerto Rico. Coffee sent to the Vatican came from Puerto Rico, by the Cooperativa Cafeteros de Puerto Rico, which registered the Café Rico brand in 1924. For a long time, it was considered the best coffee in the world. It had a factory with a coffee cupping laboratory and the only one that had a certified coffee taster in the entire archipelago. Today Puerto Rico still produces small batches of grade 1 coffee and peaberry. The quality of Puerto Rican coffee resembles Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee and can be expensive. Puerto Ricans enjoy their coffee with sugar and milk. Another popular way Puerto Ricans prepare coffee is with sugar and cube of cheddar cheese dropped into the coffee. Coquito latte have become popular, and it is heavily spiced with coconut milk, condensed milk, egg yolk, and a variety of spices. 

Soft drinks have a rich history in Puerto Rico, including the creation of popular drinks and the local production of other brands. Coco Rico began marketing its drink in Puerto Rico in 1934, and patented the formula the following year. It is the first coconut soda and has gained popularity throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and some parts of Latin America. Kola Champagne was invented in Puerto Rico by Ángel Rivero Méndez. Like Coco Rico, Kola Champagne is popular throughout the Caribbean and parts of Latin America, but also Pakistan. Malta (soft drink) may have come to Puerto Rico in the mid-19th century with German businesspeople or laborers, or with German and German-American immigrants who settled in Puerto Rico after World War I. A drink made from malta in Puerto Rico is called ponche de malta. Malta is mixed with whipped egg yolk, and condensed milk. A scoop of ice cream can be added and topped with cinnamon. 

Cherry Coca-Cola, spiced rum, cherry liqueur, garnished with maraschino cherry and lime wedge called spiced cherry is a local play on the famous Cuba libre (rum and coke).

Spanish conquistadors brought horchata to the Americas during colonization, but they did not bring tiger nuts, the key ingredient in the original recipe. Instead, they used rice and other grains, and added sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and sometimes marigolds. In Puerto Rico toasted sesame seeds are used and sometimes coconut milk is added.

La Factoría is a famous bar located in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. This unconventional spot is very popular with tourists and locals alike and has been among The World&#x27;s 50 Best Bars for five years in a row. While the bar is known for creating some of the world&#x27;s best cocktails, they also frequently serve typical Puerto Rican drinks that originated on the island such as piña colada, chichaíto (anisette, rum, and coffee bean on top), bilí, and coquito.

===Kiosks===
Rustic stalls displaying many kinds fritters under heat lamps or behind a glass pane can be spotted in many places throughout Puerto Rico. Collectively known as &quot;frituras&quot;, these snacks are called &quot;cuchifritos&quot; in New York City, but to be strictly correct, &quot;cuchifritos&quot; are the mom-and-pop stores where &quot;frituras&quot; are sold. In Puerto Rico, the name &quot;quioscos&quot; (kiosk) is used to refer to the cuchifrito. Quioscos are a much-frequented, time-honored, and integral part to a day at the beach and the culinary culture of the island. Fresh octopus and conch salad are frequently seen. Much larger kiosks serve hamburgers, local/Caribbean fusion, Thai, Italian, Mexican and even Peruvian food. Most kiosks have a signature alcoholic drink.

===Puerto Rican food outside Puerto Rico===

In New York City, cuchifritos or cochifritos refers to various fried foods prepared principally of pork in Spanish and Puerto Rican cuisine. In Spain, cuchifritos are a typical dish from Segovia in Castile. The dish consists of pork meat fried in olive oil and garlic and served hot. In Puerto Rican communities in New York City they include a variety of dishes including morcilla (blood sausage), papa rellena (fried potato balls stuffed with meat), and chicharrón (fried pork skin), and other parts of the pig prepared in different ways. Some cuchifritos dishes are prepared using plantain as a primary ingredient. Cuchifritos vendors also typically serve juices and drinks such as passionfruit, pineapple, and coconut juice, as well as ajonjolí, a drink made from sesame seeds.

In Chicago, &quot;el jibarito&quot; is a popular dish. The word &quot;jíbaro&quot; in Puerto Rico means a man from the countryside, especially a small landowner or humble farmer from far up in the mountains. Typically served with Puerto Rican yellow rice, &quot;jibaritos&quot; consist of a meat along with mayonnaise, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, all sandwiched between a fried green plantain. In the early 20th century, bread made from wheat (which would have to be imported) was expensive out in the mountain towns of the Cordillera Central, and &quot;jíbaros&quot; were made from plantains which are still grown there on the steep hillsides. The version introduced to Chicago was originally made with skirt steak, but today it can be found in versions made with chicken, roast pork, ham, shrimp and even tofu. &quot;La jibarita&quot; is the sweet plantain version.

<doc id="288345" wikidata="Q261744" url="?curid=288345" title="Firebird (database server)">
<text>Firebird is an open-source SQL relational database management system that supports Linux, Microsoft Windows, macOS and other Unix platforms. The database forked from Borland&#x27;s open source edition of InterBase in 2000 but the code has been largely rewritten since Firebird 1.5.

==History==
Within a week of the InterBase 6.0 source being released by Borland on 25 July 2000, the Firebird project was created on SourceForge. Firebird 1.0 was released for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on 11 March 2002, with ports to Solaris, FreeBSD 4, HP-UX over the next two months.

Work on porting the codebase from C to C++ began in 2000. On 23 February 2004, Firebird 1.5 was released, which was the first stable release of the new codebase. Version 1.5 featured an improved query optimizer, SQL-92 conditional expressions, savepoints and support for explicit locking. Firebird 2.0 was released on 12 November 2006, adding support for 64-bit architectures, tables nested in FROM clauses, and programmable lock timeouts in blocking transactions.

The previous stable release was version 2.1.6, which added new features including procedural triggers, recursive queries, and support for MERGE statements.

Firebird 2.5 introduced new features like improved multithreading, regular expression syntax and the ability to query remote databases.

The most recent stable version is Firebird 3.0, released 19 April 2016, with focus in performance and security. A major re-architecture of the code allowed total support to SMP machines when using the SuperServer version.

Through the Google Summer of Code 2013 work has begun on integrating Firebird as a replacement for HSQLDB in LibreOffice Base.

===Mozilla Firefox name conflict===
In April 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced a rename of its web browser from &quot;Phoenix&quot; to &quot;Firebird&quot; after a trademark dispute with Phoenix Technologies.

This decision caused concern within the Firebird database project due to the assumption that users and Internet search engines would be confused by a database and a web browser both using the name Firebird. The Mozilla developers issued a statement, making clear that their software package was called &quot;Mozilla Firebird&quot;, not &quot;Firebird&quot;. The statement also said that the Mozilla Firebird name was a project codename.

The dispute was resolved on 9 February 2004, when Mozilla changed the name of its browser to Mozilla Firefox, thus ending the conflict.

==Main features==
* Full support for stored procedures and triggers
* Full ACID compliant transactions
* Referential integrity
* Multi Generational Architecture (sometimes called MVCC)
* Support for External Functions (UDFs)
* SQL activity can send asynchronous notification events to clients
* Third-party tools, including GUI administrative tools and replication tools
* Careful writes - fast recovery, no need for transaction logs
* Many access methods: native/API, dbExpress/FireDAC drivers, ODBC, OLE DB, .NET provider, JDBC native type 4 driver, Python module, PHP, Perl
* Incremental backups
* Full cursor implementation in PSQL

==Storage and index technology==

===The Multi-Generational Architecture (MGA)===
Firebird inherited the storage architecture of Interbase. To ensure the ACID properties of transactions, the database engine keeps different versions of each record changed by the active users in the database. When the transactions are committed, the last version of every changed record is marked as the definitive. If transactions are rolled back, the database engine keeps the mark on the original record versions, leaving them untouched. As a result, Firebird disk writes are very reduced compared to databases that use the traditional transaction log architecture. Writing transactions does not prevent reading and vice versa, because each one sees its own version of the database. The tradeoff is that some maintenance (&quot;sweeping&quot;) is required from time to time to clean up old record versions and free disk space.

The multi-generational architecture ensures that OLTP and DSS/OLAP operations can be run simultaneously without the delays caused by locking mechanisms found in other products.

===Indexes===
Firebird makes all indices of the database behave like well-tuned &quot;clustered indexes&quot; used by other architectures. Firebird index buckets aren&#x27;t subject to two-phase locking, and boolean &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; operations can be performed on intermediate bitmaps at a negligible cost, eliminating the need for the optimizer to choose between alternative indexes.

==Variants==
* Firebird SuperServer has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with shared cache
* Firebird SuperClassic also has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with separate caches
* Firebird Classic uses inetd to run one copy of the server per client connection, recommended for SMP systems but might have event-notification issues if access is via a firewall
* Firebird Embedded for creating CD-ROM catalogs, single user or evaluation versions of applications

==Licensing==
The Firebird database engine and its modules are released under an open-source license, the Initial Developer&#x27;s Public License (IDPL), a variant of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 1.1. It does not require the developer to open the products using Firebird or even custom-derivatives made from its source code, but if the developer chooses to do so, then some terms and conditions should be honored. The IDPL allows the developer to make proprietary, closed-source applications that use Firebird or are based on it.

==Connectivity APIs==

===Low-level Firebird Native API, Services API and embedded SQL===
The Firebird native API is used directly or indirectly by applications or middleware that connect to a Firebird database. It is implemented in the client library, fbclient.dll, on Windows systems, and in libfbclient.so on Unix ones.

The Services API is a special function set for accessing and controlling service administration tasks such as user management, backup/restore and statistics gathering.

Embedded SQL is a technique that simplifies the development of C/C++ and COBOL Firebird applications, by using a preprocessor called gpre, which allows the embedding of SQL statements directly into the source code of the host language.

<doc id="288350" wikidata="Q1249629" url="?curid=288350" title="Police Story (1973 TV series)">
<text>Police Story is an American anthology crime drama television series that aired weekly on NBC from September 25, 1973, through April 5, 1977, followed by a season of irregularly scheduled television film specials from September 27, 1977, to May 28, 1978, with three further television films screened in 1979, 1980, and 1987. The show was created by author and former police officer Joseph Wambaugh and was described by &quot;The Complete Directory of Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows&quot; as &quot;one of the more realistic police series to be seen on television&quot;. It was produced by David Gerber and Mel Swope.

==Overview==
Although it was an anthology, all episodes had certain things in common; for instance, the main character in each episode was always a police officer. The setting was always Los Angeles, and the characters always worked for some branch of the Los Angeles Police Department. Notwithstanding the anthology format, some characters were recurring. During the first three seasons, Scott Brady appeared in 16 episodes as &quot;Vinnie&quot;, a retired cop, who had opened a bar catering to police officers, and who acted as a sort of Greek chorus during the run of the series, commenting on the characters and plots. Others who appeared more than once were Tony Lo Bianco and Don Meredith, each making five appearances as Robbery-Homicide Division partners Tony Calabrese and Bert Jameson, four of these appearances being in the same episodes; Vic Morrow played surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda in the pilot, &quot;Slow Boy&quot;, and in the first-season, two-part episode, &quot;Countdown&quot;. Vice officer turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka was played by James Farentino in two episodes, and John Bennett Perry played Officer Chick Torpey five times during the first two seasons, including the pilot film. Chuck Connors and Jackie Cooper also starred in various episodes, as different characters on both sides of the law.

The anthology format allowed the series to depict a wider variety of police activities and experiences than was usual in police dramas. In addition to detectives investigating major crimes, or patrol officers patrolling high-crime beats, the show depicted newly hired cadets trying to make it through the academy, woman officers trying to fit into a male-dominated profession, traffic officers investigating accidents, officers dealing with marital difficulties or alcohol dependence, fingerprint technicians trying to develop suspects from a single print, high-ranking administrators dealing with the stresses of command in a major metropolitan police force, officers adjusting to permanent physical disabilities caused by on-duty injuries, and officers trying to juggle two different jobs to make enough money to support their families.

The anthology format also allowed the show to try out characters and settings for series development, and during its broadcast run, &quot;Police Story&quot; generated three spin-offs. A first-season episode, &quot;The Gamble&quot;, starring Angie Dickinson, became the pilot for the successful &quot;Police Woman&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1978. &quot;The Return of Joe Forrester&quot;, a second-season episode starring Lloyd Bridges, was developed into the weekly series &quot;Joe Forrester&quot;, which lasted a full season. Finally, &quot;A Chance to Live&quot;, a special episode from the fifth season starring David Cassidy, was spun off into the series &quot;Man Undercover&quot;. That series did not do as well, and lasted only 10 episodes.

In later seasons, perhaps because of the expense of maintaining the anthology format on a weekly basis, &quot;Police Story&quot; became a series of irregularly scheduled television films.

&quot;Police Story&quot; was a precursor to later shows such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981–1987), NBC&#x27;s and CBS&#x27;s &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1988–95), &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1990–2010), ABC&#x27;s &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993–2005), NBC&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1993–1999) and FX&#x27;s &quot;The Shield&quot; (2002–2008).

<text>Empire Earth is a real-time strategy video game developed by Stainless Steel Studios and released on November 13, 2001. It is the first game in the &quot;Empire Earth&quot; series.

The game requires players to collect resources to construct buildings, produce citizens, and conquer opposing civilizations. &quot;Empire Earth&quot; spans 500,000 years of human history, which is divided into 14 epochs, beginning with the prehistoric age, and ending with the nano age.

An expansion pack, &quot;Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest&quot;, was developed by Mad Doc Software and released in 2002. It added new features such as a special power for each civilization, and a new 15th epoch, entitled the Space Age, which focuses on the colonization of space planets.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Empire Earth&quot; is a history-based real-time strategy game. &quot;Empire Earth&quot; uses 3D graphics. The game itself contains many unique and innovative features, including a &quot;morale&quot; system, which directly affects individual units&#x27; statistics. It also incorporates a &quot;hero&quot; system. These can be built at the town center or capital. There are two types of heroes, Strategist heroes who heal surrounding units and can demoralize enemy units while Warrior heroes give morale to surrounding units and have greater attack power. The player has the option of creating their own civilization with unique bonuses. &quot;Empire Earth&quot; has a map editor included.

Epochs are the ages a player passes through in &quot;Empire Earth&quot;. Each of these epochs represents an age within history. In &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, the last two ages (Digital and Nano Ages) are set into the moderate future (at the time of release in 2001). In the Art of Conquest, a third future age, the Space Age, is available. It deals with space colonization. Each epoch brings new technologies and units. Epoch advancement requires additional buildings to be built and the costs of advancing increases as more epochs are attained, although the ability to gather the required resources greatly increases as well. With new epochs, some new units are available at the cost of having to abandon the ability to produce old units, though any old units still alive are kept. The epochs in Empire Earth are the Prehistoric Age, the Stone Age, the Copper Age, the Bronze Age, the Dark Age, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Imperial age, the Industrial age, the Atomic World War I age, the Atomic World War II Age, the Atomic Modern Age, the Digital Age, and the Nano Age. An extra epoch, the Space Age, is available in &quot;Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest&quot;.

Several different units are available in each epoch, each being produced in a different building. Some units such as infantry are available in every epoch and can be created at the barracks. Other units such as archers are available from the Stone Age to the Renaissance and are created at archery ranges. Horsemen are available from the Copper Age to the Industrial Age and are created at stables. Siege weapons such as catapults are produced at siege factories, they are available starting from the Bronze Age until the Dark Ages and are later substituted by the trebuchet in the Middle Ages throughout the Imperial age, finally being replaced by cannons in the Renaissance. In the Atomic Age-World War I epoch some new buildings are made available to the player, such as airports, tank factories, and naval yards where certain planes, tanks, and submarines, etc. can be produced. In the Digital age Cyber Factories and Laboratories are available and can produce many types of robots, referred to as &quot;Cybers&quot;.

Like many real-time strategy games, there are technologies available to improve a player&#x27;s civilization. Technologies to improve farming can be researched at the granary. Health-related technologies can be researched at a hospital. Technologies researched at the hospital improve the hit points, speed, and attack of a civilization&#x27;s citizens, a hospital&#x27;s healing rate and range, or the population capacity. Education upgrades are found in the university, which can protect units from being converted. Economic upgrades are found in the town center or capitol. These upgrades will increase the rate at which resources are gathered.
&quot;Empire Earth&quot; has 21 civilizations, (with two additional ones in &quot;The Art of Conquest&quot;). Civilizations are predetermined in scenarios but chosen by the player shortly after the beginning of random map games. Each civilization has several bonuses such as increased speed or decreased cost for a type of unit. Any civilization can be played in any epoch but will only be powerful in ages that use units that it has bonuses for. In scenarios, the player receives &quot;civ points&quot; for completing various tasks. The following are the available civilizations, grouped into their recommended epochs. With the exception of the futuristic Novaya Russia and Rebel Forces, all civilizations in &quot;Empire Earth&quot; are based upon history. From the Prehistoric to Dark Ages, the civilizations are Ancient Greece, Assyrian Empire, Babylon, Byzantine Rome, Carthage, and the Kingdom of Israel. From the Middle Ages to the Industrial Age Austria, England, Franks, Kingdom of Italy, the Ottoman Empire, and Spain are available. From the Atomic Age to Modern times France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, and the United States are playable, and from Digital Age to Space Age China, Novaya Russia, and Rebel Forces are playable. Japan and Korea are added in the Art of Conquest expansion and belong in the &quot;Digital Age to Space Age&quot; group.

==Campaigns==
Like many other real-time strategy games, &quot;Empire Earth&quot; has single-player campaigns. However, unlike some games, each scenario has a story to tell and the player takes part in that story. Apart from the Russian campaign, the mission &quot;Operation Sealion&quot; in the German campaign, and possibly the first four scenarios in the Greek campaign, all of the battles in the campaigns are based on true events.

===Learning campaign===
The first campaign in &quot;Empire Earth&quot; is the Learning campaign. This campaign is where players are taught how to play &quot;Empire Earth&quot;. This campaign is available in both the original game and &quot;The Art of Conquest&quot;. This campaign is not required to be played in order and is divided into two parts. The first part is about the rise of Phoenicia. The second part is about the rise of the Byzantine Empire.

===Greek campaign===
The first real campaign focuses on Ancient Greece. The opening five scenarios (of eight scenarios total) focus on the rise of Greece. The story tells of the early Helladic people from Anatoly, the Trojan War, the rise of Athens by unifying Attica, and the first years of the Peloponnesian War. There are some fictional elements as well (such as the Trojan horse being given to the Ithacans by the gods). The sixth scenario of the campaign is about the life of Alexander the Great. This part is about Alexander&#x27;s ascension to the Macedonian throne and the establishment of the League of Corinth by crushing the revolt of Thebes, Athens and Sparta. The following scenario is about the Battle of the Granicus, Battle of Issus, and the siege of Tyre. The final scenario is the Battle of Gaugamela, the capture of Babylon and the battle for the Persian Gates, a mountain pass beyond which lies Persepolis, the ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire. The campaign ends when Alexander and his army enters Persepolis and Alexander manages to escape an assassination attempt while visiting the tomb of Xerxes I of Persia.

===English campaign===
The English campaign is about the struggles between England and France for superiority in Europe. The first three scenarios (of eight total) are about William I of England, his victory against the rebellion from the barons with the help of Henry I of France in 1047, and the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The next three scenarios take place during the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France; Edward, the Black Prince and his raids in France are featured in the fourth and fifth scenarios. The sixth scenario is about Henry V of England&#x27;s story, some parts based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play. The first part is the internal unrest of Lollards while the second part sees the occupation of Harfleur and the Battle of Agincourt. The final two scenarios are led by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who meets Napoleon I of France in battles at Roliça, Talavera and Waterloo.

===German campaign===
In the German campaign, the first four scenarios—out of seven total—take place during World War I and feature the Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. The player follows Richthofen through his early days of flight and the development of his &quot;Flying Circus.&quot; The first mission involves directing Richthofen and his pilot, Count Holck, to safety after their aircraft is shot down over Poland in 1915, but in subsequent missions, Richthofen is a minor character. In the next three missions, the player protects shipments of war materials into Germany, directs German forces at the Battle of Verdun, and directs the &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; at the Battle of the Somme.

The second part, consisting of three scenarios, deals with Nazi Germany and the first years of World War II in Europe. The first scene introduces the Blitzkrieg, in which the player has to conquer Poland, Scandinavia, and France before an American-Soviet alliance makes it impossible. The next mission deals with the German U-boat and naval blockade of Great Britain and the Battle of Britain, which features the Kriegsmarine surface fleet led by the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; facing off against the British Home Fleet. In the final scenario—the never-attempted Operation Sealion—the player leads German forces in an invasion of Great Britain under the famous Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, ultimately annexing the United Kingdom to the Greater German Reich and thwarting a surprise attack by the U.S. 5th Fleet (led by the carrier &quot;USS Enterprise&quot;) in the process.

===Russian campaign===
In the Russian campaign, the player leads Novaya Russia, a reconstruction of the Russian Federation. The game begins in 2018, with the Russian political dissident Grigor Stoyanovich heading up a full-sized civil war from Volgograd, followed by a seizure of power in the Kremlin in Moscow. The second scenario is about Europe&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to free Novaya Russia&#x27;s oppressed population and Russia&#x27;s conquest of the continent. In the third scenario the now-old Grigor appoints his robotic bodyguard as his successor, crushes a coup in Moscow with help from loyalist forces, and finally succumbs to heart problems. Under Grigor II, Novaya Russia continues its conquest of the world by invading and subjugating China. China had been building a time machine, but the Russian forces destroy it, narrowly averting a time paradox. By this time, Novaya Russia has control over much of Eurasia.

In the penultimate scenario, during an attempted invasion of the United States in 2098, General Sergei Molotov finally realizes that Grigor II became mad with power, and deserts instead of following orders to wipe out the entire population of Cuba. Cooperating with U.S. agent Molly Ryan, he re-enacts the Chinese plan, building a time machine and returning to 2018 in order to set things right. They arrived just a few minutes late, as Grigor already left Voronezh. In addition, Grigor II realized their plans and took the time machine, fortifying Volgograd with a sizeable detachment of cybernetic forces. A massive battle ensued, ending in the technologically horribly outmatched Molotov and Ryan destroying Grigor II and assassinating Grigor (who proved to be unreasonable due to the knowledge of Novaya Russia&#x27;s military might).

==Development==
&quot;Empire Earth&quot; was announced by Stainless Steel Studios in May 1998. When first interviewed about the game, Rick Goodman and Stefan Arnold commented about the progress and layout of the game on December 12, 2000. They mentioned many aspects of the game, including the use of heroes, unit upgrades, the availability of civilizations, economic build-up, and polishing of the final product.

On January 18, 2001, Stainless Steel Studios added Damon &quot;Stratus&quot; Gauthier to work on the multiplayer aspect of the game. He was a veteran of several StarCraft tournaments, and was meant to balance the multiplayer of the game. &quot;Empire Earth&quot; also made appearances at E3 2000 and E3 2001 about its progress, and a beta test and movie for it were released in early August 2001.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Empire Earth&quot; sold over 1 million units globally by 2002. In the United States, it sold 390,000 copies and earned $16.7 million by August 2006. It was the country&#x27;s 41st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. In the United States, combined sales of all &quot;Empire Earth&quot; games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 870,000 units. &quot;Empire Earth&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In Spain, the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento offered it a &quot;Gold&quot; prize, for 40,000 sales in the country during its first year. In France, the game sold 110,000 units by March 2005.

===Critical reviews===

&quot;Empire Earth&quot; averaged an 82% according to GameRankings, and earned GameSpy&#x27;s 2001 &quot;PC Game of the Year&quot; award. It was rated 8.5/10 by IGN, who commented &quot;Anyone who&#x27;s familiar with &quot;Age of Empires&quot; is going to hit the ground running in &quot;Empire Earth&quot;. With a few additions and some small changes the economic model and interface is pretty much exactly like that in AoE2.&quot; GameSpot was not as impressed, giving it 7.9/10, saying &quot;&quot;Empire Earth&quot; is best reserved for hard-core real-time strategy players who won&#x27;t mind the game&#x27;s less-than-stellar graphics and sound but will instead relish the ability to relive 14 different epochs of human warfare.&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; was disappointed and gave it a 6.25/10, saying &quot;&quot;Empire Earth&quot; couldn&#x27;t walk the walk like it talked the talk. Although no one patch can fix either of the aforementioned items, the latter will certainly see some type of quick adjustment in the near future.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Empire Earth&quot; spawned an expansion pack and several sequels. The expansion pack, &quot;Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest&quot;, was released in 2002.

&quot;Empire Earth&quot; was re-released as &quot;Empire Earth: Gold Edition&quot; in May, 2003. It contains both the original game and the expansion pack, manuals, and technology trees for both games, hotkey reference and the official strategy guide.

&quot;&quot; was considered to be a &quot;spiritual sequel&quot; to &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, since it was also made by Stainless Steel Studios and released between &quot;Empire Earth&quot; and &quot;Empire Earth II&quot;. It was released in 2003.

A sequel, &quot;Empire Earth II&quot;, was released in 2005. &quot;Empire Earth II: The Art of Supremacy&quot;, the expansion pack for &quot;Empire Earth II&quot;, was released in 2006. &quot;Empire Earth II&quot; was developed by Mad Doc Software and published by Vivendi Universal Games.

A mobile version of &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, &quot;Empire Earth Mobile&quot;, was released in 2005.

Another sequel, &quot;Empire Earth III&quot; was released in 2007. It was developed by Mad Doc Software and published by Sierra Entertainment.

On Monday, November 3, 2008, at 7pm GMT, the WON online multiplayer servers for &quot;Empire Earth&quot; and &quot;Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest&quot; were permanently shut down by Vivendi.

=== Community ===
In the early 2000s the game quickly attracted a community of fans, the majority of which were on forums such as Heaven Games.

Over time the community reduced in size as the game became less popular and its technology became more outdated. Various issues such as backward compatibility of the game have also contributed to preventing new players from discovering the game over time. The community has been maintained in part by sharing custom scenarios and various creations such as textures and 3D models, but mostly by projects that have helped the game evolve over time.

=== Technical limitations ===
Empire Earth was developed using DirectX 7 for Windows 95 and 98, most modern drivers do not support this version of DirectX.

On November 3 Nov 2008, the game&#x27;s WON multiplayer servers were closed.

<doc id="288358" wikidata="Q1531713" url="?curid=288358" title="Global field">
<text>In mathematics, a global field is one of two types of fields (the other one is local fields) that are characterized using valuations. There are two kinds of global fields:

*Algebraic number field: A finite extension of formula_1
*Global function field: The function field of an irreducible algebraic curve over a finite field, equivalently, a finite extension of formula_2, the field of rational functions in one variable over the finite field with formula_3 elements.

An axiomatic characterization of these fields via valuation theory was given by Emil Artin and George Whaples in the 1940s.

==Formal definitions==

A &quot;global field&quot; is one of the following:
;An algebraic number field
An algebraic number field &quot;F&quot; is a finite (and hence algebraic) field extension of the field of rational numbers Q. Thus &quot;F&quot; is a field that contains Q and has finite dimension when considered as a vector space over Q.

;The function field of an irreducible algebraic curve over a finite field
A function field of an algebraic variety is the set of all rational functions on that variety. On an irreducible algebraic curve (i.e. a one-dimensional variety &quot;V&quot;) over a finite field, we say that a rational function on an open affine subset &quot;U&quot; is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the affine coordinate ring of &quot;U&quot;, and that a rational function on all of &quot;V&quot; consists of such local data that agree on the intersections of open affines. This technically defines the rational functions on &quot;V&quot; to be the field of fractions of the affine coordinate ring of any open affine subset, since all such subsets are dense.

==Analogies between the two classes of fields==

There are a number of formal similarities between the two kinds of fields. A field of either type has the property that all of its completions are locally compact fields (see local fields). Every field of either type can be realized as the field of fractions of a Dedekind domain in which every non-zero ideal is of finite index. In each case, one has the &quot;product formula&quot; for non-zero elements &quot;x&quot;:
:formula_4

where &quot;v&quot; varies over all valuations of the field. 

The analogy between the two kinds of fields has been a strong motivating force in algebraic number theory. The idea of an analogy between number fields and Riemann surfaces goes back to Richard Dedekind and Heinrich M. Weber in the nineteenth century. The more strict analogy expressed by the &#x27;global field&#x27; idea, in which a Riemann surface&#x27;s aspect as algebraic curve is mapped to curves defined over a finite field, was built up during the 1930s, culminating in the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields settled by André Weil in 1940. The terminology may be due to Weil, who wrote his &quot;Basic Number Theory&quot; (1967) in part to work out the parallelism.

It is usually easier to work in the function field case and then try to develop parallel techniques on the number field side. The development of Arakelov theory and its exploitation by Gerd Faltings in his proof of the Mordell conjecture is a dramatic example. The analogy was also influential in the development of Iwasawa theory and the Main Conjecture. The proof of the fundamental lemma in the Langlands program also made use of techniques that reduced the number field case to the function field case.

==Theorems==

===Hasse–Minkowski theorem===

The Hasse–Minkowski theorem is a fundamental result in number theory that states that two quadratic forms over a global field are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent &quot;locally at all places&quot;, i.e. equivalent over every completion of the field.

===Artin reciprocity law===

Artin&#x27;s reciprocity law implies a description of the abelianization of the absolute Galois group of a global field &quot;K&quot; that is based on the Hasse local–global principle. It can be described in terms of cohomology as follows:

Let &quot;L&quot;&quot;v&quot;⁄&quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot; be a Galois extension of local fields with Galois group &quot;G&quot;. The local reciprocity law describes a canonical isomorphism

: formula_5

called the local Artin symbol, the local reciprocity map or the norm residue symbol.

Let &quot;L&quot;⁄&quot;K&quot; be a Galois extension of global fields and &quot;C&quot;&quot;L&quot; stand for the idèle class group 
of &quot;L&quot;. The maps &quot;θ&quot;&quot;v&quot; for different places &quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot; can be assembled into a single global symbol map by multiplying the local components of an idèle class. One of the statements of the Artin reciprocity law is that this results in a canonical isomorphism.

<text>Red House is a small unincorporated community located in Putnam County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The community is divided into two distinct areas: Red House (Proper) which follows the Kanawha River Valley along WV 62, and Red House Hill along WV 34 which is in the hills just off the Kanawha River Valley. The Red House Post Office is still in service and was founded on September 26, 1840. Some say the town was named for a red house which stood at the town site, while others believe nearby red rock formations account for the name.

== Geography ==
Red House is located on WV 62 which generally follows the Kanawha River, between Hometown and Eleanor, and consists primarily of single family homes.

The Red House Hill area is primarily a mix of hilly farms (including cattle, horses, corn, etc.), and small land plots whose owners are commuters to the Charleston and Huntington metropolitan and surrounding areas.

The closest neighbors to Red House are Confidence, Hometown, Winfield, and Eleanor.

Due to the extremely winding mountain terrain, WV 34 is a very dangerous road for a 21-mile stretch from its junction with WV 62 to Kenna, where it intersects with County Route 21, which provides access to I-77.

Gia Carangi is a Philadelphia native who moves to New York City to become a fashion model and immediately catches the attention of the powerful agent Wilhelmina Cooper. Gia&#x27;s attitude and beauty help her rise quickly to the forefront of the modeling industry. However, her persistent loneliness, especially after the death of Wilhelmina, drives her to use mood-altering drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

She becomes entangled in a passionate affair with Linda, a make-up artist. Their love affair first starts when both pose nude for a photo shoot and make love afterward. Gia tries to get clean and begins taking methadone. However, Gia eventually starts using again and Linda gives her an ultimatum. Gia chooses the drugs.

Failed attempts at reconciliation with Linda and with her mother, Kathleen, drive Gia back to heroin.

<doc id="288361" wikidata="Q1926157" url="?curid=288361" title="Meuse–Argonne offensive">
<text>The Meuse–Argonne offensive (also known as the Meuse River–Argonne Forest offensive, the Battles of the Meuse–Argonne, and the Meuse–Argonne campaign) was a major part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front. It was fought from September 26, 1918, until the Armistice of November 11, 1918, a total of 47 days. The Meuse–Argonne offensive was the largest in United States military history, involving 1.2 million French, Siamese, and American soldiers, sailors and marines. It is also the deadliest campaign in the history of the United States Army, resulting in over 350,000 casualties, including 28,000 German lives, 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives. American losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops, the tactics used during the early phases of the operation, and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the &quot;Spanish flu.&quot;

The offensive was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in World War I. It was one of a series of Allied attacks, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which brought the war to an end. 
It was the largest and bloodiest operation of the entire war for the AEF even though, given the scale of other battles on the Western Front, its size was limited and the operation itself secondary, being far from the main offensive axis.

==Overview==

The logistical prelude to the Meuse attack was planned by American then-Colonel George C. Marshall who managed to move American units to the front after the Battle of Saint-Mihiel (Saint-Mihiel is a town on the river Meuse, the most important water obstacle on the Western Front). The Allied breakthroughs (north, center, and east) across the length of the front line in September and October 1918 – including the Battle of theArgonne Forest – are now lumped together as part of what is generally remembered as the Grand Offensive (also known as the Hundred Days Offensive) by the Allies on the Western Front. The Meuse–Argonne offensive also involved troops from France, while the rest of the Allies, including France, Britain and its dominion and imperial armies (mainly Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and Belgium contributed to major battles in more northwestern sectors of the Western Front, including the Hindenburg line.
After Operation Michael, the 1918 German offensive, began well but ended with the disaster of Reims in front of the French and at Amiens to British forces, The French and British armies systematically pushed back a German army whose efficiency was decreasing rapidly. British, French, and Belgian advances in the northwestern sectors of the front, along with the French–American advances around the Argonne Forest, are credited for leading directly to the Armistice of November 11, 1918. On September 26, the Americans began their strike north toward Sedan. The next day, British and Belgian divisions drove toward Ghent, Belgium. British and French armies attacked across northern France on September 28. The scale of the overall offensive, bolstered by the fresh and eager but largely untried and inexperienced U.S. troops, signaled renewed vigor among the Allies and sharply dimmed German hopes for victory.

The Meuse–Argonne battle was the largest frontline commitment of troops by the U.S. Army in World War I, and also its deadliest. Command was coordinated, with some U.S. troops (e.g. the Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Division and the 93rd Division) attached and serving under French command (e.g. XVII Corps during the second phase).

==Prelude==

===Opposing forces===

The American forces initially consisted of 15 divisions of the U.S. First Army commanded by General John J. Pershing until October 16 and then by Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett. The logistics were planned and directed by then Colonel George C. Marshall. The French forces next to them consisted of 31 divisions, including the Fourth Army (under Henri Gouraud) and the Fifth Army (under Henri Mathias Berthelot). The U.S. divisions of the AEF were oversized (12 battalions per division versus the French-British-German nine battalions per division), being up to twice the size of other Allies&#x27; battle-depleted divisions upon arrival, but the French and other Allied divisions had been partly replenished prior to the Grand Offensive, so both the U.S. and French contributions in troops were considerable. All of the heavy equipment (tanks, artillery, and aircraft) was provided by the Allies (mainly by the French Army). For the Meuse–Argonne front alone, this represented 2,780 artillery pieces, 380 tanks, and 840 planes.

Concerning armored support, the 35th Division was completed by the 1st Tank Brigade (under George S. Patton) with 127 American-crewed Renault FT light tank and 28 French-crewed Schneider medium tanks. The 3rd US Tank brigade with 250 French-crewed tank was also involved supporting the V Corps. The 37th and 79th Division were augmented with a French tank regiment (Renault FT light tank) and 2 groups of medium tank (St-Chamond). The 91st Division was augmented with an equivalent force (1 light tank regiment and 2 groups medium tank).

As the battle progressed, both the Americans and the French brought in reinforcements. Eventually, 22 American divisions participated in the battle at one time or another, representing two full field armies. Other French forces involved included the 2nd Colonial Corps, under Henri Claudel, which had also fought alongside the AEF at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel earlier in September 1918.

The opposing forces were wholly German. During this period of the war, German divisions procured only 50 percent or less of their initial strength. The 117th Division, which opposed the U.S. 79th Division during the offensive&#x27;s first phase, had only 3,300 men in its ranks. Morale varied among German units. For example, divisions that served on the Eastern front had high morale, while conversely divisions that had been on the Western front had poor morale. Resistance grew to approximately 200,000–450,000 German troops from the Fifth Army of Group Gallwitz commanded by General Georg von der Marwitz. The Americans estimated that they opposed parts of 44 German divisions overall, though many fewer at any one time.

=== Objectives ===

* &quot;Pierce the Hindenburg Line&quot;: The primary objective of the Allied forces, particularly the AEF under the command of General John J. Pershing, was to breach the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and advance beyond it. The Hindenburg Line was a series of heavily fortified defensive positions, including trenches, barbed wire entanglements, machine-gun nests, and artillery emplacements, designed to halt any Allied offensive.
* &quot;Advance into German Territory&quot;: By breaking through the Hindenburg Line, the Allies aimed to penetrate deep into German-held territory, disrupt enemy communication and supply lines, and weaken the German Army&#x27;s ability to resist further Allied advances. This would also put pressure on Germany&#x27;s ability to sustain the war effort, potentially hastening the end of the conflict.
* &quot;Force Germany to Surrender&quot;: The ultimate objective of the Battle of the Argonne Forest, as part of the broader Allied offensive on the Western Front, was to bring about the collapse of the German Army and compel Germany to seek an armistice and end the war. The success of the offensive was critical for achieving this goal and bringing about a decisive victory for the Allies.

==Battle==

===First phase (September 26 – October 4, 1918)===

The Allies decided to prepare for the assault on September 26 at 02:30 by launching one of the most expensive and stunning artillery barrages. This barrage was done with 2711 artillery guns and helped to destroy obstacles like barbed wire to help the Allies push up more effectively when the assault began. One of these artillery groups was led by Capt. Harry S. Truman, a future US president. &quot;During the three hours preceding H hour, the Allies expended more ammunition than both sides managed to fire throughout the four years of the American Civil War. The cost was later calculated to have been $180 million, or $1 million per minute (about $3.5 billion in 2022 dollars).&quot; The American attack began at 05:30 on September 26 with mixed results. The V and III Corps met most of their objectives, but the 79th Division failed to capture Montfaucon, the 28th &quot;Keystone&quot; Division&#x27;s attack virtually ground to a halt due to formidable German resistance, and the 91st &quot;Wild West&quot; Division was compelled to evacuate the village of Épinonville though it advanced . The inexperienced 37th &quot;Buckeye&quot; Division failed to capture Montfaucon d&#x27;Argonne.

The subsequent day, September 27 most of the 1st Army failed to make any gains. The 79th Division finally captured Montfaucon and the 35th &quot;Santa Fe&quot; Division captured the village of Baulny, Hill 218, and Charpentry, placing the division forward of adjacent units. On September 29, six extra German divisions were deployed to oppose the American attack, with the 5th Guards and 52nd Division counterattacking the 35th Division, which had run out of food and ammunition during the attack. The Germans initially made significant gains, but were barely repulsed by the 35th Division&#x27;s 110th Engineers, 128th Machine Gun Battalion, and Harry Truman&#x27;s Battery D, 129th Field Artillery. In the words of Pershing, &quot;We were no longer engaged in a maneuver for the pinching out of a salient, but were necessarily committed, generally speaking, to a direct frontal attack against strong, hostile positions fully manned by a determined enemy.&quot;

The German counterattack had shattered so much of the 35th Division—a poorly led division, most of whose key leaders had been replaced shortly before the attack, made up of National Guard units from Missouri and Kansas—that it had to be relieved early, though remnants of the division subsequently reentered the battle. Part of the adjacent French attack met temporary confusion when one of its generals died. Nevertheless, it was able to advance , penetrating deeply into the German lines, especially around Somme-Py (the Battle of Somme-Py ()) and northwest of Reims (the Battle of Saint-Thierry ()). The initial progress of the French forces was thus faster than the gained by the adjacent American units, though the French units were fighting in a more open terrain, which can be an easier terrain from which to attack.

With the US struggling to make the progress they wanted, as well as struggling to pull their logistics together, Pershing ordered a halt to the attack on October 1. This allowed Pershing to regroup all the men and reinforce the line. This move to halt the attack was not popular among the Allied Generals and almost lost Pershing his job. Despite the lack of faith in Pershing he was allowed to continue leading the offensive, and The Offensive started up again on October 4.

===Second phase (October 4–28, 1918)===
The second phase began on October 4, when the first assault divisions (the 91st, 79th, 37th and 35th) were replaced by the 32nd, 3rd and 1st Divisions. The 1st Division created a gap in the lines when it advanced against the 37th, 52nd, and 5th Guards Divisions. It was during this phase that the Lost Battalion affair occurred. The battalion was rescued by an attack by the 28th and 82nd Divisions (the 82nd attacking soon after taking up its positions in the gap between the 28th and 1st Divisions) on October 7. On October 12 Pershing had to reorganize the AEF and First Army due to the many struggles that were occurring in the second phase including disasters like the lost battalion which reflected badly on Pershing&#x27;s leadership. Pershing started by dividing the First Army into two smaller armies. The First Army would be led by Hunter Ligget, and the newly formed Second Army would be led by Robert Bullard. Pershing, now free to focus on just the AEF, cleaned out all of the AEF’s senior officers. This was done as Pershing felt the AEF leaders lacked the aggression that was needed in the offensive. The Americans launched a series of costly frontal assaults that finally broke through the main German defenses (the Krimhilde Stellung of the Hindenburg Line) between October 14–17 (the Battle of Montfaucon ()). During the Battle of Montfaucon Missouri and Kansas National Guard soldiers were the first U.S. troops who tried to break through the stronghold of the Hindenburg Line at Côte de Châtillon but they were repulsed due to poor leadership. Next, the elite U.S. 1st Infantry Division tried and failed after suffering catastrophic casualties. The Rainbow Division (42nd Division) under Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur was finally able to take Côte de Châtillon after exposing a gap in the German defenses that was discovered by MacArthur&#x27;s soldiers. This victory at Côte de Châtillon was considered the decisive turning point of the whole Meuse–Argonne offensive. By the end of October, U.S. troops had advanced ten miles and cleared the Argonne Forest. On their left the French had advanced twenty miles, reaching the Aisne River. It was during the opening of this operation, on October 8, that Corporal (later Sergeant) Alvin York made his famous capture of 132 German prisoners near Cornay. On October 23, notable injuries were sustained to Major Frank Cavanaugh as a result of enemy shellfire. From October 27 to November 1 Liggett allowed the Army to reorganize. This was due to the huge number of casualties that the First Army had taken, with over 9000 men lost and over 100,000 men injured since the start of the operation. The First Army needed time to not only train the fresh troops coming in, but also needed time for First Army engineers to build roads and light rails. Liggett wanted to ensure that he had manpower and resources, since the advantage they held over the Germans was the ability to reinforce and outnumber.

===Third phase (October 28 – November 11, 1918)===

By October 31, the Americans had advanced and had cleared the Argonne Forest. On their left the French had advanced , reaching the River Aisne. The American forces reorganized into two armies. The First, led by General Liggett, moved to the Carignan-Sedan-Mezieres Railroad. The Second Army, led by Lieutenant General Robert L. Bullard, was directed to move eastward toward Metz. The two U.S. armies faced portions of 31 German divisions during this phase. The American troops captured German defenses at Buzancy, allowing French troops to cross the River Aisne, whence they rushed forward, capturing Le Chesne (the Battle of Chesne ()). In the final days, the French forces conquered the immediate objective, Sedan and its critical railroad hub (the Advance to the Meuse ()), on November 6 and American forces captured surrounding hills. On November 11, news of the German armistice put a sudden end to the fighting.

<doc id="288362" wikidata="Q283660" url="?curid=288362" title="The Rockford Files">
<text>The Rockford Files is an American detective drama television series starring James Garner that aired on the NBC network from September 13, 1974, to January 10, 1980. Garner portrays Los Angeles private investigator Jim Rockford, with Noah Beery Jr. in the supporting role of his father, Joseph &quot;Rocky&quot; Rockford, a retired truck driver. The show was created by Roy Huggins and Stephen J. Cannell. Huggins had created the American Western TV show &quot;Maverick&quot; (1957–1962), in which Garner also starred, and he wanted to create a similar show in a modern-day detective setting. In 2002, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; was ranked number 39 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.

==Premise==

Producers Roy Huggins and Stephen J. Cannell devised the Rockford character as a departure from typical television detectives, essentially Bret Maverick as a modern detective.

In the series storyline, James Scott &quot;Jim&quot; Rockford had served time in California&#x27;s San Quentin Prison in the 1960s due to a wrongful conviction. After five years, he was pardoned (not paroled, a distinction frequently mentioned in plot points). His jobs as a private investigator barely allow him to maintain his weathered mobile home (which doubles as his office) in a parking lot on a beach in Malibu, California.

In early episodes of the first season, Rockford&#x27;s trailer is located in a parking lot alongside the highway at 22878 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, and near the ocean; for the rest of the series, the trailer is at Paradise Cove (address 29 Cove Road), adjacent to a pier and a restaurant (The Sand Castle, now known as the Paradise Cove Beach Cafe).

In the television movies from 1994 to 1999, Rockford is still living and working at the same Paradise Cove location, but in a much newer trailer that has been extensively enlarged and remodeled.

In contrast to sharp-dressed, pugnacious television private eyes of the time, Rockford wears casual, off-the-rack clothing and tries to avoid physical altercations. He can hold his own in a one-on-one fistfight, but is frequently overpowered when ambushed or outnumbered, often from behind, but he almost always winds up figuring out what is going on, catching the bad guys/gals, and usually exacting revenge by the end of the episode, with some notable exceptions. He is experienced, observant, tenacious, and quick-thinking, and has a faculty for impersonation and accents (usually Southern, drawing on Garner&#x27;s Oklahoma background).

He rarely carries his Colt Detective Special revolver, for which he has no permit and usually stores in a cookie jar, and prefers to talk his way out of trouble. He works on cold cases, missing persons investigations, and low-budget insurance scams, repeatedly stating that he does not handle &quot;open cases&quot; to avoid trouble with the police. (This self-imposed rule was relaxed in later seasons, after &quot;trouble with the police&quot; became a frequent plot device.)

Rockford has been a private investigator since 1968 (according to his Yellow Pages ad, glimpsed in a few episodes), and his oft-quoted fee, when he can collect it, is $200 per day plus expenses By the time of the 1990s reunion movies, Rockford&#x27;s fee was $450 a day, plus expenses. Rockford is very insistent on his fee, but in a running gag, circumstances often conspire to prevent Rockford from collecting the full amount he is owed after a case.

==Cast==
Listed in the opening credits:
*James Garner is Jim Rockford.
*Noah Beery Jr. as Joseph &quot;Rocky&quot; Rockford, is Jim&#x27;s father, a retired truck driver. (The role was played by actor Robert Donley in the 1974 pilot episode.)
*Joe Santos as Sergeant Dennis Becker, is Jim&#x27;s friend in the Los Angeles Police Department; he was promoted to lieutenant in season five.

Frequently recurring cast:
*Stuart Margolin as Evelyn Angelo &quot;Angel&quot; Martin, is Jim&#x27;s former prison friend. Angel is an untrustworthy, pathologically lying, con artist whose schemes constantly get Jim in trouble, yet Jim remains his friend.
*Gretchen Corbett as Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Davenport, is Jim&#x27;s lawyer and sometime girlfriend (seasons one-four).
*James Luisi as Lieutenant Douglas J. &quot;Doug&quot; Chapman (seasons three–six), is Becker&#x27;s superior officer (until Becker&#x27;s promotion). Rockford and he despise each other, although in later episodes, Chapman grudgingly acknowledges Rockford&#x27;s street smarts.
*Tom Atkins as Lieutenant Alex/Thomas Diehl, is Becker&#x27;s superior officer (seasons one-two and four), who also has an antagonistic relationship with Rockford.

Seen in multiple episodes:
*Pat Finley as Peggy Becker is Sergeant Becker&#x27;s wife (six episodes).
*Isaac Hayes is Gandolph &quot;Gandy&quot; Fitch, a brutal, violent acquaintance of Rockford&#x27;s from his prison days. He almost always calls Jim &quot;Rockfish&quot;. Jim helps prove Fitch did not commit the crime for which he was imprisoned. The two become friendly. In later episodes, Fitch tags along with an unscrupulous investigator Marcus Hayes (Louis Gossett Jr.) trying to cash in on one of Rockford&#x27;s cases, and needs Jim&#x27;s help dealing with mobsters connected to the ex-husband of his new girlfriend (played by Dionne Warwick). Jim remains on good terms with Fitch, towards whom he seems to display an almost naive blind spot despite Fitch&#x27;s refusal to ever take Jim&#x27;s &quot;no&quot; for an answer, and his lack of compunction about using violence, including occasionally on a recalcitrant Jim himself (three episodes).
*Bo Hopkins is John &quot;Coop&quot; Cooper, Jim&#x27;s disbarred attorney friend in season five (four episodes).
*Tom Selleck is Lance White, a successful and glamorous private investigator with an uncynical approach to the business. Lance is liked and admired by everyone, and Jim is a bit jealous and considers him naive, lucky, and likely to cause others to get hurt (two episodes). According to Stephen J. Cannell&#x27;s meticulous Archive of American Television interview, Lance White was based on &quot;Waco Williams&quot;, a similarly polished character in &quot;Maverick&quot; appearing in the episode &quot;The Saga of Waco Williams&quot;. Williams was portrayed in &quot;Maverick&quot; by Wayde Preston, who in 1958 resembled Tom Selleck two decades later. Tom Selleck played another private investigator, Thomas Magnum, in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; in the 1980s. 
*Dennis Dugan is Richie Brockelman, a young, idealistic, and seemingly naive private investigator who seeks Jim&#x27;s help from time to time. Bereft of Jim&#x27;s cynicism and physical toughness, Richie is nevertheless a sharp operator who used his outwardly trusting &quot;gee whiz&quot; persona to mask his dogged cleverness. This character was initially introduced in the short-lived &quot;Richie Brockelman, Private Eye&quot; (two two-part episodes). 
*Kathryn Harrold is Dr. Megan Dougherty, a blind psychiatrist who hires Jim. Their relationship eventually blossoms into a romance. Jim is upset in a later episode to learn that she has become engaged to another man (two episodes).
*Simon Oakland is Vern St. Cloud, a blustery, arrogant, and often untrustworthy fellow private investigator. St. Cloud and Rockford grudgingly accept each other&#x27;s assistance from time to time, trading insults along the way (Oakland appeared in a sixth-season episode playing an unrelated character, three episodes).
*Louis Gossett Jr. as Marcus Aurelius &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes, an impeccably dressed, chauffeur-driven, boastful P.I. who is nearly always on a hustle, usually to Rockford&#x27;s misfortune. Gossett appeared first in &quot;Foul on the First Play&quot; wearing a full wig with sideburns, appearing the following season in &quot;Just Another Polish Wedding&quot; without it (two episodes).
*Rita Moreno as Rita Capkovic, is a call girl and occasional police informant, who is targeted by a millionaire businessman because of her friendship with an elderly widow. In later episodes, she gets accused of the murder of a client; when she tries to leave her profession and hides out with Rockford, it enrages her sadistic former pimp. Whether Jim and Rita are ever romantically involved, beyond their close friendship (three episodes), is unclear.
* James Whitmore Jr. is Fred Beamer, an auto mechanic who aspires to be a private investigator, and involves himself in Jim&#x27;s affairs. In his first appearance, Beamer assumed Jim&#x27;s identity, living in his trailer, making numerous purchases on credit for detection equipment of questionable efficacy, driving (and heavily damaging) his Firebird, and taking on clients, plunging Jim into trouble. (Whitmore later directed the TV movie &quot;The Rockford Files: I Still Love L.A.&quot;) (two episodes).
*Al Stevenson is L.J., a friend of Rocky&#x27;s, who often performs odd jobs for Rocky and Jim (in one episode, Jim discovers him alone at Rocky&#x27;s house repairing a shower faucet). L.J. is closer to Jim&#x27;s age than Rocky&#x27;s, and they likely met during the latter&#x27;s career as a trucker (four episodes).
*Luis Delgado as Officer Todd Billings, is seen frequently at the precinct or at crime scenes. Delgado played a number of other bit roles in early &quot;Rockford&quot; seasons before settling into the recurring minor role of Billings starting in season three. Delgado was the brother-in-law of series co-creator Roy Huggins, and James Garner&#x27;s long-time stand-in.
*Bucklind Beery as Officer Al Mazursky, is another recurring bit-part officer very occasionally seen at the precinct during seasons two-five. Bucklind Beery is the son of Noah Beery Jr.
*Hunter von Leer (credited as Hunter Von Leer) as Skip Spence, is a libidinous, money-seeking lifeguard stationed on the beach near Jim&#x27;s trailer. Jim finds Skip distasteful, but Skip occasionally provides information helpful to him. In one episode Skip gives information to gangsters searching for Jim (two episodes).
*Jack Garner (James Garner&#x27;s real-life brother) was seen in numerous bit parts including a policeman, a gas station attendant, and a stranger in a bathroom. He then assumed the role of the fence-sitting, ineffectual Captain McEnroe (Becker&#x27;s superior officer) in season six.
*Sharon Spelman as Doris Parker, a wealthy widow who hired Rockford to investigate the suspicious death of her husband in &quot;Profit and Loss&quot; episodes one and two and as public defender Karen Hathaway in &quot;The Deuce&quot;.

===Supporting characters===
Dennis Becker: Rockford&#x27;s pursuit of cases often leads to difficulties with his friend in the LAPD, Sgt. Dennis Becker (Joe Santos), a homicide detective struggling to advance in the department under a series of overbearing lieutenants. The two most notable are Alex/Thomas Diehl (Tom Atkins) during the first, second, and fourth seasons and Doug Chapman (James Luisi) in the third to sixth seasons. Those higher-ups invariably dislike Rockford (and private investigators generally) because of their perception that either he is meddling in open cases or is trying to make the LAPD look incompetent in its handling of closed cases. Further, Rockford often calls Becker asking for favors, such as running license plates through the California Department of Motor Vehicles computer system, often annoying the already overworked cop. By the fifth season, Becker is promoted to lieutenant; the episode where Becker is promoted stated that Becker&#x27;s association with Rockford, considered by LAPD brass to be a shifty ex-con, had hampered Becker&#x27;s chances for promotion. Chapman was irritated when Becker became his &quot;equal&quot;. In season-six episode &quot;The Big Cheese&quot;, the third-to-last of the series, Rockford gets a degree of revenge when Chapman inadvertently makes incriminating statements about his tax evasion before an undercover IRS agent who is with Rockford. Becker appears in 89 of the 123 episodes.
Joseph &quot;Rocky&quot; Rockford: Rockford&#x27;s father, Joseph &quot;Rocky&quot; Rockford, is an ex-Seabee, semiretired, truck driver who nags his son to find stable (and less dangerous) employment, often urging him to follow in his footsteps as a truck driver (especially in early seasons), and often wishing Jim would get married. The relationship of father and son was an integral part of the show. Rocky appears in 101 episodes, and usually becomes involved (like it or not) in his son&#x27;s cases. Occasionally, he hires Jim himself. Jim Rockford&#x27;s mother is never shown or named, and is very seldom referred to; though never stated directly, she apparently died some years ago.

Rocky was portrayed by Noah Beery Jr. except in the 1974 pilot film, where he was portrayed by Robert Donley. Although much of the character&#x27;s backstory is the same, in the pilot, Rocky is portrayed as more of a small-time grifter and operator — at one point, working with a partner, Rocky unsuccessfully tries to run a minor scam on Jim, his own son. This element of Rocky&#x27;s character would largely be dropped as the series started. Beery&#x27;s version of Rocky was generally honest and reliable, though not above working an unreported job under the table to supplement his pension income, or eating the most expensive food in Jim&#x27;s refrigerator if he dropped by while Jim was out.

Beth Davenport: Rockford has a close relationship with his attorney, the idealistic, tenacious Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Davenport (Gretchen Corbett). In second-season episode &quot;A Portrait of Elizabeth&quot;, it is explained that Beth and Rockford had dated for a time (prior to the beginning of the series), but she soon became aware of his emotional unavailability and lack of interest in a long-term relationship, and realized that they would be better off as friends (although the two do seem to still casually date on occasion during early seasons).

Angel Martin: Rockford&#x27;s scheming former San Quentin cellmate, Evelyn &quot;Angel&quot; Martin was something of a comic relief character played by Stuart Margolin. Jim employs Angel as an operative from time to time, often to gather street-level information, or to help him access the files of the newspaper where Angel works as a low-level filing clerk. Keeping this job is a condition of Angel&#x27;s parole; even so, the ever-shifty Angel would be unlikely to be capable of doing so, except that his brother-in-law owns the paper. Jim also uses Angel on a few occasions to play a supporting role in con games that he sets up to sting especially difficult adversaries.

Angel is himself forever running some sort of (usually very bottom-of-the-barrel) con game, and is consistently ready to sell anyone out at a moment&#x27;s notice for his own benefit — and often does. In doing so, Angel almost always gets Rockford in trouble, usually by involving him in hare-brained scams ... often without Jim&#x27;s knowledge, and never with his consent. As often as not, Angel&#x27;s antics result in his, Jim&#x27;s and/or others&#x27; arrests, and/or being placed on somebody&#x27;s hit list. In spite of this, Jim considers Angel as one of his best, if most exasperating, pals. Towards the end of the series, a noticeable cooling occurs in Jim&#x27;s attitude toward Angel in their often-fractious relationship; however, the rift seems to have been repaired by the time of the reunion movies.

Others:
After Corbett was dropped from the show following the fourth season (allegedly due to contract disputes between Universal, which owned her contract, and Cherokee Productions, Garner&#x27;s company), John Cooper (Bo Hopkins), a disbarred attorney, was added as a new adviser for the frequent legal problems in which Rockford would become entangled. A new romantic interest, Dr. Megan Dougherty (Kathryn Harrold), a blind but highly independent psychiatrist, appears in two episodes in seasons five and six (&quot;Black Mirror&quot; and &quot;Love Is the Word&quot;, respectively) and the 1996 television movie &quot;The Rockford Files: Punishment and Crime&quot;.

==Credits==
===Writers===
The show&#x27;s pilot was written by Cannell, who also wrote 36 episodes and was the show&#x27;s co-creator. Juanita Bartlett, one of the show&#x27;s producers and Garner&#x27;s partner at Cherokee Productions, wrote 34 episodes. She also wrote for &quot;Scarecrow and Mrs. King&quot;, &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. David Chase wrote 16 episodes; he later went on to &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The show&#x27;s co-creator, Roy Huggins, also wrote for the show during the first season, always using pen name John Thomas James. Huggins&#x27; contributions to the show ended midway through the first season, though, after he submitted a script rewrite direct to set as the episode was shooting, without getting approval from any other writer or producer. Garner, trying to work with the material on set, felt the rewrite was unsatisfactory, and could not figure out why it had been approved for shooting. When he discovered that neither Cannell nor any of the other production staff members knew anything about the rewrite, Garner issued a directive that Cannell, not Huggins, had final say on all script material. Though Huggins was credited as a producer for the entire run of the series, this effectively ended his creative involvement with the show, as he submitted no further material to &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and did not involve himself in the day-to-day running of the series.

===Directors===

Frequent directors included William Wiard (23 episodes), Lawrence Doheny (10 episodes), and Ivan Dixon (previously a regular on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;) (nine episodes). Veteran actor James Coburn directed an episode. Coburn had co-starred with Garner in the classic movies &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964). Other actors who directed episodes include Jackie Cooper (three episodes), as well as Richard Crenna and Dana Elcar (one episode each). Co-creator Stephen J. Cannell directed several episodes; executive producer Meta Rosenberg directed six episodes; series regular Stuart Margolin helmed two; and James Garner directed one episode in the second season, &quot;The Girl in The Bay City Boys&#x27; Club&quot;. It was Garner&#x27;s only directing credit in his entire 50-plus-year film career; in his autobiography, &quot;The Garner Files&quot;, Garner states he only took on the assignment because the scheduled director was unexpectedly unavailable at the last minute.

==Vehicles==
===Pontiac Firebird Esprit===
Familiar to viewers was Jim Rockford&#x27;s gold Pontiac Firebird Esprit car. One oft-recurring element of the show was the famous &quot;Jim Rockford turn-around&quot; (also known as a J-turn or a &quot;moonshiner&#x27;s turn&quot; - commonly employed as an evasive driving technique taught to Secret Service). Garner explained the move in his 2011 autobiography &quot;The Garner Files&quot;: &quot;When you are going straight in reverse about 35 miles an hour, you come off the gas pedal, go hard left, and pull on the emergency brake. That locks the wheels and throws the front end around. Then you release everything, hit the gas, and off you go in the opposite direction.&quot; Garner stated in a season-one DVD interview that he performed this stunt for the duration of the series. The car&#x27;s license plate was 853 OKG, although the plate in some early episodes displayed the number 835 OKG. Garner writes in his autobiography that he believes that the letters OKG stood for &quot;Oklahoma Garner&quot; but that he does not know the origin of the number 853.

Starting with the 1974 model year, Rockford would get a new model-year Pontiac Firebird each year throughout the series. The Firebirds used had an identical &quot;copper mist&quot; color with the Esprit&#x27;s exterior and interior. Although the Firebirds were badged as Esprits, they were actually the higher-performance &quot;Formula&quot; model without the twin scoop hood. Garner needed Rockford&#x27;s car to look like the lower-tiered Esprit model, a car Rockford could afford, but have the performance necessary for the chase sequences in the show. To achieve this, the show featured Pontiac Firebird Formulas rebadged and rehooded to look like the Esprit model. The Formula model was developed to provide the performance of the top-level Trans Am in a less ostentatious form. Formulas did not have the shaker hood scoop, side vents, graphics, or lettering used on the Trans Am, but they had the same higher-horsepower engines and drive trains, larger front and rear antisway bars, stiffer springs and shocks, and a twin-scoop hood. (Sharp-eyed car connoisseurs can spot the twin exhausts and rear antisway bar on the cars used on the show, options that were not part of the Esprit package, as well as spot the different model-year cars used in various chase scenes that differed from those in an actual episode, especially in later seasons.) Although the series ran until early 1980, no Firebird was used past the 1978 model year as Garner reportedly was displeased with the restyled front end of the 1979 and later Firebird models, and as such, did not wish them featured on the show (although an answering machine message in one episode in the final season indicated his car was a 1979 Firebird).

In the first TV movie, &quot;I Still Love L.A.&quot; in 1994, the Firebird is shown, in ramshackle disrepair, parked next to Rockford&#x27;s trailer. He mentions he plans to have it &quot;fixed up&quot;, but drives other cars throughout the films.

===GMC Sierra Classic pickup===
Joseph &quot;Rocky&quot; Rockford drove a GMC Sierra Classic pickup truck throughout the series. In the course of the storylines, Jim often borrowed Rocky&#x27;s truck when his own Firebird was being repaired from its frequent major damage sustained during cases, or was too &quot;hot&quot; (i.e., the LAPD, which knew Jim well, was seeking to bring him in).

Rocky&#x27;s truck had a 400-cubic-inch engine, Turbo 400 automatic transmission, and a four-wheel drive factory setup. The custom exterior paint was silver with maroon panels and orange pinstriping. Additionally, the truck sported various after-market accessories added by noted California customizer and off-road racer Vic Hickey, including the winch, brush guard, hubcap covers, sidestep bed plates, auxiliary gas tanks, custom steering wheel, rear roll bar, Cibié headlamps mounted on the front bumper/rear roll bar, and Pace CB radio. In several season-five and -six episodes, Rocky drives a candy-apple red 1980 GMC C-10 short box pickup when his original vehicle is said to be in the shop for repair of damage from one of Jim&#x27;s earlier adventures.

=== Other cars ===
Beth Davenport drove a yellow 1973 Porsche 914 in season one, before switching to an orange 1975 model in season two (though in episode 202, &quot;The Farnsworth Stratagem&quot;, she drove a 1972 Audi 100 C1) and using it through the first half of Season 3, last appearance in episode 311, &quot;The Trouble With Warren&quot;. In season three, she switched to a Mercedes-Benz 450SL. Police cars used during the series were usually the 1972-1973 AMC Matador, in real-life use by the LAPD during the 1970s. From the third season, the 1974 second-series, &quot;coffin nose&quot; Matador was also used, which was also the last AMC model used by California law enforcement agencies.

==Theme tune==
The show&#x27;s theme tune, titled &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, was written by noted theme music composers Mike Post and Pete Carpenter. It appears at the opening and ending of each episode with different arrangements. Throughout the show&#x27;s tenure, the theme tune went through numerous evolutions with later versions containing a distinct electric guitar-based bridge section played by session guitarist Dan Ferguson. The theme for #1.7 &quot;This Case Is Closed II&quot;, also has the guitar section from later seasons, added when the episode was split into two parts for syndication.

The theme tune was released as a single and spent two weeks at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, in August 1975. The B-side track (or &quot;flip-side&quot;), titled &quot;Dixie Lullabye&quot;, was also composed by Post and Carpenter. The single remained on the chart for 16 weeks and won a 1975 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement. In Canada, the tune reached number eight, and was number 84 in the year-end chart.

For more than 40 years, the British football team Tranmere Rovers have used the Rockford theme as walk-out music for most games. Occasionally, it has been dropped, and then restored by popular demand.

==Answering-machine introductions==
Each episode began with the image of Rockford&#x27;s answering machine, and the opening title sequence was accompanied by a message on a Dictaphone remote Ansafone 660. As the camera focuses on the telephone, whose number is 555-2368, it rings twice, and then Rockford&#x27;s recorded voice is heard providing the following greeting:

The messages were usually unrelated to the current episode, but were often related to previous events in earlier episodes. They were a humorous device that invited the viewer to return to the quirky, down-on-his-luck world of Jim Rockford. The messages usually had to do with creditors or deadbeat clients, or were just oddball vignettes. Though a distinctive and clever entry device, the messages became difficult for the writers to create. Suggestions from staff and crew were welcome and often used.

In total, 122 different messages were created through the run of the original six seasons. The eight CBS TV movies (also referred to as season eight) feature a unique message, but episodes syndicated as &quot;James Rockford, Private Investigator&quot; use the same message; it was taken from the season-five episode &quot;A Three-Day Affair with a Thirty-Day Escrow&quot;.

Each message is a standalone gag that often provides a small amount of biographical detail about Rockford, the people he knows, and the activities that occur in his life as a private investigator. Only extremely rarely (such as in season two, episode 9, &quot;Chicken Little is a Little Chicken&quot;, during which Rockford house- and cat-sits for an absent Beth) is the content of the answering machine message in any way connected to the plot or situations of the episode itself.

==End==
The show went into hiatus late in 1979 when Garner was told by his doctors to recuperate from numerous knee injuries and back trouble, as well as an ulcer. He sustained the former conditions largely because of the daily grind of an extremely physically demanding show, performing most of his own stunts for realism, especially those involving fist fights or car chases. Because of the toll on his body, Garner was ordered by his doctor to immediately take time off some months later, and NBC abruptly cancelled the program in midseason. Allegedly, &quot;Rockford&quot; had become very expensive to produce, mainly due to the location filming and use of high-end actors as guest stars. According to sources, NBC and Universal claimed the show was generating a deficit of several million dollars, a staggering amount for a nighttime show at the time, although Garner and his production team Cherokee Productions claimed the show turned a profit. Garner told a story to Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that the studio once paid a carpenter $700 to build a shipping crate for a shoot-out on a boat dock, though shipping crates were already on the dock. The script often called for Garner to damage his car, so the car could be sold, repaired, and repurchased for each episode.

===Aftermath===
Later in the 1980s, Garner became engaged in a legal dispute with Universal that lasted more than a decade, regarding the profits from &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. The dispute caused significant ill will between Garner and the studio. The dispute was settled out of court in Garner&#x27;s favor, but the conflict meant that the Rockford character would not re-emerge until 1994. Universal began syndicating the show in 1979 and aggressively marketed it to local stations well into the early and mid-1980s. This accounts for its near ubiquity on afternoon and late-night schedules in those days. From those showings, &quot;Rockford&quot; developed a following with younger viewers, with the momentum continuing throughout the 1990s and 2000s on cable. (The Ben Folds Five song &quot;Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;, in which &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; is mentioned, is one example of the show&#x27;s newfound youth following; furthermore, the &quot;Rockford Files&quot; theme tune is played at the end of the band&#x27;s concerts.)

By 1989, the show had grossed from network and syndicated runs.

In 2006, the show was broadcast for a few months on the national Chicago Superstation WGN. In 2007, the Retro Television Network began broadcasting the program nationwide, as did the digital cable channel Sleuth and Chicago TV station WWME-CA. ION Television has rights to the show and it is slated for future broadcast. In the fall of 2009, the show reappeared in Canada on Deja View.

In the UK, the series was first broadcast on BBC1 on Tuesday, 18 March 1975 at 20:10, with the original run concluding on 7 September 1980. A rerun began on BBC1 on 8 September 1981, again starting on Tuesdays at 19:40. It lasted until 30 May 1984, in September 1984 it switched to BBC2. Since then, it has been repeatedly rerun on BBC1 and BBC2, and also ITV and also on Granada +Plus, which later became ITV3, although none of these channels repeated the later seasons.

In West Germany, the series first aired on 11 March 1976 on ARD, concluding on 9 September 1980. Some episodes were omitted, due to concerns over politics and violence. The episodes did not air in order, with season one and some of season two&#x27;s episodes airing from 11 March 1976 to 17 February 1977 on alternating Thursdays at 21:00, seasons two to five episodes from 9 May 1978 to 11 September 1979 on alternating Tuesdays at 21:45, and season six episodes from 27 May to 9 September 1980, again on alternating Tuesdays at 21:45. It was then rerun on Das Erste (ARD) from 25 June 1989 to 24 July 1991 on Sunday nights. On 21 March 1995, it began airing on RTL. The TV movies, with the exception of &quot;Friends and Foul Play&quot; aired between 2 February 1996 and 3 August 2000.

In Italy, the show began airing on Italia 1 on 19 April 1982, and aired until 1987.

In Australia, the series runs Monday - Friday on cable and satellite channel Fox Classics and on 7Mate. The series aired in the United States on the MeTV digital subchannel network until September 2, 2016. The series was available on Netflix until January 1, 2017, with the first three seasons then available on Hulu. From 2016 to 2020, the series was available on IMDb TV. In late 2020, it began streaming on Peacock. In 2022, it began streaming on Tubi. The series previously aired on Cozi TV. As of January 3, 2022, the series is airing on Get as part of its nightly lineup.

==Episodes==

The series pilot aired on NBC March 27, 1974, as a 90-minute made-for-television movie. In the pilot, Lindsay Wagner also starred and later made a return appearance. The pilot was titled &quot;Backlash of the Hunter&quot; for syndication.

==TV movies==
After several long-running contractual disputes between Garner and Universal were resolved, eight &quot;Rockford Files&quot; reunion TV movies were made from 1994 to 1999, airing on the CBS network (whereas the original series aired on NBC) and reuniting most of the cast from the original show. Beery died on November 1, 1994, so the first of these films, which aired later that month, stated, &quot;This picture is dedicated to the memory of Noah Beery, Jr. We love you and miss you, Pidge.&quot; (&quot;Pidge&quot; was Beery&#x27;s nickname.)

The movies picked up nearly 15 years later from where the show ended. In the initial movies, Rocky is referenced as alive, but is off-screen; he dies (within the series continuity) sometime before the third movie.

Garner, Santos, and Margolin appear in every movie. Other &quot;Rockford&quot; regulars who appear in multiple movies include Luisi, Atkins, Corbett, and Jack Garner (as Capt. McEnroe). Recurring players from the series who are brought back for a single return appearance include Rita Moreno (as Rita Kapkovic), Kathryn Harrold (as Megan Daugherty), and Pat Finley (as Peggy Becker).

Also added to the cast (i.e., appearing only in the movies and in small, recurring roles) were Gerry Gibson as &quot;Critch&quot; Critchland, the owner of The Sand Castle restaurant across from Jim&#x27;s trailer; and Shirley Anthony as Sally, a friendly, cheerful grandmotherly type who frequented the precinct to (falsely) confess to crimes, and to knit sweaters while she waited. Anthony had previously been a frequent extra and occasional bit part player on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; from 1976 to 1979.

===Spinoffs===
*The series &quot;Richie Brockelman, Private Eye&quot; was a spin-off of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. The character of Richie Brockelman, played by Dennis Dugan, was originally created for a 1976 TV movie intended as a series pilot produced by Cannell, but NBC did not pick up the series nor air the pilot movie. However, Cannell introduced the Brockelman character in the 1978 &quot;Rockford Files&quot; episode &quot;The House on Willis Avenue&quot;, which was broadcast the week before &quot;Richie Brockelman, Private Eye&quot; began its five-week trial run in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; time slot. The series was not renewed behind that limited run, but the Brockelman character returned in the 1979 &quot;Rockford Files&quot; episode &quot;Never Send a Boy King To Do a Man&#x27;s Job&quot;.
*Universal made a backdoor pilot featuring the characters Gandolph &quot;Gandy&quot; Fitch and Marcus &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes (played by Isaac Hayes and Louis Gossett Jr., respectively) in the episode titled &quot;Just Another Polish Wedding&quot;. The intention was to spin this out into a series called &quot;Gabby &amp; Gandy&quot;, but the series never came to fruition.
*A second backdoor pilot was made for a series that would have featured Greg Antonacci and Gene Davis as Eugene Conigliaro and Mickey Long, two humorously incompetent characters who were introduced in the episode &quot;The Jersey Bounce&quot;. The series pilot involved them trying to ingratiate their way into the New Jersey mob and aired as &quot;Just a Coupla Guys&quot;, the next-to-last episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. David Chase, who wrote both episodes, later created &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, which centered on the New Jersey mob. Greg Antonacci, who had played Conigliaro, played a role as an underboss of a rival family to the Sopranos.

==Production== 
The show was created by Roy Huggins and Stephen J. Cannell. Huggins had created, written for, and produced Garner&#x27;s breakthrough series &quot;Maverick&quot; in 1957 and envisioned &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; as presenting a similar character as a modern private investigator rather than a gambler in the American Old West. Huggins teamed with Cannell, who had written for Jack Webb&#x27;s Mark VII Productions such as &quot;Adam-12&quot; and &quot;Chase&quot; (1973–1974, NBC), to create &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;. The show was credited as &quot;A Public Arts/Roy Huggins Production&quot; along with Cherokee Productions in association with Universal Television] Cherokee was owned by Garner, with partners Meta Rosenberg and Juanita Bartlett, who doubled as story editor during most of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; run.

==Remakes==
In 2009, NBC, Universal Media Studios and Steve Carell&#x27;s Carousel Television produced a revival of the show. David Shore, creator of &quot;House&quot;, was hired to head the series. In February 2010, it was announced that Dermot Mulroney was cast as Jim Rockford, Alan Tudyk cast as Det. Dennis Becker, Melissa Sagemiller was cast as Beth Davenport, and Beau Bridges was cast as Rocky. A pilot, directed by Michael W. Watkins, was filmed but never broadcast. Early audiences indicated that the pilot was not directed well. On May 13, 2010, the &quot;Rockford Files&quot; remake was scrapped by NBC.

A feature adaptation was in production by Universal Pictures as of 2012, with Vince Vaughn associated with the project as producer and star. After the death of actor James Garner in 2014, the film adaptation was postponed, but Vaughn in 2012 was hoping to get the film project made.

<text>The Polish cavalry () can trace its origins back to the days of medieval cavalry knights. Poland is mostly a country of flatlands and fields and mounted forces operate well in this environment. The knights and heavy cavalry gradually evolved into many different types of specialised mounted military formations, some of which heavily influenced western warfare and military science. This article details the evolution of Polish cavalry tactics, traditions and arms from the times of mounted knights and heavy winged hussars, through the times of light uhlans to mounted infantry equipped with ranged and mêlée weapons.

==Early medieval times==

The first Polish cavalry was created by the Duke of Polans - Mieszko I, who united the West Slav tribes in the area of modern Poland. It&#x27;s noted in the manuscript of Abraham ben Jacob who traveled in 961–62 in Central Europe. He wrote that the drużyna of Mieszko I had 3000 men, who were paid by the duke. The Prince&#x27;s druzhina also received a share of military loot.

==Battle of Grunwald==
Until the 14th century, the Polish armed forces were composed mostly of mounted soldiers. By the start of the 15th century, the core of the Polish armies was formed by mounted knights called to arms by the kings. The basic tactical unit of the army was a banner (&quot;chorągiew&quot;), that is, a group of approximately 50 men financed by a noble clan, a notable person or a land owner. The banner fought separately and included all the necessary detachments, including its own kitchen, tabors and servants.

One of the finest examples of usage of the early Polish cavalry was the Battle of Grunwald of 1410. During the battle, the Polish armoured cavalry was used to break through the Teutonic lines. In addition, the Polish forces were helped by Lithuanian light cavalry of Eastern origins and by Tartar skirmishers, who used mostly hit-and-run tactics. During the battle, after initial clashes of the light cavalry, the Teutonic Order split its forces, which were then defeated by an armoured cavalry charge.

==16th and 17th centuries==
In the 16th century the introduction of gunpowder and firearms made the medieval armoured cavalry obsolete. The standing army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was gradually converted to other, more modern forms of cavalry. Under eastern influence, the armament of the cavalrymen was lightened and their speed and mobility increased, which added to the successes of the Polish cavalry in numerous wars against the Tsardom of Russia, Ottomans and the Tartars.

1503 saw the formation of a first hussar unit in Poland. Being far more manoeuvrable than the heavily armoured lancers previously employed, the hussars proved vital to the Polish victories at Orsza (1514) and Obertyn (1531). By the reign of King Stefan Batory, the hussars had replaced medieval-style lancers in the Polish army, and they now formed the bulk of the Polish cavalry.

Over the course of the 16th century hussars had become heavier in character: they had abandoned wooden shields and adopted plate metal body armour. With the Battle of Lubieszów in 1577 the &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of the &quot;husaria&quot; began. Until the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Polish hussars fought countless actions against a variety of enemies, and rarely lost a battle. In the battles of Byczyna (1588), Kokenhausen (1601), Kluszyn (1610), Gniew (1626), Chocim (1673) and Lwów (1675), the Polish hussars proved to be the decisive factor often against overwhelming odds. One of the most notable examples of such victories of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy hussars was the Battle of Kircholm of 1605, in which 3,000 hussars under Jan Karol Chodkiewicz managed to defeat 11,000 soldiers of Charles IX of Sweden - with negligible losses.

As one of the very few units in the Polish national standing army (most of other units were formed as &quot;mobilizers&quot;), the hussars were well-trained and well-equipped. Until the 18th century they were considered the elite of the Polish national armed forces. Because of the extreme cost, lackluster pay, fame and prestige that surrounded the hussars, almost all of them were members of the upper level nobility (szlachta). Although by the 18th century their importance was diminished by the collapse of the Polish military system and not by the introduction of modern infantry firearms and quick-firing artillery, the Polish hussars&#x27; tactics and armament remained almost unchanged until they were absorbed into the National Cavalry regiments in the 1770s.

At first hussars performed most services but as they grew heavier the need arose for a medium or lighter cavalry. The 16th century saw creation of lighter cavalry known as &#x27;Kozacy&#x27; (singular &#x27;Kozak&#x27; hence &#x27;towarzysz kozacki&#x27;) until 1648 and then known as &#x27;Pancerni&#x27; from the 1650s on until the 1770s, &#x27;Kozacy Pancerni&#x27; can be translated as &#x27;Armoured cossacks&#x27;) in the Kingdom of Poland or &#x27;Petyhorcy&#x27; in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the actual subject of the illustration) - whose offensive armament included a shorter &#x27;demi-lance&#x27; (&#x27;dzida&#x27;) or &#x27;rohatyna&#x27;, bow and arrows, war-ax, sabre in the 16th century and a pistol or two, a carbine in the 17th and 18th centuries. The lighter yet cavalry was created during the Muscovite Wars of the early 17th century, the most famous unit or type was known as Lisowczyk, after their commander Aleksander Lisowski, that fought in the 30 Years War as well. Along with these mentioned Polish or Lithuanian horsemen there were banners/companies of lighter cavalry drawn from Lithuanian Tatars (serving in their own banners under their precarious legal status), Romanian (&quot;Wallachian&quot;), Cheremis, Circassians (similar to Kozak/Pancerni) and Hungarians.

The early 18th century saw the creation of yet another cavalry formation that influenced most European armies of the time: the uhlans. Initially light cavalry companies formed by Polish Tatars (the very word &quot;ulan&quot; came from Lithuanian Tartar surname that might have come from an honorific name for a young, skilled warrior known as &quot;oglan&quot;) for one of the magantes, Sapieha, the uhlans joined the forces of Augustus der Starke, the king of Poland-Lithuania-Saxony, and in early 1740s 18th century the first uhlan &#x27;pulks&#x27; (regiments) - known as uhlans - were formed for his son, king Augustus III. The uhlans were light cavalry armed with lances, sabres and pistols, which gave them enough power and at the same time adding to their versatility and manoeuvrability. In addition, the Polish uhlans, or &quot;ułani&quot; as they were called in their native tongue, introduced a new uniform style composed of a colourful jacket with a coloured panel in the front, dark trousers with colourful stripes on the sides and a high, pointed cap called czapka (often rendered &quot;chapska&quot; in English).

==19th century: the Napoleonic and Partition Eras==
With the advent of the 19th century Poland was partitioned by her neighbours. However, the Polish army was not disbanded and instead most of it was simply drafted into the armies of the occupying countries. Thanks to that, the Polish cavalry traditions were retained. After the creation of Duchy of Warsaw, many Poles volunteered for the Polish cavalry units fighting in the Napoleonic Wars alongside the French army.

The new formation of uhlans proved to be not only fast and effective, but also very influential: during the Napoleonic Wars the uhlans of the Duchy of Warsaw were among the most effective cavalry units and by the end of that period most of European states copied both their tactics and their uniforms. Together with the French, the Polish cavalry took part in many of the most notable battles of the Napoleonic period, including the battles of Smolensk, Fuengirola, Raszyn, and many others. Also, the Polish cavalrymen were the first unit of the Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée to enter Moscow Kremlin during the Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. Finally, the Polish cavalry detachments were also present in Haiti, where they helped the French administration to quell a slave revolt. However, perhaps the most notable success of the Polish cavalry in that period (and certainly the best known) is the Battle of Somosierra, a part of the Peninsular War.


During his advance on Madrid, Napoleon was blocked on 30 November 1808 by 9,000 Spaniards under General San Juan in the valley of Somosierra in the Sierra de Guadarrama. Because of the rough and uneven terrain, the Spanish forces could not easily be outflanked. Their positions were well-fortified and guarded with artillery. Impatient to proceed towards Madrid, Napoleon ordered his Polish light cavalry escort of some 87 troops, led by Jan Kozietulski, to charge the Spaniards. Despite losing two thirds of their numbers, the Poles succeeded in forcing the defenders to abandon their position.

Cavalry units were employed by the Poles in both November uprising and in later January uprising. During the January uprising, each insurgent unit posessed a cavalry force meant for scouting and screening. The cavalry followed a mixture of Polish and French traditions. The araments were composed of pistols, lances and sabres; rear ranks of the soldiers also carried carabines.

==20th century==

===The Polish-Soviet War===
In November 1918 Poland was re-established following World War I, there were already several Polish cavalry units existing. Some of them were created as parts of either Austro-Hungarian or German Armies while others were created in Russia and as part of the French-based Blue Army. Because of that, each cavalry unit in the reborn Polish Army used different uniforms, different equipment and different strategy. However, all of the units shared the same traditions and, despite all the differences, were able to cooperate on the battlefield.

In late January 1919, the reorganisation of the Polish Army began. All previously-existent cavalry squadrons were pressed into 14 newly formed cavalry regiments, which in turn were joined into six cavalry brigades after 7 March 1919. Later a seventh brigade was added and some of the brigades were joined into two semi-independent cavalry divisions.

The newly recreated Polish Cavalry units were of modern type and were trained in both cavalry tactics and in trench warfare. After the Polish-Soviet War broke out, these were one of the very few combat-ready troops in Polish service. The lack of advanced military equipment on both sides of the front made the cavalry a decisive weapon in breaking the enemy lines and encircling the Russian units. In addition, smaller cavalry detachments (usually squadron-sized) were attached to every infantry brigade and served as reconnaissance and support units. Also, the lack of sophisticated equipment made the traditional role of the cavalry once again important. The Polish cavalry units were equipped with sabres, lances and all types of armament that were typically used by the cavalry in previous centuries.

During the war, the Polish cavalry brigades and divisions took part in most of the notable battles, including the pivotal Battle of Warsaw, in which they played a crucial role in surrounding the withdrawing Red Army, and in the Battle of the Niemen, in which the cavalry was vital in breaking the enemy lines near Grodno. However, the most important cavalry battle took place on 31 August 1920 near the village of Komarowo near Zamość. The battle was a complete disaster for the Soviet 1st Cavalry Army which sustained heavy casualties and barely avoided being totally surrounded. After that battle, the 1st Cavalry Army&#x27;s morale had collapsed and the army, which was one of the most feared of the Soviet troops, was no longer considered an effective fighting force. Because of the numbers of forces involved, the Battle of Komarów is considered the greatest cavalry battle of the 20th century. Along with the battles then taking place in south Russia, this was one of the last battles fought mostly by cavalry units, in which traditional cavalry tactics were used and sabers and lances played a vital role. Because of that, it is sometimes referred to (by Poles) as &quot;the greatest cavalry battle after 1813&quot; and the last cavalry battle.

===World War II===


During the German invasion of Poland in 1939, cavalry formed 10% of the Polish Army. Cavalry units were organised in 11 cavalry brigades, each composed of 3 to 4 cavalry regiments with organic artillery, armoured unit and infantry battalion. Two additional brigades had recently been converted to motorized and armoured units, but they retained their cavalry traditions. In addition, every infantry division had an organic cavalry detachment used for reconnaissance.

In contrast with its traditional role in armed conflicts of the past (even in the Polish-Soviet War), the cavalry was no longer seen as a unit capable of breaking through enemy lines. Instead, it was used as a mobile reserve of the Polish armies and was using mostly infantry tactics: the soldiers dismounted before the battle and fought as a standard infantry. Despite media reports of the time, particularly in respect of the Battle of Krojanty, no cavalry charges were made by the Polish Cavalry against German tanks. The Polish cavalry, however, was successful against the German tanks in the Battle of Mokra.
The Polish cavalry did not discard the lance as a weapon until 1934 or 1937 and continued to use it for training purposes up to the outbreak of World War II.

Although the cavalrymen retained their Szabla wz. 1934 sabres, after 1934 or 1937 the lance ceased to be issued as a combat weapon and was retained for training purposes only. Instead, the cavalry units were equipped with modern armament, including 75 mm guns, tankettes, 37mm AT guns, 40mm AA guns, anti-tank rifles and other pieces of modern weaponry.

During the campaign, the brigades were distributed among the Polish armies and served as mobile reserves. In this role, the Polish cavalry proved itself a successful measure in filling the gaps in the front and covering the withdrawal of friendly units. Polish cavalry units took part in most of the battles of 1939 and on several occasions proved to be the elite of the Polish Army.

After the September Campaign, the Polish Army on the Western Front continued its pre-war tradition of Uhlan regiments giving their names to armoured units, while Polish units on the Eastern Front used cavalry as mobile infantry until the end of the war.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, several Polish units, including cavalry forces, were formed by the Soviets. One of these units carried out the last Polish cavalry charge at the Battle of Schoenfeld, where a surprise cavalry assault succeeded in overrunning the German defensive positions.

===After World War II===
Combat cavalry units existed in the Polish Army until 27 January 1947, when the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division was disbanded. The last Polish cavalry unit, the &quot;Representative Squadron of the President of Poland&quot;, was disbanded in July 1948. However, after several years of gathering funds, a group of enthusiasts formed in 2000 the &quot;Representative Squadron of Cavalry of the Polish Army&quot;. The unit is under the auspices of the army, which thus returned to its cavalry tradition. The squadron is present at most official anniversary celebrations in Warsaw, as well as other towns of Poland. In other places people are forming reenactment groups that continues, often with help of army, the traditions of local cavalry units. An example of such a society is the Volunteer Representative Squadron of City of Poznań which is a tribute to the 15th Poznań Uhlans Regiment. These remained until the Eastern Bloc collapsed, as the Soviet Union collapsed too. Afterwards, The Polish military was freely able to expand, or follow whatever perimeters it wanted.

The combat traditions of Polish cavalry are continued by the armoured (&quot;Kawaleria Pancerna&quot;) and aeromobile (&quot;Kawaleria Powietrzna&quot;) units of Polish Land Forces.
==Cavalry charges and propaganda==
Apart from countless battles and skirmishes in which the Polish cavalry units fought dismounted, there were 16 confirmed cavalry charges during the 1939 war. Contrary to common belief, most of them were successful.

The first and perhaps best known cavalry charge happened on 1 September 1939, during the Battle of Krojanty. During this action, elements of the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment met a large group of German infantry resting in the woods near the village of Krojanty. Colonel Mastalerz decided to take the enemy by surprise and immediately ordered a cavalry charge, a tactic the Polish cavalry rarely used as their main weapon. The charge was successful and the German infantry unit was dispersed.

The same day, German war correspondents were brought to the battlefield together with two journalists from Italy. They were shown the battlefield, the corpses of Polish cavalrymen and their horses, alongside German tanks that had arrived at the field of battle only after the engagement. One of the Italian correspondents sent home an article, in which he described the bravery and heroism of Polish soldiers, who charged German tanks with their sabres and lances. Other possible source of the myth is a quote from Heinz Guderian&#x27;s memoirs, in which he asserted that the Pomeranian Brigade had charged on German tanks with swords and lances. Although such a charge did not happen and there were no tanks used during the combat, the myth was disseminated by German propaganda during the war with a staged Polish cavalry charge shown in their 1941 reel called &quot;Geschwader Lützow&quot;. 

Even such prominent German writers as Günter Grass, later accused of anti-Polonism by Jan Józef Lipski among others, were falling victims to this Nazi deception. Grass wrote the following passage, somewhat metaphorically, in his famous novel &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;:

:&quot;&quot;O insane cavalry!—picking blueberries on horseback. With wimpled lances, red and white. Squadrons of melancholy and tradition. Picture-book charges. Over the fields of Lodz and Kuno. Modlin, freeing the fortress. Galloping so brilliantly. Always awaiting the setting sun. Only then does the cavalry attack, when both foreground and background are splendid, for battle is so picturesque, and Death the artist&#x27;s model, one leg engaged and one leg free, then plunging, nibbling blueberries, rose- hips tumble and burst, release the itch that spurs the cavalry to charge. Uhlans, itching again, wheel their horses about where shocks of straw are standing—this too a striking image—and gather round a man called Don Quixote in Spain, but this one&#x27;s name is Pan Kichot, a pureblood Pole of sad and noble mien, who&#x27;s taught his uhlans how to kiss a lady&#x27;s hand on horseback, so now they always kiss the hand of Death as if he were a lady, but gather first with sunset at their backs—for atmosphere and mood are their reserves—the German tanks before them, stallions from the stud farms of Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach, nobler steeds there never were. But that half-Spanish, half-Polish knight so in love with death—brilliant Pan Kichot, too brilliant—lowers his red-white wimpled lance, bids you all to kiss the lady&#x27;s hand, cries out so that the evening glows, red-white storks clatter on the rooftops, cherries spit out their pits, and he cries to the cavalry, &quot;Ye noble Poles on horseback, those are not tanks of steel, they are windmills or sheep. I bid you all to kiss the lady&#x27;s hand!&quot;&quot;

On 1 September 2009 Sir Simon Jenkins, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s website, characterised the notion of pitting Polish cavalry against tanks as &quot;the most romantic and idiotic act of suicide of modern war.&quot; On 21 September 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; was forced to publish an admission that his article &quot;repeated a myth of the second world war, fostered by Nazi propagandists, when it said that Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler&#x27;s panzers. There is no evidence that this occurred.&quot;

Other cavalry charges of 1939 were as follows:

# September 1 - Battle of Mokra - 19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment took by surprise the elements of German 4th Panzer Division, which retreated in panic. During the charge, lances were used. In fact, the cavalry charge in the traditional sense was neither planned, nor executed. The mounted infantry rode over behind the attacking German armor in behind the tankettes with the tank men throwing smoke grenades to cover the approach. Indeed, the mounted infantry did repel the German support infantry and forced part of the German armored regiment to continue to advance while deprived of the infantry support.
# September 1 - Battle of Lasy Królewskie - 11th Legions Uhlan Regiment on a reconnaissance mission encountered a similar unit of German cavalry. Lieut. Kossakowski ordered a cavalry charge, but the enemy did not accept battle and after a short clash withdrew towards their positions.
# September 2 - Battle of Borowa Góra - 1st squadron of the 19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment encountered a squadron of German cavalry in the village of Borowa. A charge was ordered, but the Germans withdrew.
# September 11 - Osuchowo - 1st squadron of the 20th Uhlan Regiment of King Jan III Sobieski charged through the German infantry lines to avoid encirclement, and broke through. There were negligible losses on both sides.
# September 11–12 - Kałuszyn - 4th squadron of the 11th Legions Uhlan Regiment charged overnight at the German positions in the town of Kałuszyn. Although the charge was a mistake (the Polish infantry commander issued a wrong order which was understood as a charge order while the cavalry was meant to simply move forward), it was a success. After heavy casualties on both sides, the town was retaken in the early morning.
# September 13 - Mińsk Mazowiecki - 1st squadron of the 2nd Grochow Uhlan Regiment charged German infantry positions, but was repelled by German MG and artillery fire.
# September 13 - Maliszewo - 1st squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment was engaged in heavy fighting near the village of Maliszewo. After the Germans were beaten and started to retreat towards the village, the Poles charged and took the village along with a large number of German prisoners.
# September 15 - Brochów - elements of the 17th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment charged towards the German positions to frighten the enemy infantry. Shortly before reaching the range of enemy weapons, they dismounted and continued their assault on foot; the attack was successful.
# September 16 - Dembowskie - a platoon from the 4th squadron of the 17th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment charged towards a small German outpost located around a foresters&#x27; hut. The small number of Germans withdrew.
# September 19 - Battle of Wólka Węglowa - Most of the 14th Jazlowiec Uhlan Regiment (without its MGs and AT platoon) was ordered to probe the German lines near the town of Wólka Węglowa. After elements of 9th Lesser Poland Uhlan Regiment arrived, the group was ordered to charge through the German lines to open the way towards Warsaw and Modlin for the rest of Polish forces who were withdrawing from the Battle of Bzura. The Poles charged through a German artillery barrage and took the German infantry by surprise. Polish losses were high (205 killed and wounded), the German losses remain unknown, but the Polish unit broke through and was the first to reach Warsaw after the Battle of Bzura.
# September 19 - Łomianki - recce squad of 6th Mounted Artillery Detachment charged through the German lines in the town of Lomianki and paved the way for the rest of the unit to Warsaw.
# September 21 - Battle of Kamionka Strumiłowa - 3rd squadron of the 1st Mounted Detachment (improvised) charged through German infantry who were preparing to assault the Polish positions. The preparations were paralysed and the Germans withdrew.
# September 23 - Krasnobród - 1st squadron of the 25th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment charged towards the town of Krasnobród. After heavy casualties, they reached the hilltop on which the town was located. A unit of German organic cavalry from the German 8th Infantry Division countercharged from the hill, but was repelled and the Poles captured the town and took the HQ of the division, together with its commander and about 100 German soldiers. 40 Polish combatants previously taken prisoner by the Germans were also freed.
# September 24 - Husynne - reserve squadron of the 14th Jazlowiec Uhlan Regiment (some 500 sabres), reinforced with an improvised cavalry unit of police and some remnants of divisional organic cavalry, was ordered to break through the Soviet infantry surrounding the Polish positions in the village of Husynne. The charge was led by the mounted police, and the Soviet forces withdrew in panic. However, the attack was soon halted by a strong Soviet tank unit. Casualties were similar on both sides.
# September 26 - Morańce - 27th Uhlan Regiment twice charged an entrenched German infantry battalion in the village of Morańce. Both charges were repelled with heavy casualties (the Poles lost 20 KIA and about 50 wounded, German losses are unknown). After the second charge the Germans sent out a soldier with a white flag and, after a short discussion with the Polish commander of the Nowogródek Cavalry Brigade, the Germans withdrew.

==Present time==

In Poland there are now several Volunteer Representative Squadrons. The Polish Army also has a &quot;Representative Cavalry Squadron of the Polish Army&quot; ().

<doc id="288367" wikidata="Q7407629" url="?curid=288367" title="Lynching of Sam Hose">
<text>Sam Hose (born Samuel Thomas Wilkes; c. 1875 – April 23, 1899) was an African American man who was tortured and murdered by a white lynch mob in Coweta County, Georgia, after being accused of rape.

== Personal life ==
Sam Hose was born Tom Wilkes in south Georgia near Marshallville (Macon County), circa 1875. He grew up on a Macon County farm owned by the Jones family; the family had owned his mother. Hose was described by those who knew him as friendly and intelligent and, unusual for a black man in the 19th century South, he learned how to read and write. Having to look after his aging mother and an intellectually disabled brother, he abandoned his plans for higher education and worked as a manual laborer. Newspaper accounts in 1899 said that Wilkes left Marshallville and used the alias Sam Hose because he had been accused of assaulting an elderly black woman.

== Accusation ==

Wilkes moved to Coweta County, where he assumed the alias Sam Hose. On April 12, 1899, he was accused of murdering his employer, Alfred Cranford, after a heated argument. Hose had requested time off to visit his ailing mother. According to Hose, Alfred Cranford threatened to kill him and pointed a revolver at him. Hose was working at the time with an ax in his hands. Hose alleged that, due to the threat, he defended himself and threw the ax, killing Cranford. Hose fled the scene, and the search for him began shortly thereafter. Five cash rewards were offered for his capture, including from then-Governor Allen Candler, The Atlanta Constitution, Coweta County, the town of Palmetto, and Jacob Hass of Atlanta. Over the next few days, the furor was caused by rumors suggesting that Wilkes sexually assaulted Cranford&#x27;s wife, Mattie Cranford, and assaulted his infant child. Newspapers portrayed Hose as &quot;a monster in human form&quot; who gleefully raped Mrs. Cranford and their infant child in front of the dying Mr. Cranford and, for good measure, claimed without evidence that Hose was suffering from advanced syphilis. Mrs. Cranford forever maintained that she had been raped by Hose, and her youngest son, Clifford Alfred “Tan” Cranford, was left blind in his left eye as a result of the injuries he received that day. On April 23, 1899, Hose was apprehended in Marshallville and returned by train to Coweta County.

== Following events ==
A mob kidnapped Hose from the train at gunpoint in Newnan, Georgia. Hose was marched to the Newnan jail, where a dispute arose between Hose&#x27;s captors and the sheriff. The captors agreed to surrender Hose to the sheriff if they were paid their reward money. As the town jailer led Hose to a cell, the mob grew alarmed, held a pistol to the jailer&#x27;s head, and took Hose away. Former Governor William Yates Atkinson and Judge Alvan Freeman pleaded with the crowd to release Hose to the custody of the authorities.

Ignoring their pleas, the crowd moved northward toward the Cranford home. The lynch mob grew, reaching an estimated 500 individuals, though some accounts purport around 2000. Once news of the capture reached Atlanta, large crowds boarded trains to Newnan. Mistakenly believing that these trains were loaded with troops, the mob stopped just north of Newnan, deciding they could wait no longer.

=== Lynching ===
Hose was brought to a patch of land known as the old Troutman field. Newspapers reported that members of the mob used knives to sever Hose&#x27;s ears, fingers and genitals while others plunged knives repeatedly into his body, to cheers from the mob. Men and boys gathered kindling from the nearby woods to create a pyre. The skin from Hose&#x27;s face was removed, and he was doused with kerosene. He was then chained to a pine tree. Several matches were thrown onto the pyre by members of the mob, lighting it on fire and burning Hose alive. The heat from the fire caused Hose&#x27;s veins to rupture while his eyes nearly burst from their sockets. One journalist present noted the crowd watched &quot;with unfeigned satisfaction&quot; at contortions of Hose&#x27;s body. As the flames consumed his body, Hose screamed out, &quot;Oh my God! Oh Jesus!&quot; From the time of Hose&#x27;s first injuries to his death, almost 30 minutes passed. One woman thanked God for the actions of the mob. Some members of the mob cut off pieces of his dead body as souvenirs. Pieces of Hose&#x27;s bones were sold for 25 cents, while his heart and liver were cut out to be sold.

None of the lynch mob wore masks and did not seek to hide their identities, giving their names to journalists who were present. On the tree where Hose had died, a sign was attached reading &quot;We Must Protect Our Southern Women&quot; One white Southern woman objected, a Mrs. P.H. Mell of Atlanta, who proudly noted in her letter to the editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; that she was a member of the Daughters of the Confederacy, and spoke of her horror about what was done to Hose, urging white women to protest the &quot;unparalleled brutality&quot; committed in the name of protecting them. Another woman, future United States Senator Rebecca Felton, wrote a letter protesting against Mell&#x27;s letter, saying that any &quot;true-hearted husband or father&quot; would have done the same to the &quot;beast&quot; Hose, arguing that Hose needed to be killed in the same way that a mad dog needed to be put down, except &quot;the dog is more worthy of sympathy.&quot;

According to Philip Dray&#x27;s &quot;At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America&quot;, the noted civil rights leader and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, who lived in Atlanta at the time, was on his way to a scheduled meeting with &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; editor Joel Chandler Harris to discuss the lynching when he was informed that Hose&#x27;s knuckles were for sale in a grocery store on the road on which he was walking. He turned around and did not meet with Harris after learning this. Until then, Du Bois believed that lynching was an aberrant phenomenon and that he could use reason and a sense of fairness to appeal to the majority of the white community. The spectacular nature of Hose&#x27;s lynching and the sale of body parts convinced him otherwise.

The governor of Georgia, Allen D. Candler, issued a statement calling the murder of Alfred Cranford &quot;the most diabolical in the annals of crime&quot; and blamed the entire black community of Georgia. Candler complained the younger generation of blacks had not been so &quot;lucky&quot; to have experienced slavery while the older generation of blacks had failed to pass on the right values. Without presenting any proof, Candler argued that the entire black community was responsible for Hose&#x27;s actions and accused black citizens of hiding and sheltering him during the manhunt. Candler ended his statement by saying that it was &quot;deplorable&quot; that the blacks had protested the lynching of Hose.

Four days later, on April 27, a black man named Mitchell Daniel was lynched by whites in Leesburg, Georgia, because he had complained about Sam Hose&#x27;s lynching. 

== Post-lynching investigation ==

The actions of the lynch mob were condemned throughout most of the United States and Europe. A group of prominent citizens in Chicago, led by journalist and activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, hired detective Louis P. Le Vin to investigate the Hose lynching. Le Vin&#x27;s entire report was published in Chapter IV of Ida B. Wells-Barnett&#x27;s article, &quot;Lynch Law in Georgia&quot;.

Le Vin stated that he spent over one week in his investigation. He concluded that Hose acted in self-defense, and whites added the rape allegation to incite a lynching. Le Vin stated that his conclusions were gathered from interviews with &quot;persons he met in Griffin, Newman [&quot;sic&quot;], Atlanta and the vicinity.&quot; He does not provide the name of any individual who provided information, probably because they fear reprisals for speaking out publicly. He stated that he could not speak to Mattie Cranford because she &quot;was still suffering from the awful shock.&quot; Le Vin&#x27;s report stated, &quot;that Wilkes killed Cranford there is no doubt, but under what circumstances can never be proven.&quot; Le Vin concluded his report with the statement, &quot;I made my way home thoroughly convinced that a Negro&#x27;s life is a very cheap thing in Georgia.&quot; In &quot;Lynch Law in Georgia&quot;, he stated:

Historian Leon Litwack states, in &quot;Trouble In Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow&quot;, that during an investigation by a white detective, separate from the investigation organized by Wells-Barnett, Cranford&#x27;s wife Mattie revealed that Hose had never entered the house, and had acted in self-defense against her husband.

==The memory of the lynching==
In February 2007, Richard Rusk who had founded the Moore&#x27;s Ford Memorial Committee to commemorate the Moore&#x27;s Ford lynchings was contacted by a group called Come to the Table in Newnan, Georgia, that wanted to commemorate Hose&#x27;s lynching. Rusk had led an effort to commemorate the Moore&#x27;s Ford lynchings by applying for a Georgia historical marker to be placed at the site of the lynching. The Georgia Historical Society erected a historical marker in 1999, the first historical marker in Georgia—and one of the first in the country—to document a lynching. Come to the Table were hoping Rusk could help them do the same at the site of Hose&#x27;s lynching. To raise public interest, Rusk spoke to a journalist, Winston Skinner, from the &quot;Newnan Times-Herald&quot;. Rusk later stated the article: &quot;I expected they would run it inside the paper on the fifth or sixth page. Instead, it was a front-page article. When I expressed my surprise, they told me anything to do with Sam Hose was a front-page story&quot;.

Rusk suggested a memorial service to honor Hose: &quot;We hope something good will come after so many years by paying our respects to Sam Hose.&quot; The article in the &quot;Newnan Times-Herald&quot; on February 6, 2007, started a firestorm of controversy in Newnan, attracting a flood of highly negative letters to the editor calling Hose a murderer and rapist who was justly lynched by the white community of Newnan. Rusk felt Skinner was responsible for the backlash, noting that he had omitted from the article the part in the interview which he stated that Hose was probably innocent and instead presented it as a fact that Hose was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused. In his article, Skinner wrote: &quot;On 12th of April 1899, Hose hit his employer in the head with an ax, killing him. He then raped the landowner&#x27;s wife and injured their infant child&quot;. Rusk felt that there were mitigating circumstances for Hose killing Cranford and that Hose was innocent of the charges of rape. In response, Skinner replied to Rusk that in Newnan, it was accepted that Hose was a murderer and rapist, and it was disrespectful to the Cranford family to present the story any other way.

Many white residents of Newnan wrote letters objecting to the memorial service, with one letter writer calling Rusk&#x27;s proposed service &quot;shameful.&quot; One letter writer wrote: &quot;I am amazed there are plans to have a memorial service to show respect and honor Sam Hose, the man who raped and murdered his way across our country many years ago...The group proposing to hold this memorial service should be truly ashamed&quot;. One white woman wrote: &quot;A man who is an ax murderer and a rapist, and whose crimes were described as some of the most violent, needs to be lynched. I don&#x27;t care about race, sex, orientation, etc., etc. In fact, maybe if the judicial system actually punished crimes committed, there might be one person who thinks twice about crimes instead of looking forward to a cushy life in prison with three squares, cable TV, exercise equipment, libraries and steaks. Why doesn&#x27;t this group not seek to honor someone who was just a good, decent person instead of someone who obviously got what he deserved?&quot; Another letter writer wrote that while Hose did not receive fair treatment stated: &quot;Lack of fair legal system treatment...is in no way an obligation to &#x27;pay our respects to Sam Hose.&#x27; If we start paying respect to murderers and rapists, then we need to do the same for the late Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, and John Wayne Gacey&quot;. Judge John Herbert Cranford, a descendant of Alfred Cranford, issued a public statement condemning the lynching, but also expressed much anger at Rusk for not paying enough attention to his family&#x27;s suffering. One letter writer took a contrary position to the majority, saying the Moore&#x27;s Ford Memorial Committee should be &quot;commended&quot; for its work, and concluded: &quot;To ignore the past or sweep it under the rug is what keeps people from getting together in harmony and amity...The bottom line is that addressing an old wrong is the right thing to do&quot;.

Rusk in a letter to the editor of the &quot;Newnan Times-Herald&quot; argued for a public discussion rather than a memorial service for Hose, writing: &quot;One of the more unfortunate aspects of lynching in Georgia and elsewhere is that many of those killed were innocent of any crime. Hose may indeed be one of the exceptions. On several issues, many of us can agree. No man deserved to die like Sam Hose, whether innocent or guilty. Number two—little lasting good will be achieved if any effort to revisit this horrific event in Newnan is cooked up primarily by &#x27;outsiders&#x27;...Do wounds like Hose&#x27;s killing really heal by leaving them alone? Or if unaddressed, do they just fester away?&quot; Rusk drove to Newnan himself to meet with members of Come to the Table, where he argued that most of the white people in Newnan knew only a very biased version about the lynching of Hose and believed that the effort to honor him was a way to defame their town&#x27;s reputation.&quot; On April 23, 2007, Rusk spoke at a meeting at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Newnan about the lynching. In his speech Rusk stated the Hose lynching was different from the Moore&#x27;s Ford lynching as Hose had no descendants to champion his memory while the Cranford family were still well respected and known in Newnan, making it more difficult to honor Hose as a victim of injustice. The historian Edwin Arnold from Coweta County noted that even today, there is no marker at the place where Hose was killed to commemorate the event.

<doc id="288371" wikidata="Q470282" url="?curid=288371" title="Stephen J. Cannell">
<text>Stephen Joseph Cannell (; February 5, 1941 – September 30, 2010) was an American television producer, writer, novelist, actor, and founder of Cannell Entertainment (formerly Stephen J. Cannell Productions) and The Cannell Studios.

After starting his career as a television screenwriter, Cannell created or co-created several dozen successful TV series from the 1970s to the 1990s, often with his creative partner Frank Lupo. Cannell&#x27;s creations include &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, and &quot;The Commish&quot;. He also wrote novels, notably the Shane Scully mystery series.

==Early life==
Cannell was born in Los Angeles and raised in nearby Pasadena. He was the son of Carolyn (née Baker) and Joseph Knapp Cannell. Joseph owned the highly-successful interior decorating company Cannell and Chaffin. Cannell struggled with dyslexia in school, but did graduate from the University of Oregon in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism. At UO, he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity.

The 2009 documentary &quot;&quot; features an interview with Cannell, in which he discusses his struggles with dyslexia and how he managed to be such a successful writer despite his difficulties reading. During the interview, he mentions how he used to hire typists to overcome his spelling problem, as he refers to his dyslexia, but also describes how he feels his condition has enriched his life.

==Career==
After college Cannell spent four years working with the family business before selling his first script to the Universal series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; in 1968. He was quickly hired by Universal Television, the television production branch of Universal Studios and was soon freelance writing for such other crime shows as &quot;Ironside&quot; (1970–1971) and &quot;Columbo&quot; (1973).

In 1971, he received a telephone call from friend Herman Saunders who was the producer on Jack Webb&#x27;s police series &quot;Adam-12&quot;. They needed a script right away and Saunders asked if Cannell would be interested in writing it. He delivered what they wanted in one day, his first full-time gig, and was soon hired as story editor of the series, then in its fourth season, until 1973.

For Universal Television, Cannell created or co-created &quot;Chase&quot; (1973–1974), &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (1974–1980), &quot;Baretta&quot; (1975–1978), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1976), and &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (1976–1978). He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1978 for &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

In a 2002 interview, Cannell described his early financial arrangements, saying that at Universal,

In 1979, Cannell left Universal and formed his own company, Stephen J. Cannell Productions. For the first few years, Cannell&#x27;s office was located on the lot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, though his earlier work at Universal was still distributed by MCA-Universal. His first series under his new banner was &quot;Tenspeed and Brown Shoe&quot; (1980), and was soon followed by &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; (1981–1983), &quot;The Quest&quot; (1982), &quot;The A-Team&quot; (1983–1987), &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot; (1983–1986), &quot;Riptide&quot; (1984–1986), and &quot;Hunter&quot; (1984–1991). Cannell&#x27;s offices relocated to larger facilities on Hollywood Boulevard in 1983.

In 1986, Cannell was co-founder, along with Tri-Star Pictures and Witt/Thomas Productions, of the syndication distributor TeleVentures. In late 1988, Witt/Thomas Productions exited the TeleVentures venture and entered a distribution deal with Walt Disney Television, selling its share to Cannell. On July 11, 1990, both Tri-Star and Cannell dissolved the TeleVentures joint venture, and Tri-Star sold its shares to Stephen J. Cannell Productions. TeleVentures thus became Cannell Distribution Co.

Also in 1986 the favorable exchange rate between the US and Canadian dollars being a win/win for US producers, Cannell decided to shoot his new series &quot;Stingray&quot; (1985–1987) in Toronto. However, so many producers were shooting in Toronto that no crews were available to staff any additional productions. Consequently, Cannell shot the first seven episodes of &quot;Stingray&quot;&#x27;s second season in Calgary with the remaining eight episodes being shot in Vancouver. His first series to entirely be shot in Vancouver was &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (1987–1991), the highest-rated show of the new Fox network&#x27;s first season.

With more and more series being shot in Vancouver, Cannell said, &quot;We were fighting with everybody for locations and stage space&quot;. His solution was to build a new, state-of-the-art facility, &quot;The North Shore Studios&quot; on 13 acres with one hundred thousand square feet of office space and seven sound stages. The series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; was soon followed by &quot;J.J. Starbuck&quot; (1987–1988), &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1987–1990), &quot;Unsub&quot; (1989), &quot;Top of the Hill&quot; (1989), &quot;Booker&quot; (1989–1990), &quot;Broken Badges &quot; (1990–1991), &quot;Palace Guard&quot; (1991), &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; (1991–1992), &quot;The Commish&quot; (1991–1996), &quot;Street Justice&quot; (1991–1993), &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; (1991–1999), &quot;The Hat Squad&quot; (1992–1993), &quot;Renegade&quot; (1992–1997), &quot;Cobra&quot; (1993–1994), and &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (1994–1995). A number of television films were also shot in Vancouver by Cannell&#x27;s production company.

On July 31, 1995, New World Communications acquired his Cannell Entertainment production company. Cannell then founded The Cannell Studios. One of the first shows produced by the newly established Cannell Studios was the short-lived but critically acclaimed corporate drama &quot;Profit&quot; (1996).

Cannell created or co-created nearly 40 television series, mostly crime dramas. In the process, he had by his own count, scripted more than 450 episodes, and produced or executive produced over 1,500 episodes.

In May 1988, Cannell was a panelist in the John Davidson edition of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. He also served as the host of the 1991–92 series &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;, a mystery anthology series with a repertory cast, and of the 1995–1996 syndicated documentary series &quot;U.S. Customs Classified&quot;, focusing on the work of the U.S Customs Service.

Cannell also acted occasionally, including a recurring role as main antagonist &quot;Dutch&quot; Dixon on his series &quot;Renegade&quot;. He also took a turn in an episode of &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, in which the script called for one character to tell him, &quot;You look just like that writer on TV,&quot; to which Cannell&#x27;s character responds, &quot;I get that all the time.&quot; Cannell appeared as himself in the 2009 pilot of the ABC show &quot;Castle&quot; and again in two episodes of season two. Along with James Patterson, Dennis Lehane, and Michael Connelly, he was one of Castle&#x27;s poker buddies. In season three following Cannell&#x27;s death, an empty seat at the poker table is described as Cannell&#x27;s, and remains empty for a full year in tribute to him.

Beginning in 1995 Cannell turned his attention to writing novels. His first novel, &quot;The Plan&quot;, was released in 1997 by Avon. As of 2010, he had written 18, 11 of which featured the character of detective Shane Scully of the Los Angeles Police Department. Seven are stand-alone novels. The last in the series, &quot;Vigilante&quot;, was released December 2011 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

Cannell&#x27;s TV series &quot;The A-Team&quot; was remade into a 2010 feature-length film. Cannell served as a producer and creative consultant for the project. His other series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; was made into a 2012 feature by Columbia Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and into the sequel &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; which was released in June 2014.

==Personal life==
Cannell married his high school sweetheart, Marcia, in 1964. He &quot;asked her to go steady (with him) in the eighth grade&quot;. They had two daughters, Tawnia and Chelsea, and two sons, Cody and Derek. Derek died in 1982 at age 15 when a sand castle he was building at the beach collapsed and suffocated him. The tragedy occurred during the filming of the &quot;Captain Bellybuster&quot; episode of &quot;The Greatest American Hero.&quot; Actor William Katt, who is an expert musician, wrote a song for Cannell titled &quot;Cody the Cowboy&quot;. Cannell was so touched by this gift that he named his next son Cody in honor of the song.

Cannell was dyslexic and was a spokesman on the subject. According to an episode of Paul Harvey&#x27;s &quot;The Rest of the Story&quot;, Cannell frequently had to dictate ideas or even complete scripts with the help of his personal secretary Grace Curcio, an employee of 20 years. Following Curcio&#x27;s retirement in 2003, Kathy Ezso became his editor and executive assistant. He discusses his experiences as a dyslexic in the 2009 documentary &quot;Dislecksia: The Movie&quot;.

Cannell wrote on a typewriter, an IBM Selectric, when not dictating to an assistant, and only used a computer for research purposes.

Cannell was 69 when he died on September 30, 2010, from complications of melanoma. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. In tribute to his memory, the producers of &quot;Castle&quot; ended their third-season episode &quot;Punked&quot; with a new version of Cannell&#x27;s production company logo, which featured video of Cannell at his typewriter tossing out a typed sheet, over a caption reading, &quot;Stephen J. Cannell. Colleague. Mentor. Friend. We&#x27;ll miss you, pal.&quot; The episode aired October 11, 2010 on ABC.

===Distribution===
Cannell sold his company in March 1995 to New World Communications for $30 million and News Corporation acquired New World in 1996. However, two of Cannell&#x27;s series, &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; are controlled by two other studios: Universal Television for the former and Sony Pictures Television for the latter and were not part of the deal. Also part of the deal, Cannell would pay Fox for international and domestic sales for his series. On May 4, 1998, Cannell reacquired his library from Fox.

On January 24, 2006, The Carsey-Werner Company acquired distribution rights to Cannell&#x27;s library.

In March 2020, the Cannell estate signed a worldwide distribution deal with Shout! Factory.

<text>Hibernia National Bank was a bank headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. The bank was the primary subsidiary of Hibernia Corporation, a bank holding company. In November 2005, the bank was acquired by Capital One.

Hibernia is the classical Latin name for Ireland. The logo of the bank included a harp, the national symbol of Ireland.

==History==
In April 1870, three Irish-American businessmen co-founded the Hibernia Bank &amp; Trust Company in New Orleans. Patrick Irwin was named the first President, Hugh McCloskey, the first Vice-President, and Thomas Fitzwilliam, first Secretary. In September 1870, the bank began operations.

In 1973, the board of directors hired 38-year-old Martin C. Miler, formerly an executive at First Union, to be the bank&#x27;s president and chairman. In 1975, the Louisiana legislature approved multi-parish banking. By 1983, Hibernia grew to be the largest bank in the state in terms of assets. Despite its operations in Louisiana, the bank never lent heavily to the petroleum industry.

In 1989, the bank entered Texas via the acquisition of First State Bank of Pflugerville, which was shut down by regulators as a result of bank failure. 

In 1990, the bank acquired BancTexas after it also failed.

The bank had positive growth every quarter from 1973 to 1990; however, in 1990, as a result of the savings and loan crisis, the bank reported a loss, eliminated its dividend and needed capital.

In 1991, Martin Miler retired.

In 1992, the company sold its operations in Texas to Comerica for $63.1 million in cash. The company also recapitalized by giving Chase Manhattan Bank a majority ownership stake in the company in exchange for debt forgiveness.

In 2000, the company entered the insurance business with the acquisition of The Rosenthal Agency.

In 2003, the company re-entered the Texas market with the acquisition of Coastal Bancorp. The company also announced plans to open additional branches in Texas.

In November 2005, Capital One acquired the company. The acquisition price was re-negotiated downward after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans.

<text>MBNA Corporation was a bank holding company and parent company of wholly owned subsidiary MBNA America Bank, N.A., headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, prior to being acquired by Bank of America in 2006.

==History==

The former Maryland National Bank, once the largest banking chain in Maryland, originated as the Baltimore Trust Company in the early 1900s. It later was challenged by the expenses and problems from the building of its landmark red brick, masonry, and limestone art deco-style skyscraper in downtown Baltimore at 10 Light Street between East Redwood (known as German Street before World War I) and East Baltimore Streets. Construction began on the new BTC Building in 1924. Upon completion in 1929, it became the tallest building in Baltimore (and Maryland), surpassing the neighboring Citizens National Bank to the south. It opened just before the avalanche of economic disaster and unemployment following the Wall Street crash of 1929. After a series of reorganizations during the &quot;New Deal&quot; administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt (and his bank holiday shortly after taking office in March 1933), the bank was reorganized as the Maryland National Bank.

Maryland National&#x27;s parent, bank holding company MNC Financial, began offering credit cards in the 1960s.

In the early 1980s, Maryland banks lobbied the Maryland General Assembly for legislation to permit higher interest rates on credit-card charges, but lawmakers refused. The neighboring state of Delaware, by contrast, had removed interest-rate restrictions in 1981. When Maryland failed to do the same, MNC Financial moved its credit-card business across the state line. MBNA was founded in 1982 as Maryland Bank, N.A.

Led by Charles Cawley, MBNA opened its first office in a converted A&amp;P (Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company) food supermarket in Ogletown, Delaware. An early driver of MBNA&#x27;s growth was the creation of &quot;affinity cards&quot; in 1983. Cawley convinced the alumni association at his alma mater, Georgetown University, to allow MBNA to issue credit cards branded with the university&#x27;s name. This proved to be a successful business, and other affinity affiliations with universities, organizations, and sports teams followed; by 2004, MBNA had more than 5,400 partnerships, making up about 85% of the affinity-card market.

In 1989, Maryland Bank was renamed MBNA America Bank. In 1991, MBNA Corp. spun off from Maryland National and became an independent company. Businessman Al Lerner, a major investor and chairman of Maryland National since 1989, was the new MBNA&#x27;s largest stockholder and chairman. Lerner became a multi-billionaire and purchased the Cleveland Browns franchise of the National Football League in 1998. He served as chairman of MBNA until his death in 2002.

Maryland National was acquired by NationsBank in 1993.

As MBNA grew, it became one of the most profitable companies in the United States, the world&#x27;s largest independent credit card issuer, and the largest private-sector employer in Delaware.

In 1995, MBNA moved its headquarters from a suburban location to Rodney Square in downtown Wilmington, Delaware. This investment was credited with helping to revive Wilmington&#x27;s downtown real estate market. In 2003, MBNA partnered with Bluefish entrepreneur Steve Sims to launch its own credit card.

Historically, many MBNA executives were former employees of the FBI.

==Mergers and acquisitions==
On June 30, 2005, MBNA announced that it was being acquired by Bank of America for stock and cash totaling more than $35 billion, and the deal was closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition resulted in MBNA being renamed to &quot;Bank of America Card Services&quot; while still based in Delaware. For the first part of 2006, MBNA still issued credit cards under its own name associated with Mastercard, VISA, and American Express, but by the second half of 2006, all credit card products were re-branded as Bank of America rather than MBNA.

At the same time in June 2005, MBNA bought Loans.co.uk (LCUK), then the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading finance broker. Although figures were never released, various media outlets including newspapers in Watford, where Loans.co.uk was based, reported the deal made founders David Cowham and Steve Hayes worth £100m. MBNA/Bank of America later decided to close Loans.co.uk.

On January 1, 2006, MBNA merged with and into Bank of America. MBNA America Bank, National Association, (MBNA) then became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America. On June 10, 2006, MBNA changed its name to FIA Card Services, National Association (FIA), which is not an acronym. On October 20, 2006, Bank of America, National Association (USA), a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, merged with and into FIA.

This purchase was a reunion of sorts. In 1993, NationsBank (formerly NCNB, and originally North Carolina National Bank) bought MNC Financial (whose credit card division was spun off years earlier to become MBNA). Five years later, the Bank of America that exists today was the result of the merger between the San Francisco-based Bank of America and the Charlotte-based NationsBank. When Bank of America bought MBNA, it was in effect reuniting MNC Financial&#x27;s credit card portfolio to its original banking assets and combining the Bank of America credit card portfolio with MBNA&#x27;s.

Employing more than 25,800 people around the world at the time of the merger with Bank of America, MBNA owned or managed more than $122.5 billion in outstanding consumer credit loans. Most of this loan debt was held in securitized portfolios that had been sold to other entities such as insurance companies and pension funds. MBNA virtually invented the process for securitizing credit card debt and this process contributed significantly to the fast growth of the company. It allowed for increasing the amount loaned without having to acquire matching assets to offset the loans.

In Canada and Europe, the MBNA name was retained. MBNA Europe headquarters is in Chester, England, United Kingdom. MBNA Canada&#x27;s headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario. In 2007, the Canadian division was named one of Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers.

On August 15, 2011, MBNA announced that the Toronto-Dominion Bank would be purchasing MBNA&#x27;s Canadian MasterCard portfolio. The acquisition of MBNA Canada by TD, which was completed on December 1, 2011, saw TD become a dual credit issuer (both Visa and MasterCard), become Canada&#x27;s largest MasterCard issuer, and one of Canada&#x27;s largest credit issuing banks.

In January 2013, Virgin Money agreed to buy £1 billion of assets from MBNA, namely the Virgin Credit Card assets which MBNA had serviced and managed in partnership with Virgin Money since 2002. The former Vice Chairman of MBNA Corporation, Lance Weaver, became Virgin Money&#x27;s President of Virgin Money Cards.

On December 20, 2016, Lloyds Banking Group announced that it would purchase MBNA&#x27;s UK portfolio from Bank of America for £1.9 billion, its first acquisition after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The deal was completed on June 1, 2017 and since that time, in the United Kingdom, MBNA is a trading style of Lloyds Bank plc and is regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA.

== Controversies ==

MBNA hired Hunter Biden (then 26 years old and a recent law school graduate) during the years when his father, then-Senator Joe Biden, was pushing for bankruptcy reform legislation supported by the company, which became law and makes it more difficult to acquire bankruptcy protection. Because of the close relationship between Biden and MBNA, Byron York called Biden the &quot;Senator from MBNA&quot; in a 1998 article for conservative magazine &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

MBNA was one of the companies mentioned on a 2004 &quot;Frontline&quot; WGBH Boston PBS special about unfair business practices by credit card companies. Some practices that &quot;Frontline&quot; claimed MBNA has engaged in included doubling or tripling of interest rates, shifting billing due dates/payment cycles monthly and raising rates for customers whose payments were a day or two late. MBNA has been found to be one of the leading implementors of rate-jacking. For further information and links, see &quot;credit card&quot;.

In Ireland, MBNA was accused of calling consumers up to eight times a day who were behind in making payments, which prompted the state debt advisory service to publicly state that harassment is outlawed. Affected people were advised to complain to the relevant authorities. The company in December 2009 admitted overcharging 500,000 Irish consumers up to €18 million.

In the UK, circa September 2010, MBNA came under fire for its interpretation of new UK legislation, under which credit card providers must allocate payments to the debt with the highest interest rate first: one consumer site called MBNA&#x27;s interpretation of these rules a &quot;disingenuous money-making tactic&quot;.

<text>LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud, and a popular element of Internet slang, which can be used to indicate amusement, irony, or double meanings. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (&quot;laughing my ass off&quot;) and ROFL or ROTFL (&quot;rolling on the floor laughing&quot;).

In 2003, the list of acronyms was said to &quot;grow by the month&quot;, and they were collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; first listed LOL in March 2011.

==History==

In the early to mid-1980s, Wayne Pearson was reportedly the first person to have used LOL while responding to a friend&#x27;s joke in a pre-Internet digital chat room called Viewline. Instead of writing &quot;hahaha,&quot; as he had done before when he found something humorous, Pearson stated that he instead typed &quot;LOL&quot; to symbolize extreme laughter. Although the account is commonly accepted as true, no written record of the conversation has been found, and the exact date of origin is unknown. The earliest recorded mention of LOL in the contemporary meaning of &quot;Laughing Out Loud&quot; was made in a list of common online acronyms on the May 8, 1989 issue of the electronic newsletter &quot;FidoNews&quot;, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and linguist Ben Zimmer.

A 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually &quot;lower&quot; than she had expected. The students &quot;used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons&quot;. Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL.On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for &quot;little old lady&quot; in the 1960s.

Gabriella Coleman references &quot;lulz&quot; extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous.

LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystallikening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s invention of movable type in the 15th centurystates that this is &quot;a brand new variety of language evolving&quot;, invented by young people within five years, that &quot;extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language&quot;. However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their &quot;total effect on language&quot; would be &quot;utterly trivial&quot;.

While LOL originally meant &quot;laughing out loud,&quot; modern usage is different, and it is commonly used for irony, as an indicator of second meanings, and as a way to soften statements.

==Analysis==
Silvio Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Scott Molski, in their essay entitled &quot;The Lost Art of Writing&quot;, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, &quot;Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not &#x27;lol&#x27; when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made-up words, and silly acronyms.&quot; Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that smileys and abbreviations are &quot;no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication&quot;.

Linguist John McWhorter stated, &quot;Lol is being used in a particular way. It&#x27;s a marker of empathy. It&#x27;s a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles...&quot; Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as &quot;oh&quot; in &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;uh&quot; when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that &quot;lol&quot; is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation.

Frank Yunker and Stephen Barry, in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting, have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are &quot;often misunderstood&quot; by students and are &quot;difficult to decipher&quot; unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of &quot;ROFL&quot; as not obviously being the abbreviation of &quot;rolling on &quot;the&quot; floor laughing&quot; (emphasis added). Matt Haig describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that &quot;as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing&quot;. Hossein Bidgoli advises that such initialisms should be used &quot;only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning&quot; as they &quot;might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver&quot;, and differences in meaning may lead to misunderstandings in international contexts.

Tim Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of &quot;annotating text with stage directions&quot;. Peter Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between &quot;telling&quot; someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: &quot;The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution &#x27;LOL&#x27; to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.&quot;

David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question &quot;How many people are actually &#x27;laughing out loud&#x27; when they send LOL?&quot;. Louis Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL.

Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that &quot;a user who types &quot;LOL&quot; may well be laughing louder than one who types &quot;lol&quot;&quot;, and opines that &quot;these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse&quot;. Michael Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, &quot;or you won&#x27;t be LOL&quot;.

==Variations on the theme==
===Variants===

* : phonetic spelling of LOL. &quot;LUL&quot; is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on Twitch, which depicts game critic TotalBiscuit laughing.
* : Occasionally used in place of LOL.
* : Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about Internet trolling, &quot;&quot;lulz&quot; means the joy of disrupting another&#x27;s emotional equilibrium.&quot; Can be used as a noune.g. &quot;do it for the lulz.&quot;, shortened into &quot;ftlulz&quot; (to distinguish it from &quot;ftl&quot;&quot;for the loss&quot;). See also LulzSec.
* LOLOLOL...: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of &quot;OL&quot;. In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., &quot;Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud&quot;), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row.
* OMEGALUL and LULW: variants of &quot;LUL&quot; used as a Twitch emote.
* trolololol or trollololol: A blend of troll and LOL iterated, likely meant to mimick Eduard Khil&#x27;s 1976 song Mr. Trololo song, which became an internet meme in 2010. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling.
===Derivations===

* (to) LOL: Used as a verb (&quot;to laugh out loud&quot;) and is meant to be conjugated in the appropriate tense. When the past tense is meant, it is written as &quot;LOL(e)d&quot; or &quot;LOL&#x27;d&quot;.
* (sometimes &quot;lulwut&quot;): + , used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion.
* lawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying &quot;lawl&quot; is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL and is not meant to express laughter.
* Lel or LEL is a &quot;playful or ironic&quot; variation of LOL. It is sometimes thought to be an initialism, standing for &quot;laughing extremely loud&quot; or &quot;laughing extra loud&quot;, but this has been disputed.
* lolcat, an image macro of a cat

===Related===

* *G* or *g*: For &quot;grins&quot;. Like &quot;lulz&quot; it is used in the initialism &quot;J4G&quot; (&quot;just for grins&quot;).
* kek: A term for laughter that originated in online games, possibly either &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;StarCraft&quot;, the latter in which Korean players would type &quot;kekeke&quot; as onomatopoeia for laughter. It later became associated with alt-right politics, in the form of a parody religion surrounding the character Pepe the Frog by analogy with the frog-headed ancient Egyptian god Kek.
* : For &quot;laughing my arse/ass off&quot;. Variants: LMBO (&quot;Laughing my butt off&quot;), LMFAO (&quot;Laughing my fucking ass off&quot;).
* lqtm: For &quot;Laughing quietly to myself&quot;.
* : For &quot;rolling on the floor laughing&quot;. It is often combined with LMAO for added emphasis as (&quot;Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off&quot;) or ROFLMFAO (Rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off).
* : A portmanteau of ROFL and helicopter. A popular glitch in the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when &#x27;SOI&#x27; or &#x27;SOY&#x27; is entered, and the phrase &#x27;My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi...&quot; is often associated with the term as a result.
* : For &quot;pissing myself laughing&quot;.
* : For &quot;I just burst out laughing&quot;. Gaining popularity among Gen Z, initially popularized within the K-pop fandom. Not derived from Korean.
* XD, sometimes stylized as xD, xd, or Xd, is an emoticon commonly used to symbolize extreme laughter or happiness.

=== Commonly used equivalents in other languages ===

Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is &quot;hi hi&quot;. The sound of this in morse (&#x27;di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit&#x27;) is thought to represent chuckling.

* : the Thai variation of LOL. &quot;5&quot; in Thai is pronounced &quot;ha&quot;, three of them being &quot;hahaha&quot; ().
* : Swedish abbreviation of the term , meaning intense laughter.
* : Danish abbreviation of the word &quot;griner&quot;, which means &quot;laughing&quot; in Danish.
* : in Spanish, the letter &quot;j&quot; is pronounced /x/.
* jejeje: in the Philippines is used to represent &quot;hehehe&quot;. &quot;j&quot; in Filipino languages is pronounced as /h/, derived from the Spanish /x/. Its origins can be traced to SMS language. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as Jejemons.
* : Esperanto version, from the initials of , which translates to &quot;lot of laughs&quot; in English.
* : French version, from the initials of &quot;mort de rire&quot; which roughly translated means &quot;died of laughter&quot;, although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet.
* : in Afghanistan &quot;mkm&quot; (being an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;ma khanda mikonom&quot;). This is a Dari phrase that means &quot;I am laughing&quot;.
* : French variant from literally meaning &quot;broken with laughter&quot;
* : in Brazil &quot;rs&quot; (being an abbreviation of &quot;risos&quot;, the plural of &quot;laugh&quot;) is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it (&quot;rsrsrsrsrs&quot;) is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is &quot;kkk&quot; (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter &quot;k&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese sounding similar to the &quot;ca&quot; in &quot;card&quot;, and therefore representing the laugh &quot;cacacacaca&quot; (also similar to the Hebrew version below).
* /: Hebrew version of LOL. The letter ח is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and ה is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter.
* (&quot;kkk&quot; or &quot;kekeke&quot;) and (&quot;hhh&quot;) are usually used to indicate laughter in Korean. &#x27;&#x27;, is a Korean Jamo consonant representing a &quot;k&quot; sound, and &quot; represents an &quot;h&quot; sound. Both &quot; and &quot; represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: &quot;haha&quot; , &quot;hoho.&quot;
* (): in Japanese, the kanji for laugh, is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as (literally &quot;parentheses laugh&quot;) or just . is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple &quot;w&quot; to be chained together. The resulting shape formed from multiple &quot;wwwww&quot; leads to the usage of ( 草 meaning grass, read as ), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass.

<doc id="288385" wikidata="Q472179" url="?curid=288385" title="Morzine">
<text>Morzine (; ), alternatively known as Morzine-Avoriaz (), is an alpine commune on the Swiss border in the Haute-Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Southeastern France.

It is located in the French-Swiss Chablais historical area, south-southeast of Évian-les-Bains and just west of Champéry in Valais. As of 2020, it had a population of 2,690. The town of Morzine is situated in the French Alps&#x27; Vallée d&#x27;Aulps (Aulps Valley), which stretches from Morzine to La Vernaz in the northwest.
A traditional market town in the heart of the Portes du Soleil, Morzine is dominated by chalets spread across a river gorge, bordered by partially wooded slopes allowing skiing in poor weather conditions. Situated at an altitude of about 1,000 m, it is one of the most northerly of the French Alpine resorts, weatherwise benefiting from the Mont Blanc microclimate. The locality enjoys panoramic mountain views and modern ski facilities, as well as hotels and restaurants in the town itself. The ski resort of Avoriaz is located on the territory of the commune.

==History==
In 1181, Morzine (, or &quot;border area&quot;) was a grange of Aulps Abbey, a Cistercian monastery 7 km away. In the Middle Ages, granges were agricultural centres from which the monks exploited their landscape and co-ordinated farming and industrial work. The grange was fundamental to the Cistercians&#x27; successful expansion and management of their mountain land. The granges supplied the monastery&#x27;s food, clothing, utensils and building materials. The granges were manned by lay-brothers, who cultivated the lands and reared livestock.

From the 18th to the early 20th century, the exploitation of slate quarries was an important economic activity of Morzine, before winter tourism took over around in 1930. Between 1857 and 1870, the commune received national attention for an unusually high number of women claiming to be possessed. In 2015 only a few quarries were still being exploited.

==Climate==
Morzine has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) closely bordering on a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;).
==Population==
==Summer sports==
Morzine also hosts summer activities such as mountain biking, golfing, walking and caving. The resort also boasts an Olympic sized swimming pool.

===Mountain biking===

Local trails are generally single track and with varying levels of difficulty available from steep, rooty and technical to fast open downhill tracks. There is also a small amount of Northshore available in the Chatel Bike Park area.

Morzine is also within easy reach of other resorts including Avoriaz, Morgins, Châtel and Les Gets. The resorts of Pila, Verbier and Les Arcs lie within easy reach by car thus giving access to several places to ride.

A single lift pass can be purchased to cover the whole of the Portes du Soleil area and costs much less than during the winter months.

===Tour de France===

Morzine has hosted Tour de France stage finishes on several occasions, thanks in part to the proximity of the notoriously steep Col de Joux-Plane climb.

Morzine was the finale of the first mountain stage in the 2003 Tour de France. Stage seven&#x27;s yellow jersey (for the leader of the general classification) and polka dot jersey (for the leader of the mountains classification) were awarded to Richard Virenque of France&#x27;s Quick-Step–Davitamon team. Stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France ended in Morzine, where Floyd Landis did the impossible and gutted out one of the most memorable stage wins in Tour history during the height of the 1992–2012 doping-era. The town was also the starting point for Stage 18. In the 2010 Tour de France Morzine was the finishing location for stage 8.

Morzine again featured in the 2016 Tour de France as the finish for stage 20 – Megève to Morzine.

On the 11 and 12 July 2022, the tour visited Morzine again, when it hosted the second rest day of the tour and the start of stage 10.

===Football===

Morzine is home to the annual French Mountain Villages Football Tournament (Tournoi des Montagnes) where the best junior teams compete for a much coveted trophy each June.

==Winter sports==

===Ice hockey===
The town is home to the Morzine-Avoriaz Penguins, an ice hockey team which reached the Ligue Magnus final in 2006, but nowadays plays in the country&#x27;s minor leagues.

===Skiing and snowboarding===
The intermediate terrain makes the area well suited to beginners and less-seasoned skiers and snowboarders, which has led to the resort being especially popular with families. However more challenging slopes can be found at nearby Avoriaz.

Morzine is closely linked to its neighbours Avoriaz and Les Gets in that they function as linked skiing centres during the winter season. The two resorts are included in the Portes du Soleil ski area, which includes both French and Swiss villages.

==Other events==
Since 2013, the town has hosted the Morzine Harley Days, a major motorcycle and music rally sponsored by Harley-Davidson and organized by its Harley Owners Group. The event reportedly drew 20,000 vehicles and 60,000 fans in 2019.

==Local transport==
The closest airport to Morzine is Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Switzerland. Although there is no rail service directly to Morzine the two closest stations are at Thonon-les-Bains and Cluses, and from these stations local buses are available to the town.

<doc id="288394" wikidata="Q1411891" url="?curid=288394" title="Webby Awards">
<text>The Webby Awards (colloquially referred to as the Webbys) are awards for excellence on the Internet presented annually by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, a judging body composed of over three thousand industry experts and technology innovators. Categories include websites, advertising and media, online film and video, mobile sites and apps, and social.

Two winners are selected in each category, one by members of The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and one by the public who cast their votes during Webby People&#x27;s Voice voting. Each winner presents a five-word acceptance speech, a trademark of the annual awards show.

In its early years, the award was hailed as the &quot;Internet’s highest honor&quot; and was associated with the phrase &quot;The Oscars of the Internet.&quot; 

== History ==
In its early years, the organization was one of several vying to be the premiere internet awards show. Both shows would compare themselves to the Oscars, as did media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; to Canada&#x27;s &quot;Globe &amp; Mail&quot;.

The winners of the First Annual Webby Awards in 1995 were presented by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, writers for Columbia Pictures. It was held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The televised Webby Awards were sponsored by the Academy of Web Design and Cool Site of the Day. The first Webby Awards were produced by Kay Dangaard at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel as a nod to the first site of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars). That first year, they were called &quot;Webbie&quot; Awards. The first &quot;Site of the Year&quot; winner was the pioneer webisodic serial The Spot.

The modern Webby Awards were co-founded by Tiffany Shlain, a filmmaker, when she was hired by &quot;The Web Magazine&quot; to re-establish them, and were first held in San Francisco in 1997. They quickly became known for its requirement that winners give their acceptance speeches in five words. After this, the awards became more successful than the magazine and IDG closed the publication. Shlain and co-founder Maya Draisin Farrah continued to run The Webby Awards until 2004.

The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, which selects the winners of The Webby Awards, was established in 1998 by co-founders Tiffany Shlain, Spencer Ante and Maya Draisin. Members of the Academy include Kevin Spacey, Grimes, Questlove, Internet inventor Vint Cerf, Instagram’s Head of Fashion Partnerships Eva Chen, comedian Jimmy Kimmel, Twitter founder Biz Stone, Vice Media co-founder and CEO Shane Smith, Tumblr’s David Karp, Director of Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society Susan P. Crawford, Refinery29’s Executive Creative Director Piera Gelardi, and CEO and co-founder of Gimlet Media Alex Blumberg.

The Webby Awards is owned and operated by the Webby Media Group, a division of Recognition Media, which also owns and produces the Lovie Awards in Europe and Netted by the Webbys, a daily email publication launched in 2009. David-Michel Davies, CEO of Webby Media Group, current Executive Director of the Webby Awards and co-founder of Internet Week New York, was named Executive Director of the Webby Awards in 2005.

In 2009, the 13th Annual Webby Awards received nearly 10,000 entries from all 50 US states and over 60 countries. That same year, more than 500,000 votes were cast in The Webby People&#x27;s Voice Awards. In 2012, the 16th Annual Webby awards received 1.5 million votes from more than 200 countries for the People&#x27;s Voice awards. In 2015, the 19th Annual Webby Awards received nearly 13,000 entries from all 50 U.S. states and over 60 countries worldwide.

== Nomination process ==
The 2000 awards began the transition to nominee submissions. Previously, nominees had been selected by an internal committee.

As early as 2017, organizations wanting to nominate themselves were charged $395 for a single entry. An &quot;ad campaign entry&quot; would cost $595. By 2024, those fees had risen to $495 and $675, respectively.

Executive Academy Members with category-specific expertise evaluate the shortlisted entries based on the appropriate Website, Advertising &amp; Media, Online Film &amp; Video, Mobile Sites &amp; Apps, and Social category criteria, and cast ballots to determine Webby Honorees, Nominees and Webby Winners. Deloitte provides vote tabulation consulting for the Webby Awards.

In addition to the award given in each category by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, another winner is selected in each category as determined by the general public during People&#x27;s Voice voting. Winners of both the Academy-selected and People&#x27;s Voice-selected awards are invited to the Webbys.

== Awards granted ==

The Webby Awards are presented in over a hundred categories among all four types of entries. A website can be entered in multiple categories and receive multiple awards. In each category, two awards are handed out: a Webby Award selected by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and a People&#x27;s Voice Award selected by the general public.

== Ceremony ==
Between 2005 and 2019, the Webby Awards were presented in New York City. Many of the ceremony hosts are comedians and comedic actors. Comedian Rob Corddry hosted the ceremony from 2005 to 2007. Seth Meyers of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted in 2008 and 2009, B.J. Novak of the sitcom &quot;The Office&quot; in 2010, and Lisa Kudrow in 2011. Comedian, actor, and writer Patton Oswalt hosted from 2012 to 2014. Comedian Hannibal Buress hosted in 2015.

The Webbys are famous for limiting recipients to five-word speeches, which are often humorous, although some exceed the limit. In 2005 when accepting his Lifetime Achievement Award, former Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s speech was &quot;Please don&#x27;t recount this vote.&quot; He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to state, &quot;We all invented the Internet.&quot; In 2013, the creator of the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Steve Wilhite, accepted his Webby and delivered his now famous five-word speech, &quot;It&#x27;s pronounced &#x27;Jif&#x27; not &#x27;Gif&#x27;.&quot;

== Criticism ==

The Webbys have been criticized for their pay-to-enter and pay-to-attend policy (winners and nominees also have to pay to attend the award ceremony), and thus for not taking most websites into consideration before distributing their awards. Gawker, its Valleywag column, and others, have called the awards a scam, with Valleywag saying, &quot;...somewhere along the way, the organizers figured out that this goofy charade could be milked for profit.&quot;

In response, Webby Awards executive director David-Michel Davies told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that entry fees “provide the best and most sustainable model for ensuring that our judging process remains consistent and rigorous and is not dependent on things like sponsorships that can fluctuate from year to year.”

==Anthem Awards==

In 2021, the Webby organization started a new line of awards, the Anthem Awards, to honor the purpose and mission-driven work of people, companies and organizations worldwide. The finalists and winners are selected by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.

<text>The &quot;Schedules&quot; of the Niue Constitution Act 1974 form the Constitution of Niue. It stipulates the make-up of the executive branch of the government, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. The Niue Constitution Act 1974 is the supreme law of Niue; any other Niue law that is inconsistent with the Niue Constitution Act 1974 will be deemed to be invalid.

Its granting by the New Zealand Parliament in 1974 is celebrated yearly as Niue&#x27;s independence on &quot;Constitution Day&quot; on 19 October. The road towards self-government for Niue started with the UN Decolonisation Committee putting pressure on New Zealand for Niue to decide what form of status Niue wanted. The people of Niue voted in 1974 choosing the self-government option as the best direction for Niue. The Niue Constitution is the legal doctrine that put the wishes of the Niue people for self-government into practice. Self-government allows for Niueans to lead and take charge of their own affairs; this has reduced the number of New Zealand expats working in key Government positions from around 20 in 1974 to none at the moment.

Amendments require a two-thirds majority vote in favour in the second and third readings of the respective constitutional amendment bills in the Assembly, followed by approval by a referendum; amendments to articles 1 (executive authority being vested in the Crown), 35(1)(b)(i) (requirements to amend the constitution) and 69 (appointments to Niue Public Service) require two-thirds of the valid vote in favour in the referendum to be approved, while amendments to other articles require only a majority of the valid vote in favour.

<doc id="288396" wikidata="Q566889" url="?curid=288396" title="Order (business)">
<text>In business or commerce, an order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer&#x27;s point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a purchase order. From a seller&#x27;s point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a sales order. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a contract between the buyer and seller.

Within an organization, it may be a work order for manufacturing, a preventive maintenance order, or an order to make repairs to a facility.

In many businesses, orders are used to collect and report costs and revenues according to well-defined purposes. Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.

==Spoken orders==
Businesses such as retail stores, restaurants and filling stations conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer&#x27;s actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a take-out or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one&#x27;s tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an &quot;implied in fact contract&quot;.

==Steps in commercial orders==
In commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.

There are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of &quot;in writing&quot; sometimes applies.

The main concern for commercial orders is that there must be agreement (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a request for quotation, request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.

Once an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.

==Uniform Commercial Code==
In the US, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code. Section 2-106 describes the difference between a present sale (recorded as a sales order) and a sale (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).

(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires &quot;contract&quot; and &quot;agreement&quot; are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. &quot;Contract for sale&quot; includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A &quot;sale&quot; consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401). A &quot;present sale&quot; means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.

==Aggregate level of orders==
In their &quot;Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services&quot;, the US Census Bureau publishes estimates of US retail and food services sales. These &quot;sales&quot; are orders that have been filled; payment has been made or is an account receivable.
In their &quot;Preliminary Report on Manufacturers&#x27; Shipments, Inventories and Orders&quot;, the US Census Bureau publishes statistics for &quot;new orders&quot;, shipments, &quot;unfilled orders&quot; and inventories for manufactured durable goods. This gives an indication whether trade is increasing or decreasing for manufactured durable goods in the US.

<doc id="288400" wikidata="Q1773840" url="?curid=288400" title="Provenance">
<text>Provenance () is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object. The term was originally mostly used in relation to works of art, but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archival science, economy, computing, and scientific inquiry in general.

The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping authenticate objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of documentation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term &quot;chain of custody&quot;.

For museums and the art trade, in addition to helping establish the authorship and authenticity of an object, provenance has become increasingly important in helping establish the moral and legal validity of a chain of custody, given the increasing amount of looted art. These issues first became a major concern regarding works that had changed hands in Nazi-controlled areas in Europe before and during World War II. Many museums began compiling pro-active registers of such works and their history. Recently the same concerns have come to prominence for works of African art, often exported illegally, and antiquities from many parts of the world, but currently especially in Iraq, and then Syria.

In archaeology and paleontology, the derived term provenience is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found. &quot;Provenance&quot; covers an object&#x27;s complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of fine art, antiques and antiquities is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis.

Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period. Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, stolen or looted art. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in the Arnolfini portrait.

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market. This is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert certification can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. Jacques van Meegeren forged the work of his father Han van Meegeren, who had forged the work of Vermeer. Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries, stating that a work was created by his father.

John Drewe was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive, but false provenance. Because of this, galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.

In the context of discussions about the restitution of cultural objects in museum collections of colonial origin, the AfricaMuseum in Belgium started to publicly present information about such objects in its permanent exhibition in 2021.

===Researching the provenance of paintings===

The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist&#x27;s studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a bibliography of when it has been discussed, or illustrated in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location are known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc. The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting.

The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; the provenance of the painting &quot;Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil&quot; was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a &quot;cartellino&quot;, a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; representation of an inscribed label, added to the front of a painting. However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings.
* The Witt Library houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold.
* The Heinz Library at the National Portrait Gallery, London maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits.
* The National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum has a collection of UK sales catalogues.
* The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735. This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories. 
* The Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles has a &quot;Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance&quot; (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.
* The Frick Art Reference Library in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.
* The Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a stately home, it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the Lumley inventory. The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a listing all the artist&#x27;s known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of is available at the International Foundation for Art Research.

Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the &quot;Rice&quot; portrait of Jane Austen concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.

==Archives==

Provenance – also known as custodial history – is a core concept within archival science and archival processing. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items&#x27; subsequent chain of custody. The principle of provenance, also termed the principle of &quot;archival integrity&quot;, and a major strand in the broader principle of &quot;respect des fonds&quot;, stipulates that records originating from a common source, or fonds, should be kept together – where practicable, physically, but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in finding aids.

Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain, because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody, will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the &quot;Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives&quot; by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898, often referred to as the &quot;Dutch Manual&quot;.

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.

&quot;Provenance&quot; is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include the study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves, for instance looking at inscriptions, marginalia, bookplates, book rhymes, and bindings, and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.

==Pianos==
Provenance for pianos is authenticated before a piano is inducted into a museum, sold at an auction, or appraised for an estate or legal action, when it has extraordinary value in connection to a composer, performer, event or location that has become famous. For example, the piano that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart used during the final 10 years of his life, is on display in the Mozarteum Museum in Salzberg, one of many historical pianos in museums around the world. The 300,000th Steinway piano that was presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt by Theodore Steinway, on behalf of the Steinway family is on display in the White House. It is one of many pianos with a provenance that have extraordinary value because of art, sculpture or design incorporated into the cabinet. It has legs carved into golden eagles and figures painted on the body of the piano.

For a piano, provenance can be established by starting with the authentication of the brand of manufacture and serial number, which will usually identify age. Then bills of sale, tuning records, bills of lading, concert programs that identify a piano by serial number, letters, famous signatures inside or on the outside of a piano, statements under oath in a court of law and photographs can all help authenticate a piano&#x27;s provenance.

===Piano Provenance and Valuation===

Pianos can sell for millions of dollars, when the provenance is significant enough to increase its value well beyond what it would be worth as a musical instrument alone.

When decisions need to be made in a court of law for a bankruptcy, or before a piano goes up for auction, or when an educational institution needs to establish a value for a deed of trust being established with the gift of a piano, then experts are usually hired to authenticate the piano&#x27;s provenance.

Piano provenance has emerged as a field of study with experts having college degrees in some specialty connected to the piano or to art combined with professional training and experience in the field.

Most experts belong to some form of association. For example, Karen Earle Lile niece of Tony Terran and Kendall Ross Bean, members of the Preservations Artisans Guild, were chosen by Mercersburg Academy to research and authenticate the provenance of the Lennon-Ono-Green-Warhol piano before it was put up for sale to fund a Deed of Trust by the Shaool Family to Mercersburg Academy for future student scholarships. Because this piano was part of a famous lawsuit in 2000 and had extensive coverage as the &quot;Lost Lennon Piano&quot;, when provenance research done by Lile was revealed by the Alex Cooper Auctioneers to the public, the provenance became the subject of dozens of newspapers and magazines that picked up the story.

In the case of sculpture or art that are incorporated into the piano&#x27;s cabinet, experts might be come from the field of art valuation and belong to an appraiser society such as the American Society of Appraisers or the International Society of Appraisers.

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of improving with age, the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of wine fraud. A documented history of wine cellar conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history of the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===

Archaeology and anthropology researchers use provenience to refer to the exact location or find spot of an artifact, a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site, whereas &quot;provenance&quot; covers an object&#x27;s complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term &quot;provenience&quot; appeared in the 1880s, about a century after &quot;provenance&quot;. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a synonymous variant spelling of &quot;provenance&quot;, especially in American English.

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience, where it was found, and a provenance, where it has been since it was found. A summary of the distinction is that &quot;provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand.&quot; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact&#x27;s &quot;birthplace&quot;, while provenance is its &quot;résumé&quot;. This can be imprecise. Many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region, but were used and finally deposited in another.

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:
In this context, the &quot;provenance&quot; can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation, as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or cultural anthropology may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered &quot;in situ&quot;, archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found, e.g. due to stratigraphic layers being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site.

Artifacts can be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Many source nations have passed legislation forbidding the domestic trade in cultural heritage. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance and legal status of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In paleontology and paleoanthropology, it is recognized that fossils can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently &quot;in-situ&quot;, in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different outcrops. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the &quot;provenience&quot; and &quot;provenance&quot; distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website, primarily aimed at young students, of the American Museum of Natural History treats the terms as synonymous, while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of &quot;provenience&quot; in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find&#x27;s provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

Scientific research is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow reproducibility. Scientific workflow systems assist scientists and programmers with tracking their data through all transformations, analyses, and interpretations. Data sets are reliable when the processes used to create them are reproducible and analyzable for defects. Security researchers are interested in data provenance because it can analyze suspicious data and make large opaque systems transparent.

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are National Science Foundation Datanet projects, DataONE and Data Conservancy, as well as the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Some international academic consortia, such as the Research Data Alliance, have specific groups to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group.

===Computer science===
Within computer science, informatics uses the term &quot;provenance&quot; to mean the lineage of data, as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW) and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP). Semantic web standards bodies, including the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the Proof Markup Language and the Open Provenance Model.

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provenance Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at &quot;establishing inter-operability of systems&quot; through information exchange agreements. Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM Vocabulary and the PROV Ontology make extensive use of metadata models such as Dublin Core and Semantic Web technologies such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM&#x27;s successor.

There are several maintained and open-source provenance capture implementation at the operating system level such as CamFlow, Progger for Linux and MS Windows, and SPADE for Linux, MS Windows, and MacOS. Operating system level provenance have gained interest in the security community notably to develop novel intrusion detection techniques. Other implementations exist for specific programming and scripting languages, such as RDataTracker for R, and NoWorkflow for Python.

===Petrology===
In the geologic use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in sedimentary rocks. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the geographic location of a parent plant, from which seeds were collected. In the context of ecological restoration, seed provenancing refers to a seed-sourcing strategy that focuses on the geographic location of seed sources, as each provenance can describe the genetic material from that location. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the adaptationist program – a view that populations are universally locally adapted. It is maintained that local seed is best adapted to local conditions, and that outbreeding depression will be avoided. Evolutionary biologists suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.
# Background population maladaptation can be driven by natural processes.
# Human actions of habitat fragmentation drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.
# Natural selection is changing rapidly due to climate change. and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt; 500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal genetic variation among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for climate change adaptation.

==Computers and law==
The term &quot;provenance&quot; is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. Chain of custody is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its licensing terms. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources.

Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU GDPR.

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as read only. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally deleting the file.

<doc id="288407" wikidata="Q631855" url="?curid=288407" title="Henry IV, Part 1">
<text>Henry IV, Part 1 (often written as 1 Henry IV) is a history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written no later than 1597. The play dramatises part of the reign of King Henry IV of England, beginning with the battle at Homildon Hill late in 1402, and ending with King Henry&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Shrewsbury in mid-1403. In parallel to the political conflict between King Henry and a rebellious faction of nobles, the play depicts the escapades of King Henry&#x27;s son, Prince Hal (the future King Henry V), and his eventual return to court and favour.

&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; is the first of Shakespeare&#x27;s two plays that deal with the reign of Henry IV (the other being &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;), and the second play in the Henriad, a modern designation for the tetralogy of plays that deal with the successive reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V. From its first performance on, it has been an extremely popular work both with the public and critics.

==Synopsis==
The play follows three groups of characters who initially interact only indirectly. These groups grow closer as the play progresses, coming together at the climax during the Battle of Shrewsbury. The first is centred around King Henry IV and his immediate council, who contrive to suppress a growing rebellion. The second is the group of rebel lords, led by Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, and including his brother, the Earl of Northumberland, and energetic nephew, Harry Percy (&quot;Hotspur&quot;). The Scottish Earl of Douglas, the Welshman Owen Glendower, and Edmund Mortimer also join. The third group, the comic centre of the play, consists of the young Prince Hal (King Henry&#x27;s eldest son) and his companions, Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto. 

From the play&#x27;s outset, Henry IV&#x27;s reign is beset by problems: His personal disquiet at having usurped the throne from Richard II would be solved by a crusade to the Holy Land, but trouble on his borders with Scotland and Wales make such an act impossible. Moreover, he is increasingly at odds with the Percy family, who helped him to his throne, and with Edmund Mortimer, Richard II&#x27;s chosen heir.
King Henry is also troubled by the behaviour of his eldest son and heir, Hal (the future Henry V). Hal spends little time in the royal court, preferring instead to drink in taverns with lowborn and dishonourable companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and jeopardises his legitimacy as heir; early in the play, King Henry laments that he can &quot;See riot and dishonour stain the brow of young Harry.&quot; Hal&#x27;s chief friend is Sir John Falstaff, a cowardly, drunken, but quick-witted knight whose charisma and zest for life captivate the Prince.

In the first scene, the political action of the play is set in motion. King Henry and Hotspur fall out after a disagreement over the treatment of hostages: Hotspur withholds, against the King&#x27;s orders, hostages taken in recent action against the Scots at the Battle of Homildon Hill, while King Henry refuses to pay Owen Glendower (a Welsh rebel) the ransom for Hotspur&#x27;s brother-in-law, Edmund Mortimer. This disagreement, and the King&#x27;s harsh treatment of the House of Percy generally, drives them to ally with Welsh and Scot rebels, resolving to depose &quot;this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.&quot;

Meanwhile, Hal meets with Falstaff and his associates at the Boar&#x27;s Head Tavern. Falstaff and Hal are close, but Hal enjoys insulting Falstaff, and, in a soliloquy, makes it clear that he does not plan to continue in his present lifestyle forever: Hal aims to re-assume his high place in court by proving himself to his father. Indeed, Hal reasons that by suddenly changing his ways he will be even more popular among the nobility than if he had behaved conventionally all his life. Nevertheless, he is happy to carry out a plot against Falstaff: after performing a highway robbery, Hal and Poins will slip away from Falstaff, disguise themselves, and rob Falstaff, purely for the fun of hearing the older man lie about it later, after which Hal will return the stolen money. The plot is carried out successfully.

As the revolt of Mortimer and the House of Percy grows, the Prince makes up with his father and is given the command of an army. He vows to fight and kill the rebel Hotspur, and orders Falstaff to recruit and lead a group of foot soldiers. Falstaff uses the appointment to enrich himself by taking bribes from those who do not want to be pressed into service, and, in the end, recruits only the very poor, whose wages he withholds.

All the parties meet at the Battle of Shrewsbury, a crucial moment for all involved: if the rebels are not defeated outright, they will gain a considerable advantage; other forces (under Northumberland, Glendower, Mortimer, and the Archbishop of York) can be called upon in the event of a stalemate or a victory for the rebels. Though Henry outnumbers the rebels, Hotspur, wild and skilled in battle, leads the opposing army personally. As the battle drags on, the king is hunted by Douglas. Prince Hal and Hotspur duel, and, in an important moment of noble virtue for the young prince, Hal prevails, killing Hotspur in single combat.

Left on his own during Hal&#x27;s battle with Hotspur, Falstaff dishonourably feigns death to avoid an attack by Douglas. After Hal leaves Hotspur&#x27;s body on the field, Falstaff revives in a mock miracle. Seeing he is alone, he stabs Hotspur&#x27;s corpse in the thigh and claims credit for the kill. Hal allows Falstaff to claim the honour of the kill. Soon after Hal&#x27;s generous gesture, Falstaff states that he wants to amend his life and begin &quot;to live cleanly as a nobleman should do&quot;.

The play ends at Shrewsbury, after the battle. The loss of Hotspur and the fight has dealt a serious blow to the rebel cause. King Henry is pleased with the outcome, not least because it gives him a chance to execute Thomas Percy, the Earl of Worcester, one of his chief enemies (though previously one of his greatest friends). Meanwhile, Hal demonstrates his mercy by ordering Douglas—now a prisoner of war—to be released without ransom. However, the rebellion continues, now led by the Archbishop of York and the Earl of Northumberland. This inconclusive ending sets the stage for &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;.

==Sources==
Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, as for most of his chronicle histories, was the second edition (1587) of Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, which in turn drew on Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York&quot;. Scholars have also assumed that Shakespeare was familiar with Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poem on the civil wars. Another source for this (and the following Henry plays) is the anonymous &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;.

==Date and text==

&quot;1 Henry IV&quot; was almost certainly in performance by 1597, given the wealth of allusions and references to the Falstaff character. The earliest recorded performance occurred on the afternoon of 6 March 1600, when the play was acted at court before the Flemish Ambassador. Other court performances followed in 1612 and 1625.

The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 25 Feb. 1598 and first printed in quarto later that year by stationer Andrew Wise. The play was Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular printed text: new editions appeared in 1599, 1604, 1608, 1613, 1622, 1632, 1639, and 1692.

===The Dering Manuscript===

The Dering Manuscript, the earliest extant manuscript text of any Shakespeare play, provides a single-play version of both Part 1 and Part 2 of &quot;Henry IV.&quot; The consensus of Shakespeare scholars is that the Dering Manuscript represents a redaction prepared around 1623, perhaps for family or amateur theatrics, by Edward Dering (1598–1644), of Surrenden Manor, Pluckley, Kent, where the manuscript was discovered. A few dissenters have argued that the Dering MS. may indicate that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; was originally a single play, which the poet later expanded into two parts to capitalise on the popularity of the Sir John Falstaff character. The Dering MS. is part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.

==Criticism and analysis==

===Themes and interpretations===
At its first publication in 1597 or 1598, the play was titled The History of Henrie the Fourth, and its title page advertised only the presence of Henry Percy and the comic Sir John Falstaff; Prince Hal was not mentioned. Indeed, throughout most of the play&#x27;s performance history, Hal has been staged as a secondary figure, and popular actors, beginning with James Quin and David Garrick, often preferred to play Hotspur. It was only in the twentieth century that readers and performers began to see the central interest as the coming-of-age story of Hal, who is now seen as the starring role.

In the &quot;coming-of-age&quot; interpretation, Hal&#x27;s acquaintance with Falstaff and the tavern lowlife humanises him and provides him with a more complete view of life. At the outset, Prince Hal seems to pale in comparison with the fiery Henry Percy, the young noble lord of the North (whom Shakespeare portrays as considerably younger than he was in history in order to provide a foil for Hal). Many readers interpret the history as a tale of Prince Hal growing up, evolving into King Henry V, in what is a tale of the prodigal son adapted to the politics of medieval England. The low proportion of scenes featuring the title character, the king, has also been noted, with some authors suggesting that the play contrasts the authority of Henry IV, and his struggle to stay in control of the situation, with the chaotic forces of the rebels and Falstaff.

==== Honor and Falstaff&#x27;s Catechism ====
A major theme in Henry IV Part 1 is the expression of honour and the intersection and contrasts between honour and war. In Act 5 scene 1, Falstaff delivers a soliloquy, scholastically referred to as Falstaff&#x27;s Catechism, which asserts his pragmatic and matter-of-fact perspective on war. The soliloquy reads:’Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay Him before His day. What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me? Well, ’tis no matter. Honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery, then? No. What is honor? A word. What is in that word “honor”? What is that “honor”? Air. A trim reckoning. Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No. ’Tis insensible, then? Yea, to the dead. But will ⌜it⌝ not live with the living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore, I’ll none of it. Honor is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism. (5.1.128-142)In this soliloquy, Falstaff dismisses honour as an abstract concept that has no tangible benefits. His repetition of the word &quot;honor&quot; and the subsequent reduction of it to &quot;air&quot; underscores his cynical perspective, suggesting that honour is an empty, meaningless concept that holds no practical value. He questions whether honour can &quot;set to a leg&quot; or &quot;an arm,&quot; implying that honour cannot heal wounds or restore life. This practical viewpoint starkly contrasts with the romanticised notion of honour as a noble pursuit worth dying or seriously injuring oneself for. Falstaff&#x27;s rhetorical questions serve to undermine the glorification of honour in martial society, pointing out its inability to provide any real, physical benefit to those who seek it.

The passage contrasts the other views expressed in the play, and is also unique for its deviation from Falstaff&#x27;s character, giving him a moment of philosophy distinct from his usual dismissive prose. Shakespeare’s intent with the soliloquy has been debated between academics. While some believe that the passage serves to juxtapose Falstaff’s pragmatic philosophy with the romantic, valour driven views of the rest of the cast, others assert that Falstaff’s catechism highlights his cowardice and can be played comedically.

Professor Clifford Davidson drew parallels between Philippe de Mornay’s 1582 treatise De la verité de la religion chrestienne, which would have already been translated into English at the time of writing Henry IV Part 1:They that attaine to honor, are in continuali torment, spightfull or spighted, doing mischiefe, or receiving mischiefe, over-mated, or over-mating. What is this but many evils for one, and a multiplying of miseries without number, for the obtainment of one silly shadow of felicity? We will leave the residue to declamers: what are the fruits of these hellish torments, what are they? Forsooth Honor, Reputation, and Power or Authority. What is all this but winde , which cannot fill us, nor scarcely puffe us up? I shall be saluted as I goe abroad, I shall sit highest at meetings. In having these things, what have I, which a wicked man may not rather have than I? And if it be a good thing, how is it given to evill men?De Moray’s passage and Falstaff’s catechism use similar language, both reducing honour to “air” and following a catechetical structure. As de Moray’s passage highlights the dangers of pursuing honour for reputational benefits rather than out of virtue, so Shakespeare uses Falstaff to critique the ill-intentioned pursuit of honour in early modern England. Davidson writes, “Who will pursue the ‘shadow’ of reputation rather than the ‘body’ of virtue?” Falstaff seemingly rejects both the “body” and the “shadow,” denouncing both the virtue of honour and the praise that comes with it. However, at the end of the play, Falstaff accepts praise for Hotspur’s death, suggesting that his wisdom may in fact be a facade for pure cowardice.

In the broader context of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1,&quot; Falstaff&#x27;s soliloquy offers a counterpoint to the play&#x27;s exploration of heroism and honour. His catechism challenges the audience to reconsider the true value of honour and to question the societal pressure to uphold it. Through his catechism, Falstaff juxtaposes both Hotspur’s misguided and vengeful pursuit of honour and Hal’s virtue.

===Oldcastle controversy===

&quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; caused controversy on its first performances in 1597, because the comic character now known as &quot;Falstaff&quot; was originally named &quot;Oldcastle&quot; and was based on John Oldcastle, a famous proto-Protestant martyr with powerful living descendants in England.

Although the character is called Falstaff in all surviving texts of the play, there is abundant external and internal evidence that he was originally called Oldcastle. The change of names is mentioned in seventeenth-century works by Richard James (&quot;Epistle to Sir Harry Bourchier&quot;, ) and Thomas Fuller (&quot;Worthies of England&quot;, 1662). It is also indicated in detail in the early texts of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In the quarto text of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (1600), one of Falstaff&#x27;s speech prefixes in Act I, Scene ii is mistakenly left uncorrected, &quot;Old.&quot; instead of &quot;Falst.&quot; In III, ii, 25-6 of the same play, Falstaff is said to have been a &quot;page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk&quot;—a statement that is true of the historical Oldcastle. In &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, I, ii, 42, Prince Hal calls Falstaff &quot;my old lad of the castle&quot;. An iambic pentameter verse line in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; is irregular when using the name &quot;Falstaff&quot;, but regular with &quot;Oldcastle&quot;. Finally, there is the explicit disclaimer at the close of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; that discriminates between the two figures: &quot;for Oldcastle died [a] martyr, and this is not the man&quot; (Epilogue, 29–32).

There is evidence that Falstaff was originally called Oldcastle in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; as well, the only play (outside of the two parts &quot;Henry IV&quot;) that contains the character. When the First Folio and quarto texts of that play are compared, it appears that the joke in V.v.85–90 is that Oldcastle/Falstaff incriminates himself by calling out the first letter of his name, &quot;O, O, O!,&quot; when his fingertips are singed with candles—which of course works for &quot;Oldcastle&quot; but not &quot;Falstaff.&quot; There is also the &quot;castle&quot; reference in IV.v.6 of the same play.

The name change and the Epilogue disclaimer were required, it is generally thought, because of political pressure: the historical Oldcastle was not only a Protestant martyr but a nobleman with powerful living descendants in Elizabethan England. These were the Lords Cobham: William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (died 6 March 1597), Warden of the Cinque Ports (1558–97), Knight of the Order of the Garter (1584), and member of the Privy Council (1586–97); his son Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, Warden of the Cinque Ports and Knight of the Order of the Garter; and Frances Brooke, the 10th Baron&#x27;s wife, and 11th Baron&#x27;s mother, a close personal favourite of Queen Elizabeth I.

The elder Lord Cobham is known to have had a strongly negative impact on the lives of Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the theatre. The company of actors formed by Shakespeare (the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men) in 1594 enjoyed the patronage of Henry Carey, first Lord Hunsdon, then serving as Lord Chamberlain. When Carey died on 22 July 1596, the post of Lord Chamberlain was given to William Brooke, Lord Cobham, who withdrew what official protection they had enjoyed. The players were left to the care of the local officials of the City of London, who had long wanted to drive the companies of actors out of the city. Thomas Nashe, in a contemporary letter, complained that the actors were &quot;piteously persecuted by the Lord Mayor and the aldermen&quot; during this period. The interval did not last; when Cobham died less than a year later, the post of Lord Chamberlain went to Henry Carey&#x27;s son George, 2nd baron Hunsdon, and the actors regained their previous patronage.

The name was changed to &quot;Falstaff&quot;, based on Sir John Fastolf, a historical person with a reputation for cowardice at the Battle of Patay, whom Shakespeare had previously represented in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. Fastolf had died without descendants, making him safe for a playwright&#x27;s use.

Shortly afterward, a team of playwrights wrote a two-part play entitled &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;, which presents a heroic dramatisation of Oldcastle&#x27;s life and was published in 1600.

In 1986, the Oxford Shakespeare edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s works rendered the character&#x27;s name as Oldcastle, rather than Falstaff, in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (although not, confusingly, in &quot;Part 2&quot;), as a consequence of the editors&#x27; aim to present the plays as they would have appeared during their original performances. No other published editions have followed suit.
==Adaptations==
There have been three BBC television films of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1.&quot; In the 1960 mini-series &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, Tom Fleming starred as Henry IV, with Robert Hardy as Prince Hal, Frank Pettingell as Falstaff, and Sean Connery as Hotspur. The 1979 BBC Television Shakespeare version starred Jon Finch as Henry IV, David Gwillim as Prince Hal, Anthony Quayle as Falstaff, and Tim Pigott-Smith as Hotspur. In the 2012 series &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; was directed by Richard Eyre and starred Jeremy Irons as Henry IV, Tom Hiddleston as Prince Hal, Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff and Joe Armstrong as Hotspur.

Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965) compiles the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays into a single, condensed storyline, while adding a handful of scenes from &quot;Henry V&quot; and dialogue from &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. The film stars Welles himself as Falstaff, John Gielgud as King Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal, Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet and Norman Rodway as Hotspur.

BBC Television&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Henry IV&quot; also combines the two Parts into one adaptation. Ronald Pickup played the King; David Calder, Falstaff; Jonathan Firth, Hal; and Rufus Sewell, Hotspur.

Adapted scenes in flashback from &quot;Henry IV&quot; are included in the 1989 film version of &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989) with Robbie Coltrane portraying Sir John Falstaff and Kenneth Branagh playing the young Prince Hal.

Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; is loosely based on Part 1 of &quot;Henry IV&quot;, as well as &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

The one-man hip-hop musical &quot;Clay&quot; is loosely based on &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

In 2014, playwright and actor Herbert Sigüenza adapted the play to &quot;El Henry&quot;, a post-apocalyptic Chicano gang version set in &quot;the year 2045, and to a place identified as &#x27;Aztlan City, Aztlan. Formerly San Diego.&#x27;&quot;

In 2015, The Michigan Shakespeare Festival produced an award-winning combined production—directed and adapted by Janice L. Blixt—of the two plays focusing on the relationship between Henry IV and Prince Hal.

In 2016, Graham Abbey combined &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; into a single play called &quot;Breath of Kings: Rebellion&quot;. &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot; together became &quot;Breath of Kings: Redemption&quot;. Both adaptations were staged at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario. Abbey, in the productions, played Henry IV (Bolingbroke).

The 2016 app Cycle of Kings features the entire play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; in interactive form, as well as a modern English translation.

In 2019, Netflix released the film &quot;The King&quot;, an adaptation of the play directed by David Michôd and starring Timothée Chalamet, Robert Pattinson and Joel Edgerton.

==Legacy==
The famous Sherlock Holmes catchphrase &quot;The game is afoot&quot; is taken from Act I, Scene 3, line 615, where the Earl of Northumberland says: &quot;Before the game is afoot, thou still let&#x27;st slip.&quot;

The phrase was also later used by Shakespeare in &quot;Henry V&quot;, Act III, Scene 1, by the title character:
:&quot;I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
:Straining upon the start. The game&#x27;s afoot:
:Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
:Cry &#x27;God for Harry, England, and Saint George!&#x27;&quot;

<text>Mohammed V International Airport is an international airport serving Casablanca, Morocco. Located in Nouaceur Province, it is operated by ONDA ().

With about 7.6 million passengers passing through the airport in 2022, it was the busiest airport in Morocco and in the top 10 of busiest airports in Africa. Passenger traffic in 2022 had recovered to 74% of the total pre-pandemic numbers of 2019. The airport serves as hub for Royal Air Maroc, Royal Air Maroc Express and Air Arabia Maroc. It is named after King Mohammed V of Morocco, who led the country&#x27;s successful push for independence from French and Spanish colonial rule.

==History==



===1940s===
The Casablanca Mohammed V Airport was originally built by the United States in early 1943 following Operation Torch in World War II. It was named Berrechid Airfield and it served as an auxiliary airfield for Casablanca&#x27;s Anfa Airport. The airfield handled diverse military traffic as a stopover en route to Port Lyautey Airfield, and to Marrakech Airport on the North African Cairo-Dakar route. In addition, it was the terminus of Mid-Atlantic route transatlantic flights via the Azores to Nova Scotia and airfields on the East Coast of the United States.

In addition to its transportation role, the airfield supported the North African Campaign with the Twelfth Air Force 68th Reconnaissance Group operating photo-reconnaissance versions of the P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang. Part of the 68th first arrived at Angads Airport in Oujda in November 1942 and moved to Berrechid in March 1943 upon its completion. It flew both antisubmarine missions over the Atlantic and photo-reconnaissance combat missions over German-held territory until early September when it moved east to Massicault Airfield in Tunisia. With the end of the war in 1945, the airfield was handed over to the civil government.

===1950s===
During the Cold War in the early and middle 1950s, the airfield was reopened as Nouasseur Air Base and was used as a United States Air Force Strategic Air Command staging area for B-47 Stratojet bombers pointed at the Soviet Union. These operations later moved to Ben Guerir Air Base.

With the destabilisation of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the US Air Force to pull its bases out of Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave in December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. The U.S. felt that, with the long range of the B-52 and completion of Spanish bases in 1959, the Moroccan bases were no longer important.

=== 2020s ===
In 2022, Mohammed V Airport was ranked the 4th busiest airport in Africa.

<doc id="288420" wikidata="Q535814" url="?curid=288420" title="Gum arabic">
<text>Gum arabic (gum acacia, gum sudani, Senegal gum and by other names) () is a tree gum exuded by two species of &quot;Acacia sensu lato&quot;, &quot;Senegalia senegal&quot; and &quot;Vachellia seyal.&quot; However, the term &quot;gum arabic&quot; does not actually indicate a particular botanical source. The gum is harvested commercially from wild trees, mostly in Sudan (about 70% of the global supply) and throughout the Sahel, from Senegal to Somalia. The name &quot;gum Arabic&quot; (&quot;al-samgh al-&#x27;arabi&quot;) was used in the Middle East at least as early as the 9th century. Gum arabic first found its way to Europe via Arabic ports, and retained its name of origin.

Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides, predominantly polymers of arabinose and galactose. It is soluble in water, edible, and used primarily in the food industry and soft-drink industry as a stabilizer, with E number E414 (I414 in the US). Gum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional lithography and is used in printing, paints, glues, cosmetics, and various industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in textile industries, though less expensive materials compete with it for many of these roles.

== Definition ==
Gum arabic was defined by the 31st Codex Committee for Food Additives, held at The Hague from 19 to 23 March 1999, as the dried exudate from the trunks and branches of &quot;Acacia senegal&quot; or &quot;Vachellia (Acacia) seyal&quot; in the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae). A 2017 safety re-evaluation by the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that although the above definition holds true for most internationally traded samples, the term &quot;gum arabic&quot; does not indicate a particular botanical source; in a few cases, so‐called &quot;gum arabic&quot; may not even have been collected from &quot;Acacia&quot; (in the broad sense) species, instead coming from e.g. &quot;Combretum&quot; or &quot;Albizia&quot;.

== Health benefits ==
Gum arabic is a rich source of dietary fibers and in addition to its widespread use in food and pharmaceutical industries as a safe thickener, emulsifier, and stabilizer, it also possesses a broad range of health benefits that have been evidently proved through several &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; studies. Gum arabic is not degraded in the stomach, but fermented in the large intestine into a number of short chain fatty acids. It is regarded as a prebiotic that enhances the growth and proliferation of the beneficial intestinal microbiota and therefore its intake is associated with many useful health effects. These health benefits include:
* Improved absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract
* Anti-diabetic
* Anti-obesity (gum arabic lowers the body mass index and body fat percentage)
* Lipid lowering potential (gum arabic decreases total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride)
* Antioxidant activities
* Kidney and liver support
* Immune function &quot;via&quot; modulating the release of some inflammatory mediators
* Prebiotic improving the intestinal barrier function, preventing colon cancer, and alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel diseases
* In rats, a protective effect on the intestine against the adverse actions of the NSAID drug meloxicam

== Uses ==

Gum arabic&#x27;s mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins gives it the properties of a glue and binder that is edible by humans. Other substances have replaced it where toxicity is not an issue, as the proportions of the various chemicals in gum arabic vary widely and make it unpredictable. It remains an important ingredient in soft drink syrup and &quot;hard&quot; gummy candies such as gumdrops, marshmallows, and M&amp;M&#x27;s chocolate candies. For artists, it is the traditional binder in watercolor paint and in photography for gum printing, and it is used as a binder in pyrotechnic compositions. Pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetics also use the gum as a binder, emulsifier, and suspending agent or viscosity-increasing agent. Wine makers have used gum arabic as a wine fining agent.

It is an important ingredient in shoe polish, and can be used in making homemade incense cones. It is also used as a lickable adhesive, for example on postage stamps, envelopes, and cigarette papers. Lithographic printers employ it to keep the non-image areas of the plate receptive to water. This treatment also helps to stop oxidation of aluminium printing plates in the interval between processing of the plate and its use on a printing press.

=== Food ===
Gum arabic is used in the food industry as a stabiliser, emulsifying agent, and thickening agent in icing, fillings, soft candy, chewing gum, and other confectionery, and to bind the sweeteners and flavorings in soft drinks. A solution of sugar and gum arabic in water, gomme syrup, is sometimes used in cocktails to prevent the sugar from crystallising and provide a smooth texture.

Gum arabic is a complex polysaccharide and soluble dietary fibre that is generally recognized as safe for human consumption. An indication of harmless flatulence occurs in some people taking large doses of or more per day. It is not degraded in the intestine, but fermented in the colon under the influence of microorganisms; it is a prebiotic (as distinct from a probiotic). No regulatory or scientific consensus has been reached about its caloric value; an upper limit of was set for rats, but this is not valid for humans. The US FDA initially set a value of for food labelling, but in Europe no value was assigned for soluble dietary fibre. A 1998 review concluded that &quot;based on present scientific knowledge, only an arbitrary value can be used for regulatory purposes&quot;. In 2008, the FDA sent a letter of no objection in response to an application to reduce the rated caloric value of gum arabic to .

=== Painting and art ===

Gum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any color is suspended within the acacia gum in varying amounts, resulting in watercolor paint. Water acts as a vehicle or a diluent to thin the watercolor paint and helps to transfer the paint to a surface such as paper. When all moisture evaporates, the acacia gum typically does not bind the pigment to the paper surface, but is totally absorbed by deeper layers.

If little water is used, after evaporation, the acacia gum functions as a true binder in a paint film, increasing luminosity and helping prevent the colors from lightening. Gum arabic allows more subtle control over washes, because it facilitates the dispersion of the pigment particles. In addition, acacia gum slows evaporation of water, giving slightly longer working time.

The addition of a little gum arabic to watercolor pigment and water allows for easier lifting of pigment from paper, thus can be a useful tool when lifting out color when painting in watercolor.

=== Ceramics ===
Gum arabic has a long history as additives to ceramic glazes. It acts as a binder, helping the glaze adhere to the clay before it is fired, thereby minimising damage by handling during the manufacture of the piece. As a secondary effect, it also acts as a deflocculant, increasing the fluidity of the glaze mixture, but also making it more likely to sediment out into a hard cake if not used for a while.

The gum is normally made up into a solution in hot water (typically 10–25 g/L; ¼ to ½ oz per pint), and then added to the glaze solution after any ball milling in concentrations from 0.02% to 3.0% of gum arabic to the dry weight of the glaze. On firing, the gum burns out at a low temperature, leaving no residues in the glaze. More recently, particularly in commercial manufacturing, gum arabic is often replaced by more refined and consistent alternatives, such as carboxymethyl cellulose.

=== Photography ===
The historical photography process of gum bichromate photography uses gum arabic mixed with ammonium or potassium dichromate and pigment to create a coloured photographic emulsion that becomes relatively insoluble in water upon exposure to ultraviolet light. Unreacted gum remains soluble and can be washed off in warm water so that the reacted gum arabic permanently binds the pigments onto the paper in the final print.

=== Printmaking ===
Gum arabic is also used to protect and etch an image in lithographic processes, both from traditional stones and aluminum plates. In lithography, gum by itself may be used to etch very light tones, such as those made with a number-five crayon. Phosphoric, nitric, or tannic acid is added in varying concentrations to the acacia gum to etch the darker tones up to dark blacks. The etching process creates a gum adsorb layer within the matrix that attracts water, ensuring that the oil-based ink does not stick to those areas. Gum is also essential to what is sometimes called paper lithography, printing from an image created by a laser printer or photocopier.

=== Pyrotechnics ===
Gum arabic is also used as a water-soluble binder in fireworks composition.

== Composition ==
Arabinogalactan is a biopolymer consisting of arabinose and galactose monosaccharides. It is a major component of many plant gums, including gum arabic. 8-5&#x27; Noncyclic diferulic acid has been identified as covalently linked to carbohydrate moieties of the arabinogalactan-protein fraction.

== Production ==

While gum arabic has been harvested in Arabia and West Asia since antiquity, sub-Saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export. The gum exported came from the band of acacia trees that once covered much of the Sahel region, the southern littoral of the Sahara Desert that runs from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Today, the main populations of gum-producing &quot;Acacia&quot; species are found in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. &quot;Acacia&quot; is tapped for gum by stripping bits off the bark, from which gum then exudes. Traditionally harvested by seminomadic desert pastoralists in the course of their transhumance cycle, acacia gum remains a main export of several African nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. Total world gum arabic exports were estimated in 2019 at 160,000 tonnes, having recovered from 1987 to 1989 and 2003–2005 crises caused by the destruction of trees by the desert locust.

== History ==
=== Political aspects ===

==== West Africa ====
In 1445, Prince Henry the Navigator set up a trading post on Arguin Island (off the coast of modern Mauritania), which acquired acacia gum and slaves for Portugal. With the merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the acacia gum trade. Produced by the acacia trees of Trarza and Brakna, this acacia gum was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. By 1678, the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at Saint Louis at the mouth of the Senegal River. Gum Arabic came to play an essential role in textile printing and therefore in pre-industrial economies of France, Great Britain and other European countries. Throughout the 18th century, their competition over the commodity was so fierce, that some have referred to it as the gum wars.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, gum arabic was the major export from French and British trading colonies in modern Senegal and Mauritania. West Africa had become the sole supplier of world acacia gum by the 18th century, and its export at the French colony of Saint-Louis doubled in the decade of 1830 alone. A threat to bypass Saint-Louis and taxes by sending gum to the British traders at Portendick, eventually brought the Emirate of Trarza into direct conflict with the French. In the 1820s, the French launched the Franco-Trarzan War of 1825. The new emir, Muhammad al Habib, had signed an agreement with the Waalo Kingdom, directly to the south of the river. In return for an end to raids in Waalo territory, the emir took the heiress of Waalo as a bride. The prospect that Trarza might inherit control of both banks of the Senegal struck at the security of French traders, and the French responded by sending a large expeditionary force that crushed Muhammad&#x27;s army. The war incited the French to expand to the north of the Senegal River for the first time, heralding French direct involvement in the interior of West Africa. Africa continued to export gum arabic in large quantities—from the Sahel areas of French West Africa (modern Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger) and French Equatorial Africa (modern Chad) as well as British-administered Sudan, until these nations gained their independence in 1959–61.

==== Sudan ====
Since the 1950s, the global supply of gum arabic has been dominated by Sudan. In the early 2020s, about 70% of the global supply has been sourced from Sudan, with approximately 5 million Sudanese people (more than 10 percent of a country&#x27;s population) being directly or indirectly dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods. After market reforms in 2019, official figures showed that Sudan&#x27;s exports of gum arabic were at about 60,000 tonnes in 2022, but exact numbers are difficult to ascertain because some production is in regions that are hard to access. Before the reforms, the production of gum arabic was heavily dominated by the Sudanese government and in some periods there were attempts of using its importance to the global market as a leverage against other countries. Since the 2023 Sudan conflict, the export of gum arabic has been interrupted, causing a crash in its price in Sudan because of a reduced ability to export the product, whereas international companies that rely on it are attempting to diversify the supply chain of gum arabic and find alternative ingredients that can be used as a replacement.

== Pharmacology ==
Gum arabic slows the rate of absorption of some drugs, including amoxicillin, from the gut.

== Symbolic value ==
In the works of English playwright William Shakespeare, Dutch poet Jacob Cats and other European poets of the 13th to 17th centuries, gum arabic represented the &quot;noble Orient&quot;. In the Sahel, it is a symbol of the purity of youth.

<text>LeTourneau University (; abbreviated LETU) is a private, interdenominational evangelical Christian university in Longview, Texas. Founded as LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 by R. G. LeTourneau with his wife, Evelyn, the school initially educated veterans returning from World War II. Total annual enrollment is nearly 3,000.

== History ==
R. G. LeTourneau founded LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 with a mission to shape &quot;Christian leaders in every workplace&quot;. The site was the recently abandoned Harmon General Hospital, a World War II hospital that specialized in treating servicemen with neurological and dermatological issues. LeTourneau bought the site from the United States government with the help of &quot;Longview News-Journal&quot; publisher Carl Estes and other Longview community leaders for one dollar with the conditions that for the next decade, the U.S. government could reclaim the 156 acres (631,000 m2) and 220 buildings in the event of an emergency and no new construction or demolition could occur.

The State of Texas chartered the school on February 20, 1946, and classes were first held on April 1. At that point, enrollment at LeTourneau was exclusively male and predominantly veterans. For the first two years, LeTourneau provided an academy section to allow the completion of the junior and senior years of high school as well as a college section that offered two-year trade skill programs and a four-year technology program. Students attended classes on alternating days; while one half of the students were in class, the other half worked at R. G. LeTourneau&#x27;s nearby LeTourneau Incorporated manufacturing plant (now part of Cameron International), thus satisfying the laboratory requirements of all of the industrial courses.

From 1946 to 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute and LeTourneau, Inc. were one unified company under R. G. LeTourneau. In 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute underwent a transformation into the co-educational LeTourneau College and began to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in engineering, technology, and a limited number of arts and sciences. At this point, the college began to transition from the traditional wooden barracks buildings. The Tyler Hall Dormitory for men was erected in 1962, the Margaret Estes Library in 1963 and the Hollingsworth Science Hall in 1965.

The college continued to grow under the leadership of Allen C. Tyler in 1961 and 1962 and Richard H. LeTourneau (eldest son of R. G. and Evelyn) from 1962 to 1968. Harry T. Hardwick&#x27;s presidency from 1968 to 1975 saw to the construction of the R. G. LeTourneau Memorial Student Center and the Longview Citizens Resource Center along with spearheading LeTourneau&#x27;s accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Richard LeTourneau again assumed the presidency from 1975 to 1985, during which time he oversaw the accreditation of the school&#x27;s mechanical and electrical engineering programs by the Engineer&#x27;s Council for Professional Development (now the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and supervised nine major construction projects.



LeTourneau College became LeTourneau University in 1989 under the leadership of President Alvin O. Austin, who served until 2007. Austin oversaw the development of an MBA program and the expansion of programs in business and education into educational centers in Houston, Dallas, Tyler, Austin and Bedford. Austin also oversaw the removal of all wooden barracks from the Longview campus except the historic landmark known as Speer Chapel, which is the only remaining WWII-era structure and is a popular place for weddings and ceremonies. Under Austin&#x27;s leadership, the university&#x27;s main campus underwent considerable improvements including the construction of the university mall and Belcher Bell Tower, the Solheim Recreation and Activity Center, the Glaske Engineering Center, seven new residence halls, and the S.E. Belcher Jr. Chapel and Performance Center, a 2,011-seat auditorium that opened in spring 2007.

In the spring of 2006, Austin announced that he would retire from his position as university president in June 2007 and assume the newly created role of university chancellor. On March 8, 2007, Dale A. Lunsford was announced as the new president of LeTourneau University. He assumed the office on July 1, 2007. Prior to accepting the job as university president, Lunsford served as the vice president of student affairs and external relations at the University of Texas at Tyler. Lunsford retired as president in 2021. In March 2021, Steve Mason was selected as the seventh president of LeTourneau University, serving previously as Professor of Old Testament.

The school was in the spotlight in May 2015 when Outsports reported it &quot;updated its student-athlete handbook to ban gay athletes from dating&quot; and &quot;athletes from showing support for gay marriage&quot;.

In October 2024, LeTourneau University announced its &quot;Built With Purpose&quot; campaign, the largest capital campaign in the school&#x27;s history, totaling $180 million. Capital projects also include expanding the Abbott Aviation Center to meet the high student demand for LeTourneau aviation education and the construction of an Athletic and Human Performance Air Dome with a 200-meter NCAA competition level hydraulic track.

==Academics==
Many of the university&#x27;s undergraduate degrees are focused on engineering, aeronautics, computer science, business, and education. A smaller liberal arts program provides educational balance to the largely technical concentrations.

In June 2023 the university was placed on Warning status by its educational accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, after the accreditor&#x27;s board found the school not hiring sufficient full-time faculty. The warning status was removed in June 2024.

==Athletics==
The LeTourneau Yellow Jackets compete in nine women&#x27;s sports and eight men&#x27;s sports in NCAA Division III athletics in the American Southwest Conference (ASC). These sports include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, basketball, golf, tennis, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s softball, and women&#x27;s volleyball. The school&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Buzz&quot; the yellow jacket and the colors are royal blue and gold. The baseball team was the 2014 American Southwest Conference Champions. The men&#x27;s basketball team won more games than any ASC member from 2016 to 2020 averaging 22 wins a season, two ASC East Championships and the school&#x27;s only NCAA Team Tournament win. They also won the 2020 American Southwest Conference Tournament. LeTourneau also has a club Men&#x27;s Rugby team which competes in the Lone Star conference of the Texas Rugby Union, a division of USA Rugby.

==Fine arts and music==
Although it does not offer a music major, LeTourneau University includes fine arts opportunities for its students.

The university choir, the LeTourneau Singers, performs regularly in chapel and presents an annual free Masterworks concert of classical works. The Longview Civic Chorus is composed of regional adults and high school singers.

The LeTourneau Community Orchestra is a symphonic ensemble made up of LeTourneau students, professors, and Longview community members. It includes over 130 musicians and its own internal chorus. The Yellowjacket Jazz Band consists of about 20 LeTourneau students, professors, and Longview community members.

==Campus==
Longview, the seat of Gregg County, is located about a two-hour drive east of Dallas and about a one-hour drive west from Shreveport, Louisiana. The main campus itself is located on the south side of Longview, two miles north of Interstate 20 (exit 595B). Most of LeTourneau University&#x27;s 1,400 traditional students live on campus; the school requires all unmarried students under the age of 22 (who are not living with parents or relatives during the school year) to live in residence halls and on-campus apartments or to apply for a special waiver to live off-campus. While Longview is home to a variety of neighborhoods, both in age and economic circumstance, LeTourneau is located in the middle of the highest poverty (26.1% below poverty line based on 2000 census) and lowest income (median of $26,308 as of 2000 census) compared to 10 surrounding ZIP codes.

==Student life==


In addition to official university sports, intramural competitions in soccer, football, volleyball, ultimate and basketball are also highly valued and widely popular. Somewhat unusual to LeTourneau is the extensive amount of student pride and residence hall unity known as &quot;floor pride&quot;. Many floors in the residence halls have their own student-created name, logo, mascot, colors, T-shirt, etc.; these floors form teams that compete in intramural events.

===Floor system===
LeTourneau has a housing system similar to the House System with the use of numerous (roughly 30) individual floor assignments as opposed to four houses (which is closer to the House System at Caltech). Housing is generally gender-segregated by building. In years where housing space is limited, one or two residence halls will have housing that is gender-segregated by floor. However, access is limited to each of these floors via Prox cards, which allow only residents into their respective floor areas. Freshmen are placed into floors based upon both building preference and the order in which applications and deposits are received. New students can request a particular floor through their application process, though some are placed at the discretion of Residence Life. Many students remain on the same floor until they graduate from the university, only leaving to move off campus or to on-campus apartments rather than to join another floor.

===Greek life===

LeTourneau has no traditional Greek system. There are three independent Greek Men&#x27;s &quot;Societies&quot; and one independent Greek Women&#x27;s &quot;Society&quot;. Of those, the Societies Alpha Omega (ΑΩ), Kappa Zeta Chi (ΚΖΧ), and Lambda Alpha Sigma (ΛΑΣ) have charters from the university and have residence facilities on campus. The Greek Society Residences of ΑΩ, ΚΖΧ, and LAS are unique in that they are owned by the university but were built with donations from alumni and friends. The Greek Women&#x27;s &quot;Society&quot; is Lambda Omega Chi (ΛΩΧ) and has a charter with the university but does not currently have a residential facility on campus. None of LeTourneau&#x27;s Societies are part of national Greek organizations. Two previous societies, Tau Kappa Delta (ΤΚΔ) and Delta Sigma Psi (ΔΣΨ) lost their charters from the university in the 1990s.

===Other student activities===

LeTourneau has a variety of student-led foundations and a representative body of elected students known as the Student Senate (senate seats are allocated by residence hall or living area). A portion of each student&#x27;s tuition and fees is allocated to Student Senate each year to distribute to spring break mission trips, campus activities, on-campus clubs, and other projects.

The Yellowjacket Activities Council (YAC), a university-sanctioned and funded student events committee, is responsible for planning and supervising several recreational &quot;student life&quot; activities each semester. Several student YAC Coordinators are responsible for different sections of planning and implementation of concerts, coffeehouse parties, midnight festivals, athletic competitions, off-campus events, movie nights, paintball, and Valentine parties. These are a few among the many activities organized by YAC.

Homecoming at LeTourneau, while once being hosted in the fall with a talent and variety show along with other activities for returning alumni, is now hosted in the spring. A Starlight Soiree is held, as well as athletic events, including the annual intersociety rope pull competition, and Hootenanny.

The traditional Hootenanny variety show brings together the majority of the student body, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the community for a dose of original comedy, music, and talent. Most students at LETU attend the event. The event is put on by individuals or groups of students who have auditioned in the weeks leading up to the show. 2005 marked the 40th anniversary of the Hootenanny production. Traditionally, members of the school faculty and administration have also participated at the students&#x27; request, often in satirical roles. &quot;Hootenuity 2007&quot; marked the end of using the Belcher Gym as the performance venue, with the new S. E. Belcher Chapel and Performance center slated as the new home for &quot;O Hootenanny, Where Art Thou?&quot; in the 2007–2008 school year. Because of this transition, the well-used rotating stage was destroyed and a two-story stage built to make use of the new facility. The rotating stage was a product of a senior design project in the 1970s.

<text>Private first class (; ) is a military rank held by junior enlisted personnel in many armed forces.

==French speaking countries==
In France and other French speaking countries, the rank (; ) is used.

==Poland==
In Poland, the rank is called ().

== Singapore ==
Introduced in 1983, the honorific rank is awarded to hardworking conscript citizen-soldiers who performed well in their National Service term. Private First Class (PFC) wear a rank insignia of a single chevron pointing down.
The Private First Class (PFC) rank is rarely awarded nowadays by the Singapore Armed Forces. All private enlistees can be promoted directly to Lance Corporal (LCP) should they meet the minimum qualifying requirements, conduct appraisal and work performance.

==United States==

===United States Army===

In the United States Army, recruits usually enter service as a private in pay grade E-1. Private (E-2), designated by a single chevron, is typically an automatic promotion after six months of service. Private first class (E-3), equivalent to NATO grade OR-3, is designated by a single chevron with one arc or &quot;rocker,&quot; and is more common among soldiers who have served in the U.S. Army for one year or more. Soldiers who have achieved an associate degree or its equivalent are entitled to enter the Army at this pay grade. Advancement from private first class is to specialist (E-4); advancement to corporal (also at the E-4 pay grade) requires that the soldier also complete the Basic Leader Course (BLC), the first course of study in a US Army noncommissioned officer&#x27;s professional development course. Thus, in order to qualify for leadership posts such as team leader, the soldier must have first served as a corporal; a team leader is nominally a sergeant (E-5).

The rank of private first class has existed since 1846 and, prior to 1919, its insignia consisted of the branch of service insignia without any arcs or chevrons. The Secretary of War approved &quot;an arc of one bar&quot; (i.e., a &quot;rocker&quot;) under the branch of service or trade insignia for privates first class on 22 July 1919. From August 5, 1920, to May 28, 1968, the rank insignia for private first class was a single chevron, per War Department Circular No. 303. On May 28, 1968, the insignia was changed to its current form, consisting of a single chevron with one arc.

===United States Marine Corps===

In the United States Marine Corps, the rank of private first class is the second lowest, just under lance corporal and just above private, equivalent to NATO grade OR-2, being pay grade E-2. It was established on June 3, 1916, to match the already existing Army rank, primarily because US Marine units were &quot;often called upon to serve&quot; with US Army organizations, such as in the American Expeditionary Force that served in Europe during World War I (e.g. 4th Marine Brigade of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division). At the time the two ranks were directly equivalent. However, the USMC rank of PFC is one grade lower (E-2) than the similarly titled US Army rank.

<doc id="288432" wikidata="Q5437590" url="?curid=288432" title="Father Dámaso">
<text>&quot;Padre&quot; Dámaso Verdolagas is a fictional character in the novel &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot;. The novel was written by José Rizal, one of the leaders of the Propaganda Movement in the Philippines. &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (&quot;Touch Me Not&quot; or &quot;Social Cancer&quot;) is a controversial and anticlerical novel that exposed the abuses committed by the Spanish friars (belonging to the Roman Catholic Church) and the Spanish elite in colonial Philippines during the 19th century.

The novel, according to the author, represented the state of Philippine society under Spanish colonial rule. It was intended as a liberal-nationalist wake-up call for the people of the Philippines. While the natives (&quot;indios&quot;) were trained to become secular clergy, Spanish priests in the powerful religious orders were given preferential treatment in the assignment to parishes.

==Character summary==
Dámaso Verdolagas, a Franciscan Spanish priest, was the former curate of the town of San Diego. He was an enemy of Don Rafael Ibarra, Crisóstomo Ibarra&#x27;s father; Don Rafael refuses to conform to the friars&#x27; power. After Don Rafael&#x27;s death in jail, Padre Dámaso ordered his corpse exhumed and transferred to the Chinese cemetery, which he considered was for heathens. He was later revealed to be the biological father of María Clara. María Clara&#x27;s mother, Doña Pía Alba, and Don Santiago de los Santos had been trying to conceive a child when Padre Dámaso raped Doña Pia.

Near the end of the novel, he and María Clara had a dispute about her not marrying Alfonso Linares, and her going to the convent or dying. This broke Padre Dámaso&#x27;s heart. By the end of the novel, he was transferred to another town to be its curate. He was later found dead due to unknown causes, possibly depression or hypertension.

==Legacy==

* Padre Dámaso was portrayed in the following films and television series:
** Oscar Keesee - &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (1961)
** Subas Herrero in the ABC television series &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (1992)
** Cristóbal Gómez - &quot;José Rizal&quot; (1998)
** Arnell Ignacio - &quot;Damaso&quot; (2019)
** Tirso Cruz III - &quot;Maria Clara at Ibarra&quot; (2022-2023)
* &quot;Padre Damaso&quot;, a 1990&#x27;s hit song Filipino heavy metal band Warlak, appears on various compilation albums such as &quot;The Tone Def Collection Volume 1&quot; released in 1997, refers to corrupt religious leaders who use the name of God for their personal gain. 
* The Tagalog term &quot;anak ni Padre Dámaso&quot; (&quot;child of Father Dámaso&quot;) has become a stereotype or cliché in the Philippines to refer to a white or half-white (Spanish: &quot;mestizo&quot;) child whose father is unknown. It can also refer to a child whose father was (or who was suspected to be) a Spanish clergyman. The term also became a reference to any corrupt religious leader in the Philippines, especially among the Roman Catholic clergy.
* Filipino tour guide and cultural activist Carlos Celdran was arrested for shouting and bearing a sign with the word &quot;Dámaso&quot; at the Manila Cathedral during an ecumenical service, to protest the bishops&#x27; stance against abortion and contraception on September 30, 2010.

<text>Staff sergeant is a rank of non-commissioned officer used in the armed forces of many countries. It is also a police rank in some police services.

==History of title==

In origin, certain senior sergeants were assigned to administrative, supervisory, or other specialist duties as part of the staff of a British Army regiment. As such they held seniority over sergeants who were members of a battalion or company, and were paid correspondingly increased wages. Their seniority was indicated by a crown worn above the three sergeant&#x27;s stripes on their uniform rank markings.

==National variations==
===Australia===
In the Australian Army and Cadets, the rank of staff sergeant is being phased out. It was usually held by the company quartermaster sergeant or the holders of other administrative roles. Staff sergeants are always addressed as &quot;Staff Sergeant&quot; or &quot;Staff&quot;, never as &quot;Sergeant&quot;, as it degrades their rank. &quot;Chief&quot; is another nickname though this is only used for the company chief clerk (in some instances the chief clerk role can be filled by another non-commissioned rank (but not warrant officer) and still be referred to as &quot;Chief&quot;). A staff sergeant ranks above sergeant and below warrant officer class 2.

=== Canada ===
In the pre-Unification Canadian Army, the rank of staff sergeant existed until 1968 when the Unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force into the Canadian Armed Forces occurred. Post-unification, the Canadian Armed Forces replaced the rank with that of Warrant Officer.

The rank is used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other police services throughout Canada.

=== Norway ===

In the Norwegian Defence Forces, the tasks and responsibilities of the staff sergeant () are not clear; quite recently, in January 2016, Norway replaced their old rank system, and implemented a new, which is more adapted to other NATO members. In 1975, all of the Norwegian military branches abolished the system of using non-commissioned officers. Now, however, Norway is reintroducing the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps, allowing people to become officers without graduating from a military academy or having a university degree.

=== Philippines ===
The rank of staff sergeant is used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It is a non-commissioned officer rank currently used by Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force, and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy). It is a rank positioned above sergeant and below the technical sergeant.

===Singapore===

==== Singapore Armed Forces ====
A staff sergeant (SSG) in the Singapore Armed Forces ranks above first sergeant and below master sergeant. It is the second most senior specialist rank. Staff sergeants are addressed as &quot;Staff Sergeant&quot; or &quot;Staff&quot;, but never &quot;Sergeant&quot;.

Staff sergeants may be appointed as company sergeant major if they are due for promotion to master sergeant. They are usually addressed as &quot;CSM&quot; in camp, although in the past they were referred to as &quot;Encik&quot;, which is now used to address only warrant officers.

The rank insignia consists of two chevrons pointing up and three chevrons pointing down, with the Singapore coat of arms in the middle.

==== Home Team ====
In the Singapore Prison Service, the rank of staff sergeant (SSGT) is above the rank of sergeant, and is below the rank of Chief Warder (1). The rank insignia of SSGT is one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons below it.

In the Singapore Police Force, the rank of staff sergeant is currently being phased out with the newly overhauled &quot;unified police rank structure&quot; which allows a direct-entry sergeant to be eligible for emplacement to the rank of Inspector without a degree.

In the past, the rank of staff sergeant is above the rank of sergeant, and below the rank of senior staff sergeant; with the new rank structure being introduced, the rank and insignia of staff sergeant is being phased out, and being replaced with three grades of sergeant, namely, sergeant (1), sergeant (2), and sergeant (3), before being promoted directly to senior staff sergeant. However, all three grades of sergeants don the same three-chevrons insignia.

==== Uniformed Youth Organisations ====
In the National Cadet Corps, staff sergeants are cadets who have passed the 3-days 2-nights Senior Specialists Leaders Course successfully. The rank of staff sergeant is above first sergeant and below master sergeant. Staff sergeants wear a rank insignia of two pointed-up chevrons, one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons, with the letters &#x27;NCC&#x27; located below the insignia to differentiate NCC cadets from SAF personnel.

In the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), the rank of staff sergeant is above sergeant, and below Station Inspector and Warrant Officer respectively. The rank of staff sergeant generally is awarded to cadets when they are in Secondary Four, before they pass out. NPCC and NCDCC staff sergeants wear a rank insignia of one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons. The letters &#x27;NPCC&#x27; and &#x27;NCDCC&#x27; are located below the insignia so as to differentiate NPCC and NCDCC cadets from Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel respectively.

In the St John Brigade (SJB), the rank of staff sergeant (SSG) is above sergeant, and below senior staff sergeant. Staff sergeants in SJB wear a rank insignia of one St John coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons.

===United Kingdom===
In the British Army, staff sergeant (SSgt or formerly S/Sgt) ranks above sergeant and below warrant officer class 2. The rank is given a NATO code of OR-7. The insignia is the monarch&#x27;s crown above three downward pointing chevrons.

Staff sergeants can also hold other appointments, such as company quartermaster sergeant, and are usually known by that appointment if held. The equivalent rank in infantry regiments is colour sergeant, and holders are known by that title no matter what their appointment. In the Household Cavalry the equivalent rank is staff corporal.

British staff sergeants are never referred to or addressed as &quot;Sergeant&quot;, which would be reducing their rank, but are referred to and addressed as &quot;Staff Sergeant&quot; or &quot;Staff&quot; (&quot;Staff Jones&quot;, for instance) or by their appointment or its abbreviation. Quartermaster sergeants are often addressed as &quot;Q&quot;. In most cavalry regiments, staff sergeants are addressed as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;, which is assumed to derive from the original rank of troop sergeant major, or as &quot;Sir&quot; by subordinates.

Flight sergeant and chief technician are the Royal Air Force equivalents. Chief petty officer is the equivalent in the Royal Navy and colour sergeant in the Royal Marines.

===United States===

====U.S. Army====
Staff sergeant (SSG) is the E-6 rank in the United States Army, just above sergeant and below sergeant first class, and is a non-commissioned officer (NCO). Unlike the Marine Corps, U.S. Army staff sergeants are not considered senior NCOs (senior NCOs of the Army begin with sergeant first class, equivalent to the Marines&#x27; gunnery sergeant). Staff sergeants are generally placed in charge of squads, but can also act as platoon sergeants in the absence of a sergeant first class. In support units, staff sergeants ordinarily hold headquarters positions because of the number of slots available for them in these units. Staff sergeants are typically assigned as a squad leader or company operations non-commissioned officer in charge at the company level, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. Staff sergeants are referred to as &quot;Sergeant&quot; except in certain training environments and schools. The NATO code is OR-6.

In the early days of World War II &quot;flying sergeants&quot; with the rank of staff sergeant were qualified enlisted pilots before the rank of flight officer was introduced in September 1942.

The rank of staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, along with technical sergeant (renamed sergeant first class in 1948) and master sergeant, was created by Congress after the First World War. In 1920 the Army combined several company/battery/troop level &quot;staff&quot; NCO ranks, including color sergeant, supply sergeant, radio sergeant, eleven grades of sergeant first class, three grades of sergeant, two grades of master gunner, and assistant band leader into the new rank of staff sergeant. Staff sergeant, as did the ranks it combined/replaced, then ranked above sergeant but below technical sergeant/first sergeant (which, at the time, were both in the same pay grade). At that time, sergeants served as squad or section leaders, platoon guides, and assistants to platoon commanders (the position of platoon sergeant, nor a separate rank for the position, did not yet exist), and included several formerly separate ranks such as mess sergeant, company supply sergeant, and stable sergeant, etc. In 1940, staff sergeant became the rank title of rifle platoon sergeants and in 1942 rifle squad leaders became staff sergeants, with platoon sergeants then being promoted to technical sergeants.

====U.S. Marine Corps====
Staff sergeant (SSgt) is E-6 rank (NATO code OR-6) in the United States Marine Corps (USMC), ranking above sergeant and below gunnery sergeant. This grade is normally achieved after 6 years in service.

The rank of staff sergeant in the USMC was created in 1923 to coincide with the U.S. Army&#x27;s ranks. Until the end of World War II, the insignia of platoon sergeant was three chevrons and a rocker (worn by &quot;line&quot; NCO grades), with staff sergeant having a horizontal stripe (worn by &quot;staff&quot; NCO grades) instead of a rocker below the chevrons. After the separate rank of platoon sergeant was eliminated, the staff sergeant rank switched over to the rocker insignia and staff sergeants held the platoon sergeant&#x27;s billet.

==Cadet staff sergeant==
The rank of cadet staff sergeant (CSSG or C/SSgt) is used by many cadet organisations around the world, including the Civil Air Patrol in the United States, and the Army Cadet Force and the Army Section of the Combined Cadet Force in the United Kingdom.

== Police rank ==
The rank of staff sergeant is used in some police forces to indicate a senior supervisor. The rank is used, for example, in most Canadian police services. Other national police services (for example, Cyprus) have a corresponding rank of senior sergeant. In the United Kingdom, a few police forces formerly used the rank of station sergeant, with the same rank insignia as an army staff sergeant. The Hong Kong Police Force still uses this rank.

In the Philippines, as of 8 February 2019, the rank of staff sergeant is currently being used by the Philippine National Police as they adopt a new ranking classification, eliminating confusion of old ranks. The rank stands above the Police Corporal and below the Police Master sergeant.

=== Gallery ===
==Other uses==
A number of other organisations, basing their structure on military ranks, have historically used, or still use, the rank of staff sergeant. The rank of staff sergeant was, for example, phased out of the rank structure of St John Ambulance in the early 1990s.

<text>Sergeant First Class (SFC) is typically a senior non-commissioned officer rank, used in many countries.

==United States==
Sergeant First Class (SFC) is the seventh enlisted rank (E-7) in the U.S. Army, ranking above staff sergeant (E-6) and below master sergeant and first sergeant (E-8), and is the first non-commissioned officer rank designated as a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO).

A sergeant first class is typically assigned as a platoon sergeant at the company level or &quot;battalion operations non-commissioned officer in charge&quot; at the battalion level, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically second in charge (under an officer, typically a second lieutenant, serving as the platoon leader) of from 14 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 36 soldiers and four squads in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class&#x27;s primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical casualty evacuations, and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader. Sergeant first class replaced the rank of technical sergeant in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959.)

A sergeant first class is addressed as &quot;sergeant&quot; except in certain situations, such as field artillery units, in which a sergeant first class serving as platoon sergeant is commonly referred to as &quot;Smoke.&quot; If a sergeant first class is appointed to fill the role of first sergeant, he or she is addressed as &quot;First Sergeant.&quot; Typically a sergeant first class assigned on a manning document to fill a first sergeant role while being promotable to master sergeant can be frocked to first sergeant rank and hold the insignia due its position.

Sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank in the U.S. Army to be selected by the centralized promotion system. As such, it is considerably more difficult to achieve than the previous ranks. A sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank to be considered a senior non-commissioned officer, and a soldier achieving the rank gains not only prestige, but several benefits due to the position. Contrary to popular belief due to a common apocryphal saying, it does not take an act of Congress to reduce a sergeant first class in rank. The reduction authority from sergeant first class to staff sergeant is reserved for Commanders of organizations authorized a commander in the rank of colonel or higher. For separate detachments or companies, the reduction authority will be the next higher headquarters within the chain of command. The higher headquarters must be authorized by a commander in the rank of colonel or higher.

The rank title of sergeant first class (SFC) existed in the Army from 1890 until 1920 when it was eliminated in an army-wide simplification of enlisted ranks which had grown into a system containing 128 different rank insignia. The rank of SFC was used in several technical branches such as the Army Medical Department and in the Ordnance, Signal, and Quartermaster Corps and was equivalent to the field service ranks at the company/battery/troop &quot;staff&quot; NCO level, such as color sergeant, supply sergeant, or radio sergeant. The Army restored the rank of SFC in 1948 when it replaced technical sergeant.

<text>A master sergeant is the military rank for a senior non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries.

== Israel Defense Forces ==
The (abbreviated &quot;&quot;, master sergeant) is a non-commissioned officer () rank in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Because the IDF is an integrated force, they have a unique rank structure. IDF ranks are the same in all services (army, navy and air force). The ranks are derived from those of the paramilitary developed in the British Mandate of Palestine period to protect the . This origin is reflected in the slightly compacted IDF rank structure.

== Philippines ==
Master sergeant is used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines as a non-commissioned officer rank. It is used by the Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy. The rank is below Senior master sergeant and above Technical sergeant.

As of February 8, 2019, a new ranking classification for the Philippine National Police was adopted, eliminating confusion of old ranks. Master sergeant is one of the new classification for non-commissioned officer rank. The rank stands above the Police Staff sergeant and below the Police Senior master sergeant.

== Singapore ==

=== Singapore Armed Forces ===
In the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), master sergeant is the highest rank amongst the specialist corps, ranking above staff sergeant and below third warrant officer. In the Singapore Army, master sergeants are usually instructors, staff specialists, or sergeants major of battalion or company-sized units. They are addressed as &quot;master&quot; or &quot;master sergeant&quot;.

=== National Cadet Corps ===
In the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the rank of master sergeant is awarded to outstanding NCC cadets who have contributed greatly to their unit. The insignia of MSG (NCC) is the same as the SAF&#x27;s, except that the letters &#x27;NCC&#x27; are below the insignia, to differentiate SAF and NCC master sergeants.

== United States ==

Master sergeant is a senior non-commissioned officer rank used within the United States Armed Forces by the United States Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force. It is ranked differently depending on the service branch. The Civil Air Patrol also has the rank of master sergeant.

=== U.S. Army ===
Master sergeant (MSG) is the eighth enlisted grade (E-8), ranking above sergeant first class and below sergeant major, command sergeant major, Sergeant Major of the Army, and equal in grade but not authority to a first sergeant. It is abbreviated as &quot;MSG&quot; and indicated by three chevrons above three inverted arcs, commonly referred to as &quot;rockers&quot;.

A master sergeant may be assigned as a brigade-level section noncommissioned officer in charge and serves as the subject matter expert in their field, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. The equivalent-grade first sergeant is the senior noncommissioned officer of a company, battery, or troop.

When holding the position of first sergeant, while uncommon, the master sergeant is referred to as &quot;first sergeant&quot;; however, when not in the position of first sergeant, master sergeants are addressed as &quot;sergeant&quot;. This is the standard address for all pay grades E-5 through E-8. Use of the term &quot;top&quot; or &quot;master sergeant&quot; is not a requirement, but is considered courteous, and remains to be at the discretion of the one addressing the master sergeant, though &quot;top&quot; is preferred, due to the long tradition of its use in the U.S. Army, which has, since the Civil War, emphasized the importance of senior NCOs closely advising and instructing newly commissioned second lieutenants, first lieutenants and captains.

In 1920, the Army combined several regimental level &quot;staff&quot; NCO ranks, including four grades of sergeant major, three grades of quartermaster sergeant, regimental supply sergeant, senior ordnance sergeant, senior band sergeant, four grades of senior master sergeant, and seven additional master-level technical and specialist ranks into the new master sergeant rank. Master sergeant then became the senior enlisted rank, ranking above technical sergeant and first sergeant (a positional rank/title for the senior technical sergeant in a company/battery/troop), while &quot;sergeant major&quot; became a &quot;courtesy title&quot; for the senior master sergeant in a battalion/squadron or higher headquarters.

In 1942, the rank of first sergeant was elevated one grade and was then considered as a junior version of master sergeant, because while first sergeants served as senior NCOs at the company/battery/troop level, master sergeants held positions as the senior NCO in their MOS at battalion/squadron and higher level headquarters. In 1958, both first sergeant and master sergeant were elevated one grade to the new E-8 pay grade, while the rank of sergeant major was restored as the senior enlisted rank at the new pay grade of E-9.

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
The eighth enlisted grade, ranking above gunnery sergeant and below master gunnery sergeant, sergeant major, and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. It is equal in grade to first sergeant, and is abbreviated &quot;MSgt&quot;. In the U.S. Marine Corps, master sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists at the E-8 level.

Most infantry master sergeants serve as the operations chief of a weapons company, in place of the gunnery sergeant found in the company headquarters of a rifle company. Infantry master sergeants also serve as the assistant operations chief in the S-3 section of the headquarters of an infantry regiment and Marine Expeditionary Unit and in the G-3 section of the headquarters of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade. The Marine division and Marine Expeditionary Force headquarters contains two infantry master sergeants, one as the training SNCO and the other as the readiness chief.

Some combat support battalions have master sergeants at the company level (e.g., one as the tank leader, again replacing the company gunnery sergeant, in the operations section of the tank company headquarters, and two in the company headquarters of an assault amphibian company, one master sergeant as the company gunnery sergeant in the headquarters section and the other as the section leader of the company headquarters AMTRAC Section).

In Marine aircraft squadrons MSgts usually serve as SNCOICs of the ordnance and avionics divisions in the aircraft maintenance department. The Aircraft Maintenance Chief/SNCOIC is usually a MGySgt (q.v.), and there are eight aviation-related MSgt billets in each Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS). (A MALs is organic to each Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) and performs intermediate aviation supply, aircraft maintenance (including aviation life support equipment and avionics), and aviation ordnance support for its supported aircraft squadrons.)

Most non-infantry master sergeants serve as section chief/SNCOIC of their MOS type staff section in a battalion or higher level headquarters. General command leadership at this paygrade is provided by the separate rank of first sergeant.

Only in the Marine Corps are master sergeants required to be addressed by their full rank. In the Marine Corps, master sergeants may be referred to by the nickname of &quot;Top&quot;. This usage is an informal one, however, and would not be used in an official or formal setting. Use of this nickname by Marines of subordinate rank is at the rank holder&#x27;s discretion. In the U.S. Armed Forces, all master sergeants (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) are senior non-commissioned officers (i.e., pay grades E-7 through E-9). However, in the U.S. Marine Corps, the non-commissioned officer ranks of staff sergeant and above, are classified as Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs), a classification that is unique in U.S. usage to the USMC.

=== U.S. Air Force ===

The seventh enlisted grade, ranking above technical sergeant and below senior master sergeant. It is abbreviated as &quot;MSgt&quot;. Advancement to master sergeant is one of the most significant promotions within the enlisted Air Force and Space Force. At the rank of master sergeant, the airman enters the senior non-commissioned tier and transitions his or her duties from front line technicians and supervisors to operational leaders. An operational leader develops his or her leadership and management skills since this rank carries increased broad leadership, supervisory, and managerial responsibilities rather than technical performance.

Per Air Force Instruction 36–2618, master sergeants do serve in positions as squadron superintendents, flight chiefs, section chiefs, and non-commissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC). Air Force first sergeants occupy the pay grades of E-7 through E-9 and are referred to officially as &quot;first sergeant&quot; regardless of pay grade, and unofficially as &quot;first shirt&quot; or &quot;shirt&quot;.

In 1991, the Air Force changed its NCO insignia so that a maximum of five stripes, or rockers, were placed on the bottom of the chevrons. The master sergeant rank insignia was changed by removing the bottom (sixth) rocker, and relocating it above as a single chevron, on top of the five lower stripes. The single chevron above visually identifies Senior NCO status for E-7 master sergeants along with two chevrons above for E-8 senior master sergeants and three chevrons above for E-9 chief master sergeants in the Air Force NCO insignia. In 2015, the Air Force announced its promotion overhaul and newly established boards for master sergeant.

==== Civil Air Patrol ====

The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), a non-profit corporation Congressionally chartered to operate as the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, has a quasi-military structure which includes the rank of master sergeant. The grade of master sergeant is below senior master sergeant and above technical sergeant. Former military enlisted personnel who held the rank of master sergeant in the United States Armed Forces may retain that rank as members of the CAP.

=== U.S. Space Force ===
On February 1, 2021, the United States Space Force announced its permanent rank structure, establishing the grade of master sergeant as its permanent E-7 grade. This continued its usage from the Air Force. The grade of master sergeant is above technical sergeant and beneath senior master sergeant.

<doc id="288437" wikidata="Q463754" url="?curid=288437" title="Double Ninth Festival">
<text>The Double Ninth Festival is a traditional Chinese holiday observed on the ninth day of the ninth month in the Chinese calendar. According to Wu Jun, it dates back to the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD).

According to the &quot;I Ching&quot;, &quot;nine&quot; is a yang number; the ninth day of the ninth month in the Chinese calendar (or double nine) has extra &quot;yang&quot; (a traditional Chinese spiritual concept) and is thus an auspicious date. Hence, the day is also called &quot;Double Yang Festival&quot; (). It is customary to climb a mountain, drink chrysanthemum liquor, and wear the &quot;zhuyu&quot; () plant (&quot;Cornus officinalis&quot;). Both chrysanthemum and &quot;zhuyu&quot; are considered to have cleansing qualities and are used on other occasions to air out houses and cure illnesses.

On this holiday, some Chinese also visit the graves of their ancestors to pay their respects. In Hong Kong and Macau, whole extended families head to ancestral graves to clean them, repaint inscriptions and lay out food offerings such as roast suckling pig and fruit, which are then eaten (after the spirits have consumed the spiritual element of the food). Chongyang cake is also popular and incense sticks are burned during the holiday.

==Origin==
The origins of the festival date back as early as the Warring States period

According to legend, the traditions of hiking and drinking chrysanthemum wine on this day began with the Han dynasty man and his disciple . One year, Fei advised Huan to bring chrysanthemum wine and food and climb a mountain with his family on the ninth day of the ninth month. Huan followed his master&#x27;s instructions, and when he returned home he found that his livestock had all suddenly died; if he had not climbed the mountain as instructed, the same would have happened to him and his family.

An alternative origin story involves intrigue in the imperial court of Emperor Gaozu of Han. As part of Empress Lü&#x27;s jealous plot against Consort Qi, the latter&#x27;s maid was forced out of the imperial palace. The maid, surnamed Jia (), told the common people that in the palace it was customary to wear dogwood and drink chrysanthemum wine on the ninth day of the ninth month, and these customs spread more widely.

In 1966, Taiwan rededicated the holiday as &quot;Senior Citizens&#x27; Day&quot;, underscoring one custom as it is observed in Mainland China, where the festival is also an opportunity to care for and appreciate the elderly.

Double Ninth may have originated as a day to drive away danger, but like the Chinese New Year, over time, it became a day of celebration. In contemporary times, it is an occasion for hiking and chrysanthemum appreciation. Other activities include flying kites, making flower cakes, and welcoming married daughters back home for visiting.

Stores sell rice cakes ( &quot;gāo&quot;, a homophone for &quot;height&quot; ) with mini colorful flags to represent &quot;zhuyu&quot;. Most people drink chrysanthemum tea, while a few traditionalists drink homemade chrysanthemum wine. Children learn poems about chrysanthemums and many localities host chrysanthemum exhibits. Mountain climbing races are also popular; winners get to wear a wreath made of &quot;zhuyu&quot;.

==Outside China==
===Japan===
In Japan, the festival is known as &quot;Chōyō&quot; but also as the and it is one of Japan&#x27;s five sacred ancient festivals (sekku). It is most commonly celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th month according to the Gregorian calendar rather than the lunisolar calendar, i.e. on September 9. It is celebrated at both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. The festival is celebrated in the wish for the longevity of one&#x27;s life and is observed by drinking chrysanthemum sake and eating dishes such as chestnut rice () and chestnuts with glutinous rice ().

===Korea===
In Korea, the festival is known as Jungyangjeol (), and it is celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th month. Koreans would consume chrysanthemum leaves in pancakes. As the festival is meant to celebrate and cultivate good health, outdoor activities such as carrying dogwood, climbing hills or mountains for picnics, and gazing at chrysanthemum blossoms are carried out.

<text>Sergeant major is a senior non-commissioned rank or appointment in many militaries around the world.

==History==
In 16th century Spain, the (&quot;sergeant major&quot;) was a general officer. He commanded an army&#x27;s infantry, and ranked about third in the army&#x27;s command structure; he also acted as a sort of chief of staff to the army&#x27;s commander.

In the 17th century, sergeant majors appeared in individual regiments. These were field officers, third in command of their regiments (after their colonels and lieutenant colonels), with a role similar to the older, army-level sergeant majors (although obviously on a smaller scale). The older position became known as &quot;sergeant major general&quot; to distinguish it. Over time, the term &quot;sergeant&quot; was dropped from both titles, giving rise to the modern ranks of major and major general.

The full title of sergeant major fell out of use until the latter part of the 18th century, when it began to be applied to the senior non-commissioned officer of an infantry battalion or cavalry regiment. It is about this time that the U.S. and British histories of the title diverge, with the American Revolutionary War.

==Commonwealth of Nations forces==
Sergeant major is now generally an appointment rather than a rank. The appointment is normally held by the senior warrant officer of an army or marine unit. These appointments are made at several levels: for example, the senior warrant officer of a company, battery or squadron, or the senior warrant officer of a battalion or regiment. A sergeant major of a regiment or battalion is known as a regimental sergeant major, rather than a &quot;regiment sergeant major&quot; or &quot;battalion sergeant major&quot;.

The sergeant major of a unit is responsible to the commanding officer for advising them on matters relating to non-commissioned members of that unit. Sergeant majors are normally addressed as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates, and as &quot;sergeant major&quot;, by their full title (or its abbreviation), or as &quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Ms&quot; [surname], by superiors.

In the British Armed Forces, the plural is &quot;sergeant majors&quot; and not &quot;sergeants major&quot; as it is in the United States.

===Australia===
The most senior warrant officer in the Australian Army holds the unique rank of warrant officer (introduced in 1991 and senior to WO1) and the appointment of Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A). The RSM-A is responsible to the Chief of Army, but responsive to all ranks across the Army. The RSM-A is a member of the personal staff of the Chief of Army. The post of RSM-A has existed since January 1983 and was held by a WO1 until 1991. The RSM-A is the equivalent of the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N) and the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF).

The RSM-A&#x27;s primary role is to represent to the Chief of Army and others, the solicited and unsolicited views, concerns and opinions of soldiers in the army, but also carry the Chief of Army&#x27;s message down and across the ranks.

===Canada===

====Canadian Armed Forces====
The appointment of sergeant major is given to the senior non-commissioned member within sub-units, units and some formations of the Canadian Army. The regimental sergeant-major is the senior sergeant major in a unit, such as armoured, artillery, engineer, and signal regiments, and infantry and service battalions. This appointment is normally held by a chief warrant officer.

Within sub-units (such as squadrons, companies and artillery batteries) the sub-unit sergeant-major generally holds the rank of master warrant officer and is known as a squadron, company or, battery sergeant major. They are addressed as &quot;Sergeant-Major&quot; (i.e. &quot;SSM&quot;, &quot;CSM&quot;, &quot;BSM&quot;, etc.), &quot;Mr&quot;, or &quot;Ms&quot; by officers and &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; by subordinates with the same conventions used for regimental sergeant majors.

In some unusual cases, a chief petty officer 1st class or chief petty officer 2nd class in the Royal Canadian Navy may succeed to a sergeant major&#x27;s position, especially in units with a large number of &quot;purple trades&quot;, such as service battalions. The forms of address generally remain the same, except that chief petty officers 1st and 2nd class are never addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, but as &quot;Chief&quot;. Sergeant majors do not form part of the formation, unit, or sub-unit chain of command, as their role is to advise their commander on matters pertaining to the organization&#x27;s non-commissioned members.

====Royal Canadian Mounted Police====
Sergeant major is a rank in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While technically it is the sixth level of rank, below corps sergeant major and above staff sergeant major, it, along with the other two, is a specialized rank and not part of the normal progression, which proceeds from staff sergeant to inspector.

===Singapore===
A sergeant major appointment exists in each military unit from company to division/formation. Their main job is to assist the commander in the discipline and welfare of the enlisted men. Their authority and responsibility at parades and ceremonies extends over even commissioned officers while on the parade square. In the Singapore Armed Forces, two kinds of sergeant major exist, a regimental sergeant major and a company sergeant major. A regimental sergeant major may be placed in charge of a battalion, brigade, division or service level. A regimental sergeant major could also be appointed as RSM for a vocation, i.e. infantry vocation/formation sergeant major. This appointment is usually held by a senior warrant officer or a master warrant officer, although at times a 1st warrant officer may be appointed. A company sergeant major may be a 1WO, 2WO and 3WO. Sometimes, a master sergeant or a staff sergeant may be appointed. Military Experts of rank ME 3 could also be sergeant majors, in-charge of logistical units or naval units. This practice is also mirrored in the National Cadet Corps with the master sergeant or staff sergeant being appointed as unit sergeant major. In schools with more than one NCC unit, i.e. having a land as well as a sea unit, an RSM might be appointed from either unit.

===Sri Lanka===
The rank or appointment of sergeant major exists in the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Police Service. In the army, a warrant officer 2nd class is known as a sergeant major; while a warrant officer 1st class is a regimental sergeant major. In the police, the most senior non-gazetted officer rank is police sergeant major.

===South Africa===

As described above, sergeant-major is not a rank, but an appointment held by a warrant officer class 1 or warrant officer class 2. Regardless of the appointment, the warrant officer is addressed as &quot;sergeant-major&quot; (&quot;sersant-majoor&quot; in Afrikaans).

The rank was established in the Union Defence Forces in 1913, in a single class. The rank badge was a crown, senior appointments being indicated by a wreath around the badge.

The rank was divided into two classes in 1921. The national coat of arms was assigned as the badge of the 1st class, and the crown was assigned to the 2nd class. In both classes, senior appointments were indicated by a wreath around the badge.

From 1957 to 2002, all warrant officers 1st class wore the wreathed coat of arms, and the warrant officer 2nd class wore the plain coat of arms. Since 2002, all warrant officers have worn the new national coat of arms, the classes and appointments being indicated by the shape of the surrounding frame, and the addition of stars and crossed swords above the arms.

Up until 1 June 2008, the highest appointment (level 1), that was held by a warrant officer class 1 was the Sergeant-Major of the South African National Defence Force.

Other senior warrant officer appointments up until 1 June 2008 were:

* Level 2: Sergeant-Major of the Army
* Level 3: Formation sergeant-major
* Level 4: Group or base sergeant-major or regimental sergeant-major

The South African Air Force had a similar structure for its warrant officers who are also addressed as &quot;sergeant-major&quot;.

Starting 1 June 2008, the warrant ranks (Army/ Navy/ Air Force) are:

* Master chief warrant officer (formerly level 1)—&quot;e.g. Master Chief Warrant Officer of the South African National Defence Force&quot;
* Senior chief warrant officer (formerly level 2)—&quot;e.g. Senior Chief Warrant Officer of the South African Army&quot;
* Chief warrant officer (formerly level 3)
* Master warrant officer (formerly level 4A)
* Senior warrant officer (formerly level 4)
* Warrant officer class one
* Warrant officer class two

A company/squadron/battery sergeant major should ordinarily be a WO2.

===United Kingdom===

In the British Army and Royal Marines, company/battery/squadron sergeant major is an appointment for a WO2 and regimental sergeant major is a WO1 appointment.

Due to differences in nomenclature between Regiments and Corps, sergeant majors&#x27; titles do vary; squadron sergeant major and battery sergeant major for instance would be found in the cavalry and Royal Artillery respectively, and in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, there are the appointments of artificer sergeant major.

Sergeant major instructor is an appointment held by warrant officers class 1 in the Small Arms School Corps and the Army Physical Training Corps and by some WO1s in the Royal Engineers. It is also an appointment held by some of the civilian adult instructors in the Army Cadet Force.

A machinist sergeant-major (MSM) is a specialist most often found in the Corps of Royal Engineers or the Royal Army Service Corps, and was the title of one of the major characters in the book and the film based on it, &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot;.

For the use of &quot;sergeant major&quot; as a form of address, see the articles on regimental and company sergeant majors, and that on staff sergeants.

The posts of regimental and squadron corporal major are the Household Cavalry&#x27;s equivalent of sergeant majors, as the Household Cavalry traditionally does not have ranks named sergeant. The Rifles use the spelling serjeant major, in common with the spelling used for serjeant and colour serjeant.

A new post of Army Sergeant Major was created in 2015.

====History====
The first British use of the term was around 1680 and was applied to the senior sergeant in the colonel&#x27;s company of an infantry regiment, but it wasn&#x27;t formalised until 1797, when the sergeant major was added to the battalion or regimental staff. When chevrons were introduced as badges of rank, he wore four, later under a crown.

In 1813, cavalry regiments introduced the troop sergeant major to replace the quartermaster as the senior NCO of a troop; this required the existing position to be explicitly redesignated the regimental sergeant major. Later, the rise of the squadron as the principal sub-regimental unit saw the corresponding introduction of the squadron sergeant major. The infantry, however, hung on to the undifferentiated, one-per-battalion sergeant major until the eve of the First World War, when the introduction of the company sergeant major forced them to adopt the RSM title as well. (As an infantry regiment could be, and usually was, made up of a number of battalions, one would logically expect the new title to be &quot;battalion sergeant major&quot; rather than &quot;regimental sergeant major&quot;. Perhaps the infantry felt this would imply a lower status than their cavalry equivalents.)

In 1881, the cavalry RSM and infantry sergeant major were among a number of senior non-commissioned positions that were confirmed with warrants, making them warrant officers. This was extended and rationalised in 1915, with the introduction of the new ranks of warrant officer class I (WOI) and warrant officer class II (WOII). RSM became an appointment of the former, CSM and SSM of the latter.

The Royal Marines continued to use a single rank of sergeant major, equating to warrant officer class I, until after the Second World War, when they adopted the Army system.

The Royal Flying Corps and its successor the Royal Air Force used the ranks of sergeant-major 1st and 2nd class instead of warrant officer class I and II until the 1930s, when the RAF adopted the Army-style ranks. The RAF has not used sergeant major as either a rank or an appointment since that time.

==France==
In France, the rank of &quot;sergent-major&quot; (distinct from the rank of &quot;major&quot;) was created in 1776. He was the highest ranked non-commissioned officer () in the infantry company; the equivalent in the cavalry was the &quot;maréchal-des-logis-chef&quot;. The sergeant-major was charged with the administration of the company. Under the Ancien Regime, the equivalent at the general staff headquarters of the regiment was the &quot;adjudant sous-officiers&quot;, a rank which was also established in 1776, who was the senior NCO of the regiment.

Following the reforms of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, it became harder to ascend to the officer corps, due to primarily age restrictions. With the addition of an &quot;adjudant&quot; (warrant officer) in each company, the sergeant-major became limited to purely administrative functions.

The rank was replaced with that of &quot;sergent-chef&quot; in 1928. The rank was re-established from 1942 until 1962 between &quot;sergent-chef&quot; and &quot;adjudant&quot; as the NCO in charge of the accounting responsibility of the company. There were no promotions to sergeant-major after 1964 and the rank was formally abolished in 1971. The last NCO to have held the rank retired in 1985.

Notable soldiers who held the rank of sergeant-major included Marshal of France François Achille Bazaine, Édouard Husband, and Henri Tonel.

==United States==
===United States Army===

In the U.S. Army, sergeant major (SGM) refers to both a military rank and a personnel slot, or position title. It is the highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant and master sergeant, with a pay grade of E–9, NATO rank OR–9.

The leadership variation – command sergeant major (CSM) – is the senior enlisted advisor to the commanding officer. The leadership position carries with it certain ceremonial functions such as caring for the unit&#x27;s colors (flag). Additionally, CSMs serve as monitors of, and advocates for, the enlisted soldiers in the command. This position mostly exists in units of battalion size and larger.

SGMs and CSMs serving in nominative positions (a position rated by a general officer or a civilian on the senior executive service payscale) will wear the nominative senior enlisted leader insignia. All other Sergeants Major serving commanders at or below Colonel wear their designated branch insignia.

Both the SGM and CSM are referred to, and addressed as, &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;. The Sergeant Major of the Army is a separate and unique position, but is still addressed as &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;.

===United States Marine Corps===

In the United States Marine Corps, sergeant major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in pay grade to master gunnery sergeant, although the two have different responsibilities. While sergeant major is a rank, the official billet of marines in this position is command senior enlisted leader. Marine Corps sergeants major serve as the senior enlisted marine in the Corps&#x27; units of battalion, squadron or higher echelon, as the unit commander&#x27;s senior enlisted advisor and to handle matters of discipline and morale among the enlisted marines. Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is a separate and unique position.

===History===
The first official U.S. use of the term was in 1776, when a sergeant major was appointed to the headquarters of each infantry battalion (or regiment, the two designations being used interchangeably) of the Continental Army. The original insignia of rank was an epaulette, or strip, of red cloth sewn on each shoulder of the uniform coat. In the years between 1776 and 1851, the sergeant major rank insignia went through several changes until the &quot;classic&quot; pattern worn during the Civil War and throughout the Indian Wars was adopted. Generally, these styles included either staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) epaulettes, chevrons, or a combination of both. (During this period, the rank insignia for the several SNCO ranks of sergeant major, quartermaster sergeant, drum major, and fife major were identical.) In 1821, SNCOs received a single yellow chevron, point up, above the elbow on each sleeve. (Company grade officers, including the new officer grade of &quot;adjutant&quot;, ranking above captain and below major, and non-commissioned officers or NCOs, viz., sergeants and corporals, all received chevrons of various colors, materials, patterns, and placement as their insignia of rank.) In 1825, the sergeant major chevron insignia was changed to be identical to that of the adjutant, by adding an inverted arc below the chevron (very similar in design to the modern private first class insignia), although in a different color (yellow vice gold or silver) and material (worsted vice lace) than that of the officer rank. In 1832, SNCOs returned to a rank insignia denoted by elaborate epaulettes without the chevrons. All SNCOs and NCOs returned to having chevrons as their rank insignia in 1847, when a completely new system of insignia was introduced. This was the first implementation of the three chevrons over three arcs design (with the chevrons worn point-up) of the &quot;traditional&quot; sergeant major rank insignia. (The quartermaster finally received a distinctive rank insignia—three chevrons over three horizontal bars—and for the first time, the first sergeant, or orderly sergeant, received a distinctive rank insignia—three chevrons surmounting a lozenge.) Finally, in 1851, the Army inverted the SNCO and NCO insignia again to be point-down.

The rank was in use by both the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. At that time, it was the highest enlisted rank, being just above quartermaster sergeant. The same rank insignia, three point-down chevrons under three arcs, was used by both armies. Both armies varied the color of the stripes by assigning red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, and blue for infantry. Some Confederate militia units varied these colors even farther and had other colors, including black stripes, for various units.

In 1920, with the standardization of the army&#x27;s enlisted pay grades, it ceased to be a title of rank or grade. However, it survived as the job title of the senior NCO of a battalion and was re-introduced as a rank in 1958 when Congress authorized the E–8 and E–9 pay grades (P.L. 85-422, 72 Stat. 122). This new iteration of sergeant major as a discrete grade of rank saw the new rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with a five pointed star between the chevrons and arcs. In that law (as amended), the authorized daily average number of enlisted members on active duty in an armed force in pay grade E–9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 1.25 percent, respectively, of the number of enlisted members of that armed force, subject to certain exceptions. A new insignia was authorized by DA Message 865848, 28 May 1968, for sergeants major assigned at the principal NCO of battalion and higher level command (viz., command sergeants major). This insignia was the same as the sergeant major insignia except the star was small and a wreath was placed around the star.

The appointment of Sergeant Major of the Army was created on July 4, 1966, and in 1979 received the unique grade of rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with two stars centered between the bottom chevron and the upper arc. In 1994 The insignia for Sergeant Major of the Army was changed to add the coat of arms of the United States between the two stars in the center of the insignia. The pin-on insignia is polished gold-plated with a black enamel background.

The U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; first sergeant major was Archibald Sommers, appointed on January 1, 1801. This was originally a solitary post, similar to the modern Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, but by 1899 there were five sergeants major. The title was abolished in 1946, but re-introduced as a rank in 1954. The post of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps was established in 1957, as the senior enlisted advisor to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

<doc id="288448" wikidata="Q1152468" url="?curid=288448" title="Windows Script Host">
<text>The Microsoft Windows Script Host (WSH) (formerly named Windows Scripting Host) is an automation technology for Microsoft Windows operating systems that provides scripting abilities comparable to batch files, but with a wider range of supported features. This tool was first provided on Windows 95 after Build 950a on the installation discs as an optional installation configurable and installable by means of the Control Panel, and then a standard component of Windows 98 (Build 1111) and subsequent and Windows NT 4.0 Build 1381 and by means of Service Pack 4. WSH is also a means of automation for Internet Explorer via the installed WSH engines from IE Version 3.0 onwards; at this, time VBScript became s means of automation for Microsoft Outlook 97. WSH is also an optional install provided with a VBScript and JScript engine for Windows CE 3.0 and following; some third-party engines, including Rexx and other forms of BASIC, are also available.

It is language-independent in that it can make use of different Active Scripting language engines. By default, it interprets and runs plain-text JScript (.JS and files) and VBScript (.VBS and files).

Users can install different scripting engines to enable them to script in other languages, for instance PerlScript. The language-independent filename extension WSF can also be used. The advantage of the Windows Script File (.WSF) is that it allows multiple scripts (&quot;jobs&quot;) as well as a combination of scripting languages within a single file.

WSH engines include various implementations for the Rexx, ooRexx (up to version 4.0.0), BASIC, Perl, Ruby, Tcl, PHP, JavaScript, Delphi, Python, XSLT, and other languages.

Windows Script Host is distributed and installed by default on Windows 98 and later versions of Windows. It is also installed if Internet Explorer 5 (or a later version) is installed. Beginning with Windows 2000, the Windows Script Host became available for use with user login scripts.

==Usage==
Windows Script Host may be used for a variety of purposes, including logon scripts, administration and general automation. Microsoft describes it as an &quot;administration tool&quot;. WSH provides an environment for scripts to run – it invokes the appropriate script engine and provides a set of services and objects for the script to work with. These scripts may be run in GUI mode (&quot;WScript&quot;.exe) or command line mode (&quot;CScript&quot;.exe), or from a COM object (&quot;wshom&quot;.ocx), offering flexibility to the user for interactive or non-interactive scripts. Windows Management Instrumentation is also scriptable by this means. 

WSH, the engines, and related functionality are also listed as objects which can be accessed and scripted and queried by means of the VBA and Visual Studio object explorers and those for similar tools like the various script debuggers, e.g. Microsoft Script Debugger, and editors.

WSH implements an object model which exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces. So in addition to ASP, IIS, Internet Explorer, CScript and WScript, WSH can be used to automate and communicate with any Windows application with COM and other exposed objects, such as using PerlScript to query Microsoft Access by various means including various ODBC engines and SQL, ooRexxScript to create what are in effect Rexx macros in Microsoft Excel, Quattro Pro, Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes and any of the like, the XLNT script to get environment variables and print them in a new TextPad document, and so on.

The VBA functionality of Microsoft Office, Open Office (as well as Python and other installable macro languages) and Corel WordPerfect Office is separate from WSH engines although Outlook 97 uses VBScript rather than VBA as its macro language. 

Python in the form of ActiveState PythonScript can be used to automate and query the data in SecureCRT, as with other languages with installed engines, e.g. PerlScript, ooRexxScript, PHPScript, RubyScript, LuaScript, XLNT and so on. One notable exception is Paint Shop Pro, which can be automated in Python by means of a macro interpreter within the PSP programme itself rather than using the PythonScript WSH engine or an external Python implementation such as Python interpreters supplied with Unix emulation and integration software suites or other standalone Python implementations et al. as an intermediate and indeed can be programmed like this even in the absence of any third-party Python installation; the same goes for the Rexx-programmable terminal emulator Passport. The SecureCRT terminal emulator, SecureFX FTP client, and related client and server programmes from Van Dyke are as of the current versions automated by means of WSH so any language with an installed engine may be used; the software comes with VBScript, JScript, and PerlScript examples.

As of the most recent releases and going back a number of versions now, the programmability of 4NT / Take Command in the latest implementations (by means of &quot;@REXX&quot; and similar for Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Lua, VBScript, JScript, and the like) generally uses the WSH engine. The ZOC terminal emulator gets its ability to be programmed in Rexx by means of an external interpreter, one of which is supplied with the programme, and alternate Rexx interpreters can be specified in the configuration of the programme. The MKS Toolkit provides PScript, a WSH engine in addition to the standard Perl interpreter perl.exe which comes with the package.

VBScript, JScript, and some third-party engines have the ability to create and execute scripts in an encoded format which prevents editing with a text editor; the file extensions for these encoded scripts is and and others of that type.

Unless otherwise specified, any WSH scripting engine can be used with the various Windows server software packages to provide CGI scripting. The current versions of the default WSH engines and all or most of the third-party engines have socket abilities as well; as a CGI script or otherwise, PerlScript is the choice of many programmers for this purpose and the VBScript and various Rexx-based engines are also rated as sufficiently powerful in connectivity and text-processing abilities to also be useful. This also goes for file access and processing—the earliest WSH engines for VBScript and JScript do not since the base language did not, whilst PerlScript, ooRexxScript, and the others have this from the beginning.

WinWrap Basic, SaxBasic and others are similar to Visual Basic for Applications, These tools are used to add scripting and macro abilities to software being developed and can be found in earlier versions of Host Explorer for example. Many other languages can also be used in this fashion. Other languages used for scripting of programmes include Rexx, Tcl, Perl, Python, Ruby, and others which come with methods to control objects in the operating system and the spreadsheet and database programmes. One exception is that the Zoc terminal emulator is controlled by a Rexx interpreter supplied with the package or another interpreter specified by the user; this is also the case with the Passport emulator.

VBScript is the macro language in Microsoft Outlook 97, whilst WordBasic is used for Word up to 6, PowerPoint and other tools. Excel to 5.0 uses Visual Basic 5.0. In Office 2000 forward, true Visual Basic for Applications 6.0 is used for all components. Other components use Visual Basic for Applications. OpenOffice uses Visual Basic, Python, and several others as macro languages and others can be added. LotusScript is very closely related to VBA and used for Lotus Notes and Lotus SmartSuite, which includes Lotus Word Pro (the current descendant of Ami Pro), Lotus Approach, Lotus FastSite, Lotus 1-2-3, &amp;c, and pure VBA, licensed from Microsoft, is used in Corel products such as WordPerfect, Paradox, Quattro Pro &amp;c.

Any scripting language installed under Windows can be accessed by external means of PerlScript, PythonScript, VBScript and the other engines available can be used to access databases (Lotus Notes, Microsoft Access, Oracle Database, Paradox) and spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro Pro) and other tools like word processors, terminal emulators, command shells and so on. This can be accomplished by means of WSH, so any language can be used if there is an installed engine.

In recent versions of the Take Command enhanced command prompt and tools, the &quot;script&quot; command typed at the shell prompt will produce a list of the currently installed engines, one to a line and therefore CR-LF delimited.

==Examples==

The first example is very simple; it shows some VBScript which uses the root WSH COM object &quot;WScript&quot; to display a message with an &#x27;OK&#x27; button. Upon launching this script the CScript or WScript engine would be called and the runtime environment provided.

Content of a file codice_1

WScript.Echo &quot;Hello world&quot;
WScript.Quit
WSH programming can also use the JScript language.

Content of a file codice_2

WSH.Echo(&quot;Hello world&quot;);
WSH.Quit();
Or, code can be mixed in one WSF file, such as VBScript and JScript, or any other:

Content of a file codice_3

&lt;job&gt;
&lt;script language=&quot;VBScript&quot;&gt;
 MsgBox &quot;hello world (from vb)&quot;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script language=&quot;JScript&quot;&gt;
 WSH.echo(&quot;hello world (from js)&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/job&gt;
==Security concerns==
Windows applications and processes may be automated using a script in Windows Script Host. Viruses and malware could be written to exploit this ability. Thus, some suggest disabling it for security reasons. Alternatively, antivirus programs may offer features to control .vbs and other scripts which run in the WSH environment.

Since version 5.6 of WSH, scripts can be digitally signed programmatically using the &quot;Scripting.Signer&quot; object in a script itself, provided a valid certificate is present on the system. Alternatively, the signcode tool from the Platform SDK, which has been extended to support WSH filetypes, may be used at the command line.

By using &quot;Software Restriction Policies&quot; introduced with Windows XP, a system may be configured to execute only those scripts which are stored in trusted locations, have a known MD5 hash, or have been digitally signed by a trusted publisher, thus preventing the execution of untrusted scripts.

==Available scripting engines==

Note: By definition, all of these scripting engines can be utilised in CGI programming under Windows with any number of programmes and set up, meaning that the source code files for a script used on a server for CGI purposes could bear other file extensions such as .cgi and so on. The aforementioned ability of the Windows Script Host to run a script with multiple languages in it in files with a extension. Extended Html and XML also add to the additional possibilities when working with scripts for network use, as do Active Server Pages and so forth. Moreover, Windows shell scripts and scripts written in shells with enhanced capabilities like TCC, 4NT, etc. and Unix shells under interoperability software like the MKS Toolkit can have scripts embedded in them as well.

There have been suggestions of creating engines for other languages, such as LotusScript, SaxBasic, BasicScript, KiXtart, awk, bash, csh and other Unix shells, 4NT, cmd.exe (the Windows NT shell), Windows PowerShell, DCL, C, C++, Fortran and others.
The XLNT language is based on DCL and provides a very large subset of the language along with additional commands and statements and the software can be used in three ways: the WSH engine (*.xcs), the console interpreter (*.xlnt) and as a server and client side CGI engine (*.xgi).

When a server implementing CGI such as the Windows Internet Information Server, ports of Apache and others, all or most of the engines can be used; the most commonly used are VBScript, JScript, PythonScript, PerlScript, ActivePHPScript, and ooRexxScript. The MKS Toolkit PScript program also runs Perl. Command shells like cmd.exe, 4NT, ksh, and scripting languages with string processing and preferably socket functionality are also able to be used for CGI scripting; compiled languages like C++, Visual Basic, and Java can also be used like this. All Perl interpreters, ooRexx, PHP, and more recent versions of VBScript and JScript can use sockets for TCP/IP and usually UDP and other protocols for this.

==Version history==
The redistributable version of WSH version 5.6 can be installed on Windows 95/98/Me and Windows NT 4.0/2000. WSH 5.7 is downloadable for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Recently , redistributable versions for older operating systems (Windows 9x and Windows NT 4.0) are no longer available from the Microsoft Download Center.

Since Windows XP Service Pack 3, release 5.7 is the only version available from Microsoft, with newer revisions being included in newer versions of Windows since.

<text>Bainite is a plate-like microstructure that forms in steels at temperatures of 125–550 °C (depending on alloy content). First described by E. S. Davenport and Edgar Bain, it is one of the products that may form when austenite (the face-centered cubic crystal structure of iron) is cooled past a temperature where it is no longer thermodynamically stable with respect to ferrite, cementite, or ferrite and cementite. Davenport and Bain originally described the microstructure as similar in appearance to tempered martensite.

A fine non-lamellar structure, bainite commonly consists of cementite and dislocation-rich ferrite. The large density of dislocations in the ferrite present in bainite, and the fine size of the bainite platelets, makes this ferrite harder than it normally would be.

The temperature range for transformation of austenite to bainite (125–550 °C) is between those for pearlite and martensite. In fact, there is no fundamental lower limit to the bainite-start temperature. When formed during continuous cooling, the cooling rate to form bainite is more rapid than that required to form pearlite, but less rapid than is required to form martensite (in steels of the same composition). Most alloying elements will retard the formation of bainite, though carbon is the most effective in doing so. Aluminium or cobalt are exceptions in that they can accelerate the decomposition of austenite and raise the transformation temperature.

The microstructures of martensite and bainite at first seem quite similar, consisting of thin plates which in low-alloy steels cluster together. This is a consequence of the two microstructures sharing many aspects of their transformation mechanisms. However, morphological differences do exist that require a transmission electron microscope to see. Under a light microscope, the microstructure of bainite appears darker than untempered martensite because the bainite has more substructure.

The hardness of bainite can be between that of pearlite and untempered martensite in the same steel hardness. The fact that it can be produced during both isothermal or continuous cooling is a big advantage, because this facilitates the production of large components without excessive additions of alloying elements. Unlike martensitic steels, alloys based on bainite often do not need further heat treatment after transformation in order to optimise strength and toughness.

==History==
In the 1920s Davenport and Bain discovered a new steel microstructure that they provisionally called martensite-troostite, because it is intermediate between the known low-temperature martensite phase and what was then known as troostite (later fine-pearlite). This microstructure was subsequently named bainite by Bain&#x27;s colleagues at the United States Steel Corporation, although it took some time for the name to be taken up by the scientific community with books as late as 1947 failing to mention bainite by name.

Bain and Davenport also noted the existence of two distinct forms: &#x27;upper-range&#x27; bainite which formed at higher temperatures and &#x27;lower-range&#x27; bainite which formed near the martensite start temperature (these forms are now known as upper- and lower-bainite respectively). The early terminology was further confused by the overlap, in some alloys, of the lower-range of the pearlite reaction and the upper-range of the bainite with the additional possibility of proeutectoid ferrite.

==Formation==
Above approximately 900 °C a typical low-carbon steel is composed entirely of austenite, a high-temperature phase of iron that has a cubic close-packed crystal structure. On cooling, it tends to transform into a mixture of phases, ferrite and cementite, depending on the exact chemical composition. A steel of eutectoid composition will under equilibrium conditions transform into pearlite – an interleaved mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). In addition to the thermodynamic considerations indicated by the phase diagram, the phase transformations in steel are heavily influenced by the chemical kinetics. This is because the diffusion of iron atoms becomes difficult below about 600 °C under typical processing conditions. As a consequence, a complex array of microstructures occurs when the atomic mobility is limited. This leads to the complexity of steel microstructures which are strongly influenced by the cooling rate. This can be illustrated by a continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram which plots the time required to form a phase when a sample is cooled at a specific rate thus showing regions in time-temperature space from which the expected phase fractions can be deduced for a given thermal cycle.

If the steel is cooled slowly or isothermally transformed at elevated temperatures, the microstructure obtained will be closer to equilibrium, containing for example of allotriomorphic ferrite, cementite and pearlite. However, the transformation from austenite to pearlite is a time-dependent reconstructive reaction which requires the large scale movement of the iron and carbon atoms. While the interstitial carbon diffuses readily even at moderate temperatures the self-diffusion of iron becomes extremely slow at temperatures below 600 °C until, for all practical purposes, it stops. As a consequence, a rapidly cooled steel may reach a temperature where pearlite can no longer form even though the reaction is incomplete and the remaining austenite is thermodynamically unstable.

Austenite that is cooled sufficiently rapidly to avoid higher temperature transformations, can form martensite, without any diffusion of either iron or carbon, by the deformation of the austenite&#x27;s face-centred crystal structure into a distorted body-centred tetragonal or body-centred cubic structure. This non-equilibrium phase can only form at low temperatures, where the driving force for the reaction is sufficient to overcome the considerable lattice strain imposed by the transformation. The transformation is essentially time-independent with the phase fraction depending only the degree of cooling below the critical martensite start temperature. Further, it occurs without the diffusion of either substitutional or interstitial atoms and so martensite inherits the composition of the parent austenite.

Bainite occupies a region between these two process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. The bainite, like martensite, grows without diffusion but some of the carbon then partitions into any residual austenite, or precipitates as cementite. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite&#x27;s transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.

===Displacive theory===
One of the theories on the specific formation mechanism for bainite is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite. The crystal structure change is achieved by a deformation rather than by diffusion. The shape change associated with bainite is an invariant—plane strain with a large shear component. This kind of deformation implies a disciplined motion of atoms (rather than a chaotic transfer associated with diffusion), and is typical of all displacive transformations in steels, for example, martensite, bainite and Widmanstaetten ferrite. There is a strain energy associated with such relief, that leads to the plate shape of the transformation product Any diffusion is subsequent to the diffusionless transformation of austenite, for example the partitioning of carbon from supersaturated bainitic ferrite, or the precipitation of carbides; this is analogous to the tempering of martensite.

There are many features of bainite that are correctly predicted by this theory, including:
* the plate shape, which is a consequence of the minimisation of strain energy due to the shape deformation accompanying transformation.
* The fact that excess carbon is retained inside the even defect-free regions of bainitic ferrite.
* The fact that the unit cell of bainitic ferrite can be tetragonal rather than cubic.
* The fact that the bainite transformation can be dramatically retarded when the austenite is first plastically deformed, a phenomenon known as mechanical stabilisation, which is unique to displacive transformations.
* The obvious fact that displacements occur when bainite grows. The transformation is a combination of deformation and crystal structure change, just like martensite.

===Diffusive theory===
The diffusive theory of bainite&#x27;s transformation process is based on the assumption that a bainitic ferrite plate grows with a similar mechanism as Widmanstätten ferrite at higher temperatures. Its growth rate thus depends on how rapidly carbon can diffuse from the growing ferrite into the austenite. A common misconception is that this mechanism excludes the possibility of coherent interfaces and a surface relief. In fact it is accepted by some that formation of Widmanstätten ferrite is controlled by carbon diffusion and do show a similar surface relief.

===Morphology===
Typically bainite manifests as aggregates, termed &quot;sheaves&quot;, of ferrite plates (&quot;sub-units&quot;) separated by retained austenite, martensite or cementite. While the sub-units appear separate when viewed on a 2-dimensional section they are in fact interconnected in 3-dimensions and usually take on a lenticular plate or lath morphology. The sheaves themselves are wedge-shaped with the thicker end associated with the nucleation site.

The thickness of the ferritic plates is found to increase with the transformation temperature. Neural network models have indicated that this is not a direct effect of the temperature per se but rather a result of the temperature dependence of the driving force for the reaction and the strength of the austenite surrounding the plates. At higher temperatures, and hence lower undercooling, the reduced thermodynamic driving force causes a decrease in the nucleation rate which allows individual plates to grow larger before they physically impinge on each other. Further, the growth of the plates must be accommodated by plastic flow in the surrounding austenite which is difficult if the austenite is strong and resists the plate&#x27;s growth.

===Upper bainite===
&quot;Upper bainite&quot; forms around 400–550 °C in sheaves. These sheaves contain several laths of ferrite that are approximately parallel to each other and which exhibit a Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship with the surrounding austenite, though this relationship degrades as the transformation temperature is lowered. The ferrite in these sheaves has a carbon concentration below 0.03%, resulting in carbon-rich austenite around the laths.

The amount of cementite that forms between the laths is based on the carbon content of the steel. For a low carbon steel, typically discontinuous &quot;stringers&quot; or small particles of cementite will be present between laths. For steel with a higher carbon content, the stringers become continuous along the length of the adjacent laths.

===Lower bainite===
Lower bainite forms between 250 and 400 °C and takes a more plate-like form than upper bainite. There are not nearly as many low angle boundaries between laths in lower bainite. In lower bainite, the habit plane in ferrite will also shift from &lt;111&gt; towards &lt;110&gt; as transformation temperature decreases. In lower bainite, cementite nucleates on the interface between ferrite and austenite.

===Incomplete transformation===

In the present context, &quot;incomplete transformation&quot; refers to the fact that in the absence of carbide precipitation, the bainite reaction stops well before the austenite reaches its equilibrium or paraequilibrium chemical composition. It stops at the point where the free energies of austenite and ferrite of identical composition become the same, i.e. transformation without a change in chemical composition of the participating phases becomes thermodynamically impossible.

Early research on bainite found that at a given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the austenite would transform to bainite with the remainder decomposing to pearlite after an extended delay. This was the case despite the fact that a complete austenite to pearlite transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the austenite was &quot;more&quot; stable. The fraction of bainite that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the bainitic ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding austenite thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation.

===Difference between martensite and bainite===

Bainite can essentially be regarded as martensite that tempers during the course of transformation. It forms at a higher temperature than martensite, and even the latter can autotemper. Because the transformation temperature is higher, the austenite itself is mechanically weak so that the shape deformation due to bainite is relaxed by the plastic deformation of the adjacent austenite. As a consequence, the growing plate of bainite is confronted by a forest of dislocations that eventually terminates its growth even before the plate has hit an austenite grain boundary. Plates of bainite can therefore be smaller than those of martensite in the same steel. The transformation then proceeds by a sub-unit mechanism involving the successive nucleation of new plates.

==Applications==
With increasing bainite content in steel, the hardness, yield and tensile strength remain almost constant for bainite content up to 50%, and then increase by ca. 30%. Hence meter-size shafts and plates of high-bainite steels have been commercially mass-produced by Rolls-Royce Holdings and Tata Steel.

In the railway industry, bainite steel is commonly alloyed with vanadium to produce rails of very high strength, with good wear and rolling contact fatigue resistance. Bainite rails fabricated by Corus were installed in the Channel Tunnel in 2006, and after 3 years showed no evidence of the cracks found in standard rails of the same age.

<text>iMovie is a free video editing application made by Apple for the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad. It includes a range of video effects and tools like color correction and image stabilization, but is designed to be accessible to users with little or no video editing experience. iMovie&#x27;s professional equivalent is Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro X.

iMovie was originally released in 1999 for Mac OS 8, and bundled with the iMac DV. With version 3, iMovie became part of Apple&#x27;s now-defunct iLife suite, alongside other multimedia apps. iMovie &#x27;08 was a complete rewrite, and lacked many of the features of previous versions, which returned in iMovie &#x27;09 and iMovie &#x27;11. The iOS version of iMovie came out in 2010.

iMovie is pre-installed on all new Macs, iPhones, and iPads, and is available for free on the App Store.

==History==
=== iMovie (1999) ===
The first version of iMovie was released in 1999 as a Mac OS 8 application bundled with the first FireWire-enabled consumer Mac model, the iMac DV. Both iMovie and the iMac DV were announced at Apple&#x27;s special event on October 5, 1999 at the Flint Center.

=== iMovie 2 (2001) ===
iMovie 2 added the ability to interleave video and audio tracks on the timeline.

=== iMovie 3 (2003) ===
iMovie 3 was plagued by performance issues and bugs.

=== iMovie 4 (2004) ===
iMovie 4 introduced nondestructive video editing. In prior versions of iMovie, trimming a clip removed the trimmed portion permanently. Beginning in version 4, iMovie introduced Direct Trimming, implementing editing functionality closer to professional-grade editing software.

===iMovie HD 5 (2005)===

Beginning with version 5, iMovie was renamed to iMovie HD, to highlight its new support for HDV (720p and 1080i) camcorders. It gained features to integrate it with the rest of the iLife suite, with toolbox buttons allowing the importing of images from iPhoto, music from iTunes and the setting of chapter markers ready for exporting to iDVD. iMovie HD 5 imported MJPEG files as DV by default, which introduces noise; MJPEG files are cryptically lumped with &quot;iSight&quot; files in this version.

It gained the &quot;Magic iMovie&quot; feature, which attempted to automate the whole process of video editing, by allowing a common transition to be added between scenes, a music track to be synchronised with the video and a DVD to be created with the accompanying iDVD software.

Later versions added support for footage from AVCHD camcorders, and H.264-compressed video from MPEG-4 or QuickTime File Format files (.mov), as generated by a number of digital photo cameras with HD video recording feature. To facilitate this, iMovie includes the Apple Intermediate Codec on the system as a QuickTime component. iMovie transcodes HD video upon import using this codec and stores it in the QuickTime file format.

===iMovie HD 6 (2006)===
iMovie 6 was released in January 2006 as part of the iLife &#x27;06 suite, and was also originally optionally included with iLife &#x27;08 as a substitution for iMovie &#x27;08 (due to the new version&#x27;s incompatibility with older Power PC Macintosh computers). However, this option was removed after iLife &#x27;09 was released. It was integrated with iPhoto, iTunes, iDVD, GarageBand and iWeb. iMovie HD 6 was designed for ease of use, and included new themes. Themes allow the user to drop movie clips or photos into professionally designed backdrops. Each theme included full-motion graphic bumpers and transitions. iMovie HD 6 also added real-time effects, which took advantage of the computer&#x27;s graphics processing unit to perform some effects without rendering. It also introduced real-time titling, enhanced audio tools and effects, the ability to have multiple projects open at once, video podcasts and blogs (using integration with iWeb), and a refined look based on iTunes 5 and 6.

===iMovie &#x27;08 (2007)===
iMovie &#x27;08 (version 7.0) was released in August 2007 as a part of the iLife &#x27;08 suite. iMovie &#x27;08 was a complete redesign and rewrite of iMovie. It had much better HD output, and more formats to convert to. This was limited, however, by an undocumented restriction on supported codecs. iPhoto uses the QuickTime library and can create thumbnails for all QuickTime supported formats, but most of these cannot be used by iMovie &#x27;08. Some of the formats that iMovie &#x27;08 was able to import will not be recognized when they are added to an iPhoto library. Motion JPEG-encoded AVI files were recognized, and were the most common format used by digital cameras. A new feature called &quot;skimming&quot; for quickly previewing video in the library at a user controlled speed was added, and so was a feature that allows the user to highlight parts of video clips just like highlighting text. iMovie 08 also had the ability to add more than two layers of background sound, including multiple music, narration and sounds; previous versions could play multiple tracks but could display only two extra audio tracks. It included more exportation formats, including iPhone-sized video. It also supported non-tape-based HD video, such as AVCHD and footage from DVD and HDD camcorders. iMovie &#x27;08 also had the ability to export movies to the YouTube video sharing website.

iMovie 08 was criticized due to its drastic abandonment of some iMovie HD 6 features. Former New York Times reviewer David Pogue said &quot;iMovie &#x27;08 is an utter bafflement... incapable of the more sophisticated editing that the old iMovie made so enjoyable...All visual effects are gone — even basic options like slow motion, reverse motion, fast motion, and black-and-white. And you can&#x27;t have more than one project open at a time.&quot; Features removed included the classic timeline, the ability to create DVD chapter markers, support for plugins, and in-timeline audio adjustment and control. iMovie &#x27;08 imported a much more limited set of video codecs and metadata formats than previous versions of iMovie or the then-current version QuickTime Player. For example, QuickTime Player could be extended to support the FLIP Video 3ivx MPEG-4 codec, but iMovie &#x27;08 could not. iMovie &#x27;08 also removed the ability to import DV footage. As a result, all resulting videos had lossy compression applied and there was no facility for managing full format video. The peculiar lack of QuickTime support means QuickTime Pro could edit a larger range of video than iMovie &#x27;08.

Apple released iMovie HD 6 as a free download to those who had purchased iMovie &#x27;08. However, in response to the release of the subsequent newer version of iMovie &#x27;09, Apple removed the download in late January 2009 while also reducing the $299 price tag for Final Cut Express to $199. Several of the features removed from iMovie &#x27;08 that were previously included with iMovie HD 6 have been restored into iMovie &#x27;09 and, more recently, iMovie &#x27;11.

===iMovie &#x27;09 (2009)===
iMovie &#x27;09 (version 8.0) was released January 2009 as part of the iLife &#x27;09 package. It introduced some new features and restored some features from previous versions of iMovie, including basic video effects (such as fast/slow motion and aged film) and image stabilization as well as travel map functions for marking locations where a video was shot. iMovie &#x27;09 also introduced simple implementations of more advanced features such as picture-in-picture and Chroma keying. It also improved editing with a precision cut editor and a clip trimmer, improved support for hard drive-based cameras such as the Flip Mino, added some new titles and transitions, and added full iDVD support (which was unavailable in iMovie &#x27;08). In addition, it introduced a Full-Screen Library Browser with which the user can find and examine all of his or her video in one place.

===iMovie &#x27;11 (2010)===
iMovie &#x27;11 (version 9.0) was released on October 20, 2010, as part of the iLife &#x27;11 package. It has the ability to make trailers for home movies, more control over audio, instant replay and flash and hold effects, facial recognition, news themes, and the ability to watch the video on a Mac, iPad, iPhone/iPod touch, or Apple TV, as well as sharing on Facebook and YouTube. It now supports the AVCHD Lite format.

Apple worked with Abbey Road Studios in London, England, to bring original music/film scores to iMovie &#x27;11. The music is most notably used in the &quot;trailers&quot; feature provided by the software.

On January 6, 2011, Apple made iMovie &#x27;11 (along with Aperture, the iWork suite, and the rest of the iLife suite) available on the newly-released Mac App Store.

Prior versions of iMovie had the ability to split an event so that the unwanted portion of a long event could be deleted in order to save memory. This feature was removed in iMovie &#x27;11 and is no longer available in iMovie or Final Cut Pro X (FCPX). But in FCPX, as a workaround, you can cut out all but the desired part of a project, export that project in ProRes 422 format, and then import that export. This can be used as a smaller source clip instead of the original larger one.

===iMovie 10.x (2013–present)===
iMovie 10.0 was released on October 22, 2013, by Apple Inc. This version of iMovie was a complete redesign with more options to share a movie, more movie and trailer theme options from iMovie for iOS, easier to make picture-in-pictures, cutaways, side-by-sides etc., more realistic green-screen effects and easier refinements. Because it was not compatible with projects created with iMovie 9, upgrading to iMovie 10 did not replace the earlier version, but instead moved it to a folder where it could still be used.

iMovie 10.1 was released on October 13, 2015. It added support for 4K video editing and included a major user interface overhaul, as well as the removal of some peripheral features. Later updates to iMovie 10.1 fixed bugs and made incremental changes. Versions 10.1.12 and 10.1.16 work on macOS Catalina 10.15.7.

iMovie 10.2, released on November 12, 2020, became natively compatible with Apple silicon Macs, and added new backgrounds. Versions 10.2.3 and 10.2.5 work on macOS Catalina 10.15.7.

iMovie 10.3 and later updates added support for Cinematic Mode, Magic Movie and Storyboard, and made performance improvements. Versions 10.3 and above require macOS 11 Big Sur.

iMovie 10.4 was released on November 13, 2024, and improved on stability and performance features. Versions 10.4 and above require macOS Sonoma 14.6 or later, 4 Gigabytes of RAM, and 4.6 Gigabytes of disc space.

== Features and capabilities ==

iMovie includes options to modify and enhance video color settings, crop and rotate of a video clip, stabilize shaky videos, add video transitions (such as fade, doorway, slide, swap, mosaic, cube, and page curls), and changing the speed (speed up or slow down) of clips. There are multi-clip video effects, such as creating a cutaway, using a green/blue screen to cut out a subject and replace the background with a different clip, creating a split-screen, and picture-in-picture effect.

iMovie contains a large number of built-in sound effects, and also has the ability to record a voiceover or add a music soundtrack. It also has the ability to manipulate and enhance the audio of a project by reducing background noise and boosting audio levels of quiet clips.

iMovie projects can export finished movies or clips to QuickTime file format (.mp4), or export single frames as JPEGs.

With iMovie having versions on Apple&#x27;s mobile and desktop operating systems Apple introduced a feature which allowed users to import iMovie projects from iOS to macOS. Similarly, if a project ends up requiring more advanced editing than iMovie can provide, iMovie projects can be imported in Final Cut Pro X.

=== Use cases ===
==== Trailers ====
iMovie allows for the creation of movie trailers through included templates. The trailers feature in iMovie allows for clips to be easily dropped into the timeline which consists of storyboard panes which have a label that lists which type of clip should be placed in each pane. The template also includes an outline for adding titles and credits to the trailer.

==== App previews ====
iMovie can be used to create app previews for use in Apple&#x27;s App Store. App previews allow developers to give users a brief overview of an app through video rather than images.

== Supported media formats ==
macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS to offer built-in compatibility with many older media codecs, including RealVideo, DivX, Sorenson 3, and FlashPix. Support for these codecs had been implemented in 32-bit macOS components, which Apple did not update to 64-bit, and removed entirely in macOS Catalina. In March 2019, seven months before Catalina&#x27;s release, Apple released an iMovie update that notified users about the change, and automatically converted these older formats to newer codecs.

== iOS and iPadOS version==

At WWDC 2010, Steve Jobs announced that iMovie would be released on iOS later that month, with the basic features of the Mac version. The first iPhone version was released on June 23, 2010 and was only compatible with the simultaneously-released iPhone 4, the first iPhone that could record HD video. It was released for the iPad on March 11, 2011, to coincide with the release of the iPad 2. 

iMovie gained support for 4K resolution in version 2.2, switched to using the Metal graphics API in version 2.2.5, external displays in version 2.2.6, and green screen effects in version 2.2.7.

iMovie 3, released in April 2022, gained pre-made templates, called Storyboards, to simplify the movie creation process, and the Magic Movie feature, which automatically adds transitions to clips and combines them into a finished video.

<doc id="288456" wikidata="Q419723" url="?curid=288456" title="Bromochlorodifluoromethane">
<text>Bromochlorodifluoromethane (BCF), also referred to by the code numbers Halon 1211 and [[Freon]] 12B1, is a haloalkane with the chemical formula CF2ClBr. It is used for fire suppression, especially for expensive equipment or items that could be damaged by the residue from other types of extinguishers. It is stored as a liquid under pressure and vaporizes when discharged to suppress fires.
The use of halons, including Halon 1211, has decreased over time due to their adverse impact on the ozone layer. Alternatives have been developed to mitigate environmental concerns while still providing effective fire suppression capabilities.
==Use as a fire extinguishing agent==
Brominated haloalkanes were first used during World War II in fire extinguishers for aircraft and tanks. BCF was introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid-1960s for use around highly valuable materials in places such as museums, mainframe rooms, and telecommunication switching centers. BCFs were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire extinguishing agent has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire extinguishing agent on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire extinguishing agent are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.

BCF is an excellent fire extinguishing agent, as it is a streaming agent with low toxicity, a low pressure, liquefied gas, and effective on all common types of fires, A, B, and C. It is mainly used in portable and wheeled extinguishers, and small spot protection units for aviation and marine engine applications, and was never widely used in fixed systems like Halon 1301 was.

BCF has fairly low toxicity. The lethal concentration for 15 minute exposure is about 32%.

==Synthesis==
BCF is commercially synthesized in a two-step process from chloroform. Chloroform is fluorinated with hydrogen fluoride. The resulting chlorodifluoromethane is then reacted with elemental bromine at 400-600 °C, with reaction time limited to about 3 seconds. The overall yield is over 90%.

===Regulation===
The production of BCF and similar chlorofluorocarbons has been banned in most countries since January 1, 1994 as part of the Montreal Protocol on ozone depleting substances. Halon 1211 is also a potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential 2,070 times that of carbon dioxide and an atmospheric lifetime of 16.0 years.

Recycling of Halon 1211 allows it to remain in use, although parts availability is limited to a few manufacturers and can be an issue. Halon 1211 is still widely used in the United States, despite its high cost, with the US military being the biggest user. Europe and Australia have banned its use for all but &quot;critical applications&quot; such as aviation, military, and police use. The manufacture of UL Listed halon 1211 extinguishers was supposed to cease in October 2009. The future listing is still in discussion. Halotron I, the replacement extinguishing agent, requires a larger volume to get the same ratings as 1211.

<text>A chord is in close harmony (also called close position or close structure) if its notes are arranged within a narrow range, usually with no more than an octave between the top and bottom notes. In contrast, a chord is in open harmony (also called open position or open structure) if there is more than an octave between the top and bottom notes. The more general term &quot;spacing&quot; describes how far apart the notes in a chord are voiced. A triad in close harmony has compact spacing, while one in open harmony has wider spacing.

Close harmony or voicing can refer to both instrumental and vocal arrangements. It can follow the standard voice-leading rules of classical harmony, as in string quartets or Bach chorales, or proceed in parallel motion with the melody in thirds or sixths.

== Vocal music ==

Origins of this style of singing are found in harmonies of the 1800s in America.

Early radio quartets continued this tradition. Female harmonists, like The Boswell Sisters (&quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, 1933) and The Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce (&quot;Who? You That&#x27;s Who!&quot;, 1927), who then became Three X Sisters, performed and recorded this style in the 1920s, and continued it on commercial radio of the 1930s. Close harmony singing was especially popular in the 1940s with pop and R&amp;B groups using the technique quite frequently. The Andrews Sisters also capitalized on a similar style with swing music.

Many gospel and soul groups in the 1950s and 60s also used this technique, usually 3- or 4-part SSAA or TTBB harmony with one person (either bass or lead) doing a call-and-response type lead. Examples of this are The Blind Boys of Alabama, a group that is still recording today. Artists like The Beatles and Simon &amp; Garfunkel used close harmony, echoing their chosen role-models, The Everly Brothers. The Louvin Brothers were a duo that used close harmony in the genre of country music.

Barbershop harmony has a unique harmonic structure: the melody is in the 2nd tenor or &quot;lead&quot; voice, while the 1st tenor takes the next part up, usually in 3rds, with the baritone and bass voices supporting. The bass line tends to be more rhythmic and covers the root notes of the harmonic progression, providing more &quot;support&quot; and independence than in classical vocal music, since Barbershop is usually sung a cappella. Barbershop can be sung by people of any gender. Public domain pieces, such as &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, and newer pieces are abundant. National organizations promote the music with local chapters in many communities.

Soul and gospel groups flourished in America in the years after World War II, building on the foundation of blues, 1930s gospel songs and big band music. Originally called &quot;race music&quot; by white mainstream radio and its target market, it was the precursor to rock and roll and rhythm and blues of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, influencing many English and American artists of that era. They often used the more traditional TTBB or SSAA 4-part structure, but with heavy use of solos and call-and-response, which is rooted in the African American church. These groups sometimes sang a cappella but also used instrumental backing, especially when recorded by the bigger labels. Pop music and doo-wop can be seen as a commercialization of this genre.

== Instrumental music ==
Impressionist composers like Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel often used close harmony in their works and other intervals, such as 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths may be used since the chords have four or more notes and the harmonies are more complex. In jazz, this influence flowered in the works of George Gershwin and Duke Ellington.

A well-known example of consistent instrumental close harmony is Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; which uses the full range of single-reed wind instruments (soprano clarinet, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones) to make a distinctive sound by harmonizing the different sections all within a single octave. Miller studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger, who is credited with helping Miller create the &quot;Miller sound&quot;, and under whose tutelage he himself composed what became his signature theme, &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;.

==Block harmony==
In organ performance, block harmony means that close position chords are added below the melody in the right hand, and the left hand doubles the melody an octave lower, while in open harmony the middle note of the chord is played an octave lower creating an &quot;open&quot; space in the chord.

<text>iDisk is a file hosting service offered by Apple Inc. initially to all Mac OS 9 users, and later to .Mac and MobileMe subscribers that enabled them to store their digital photos, films and personal files online so they could be accessed remotely. All Mac OS 9 users received a free 20MB iDisk, with a 400MB paid subscription option added shortly after the iDisk launch. With a standard .Mac subscription, users received a 10GB iDisk. With MobileMe, the standard storage was increased to 20GB.

iDisk integrated with Mac OS X, appearing as a network drive. Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) through 10.6 (Snow Leopard) could cache updates to an iDisk volume while off-line and synchronize updates later. Any WebDAV client could also access an iDisk volume.

Apple discontinued iDisk, along with many MobileMe (formerly .Mac and iTools) products in 2012. iDisk users could sign up for the iCloud beta or download their files.

==Folders==
*The &quot;Sites&quot; folder of a MobileMe iDisk contained the files created by HomePage, the MobileMe online web authoring tool.
*The &quot;Web&quot; folder of a MobileMe iDisk contained the files created by iWeb, part of the iLife suite.
*The &quot;Software&quot; folder of a MobileMe iDisk contained MobileMe exclusive software, such as GarageBand Jam Packs.
*The &quot;Public&quot; folder of a MobileMe iDisk was used to host downloads.

The &quot;Public&quot;, &quot;Sites&quot; and &quot;Web&quot; folders were the only ones which could be accessed by people other than the iDisk owner, but the &quot;Public&quot; folder could be made password protected via the MobileMe Preference Pane in Mac OS X.

==Backup application==
Included with iDisk in the MobileMe bundle was Backup, a software utility that allowed users to back up local files to an iDisk. The software was also used to restore files from the iDisk, or any other drive/location selected in the backup app.

<doc id="288469" wikidata="Q1151663" url="?curid=288469" title="Novelty song">
<text>A novelty song is a type of song built upon some form of novel concept, such as a gimmick, a piece of humor, or a sample of popular culture. Novelty songs partially overlap with comedy songs, which are more explicitly based on humor, and with musical parody, especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music; the other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.

Novelty songs are often a parody or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance or TV program. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical. For example, the 1966 novelty song &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot;, by Napoleon XIV, has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a snare drum, a tambourine, and the bare sides of the musicians&#x27; legs.

A book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is &quot;The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)&quot;, written by The KLF. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;, a 1988 dance remix mashup of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music released under the name of &#x27;The Timelords&#x27;. It argued that (at the time) achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through market research, sampling and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove.

==History==
===Late 19th century – 1960s===
Novelty songs were a major staple of Tin Pan Alley from its start in the late 19th century. They continued to proliferate in the early years of the 20th century, some rising to be among the biggest hits of the era. Varieties included songs with an unusual gimmick, such as the stuttering in &quot;K-K-K-Katy&quot; or the playful boop-boop-a-doops of &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot;, which made a star out of Helen Kane and inspired the creation of Betty Boop; silly lyrics like &quot;Yes! We Have No Bananas&quot;; playful songs with a bit of double entendre, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Put a Tax on All the Beautiful Girls&quot;; and invocations of foreign lands with emphasis on general feel of exoticism rather than geographic or anthropological accuracy, such as &quot;Oh By Jingo!&quot;, &quot;The Sheik of Araby&quot;, and &quot;The Yodeling Chinaman&quot;. These songs were perfect for the medium of Vaudeville, and performers such as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker became well known for such songs.

Zez Confrey&#x27;s 1920s instrumental compositions, which involved gimmicky approaches (such as &quot;Kitten on the Keys&quot;) or maniacally rapid tempos (&quot;Dizzy Fingers&quot;), were popular enough to start a fad of novelty piano pieces that lasted through the decade. The fad was brought about by the increasing availability of audio recordings by way of the player piano and the phonograph; whereas much of Tin Pan Alley&#x27;s repertoire was sold in the form of sheet music and thus had to be simple enough for an amateur pianist to play, novelty piano brought &quot;virtuoso&quot;-level performance to the home and to those who would not normally attend classical concerts.

At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot; (set to the tune of British Army bandmaster F. J. Ricketts&#x27;s popular World War Iera &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;) was sung by British troops. A 1940s novelty song was Spike Jones&#x27; 1942 &quot;Der Fuehrer&#x27;s Face&quot;, which included raspberries in its chorus. Tex Williams&#x27;s &quot;Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; best-sellers chart for six weeks and the country music chart for 16 weeks in 1947 and 1948. Hank Williams Sr.&#x27;s &quot;Move It On Over&quot;, his first hit song, has some humor and novelty elements (about a man having to share the doghouse when his lover kicks him out of the house), but contemporaries (among them Jerry Rivers) disputed this and noted that many men had been faced with eviction under similar circumstances. The 1953 #1 single &quot;(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?&quot; became notable both for its extensive airplay and the backlash from listeners who found it increasingly annoying. Satirists such as Stan Freberg, Allan Sherman, and Tom Lehrer used novelty songs to poke fun at contemporary pop culture in the 1950s and early 1960s.

In 1951, Frank Sinatra was paired in a CBS television special with TV personality Dagmar. Mitch Miller at Columbia Records became intrigued with the pairing and compelled songwriter Dick Manning to compose a song for the two of them. The result was &quot;Mama Will Bark&quot;, a novelty song performed by Sinatra with interspersed spoken statements by Dagmar, saying things like &quot;mama will bark&quot;, &quot;mama will spank&quot;, and &quot;papa will spank&quot;. The recording even includes the sound of a dog yowling. It is regarded by both music scholars and Sinatra enthusiasts to be perhaps the worst song he ever recorded. Sinatra would record a few others before he left Columbia and joined Capitol Records in 1952.

Dickie Goodman faced a lawsuit for his 1956 novelty song &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot;, which sampled snippets of contemporary hits without permission and arranged them to resemble interviews with an alien landing on Earth. Goodman released more hit singles in the same vein for the next two decades including his gold record RIAA certified hit &quot;Mr. Jaws&quot; in 1975, which charted #1 in &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; and was based on the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.

Among the more far out songs of this genre were the two released in 1956 by Nervous Norvus, &quot;Transfusion&quot; and &quot;Ape Call&quot;.

The Coasters had novelty songs such as &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;Yakety Yak&quot;. &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; became a #1 single on July 21, 1958, and is the only novelty song (#346) included in the Songs of the Century. &quot;Lucky Ladybug&quot; by Billy and Lillie was popular in December 1958. Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s 1959 cover of the 1924 novelty song &quot;Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour (On the Bedpost Overnight?)&quot; was a transatlantic hit, reaching #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts two years after its release; it was one of the earliest top-5 hits to come from the United Kingdom in the rock era, preceding the British Invasion.

Three songs using a sped-up recording technique became #1 hits in the United States in 1958–59: David Seville&#x27;s &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; and Ragtime Cowboy Joe, Sheb Wooley&#x27;s &quot;The Purple People Eater&quot;, and David Seville&#x27;s &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, which used a speeded-up voice technique to simulate three chipmunks&#x27; voices. The technique (which Dickie Goodman had also used on &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot;) would inspire a number of other knockoffs, including The Nutty Squirrels and Russ Regan&#x27;s one-off group Dancer, Prancer and Nervous.

In 1960, 16-year-old Brian Hyland had a novelty hit with the song &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot;, by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; single chart. The Trashmen reached the top 5 with &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, a surf rock medley of two novelty songs originally recorded by The Rivingtons. In 1964, the Grammy for Best Country and Western Album was awarded to Roger Miller. Miller was known to sing novelty songs.

In 1965, &quot;A Windmill in Old Amsterdam&quot;, a song written by Ted Dicks and Myles Rudge, became a UK hit for Ronnie Hilton. The song spent a total of 13 weeks on the UK Singles Chart peaking at No. 23 in the chart of 17 February 1965. The song&#x27;s composers were granted an Ivor Novello Award in 1966 for the Year&#x27;s Outstanding Novelty Composition.

===1970s–2000s===

Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1972, and Ray Stevens, known for such novelty hits as &quot;Ahab the Arab&quot;, &quot;Gitarzan&quot;, and &quot;Mississippi Squirrel Revival&quot;, had a #1 hit with &quot;The Streak&quot; in 1974. Comedy act Cheech &amp; Chong recorded a number of musical bits that can be classified as novelty songs, including &quot;Basketball Jones&quot;(1973) and &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; (1974). Warren Zevon&#x27;s lone chart hit was the novelty number &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;. Other novelty songs in the &#x27;70s are Jimmy Castor Bunch &quot;King Kong&quot;(1975), Rick Dees&#x27; &quot;Disco Duck&quot; (1976) and The Fools&#x27; &quot;Psycho Chicken&quot; (1978). &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic would emerge as one of the most prolific parody acts of all time in the 1980s, with a career that would span four decades; he would join Cliff Richard in being one of the few acts to have at least one top-40 hit in the U.S. in four consecutive decades (1950s through the 1980s for Richard, 1980s to 2010s for Yankovic).

Randy Brooks wrote a Christmas novelty song and it was originally recorded by the duo Elmo Shropshire and his then-wife Patsy in 1979, called &quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot;. It tells the tragic-comic story of a family grandmother (loosely based on Brooks&#x27;s uncle Foster Brooks) who meets her end on Christmas Eve. After having drunk too much eggnog and forgetting to take her medicine, she staggers out of her family&#x27;s house late Christmas Eve, is run over by Santa Claus&#x27; entourage, and found trampled at the scene the next morning. It has become a staple of Christmas music playlists on American radio since its original release.

An underground novelty music scene began to emerge in the 1960s, beginning with the homosexually themed songs of Camp Records and the racist humor of Johnny Rebel, then in the 1970s and 1980s with X-rated albums by David Allan Coe and Clarence &quot;Blowfly&quot; Reid.

Novelty songs have been popular in the UK as well. In 1991, &quot;The Stonk&quot; novelty song raised over £100,000 for the Comic Relief charity. In 1993, &quot;Mr Blobby&quot; became the second novelty song to reach the coveted Christmas number one slot in the UK, following Benny Hill&#x27;s 1971 chart-topper &quot;Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)&quot;. Many popular children&#x27;s TV characters would try to claim the Christmas number one spot after this. In 1997, the Teletubbies who reached number one the previous week failed to gain it with their single &quot;Say Eh-oh!&quot;. They came second in the charts to The Spice Girls second of three consecutive Christmas number ones, with &quot;Too Much&quot;. Later on at the turn of the millennium, Bob the Builder was successful in achieving a Christmas number one in 2000, with &quot;Can We Fix It?&quot;. However, Bob the Builder did have another number one single a year later with a cover of Lou Bega&#x27;s &quot;Mambo No.5&quot;, and also had another less successful single in 2008 with &quot;Big Fish Little Fish&quot;.

Some novelty music draws its appeal from its unintentional novelty; so-called &quot;outsider musicians&quot; with little or no formal musical training often will produce comical results (see for instance, Florence Foster Jenkins, Mrs. Miller, the Portsmouth Sinfonia, The Shaggs, and William Hung).

After the fictitious composer P.D.Q. Bach repeatedly won the &quot;Best Comedy Album&quot; Grammy from 1990 to 1993, the category was changed to &quot;Best &quot;Spoken&quot; Comedy Album&quot;. When &quot;Best Comedy Album&quot; was reinstated in 2004, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic won for &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;.

Novelty songs were popular on U.S. radio throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where it was not uncommon for novelty songs to break into the top 40. Freeform and album-oriented rock stations made use of novelty songs; some of the best-known work from progressive rocker Frank Zappa, for instance, is his extensive body of mostly adult-oriented novelty music. Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Brown (Goes Down)&quot; was a smash hit in Europe despite its sexually explicit storyline, and &quot;Valley Girl&quot; was a Top 40 hit in the US, while his &quot;Don&#x27;t Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; and &quot;Dancin&#x27; Fool&quot; also reached the top 100 in his native United States. Beginning in 1970, Dr. Demento&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show gave novelty songs an outlet for much of the country; this lasted through the mid-2000s, when the show (mirroring trends in the genre) faded in popularity until its terrestrial cancellation in June 2010.

===2010s to date===

In the 21st century, novelty songs found a new audience online; the hit song &quot;The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)&quot; by Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis was featured on the kids compilation album &quot;So Fresh Pop Party 13&quot; in 2014. Likewise, rapper Big Shaq&#x27;s 2017 hit &quot;Man&#x27;s Not Hot&quot;, which depicts a man who refuses to take off his jacket, received widespread attention and inspired countless memes as a result of its success, with the man behind the song being British comedian Michael Dapaah. The children&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Baby Shark&quot; received widespread attention when Korean education brand Pinkfong&#x27;s cover version from an online viral video reached the top 40 in the U.S. and several other countries.

In the United Kingdom, the novelty hit has mainly become a feature of the &quot;Christmas chart battle&quot; (apart from a few viral hits found earlier in a year), with novelty act LadBaby reaching Number One five times in a row, with all five songs being parodies of other popular songs reworked to incorporate a running gag that revolves around sausage rolls. More often than not, the UK Christmas novelty records were recorded for charity, with LadBaby&#x27;s Christmas chart rivals in 2020 also including The Dancing Binmen (Jack Johnson, Henry Wright and Adrian Breakwell) with their song &quot;Boogie Round The Bins At Christmas Time&quot;, and &quot;Merry Christmas, Baked Potato&quot; from comedian Matt Lucas, with fellow chart contender &quot;Raise The Woof!&quot; being promoted as the first ever Christmas record for dogs.

<doc id="288471" wikidata="Q5857145" url="?curid=288471" title="Mordant">
<text>A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set (i.e., bind) dyes on fabrics. It does this by forming a coordination complex with the dye, which then attaches to the fabric (or tissue). It may be used for dyeing fabrics or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. Although mordants are still used, especially by small batch dyers, they have been largely displaced in industry by directs.

The term mordant comes from the Latin &quot;mordere&quot;, &quot;to bite&quot;. In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye &quot;bite&quot; onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion, and one example is chromium (III). The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline.

==Common dye mordants==
Mordants include tannic acid, oxalic acid, alum, chrome alum, sodium chloride, and certain salts of aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, iodine, potassium, sodium, tungsten, and tin.

Iodine is often referred to as a mordant in Gram stains, but is in fact a trapping agent.

==Dyeing methods==

The three methods used for mordanting are:
* Pre-mordanting (onchrome): The substrate is treated with the mordant and then the dye. The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre.
* Meta-mordanting (metachrome): The mordant is added in the dye bath itself. The process is simpler than pre- or post-mordanting, but is applicable to only a few dyes. Mordant red 19 shown above is applied in this manner
* Post-mordanting (afterchrome): The dyed material is treated with a mordant. The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre.

The type of mordant used affects the shade obtained after dyeing and also affects the fastness property of the dye. The application of mordant, either pre-mordant, meta-mordant or post-mordant methods, is influenced by:

* The action of the mordant on the substrate: if the mordant and dye methods are harsh (for example, an acidic mordant with an acidic dye), pre-mordanting or post-mordanting limits the potential for damage to the substrate.
* The stability of the mordant or dye lake or both: the formation of a stable dye lake means that the mordant can be added in the dye without risk of losing the dye properties (meta-mordanting).

Dye results can also rely on the mordant chosen as the introduction of the mordant into the dye will have a marked effect on the final color. Each dye can have different reactions to each mordant. For example, cochineal scarlet, or Dutch scarlet as it came to be known, used cochineal along with a tin mordant to create a brilliant orange-hued red.

Residual iron mordant can damage or fade fabric, producing &quot;dye rot&quot;.

===Dye lake===
The dye lake is an insoluble complex formed upon combining the dye and mordant, which then attaches to the substrate. Mordants increase the fastness of the dye since the higher molecular weight dye is now bonded to the fibre.

The type of mordant used can change the colour of both the dye-plus-mordant solution and influence the shade of the final product.

===Wool===
Unlike cotton, wool is highly receptive toward mordants. Due to its amphoteric nature wool can absorb acids and bases with equal efficiency. When wool is treated with a metallic salt it hydrolyses the salt into an acidic and basic component. The basic component is absorbed at –COOH group and the acidic component is removed during washing. Wool also has a tendency to absorb fine precipitates from solutions; these cling to the surface of fibres and dye particles attached to these contaminants result in poor rubbing fastness.
===Silk===
Like wool, silk is also amphoteric and can absorb both acids and bases. However, wool has thio groups (-SH) from the cystine amino acid, which act as reducing agent and can reduce hexavalent chromium of potassium dichromate to trivalent form. The trivalent chromium forms the complex with the fibre and dye. Therefore, potassium dichromate cannot be used effectively as mordant.

===Animal and plant tissues===
In histology, mordants are indispensable in fixing dyes to tissues for microscopic examination.

Methods for mordant application depend on the desired stain and tissues under study; pre-, meta- and post-mordanting techniques are used as required.

The most commonly used stain used in diagnostic histology of animal tissues is Harris&#x27; haematoxylin as part of a haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain.

<doc id="288480" wikidata="Q185944" url="?curid=288480" title="Kelantan">
<text>Kelantan (; Kelantanese Malay: &quot;Klate&quot;; ) is a state in Malaysia. The capital, Kota Bharu, includes the royal seat of Kubang Kerian. The honorific name of the state is &quot;Darul Naim&quot; (&quot;The Blissful Abode&quot;). Kelantan is the only state outside of East Malaysia that does not use the term district in its second-level administrative division. Instead, the divisions are called colonies () or collectivities with one autonomous subdistrict.

Kelantan is located in the north-eastern corner of the Peninsular Malaysia. Kelantan is an agrarian state with paddy fields, fishing villages and casuarina-lined beaches. Kelantan is home to some of the most ancient archaeological discoveries in Malaysia, including several prehistoric aboriginal settlements.

Due to Kelantan&#x27;s relative isolation and largely rural lifestyle, Kelantanese culture differs somewhat from Malay culture in the rest of the peninsula; this is reflected in the cuisine, arts and the unique Kelantanese Malay language, which is unintelligible even for some speakers of standard Malay.

Kelantan is bordered by Narathiwat province of Thailand to the north, Terengganu to the south-east, Perak to the west and Pahang to the south. To the north-east of Kelantan is the South China Sea. Kelantan has diverse tropical rainforests and an equatorial climate. The state&#x27;s mountain ranges belong to the Titiwangsa Mountains, which are part of the Tenasserim Hills that span southern Myanmar, southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, with Mount Yong Belar being the state&#x27;s highest point.

== Etymology ==

There are a number of theories for the origin of the name Kelantan. One theory proposes that the word Kelantan comes from a modified version of the word &quot;gelam hutam&quot;, the Malay word for the cajuput, or swamp tea tree (&quot;Melaleuca leucadendron&quot;). Other theories claim that the name comes from the Malay word &quot;kilatan&quot;, &quot;shiny or glittery&quot; or &quot;kolam tanah&quot;, &quot;clay pool&quot;. Kelantan was called Kalantan () by the Siamese when it was under their influence.

== History ==
=== Prehistoric ===
Kelantan&#x27;s early history is not very clear, but archaeological evidence shows human settlement in prehistoric times.

=== Pre-Malaccan Era ===
Early Kelantan had links to the Funan Kingdom, the Khmer Empire, Champa and Siam. Around 1411, there was an islamic ruler named Raja Kumar and Kelantan was an important centre of trade at that time.

=== Kelantan Sultanate ===

In 1499, Kelantan became a vassal state of the Malacca Sultanate. With the fall of Malacca in 1511, Kelantan was divided up and ruled by petty chieftains, paying tribute to Patani, then a powerful Malay Kingdom of the eastern peninsula. By the early 17th century, most of these Kelantanese chiefs became subject to Patani. The legendary Cik Siti Wan Kembang was said to have reigned over Kelantan between 1610 and 1667. Kelantan made a political alliance with Patani during the reign of Raja Biru in 1619 for mutual trade and military interests. The Queen of Patani was deposed in 1651 by the Raja of Kelantan, starting a period of Kelantanese rule in Patani. 
Around 1760, Long Yunus, an aristocratic warlord of Patani origin succeeded in unifying the territory of present-day Kelantan and was enthroned by his father-in-law Ku Tanang Wangsa (Regent of Terengganu) as &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Muda&quot; or Deputy Ruler of Kelantan. Long Yunus was succeeded in 1795 by his son-in-law Tengku Muhammad by Sultan Mansur of Terengganu. The enthronement of Tengku Muhammad by Terengganu was opposed by Long Yunus&#x27; sons, triggering a war against Terengganu by Long Muhammad, the eldest son of Long Yunus. The pro-Terengganu faction was defeated in 1800 and Long Muhammad ruled Kelantan with the new title of &quot;Sultan&quot; as Sultan Muhammad I.

Later, when the Sultan died childless, it triggered another civil war among claimants to the throne. His nephew Long Senik Mulut Merah, triumphed over his uncles and cousins and assumed the throne in 1835 as Sultan Muhammad II.
Sultan Muhammad II used his loose alliance with Siam to form the modern Kelantan state, centered in his new fort on the eastern bank of the Kelantan river, which became Kota Bharu in 1844.

=== Unfederated Malay States ===

Under the terms of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, the Thais relinquished their claims over Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Perlis to the British Empire, and Kelantan thus became one of the Unfederated Malay States with a British Adviser.

=== Japanese occupation ===

Kelantan was where the Japanese first landed during their invasion of Malaya, on 8 December 1941. In 1943, Kelantan was transferred by the Japanese to Thailand and became a province of Thailand. Kelantan reverted to Malaya upon the end of World War II in August 1945.

=== Malayan Union and the Federation of Malaya ===

Kelantan became part of the Malayan Union in 1946 and then the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948, and together with other Malayan states attained independence on 31 August 1957. On 16 September 1963, Kelantan became one of the states of Malaysia.

=== Modern history ===
The Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) came to power in Kelantan for the first time in 1959. In November 1977, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Kelantan following a political crisis and street violence. An election took place soon after the emergency, in which the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) won removing the PAS from power. Kelantan was then governed by the Barisan Nasional coalition (of which UMNO was part of) until the 1990 General Election when the PAS returned with an overwhelming victory, winning all 39 State and 13 Parliamentary seats. The success was achieved through the PAS-led coalition, called Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU). In the following General Election in 1995, PAS won again, though with a reduced majority. The PAS won a large victory in 1999 due in part to Malayan anger over the treatment of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and other officials of the national government. In 2004 the PAS nearly lost control of Kelantan, retaining it with only a 1-seat majority, when the Barisan Nasional, under the new leadership of Abdullah Badawi following Mahathir&#x27;s retirement, won by a landslide nationally. However, after the 2008 Malaysian general election, the PAS regained a two-thirds majority of seats in the state assembly.

== Geography ==
Rising high on the slopes of Gunung Korbu, the second highest peak in Peninsular Malaysia, the Nengiri River flows east to merge first with the Galas, and then with the Lebir — the latter begins in the Taman Negara National Park — before turning decisively northwards and emptying into the shallow waters of the South China Sea. From Kuala Krai the conjoined streams become the Kelantan River (also known as Sungai Kelantan), a broad, mud-coloured stream which dominates the fertile coastal plains and defines the geography of the region. The Kelantan River valley is a fertile rice-bowl, rich in hardwoods and rubber and lush with tropical fruits.

For centuries, Kelantan was mostly separated from the rest of the country by the Titiwangsa Mountains, which runs from north to south through the peninsula. Weeks of hard travel were required to reach Kelantan. The easiest way to Kelantan was to sail around the peninsula. For this reason Kelantan&#x27;s history often involves the sea, and boats. Even today, many of its people are tied to the sea. A discussion with many coastal residents will confirm that their ancestors, as far back as they know, were &quot;of the sea.&quot;

A railway line was built in the 1920s, during British colonial rule, linking Tumpat on the state&#x27;s northern coast, through the jungles of upper Kelantan and Pahang and then on to other states. Also, between the 1920s and 1980s, trunk roads were built to link Kelantan with adjacent states. Presently, one can travel by road from the capital city Kuala Lumpur to Kota Bharu using national highway 8 through the mountain range within 8 hours.

=== Climate ===
Kelantan has a tropical climate, with temperatures from 21 to 32 °C and intermittent rain throughout the year. The wet season is the east-coast monsoon season from November to January.

=== Environment ===
Some experts claim groundwater extraction is causing land in Kelantan to lower, causing more floods.

== Economy ==
Kelantan has a chiefly agrarian economy dominated by rice, rubber and tobacco. Fishing along its 96-kilometre coastline is also an important economic activity. Cottage industries which employ traditional skills in handicraft production such as batik, woodcarving and songket weaving are also evident. Logging activities are active given the vast remaining area of forest. In recent years, tourism, especially to offshore islands, has increased in importance. A few reputable hotels have been established and more modern shopping malls have been opened to cater to urban populations.

Kota Bharu, the capital, is the major urban centre, and there are also plans to open up the southern portion of the state under an ambitious multimillion-dollar development project. The main market at the city centre is a top attraction.

Kelantan had a GDP per capita in 2006 at RM7,985. The State Socioeconomic Report 2017 published on 26 July 2018 reported that Kelantan has a GDP per capita of RM13,593 in 2017, significantly lower than any other state in Malaysia.

Kelantan&#x27;s cultural ties with Pattani make use of the Malaysian-Thai border, where Kelantanese and Southern Thais cross frequently to visit their relatives and transport goods for small business.

== Politics ==
A part of the conservative Malay heartland, Kelantan has been ruled by the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) since 1990. It is one of four Malaysian states led by PAS after the 2022 elections, the others being Terengganu, Kedah, and Perlis.

Almost all PAS members are Malay Muslims, as are about 97% of Kelantan&#x27;s population.

For years, the PAS has attempted to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic Law on Kelantan. It has successfully imposed certain social strictures such as single-sex supermarket queues, separate public benches for men and women, and limiting entertainment centers to prohibit &quot;salacious behavior.&quot; An Islamic regional law such as caning for unmarried couples doing cohabitation (khalwat), amputation of limbs for thievery, execution for murder, and stoning for adultery (collectively known as Hudud Law) have been passed and enacted into law, however, have been unenforced by the national government on constitutional grounds.

One of the most controversial steps that PAS have taken in Kelantan is to place strict restrictions or outright bans on the traditional performance of syncretic Malay theatrical forms, such as Wayang Kulit, Mak Yong, Dikir Barat, and Main Puteri. PAS also took action to remove any sculpture that looked like human or animal, modified versions without the traditional references to Hindu dewa–dewi and traditional Malay &quot;hantu&quot; (spirits or ghosts) and otherwise in keeping with orthodox Islam are, however, tolerated in some instances. Also restricted are public performances by women: Aside from Quran recitals, such arrangements are entirely banned if men are in the audience. While PAS has maintained that these steps were to promote Islam and put an end to immoral behavior among the Muslim population, many consider them an act of defiance against Barisan Nasional&#x27;s laws — which are more tolerant, depending on one&#x27;s viewpoint — and also a significant loss to Malay traditional arts.

A 2019 directive from the office of the Sultan prohibited state government buildings from displaying portraits of individuals other than the Sultan, Crown Prince, previous Sultan, and the state&#x27;s First Minister. This was quickly amended also to allow images of the Malaysian King and Queen.

PAS has also defended the practice of child marriage, a practice that been the focus of recent controversy due to recent cases in Kelantan.

=== Government composition ===


== Oil royalties ==

=== Assignment deed ===
On 9 May 1975, an agreement was signed between the Menteri Besar of Kelantan, Datuk Mohamed Nasir, and the Chairman of Petronas, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. According to the terms of the agreement, Kelantan was to receive a cash payment of 5 percent a year biannually, for any oil found in Kelantan or its coastal areas. In return, Kelantan grants Petronas to exclusive rights to &quot;petroleum whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia&quot;.

It became an issue as to whether Kelantan had the right to claim oil royalties from federal government as described in the agreement. Relevant to the issue, in Schedule 9, List I of the Federal Constitution, the following topics are assigned to the Federal Government:

:*Except as to State rights over permits and licences, the Federal Government has rights over development of mineral resources, mines, mining, minerals and mineral ores, oils and oilfields, petroleum products, safety in mines and oilfields
:*Gas and gasworks, production and distribution of power and energy
:*Foreign and extraterritorial jurisdiction
:*Treaties, agreements and conventions with other countries and all matters which bring the Federation into relations with any other country

As for the state government:
:*Land: Schedule 9 List II, Para 2(a). Under the Interpretation Acts, 1948 and 1967, Section 3, land includes &quot;the surface of the earth ... all substances therein... all vegetations and other natural products... whether on or below the surface... and land covered by water&quot;. The territorial waters of Kelantan will come within the definition of &quot;land covered by water&quot;. Territorial waters are defined by Section 4(2) of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No 7, 1969. Subject to some exceptions, they refer to three nautical miles.
:*Revenue from lands: Schedule 10, Part III Para 2.
:*In addition to the income from land, one notes that in Article 110[3A] there is provision for discretionary payment on such terms and conditions as maybe prescribed by or under federal law of the export duty on &quot;mineral oils&quot; produced in the state. Petroleum comes within the meaning of &quot;mineral oils&quot; under Section 10 of the Petroleum Development Act.

From the schedule, Peninsular Malaysian states have the constitutional right to set fees for permits and licences for extraction of any petroleum that is derived from their land and territorial waters. Anything beyond territorial waters, such as on the continental shelf, is entirely in federal hands. However, because exploration of oil and gas is approximately 150 km from Kota Bharu and beyond the territorial water of Kelantan. Emeritus Professor Shad Saleem Faruqi concluded that Kelantan has no constitutional right to regulate it and to receive compensation for it. He further argued given the agreement deed to support Kelantan rights over royalties will render as unconstitutional and void under the doctrine of severability (constitutional parts of the law remain even if other parts are unconstitutional), as the Assignment by Kelantan gives to Petronas the ownership of all petroleum &quot;whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia&quot; was an overstatement, and Kelantan has no rights to what lies off the shores of the whole of Malaysia.

States cannot transfer rights over something they do not own. Unfortunately for Kelantan, the matter cannot end with the two agreements. There is a supreme Constitution in Malaysia with a federal-state division of legislative and financial powers. The constitutional allocation cannot be altered except by constitutionally permitted procedures and amendments. Even mutual agreements cannot override the constitutional scheme of things because jurisdiction is a matter of law and not of consent or acquiescence.

=== Current action ===
The Kelantan state government is owed between RM850 million and RM1 billion from oil revenue royalties from the central government, according to the Petroleum Act 1974. In 2009, the central government offered &#x27;compensation&#x27; or &quot;Wang Ehsan&quot;, a fraction of the sum actually owed. Discrimination of Kelantan on the matter has led the state government considering action in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Support for Kelantan and the local government in defiance of the central government includes the group Kelantan Peoples&#x27; Movement Demanding Petroleum Royalties or &quot;Gerakan Menuntut Royalti Petroleum Rakyat Kelantan (GMR).&quot;

== Demographics ==

The largely rural state preserves Malay traditions such as kite-flying contests, top-spinning contests, and bird singing competitions, and traditional handicrafts such as batik, songket, and silver crafts. Kelantan&#x27;s ethnic composition is 95.7% Malay, 3.4% Chinese, 0.3% Indian and 0.6% others.

The ethnicities of Kelantan generally live together harmoniously. For example, members of the Thai community received a permit to build a very large statue of the Buddha without any objection from the Malay community or the PAS government that granted the permit.

=== Ethnic groups ===

==== Malays ====

Kelantanese Malays are the predominant ethnic group in the state. They speak Kelantanese Malay which is distinguished from standard Malay as well as other Malay varieties in Malaysia by its unique grammar, pronunciation and figures of speech.

Kelantanese Malay is somewhat mutually intelligible with other Malay dialects. Jawi script, which has less influence in other parts of Malaysia, is still widely used in writing and printing the Malay language in Kelantan. Signboards in Kelantan are written in both Jawi and Rumi. To a certain extent, the Southern Thai language is also used.

95.7% of Kelantan&#x27;s population are ethnic Malays, and under the Malaysian Constitution, all Malays are Muslims; therefore, Islam is the largest religion in the state.

Kota Bharu, as the state capital, is a popular centre for pursuits such as silat, martial arts, and &quot;kertok&quot; drumming. Here, too, more than any other place in Malaysia, the traditional pastimes of top-spinning — known as &quot;gasing&quot; — and the flying of giant, elaborately decorated kites called &quot;wau&quot;, is still observed.

==== Siamese ====
The minority ethnic Malaysian Siamese inhabitants of Kelantan are mostly centred around the coastal town of Tumpat, which is home to most of the state&#x27;s two hundred or so Buddhist temples, and has a number of relatively well-off Siamese villages.

The dialect of the Thai language spoken in Kelantan is called &quot;Tak Bai&quot;, after the southernmost coastal town Tak Bai of Narathiwat province, just across the Golok River from Malaysia. The &quot;Tak Bai&quot; dialect differs substantially from standard southern Thai and other regional Thai dialects, and it seems certain that the Kelantan Thais are the descendants of an original enclave of Narathiwat settlers established in sparsely populated Malay territory as long as four centuries ago.

Buddhism is also visible in the hundreds of Thai wats, also known as &quot;ketik&quot;, found throughout the state. Since 1980, the longest statue of a reclining Buddha in Southeast Asia can be found in Wat Photivihan, in Tumpat. This temple is very popular with pilgrims and devotees. The &quot;Metta&quot; chanting uses the original Pali language or a Thai translation. About a thousand visitors attend the Wat for such religious celebrations as Tok&#x27;katinna, Loy Krathong, Saibat and Songkran.

==== Chinese ====

In Kelantan, the Kelantanese Chinese see themselves as either Cino Kapong (village Chinese) or Cino Bandar (town Chinese). Famous Chinese villages in Kelantan include Kampung Tok&#x27;kong (300-year-old temple), Batu Jong, Kampung Jelatok, Kampung Joh, Kampung Temangan, Kampung Mata Ayer, Kampung Tawang, Kampung Balai, and Gua Musang. Descendants of the earlier waves of small-scale migration are known as Oghe Cino kito (our very own Chinese) and the elders are seen as Oghe Kelate beto (true Kelantanese).

Cina Kampung assimilation in Kelantan is manifested as: &quot;Malay behaviour as frontstage and Chinese behaviour as backstage&quot;. &quot;Frontstage&quot; or public behaviour includes speaking Kelantanese Malay even when among themselves, adopting Malay-style clothing, and observing certain Malay customs and holidays. &quot;Backstage&quot; or private behaviour includes maintaining certain traditional Chinese beliefs and customs confined only within the home. A pattern which they also associate as Peranakan Chinese, nonetheless they are culturally different in some ways from the Strait-Chinese Peranakan of Malacca, Penang and Singapore or even the Indonesian Peranakans.

The Cina Kampung in Kelantan have native speaker competence in the Kelantanese dialect. It is impossible to tell a Malay from a Chinese here just by listening to their speech in the Kelantanese dialect.

Much of Chinese culture still continues until today; such as the lion dance and dragon dance during Chinese New Year, temple celebration, eating bakchang (meat dumpling), mooncake, baby fullmoon, pulut kuning, telur merah, eat &#x27;e&#x27; (tangyuan), religious celebration including praying to the Na Tuk Kong. They also cook &#x27;bak hong&#x27;, &#x27;uang (meatball)&#x27; during wedding ceremonies and &#x27;kiam mai&#x27; during funerals.

The village of Kampung Tok&#x27;kong in the Kelantan state of Malaysian is well known for a historically significant Chinese temple known as Seng Choon Kiong. 25 km from Kota Bharu, it is located within a paddy field village with a population of around 500 person. The temple is approximately 300 years old and is dedicated to the worship of the goddess Mazu. Every year on the equivalent date to 23 March on the Chinese calendar, the birthday of Mazu is commemorated with concerts, lion dance, carrying god ride &#x27;Kheng kiu&#x27;, &#x27;siam hee&#x27; and also wayang kulit show for three days. Chinese and Mazu followers visit the temple to pay homage to Mazu, to offer prayers for health and wealth, as well as for personal safety and security and eat Kampung Tokkong most famous &#x27;Bak hong&#x27;.

Unlike the Chinese in other parts of Malaysia, Kelantanese Chinese prefer to conduct their wedding party at home rather than at a restaurant. This reflects their mindset that their presence to celebrate the newly weds is more important than the wedding banquet. And also make it a gathering ceremony to celebrate the angsu &#x27;red/ happiness&#x27;. The amount of guests relate to how respectable the house owner is. This is further proven by their generosity of the money gifts from the newly weds. Usually the wedding ceremony begins on Thursday night and proceeds until the next morning because the weekend holiday is Friday in Kelantan. For good luck, the groom has to bring home the bride before 12 noon on the Friday in a car decorated with flowers.

Most Chinese villagers bury their dead at the local town cemetery. Others cremate the dead at the nearest Wat. If the deceased was old, a three-day funeral ceremony and memorial is conducted, complete with chanting from the monks. But if the deceased was of the younger generation, they are either buried or cremated as soon as possible. They also offers prayers for anniversary for the death.

====Indians====
Indians are known to be one of the smallest ethnic groups in Kelantan. During British rule, Indians were brought in to Kelantan to work in rubber estates around Gua Musang District and Tanah Merah as labourers.

==== Orang Asli ====

Orang Asli, mostly Temiar people, are people who have lived in the forests of Kelantan and Perak for thousands of years. Some of the Temiar maintain traditional beliefs in their natural surroundings and other forms of animist elements. Other &quot;Orang Asli&quot; ethnic groups that live in Kelantan are Jahais, Bateks and Mendriqs.

=== Religion ===

As of 2020 the population of Kelantan is 97% Muslim, 2.3% Buddhist, 0.1% Christian, 0.1% Hindu, 0.4% follower of other religions or non-religious.

Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 93.2% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhists, with significant minorities of adherents identifying as Muslims (3.0%), Christians (2.8%) and Chinese folk religions (0.6%). The latter figure may include followers of Taoism. The majority of the Indian population identify as Hindus (76.5%), with a significant minorities of numbers identifying as Muslims (11.6%), Buddhists (6.7%) and Christians (3.7%). The non-Malay &quot;bumiputera&quot; community are predominantly Muslims (39.8%), with significant minorities identifying as Atheists (30.3%) and Christians (14.3%). All Malays are considered Muslims according to Malaysian law.

== Administrative divisions ==
=== Districts ===
Districts in Kelantan are called &quot;Jajahan&quot;s, though actually the direct translation of &quot;Tanah Jajahan&quot; in Malay to English is &#x27;Occupied Territories&#x27;. Kelantan was a divided feudal state, a common situation in the Malay Peninsula, with separate petty local rulers. However, a strong one managed to rise and conquer all these small petty territories. In the end, Kelantan became united under one Sultan. The eleven &quot;jajahans&quot;, from top to bottom are written in Rumi and Jawi:

== Culture ==
The culture of Kelantan has been influenced by Thai culture due to its location on the Thai border. Among the popular cultural practices are Dikir Barat, Wayang Kulit Kelantan, Wayang Kulit Melayu, Mak Yong, Menora, Main Puteri, Wau Bulan (kite-flying), Gasing (top-spinning), Silat, Tomoi, bird-singing competition and handicrafts. The unique Kelantan culture, Mak Yong is recognized by UNESCO. This ancient theatre form created by Malaysia&#x27;s Malay communities combines acting, vocal and instrumental music, gestures and elaborate costumes. Specific to the villages of Kelantan in northwest Malaysia, where the tradition originated, Mak Yong is performed mainly as entertainment or for ritual purposes related to healing practices.

Among the handicraft products that are songket, batik, silverware and mengkuang. The Kandis Resource Centre provides information on the Kelantanese wood carving.

== Cuisine ==
The Kelantanese cuisine is part of Malay cuisine but maintains its own unique identity. Kelantanese food makes more use of coconut milk than anywhere else in the country. Curries are richer, and creamier.

=== Local dishes ===
==== Colek ====
Contrary to popular belief, Colek is not just a dipping sauce, but can also refer to a snack eaten with the sauce. Colek comes in various forms, including meaty cholek, colek ayam (chicken), colek perut (cow tripe), colek pelepong (cow or lamb lung; usually fried plain), and also a variety of colek buah (fruits; usually unmatured, thus crunchy and sour tasting) such as colek pauh (mango). 

Colek manis (with brown sugar) is a sweet, sour and very mildly hot version. This colek is different from other chili sauces because colek is very thin and rather sweet. This dipping sauce is used for chicken, and also goes well with shrimp, fish cake, spring roll, sausage, etc.

==== Budu ====
Budu (sauce) is a salted (fermented) anchovy sauce eaten mainly as flavouring with rice, grilled fish and vegetables/salads (ulam). A bit of lime juice, hot chilis and shallots are added on for taste. Also, tempoyak (fermented durian) or fresh durian is added. Once combined, the purple-brownish condiment has a blend of salty and sour taste. Sometimes, budu is used in cooking as an ingredient.

Nowadays, other types of fish are also used to create budu. Famous budu making villages include Kg. Tawang, Bachok and Kg. Penambang near Kota Bharu.

Similar sauces are found in the Philippines and Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia).

=== Thai-influenced dishes ===

==== Somtam ====
Somtam is a green papaya salad with a salty, spicy, and sour taste. The main items in it are young, unripe papaya, soy sauce, groundnuts, fish sauce, lime juice, and chilies. These items are combined in a mortar, pounded with a pestle for few seconds and served. The salty and lime juicy taste is very popular. This light dish is widely available in regions with large numbers of ethnic Thais, such as Tumpat and Siamese wats.

==== Other influences ====

=== Tongmo ===
Tongmo (from Cham &quot;tung lamo&quot; &quot;cow intestines&quot;) is a spiced sausage introduced by the Cambodian Chams community concentrated in Kota Bharu.

<text>The Hull note, officially the Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement Between the United States and Japan, was the final proposal delivered to the Empire of Japan by the United States before the attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) and the Japanese declaration of war (seven and a half hours after the attack began). The note, delivered on November 26, 1941, is named for Secretary of State Cordell Hull (in office: 1933–1944). It was the diplomatic culmination of a series of events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Notably, its text repeats previous American demands for Japan to withdraw from China and from French Indochina. No further American proposals were made before the attack on Pearl Harbor, as the US government had received intelligence that Japan was preparing an invasion of Thailand.

==Background==
The United States objected to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the occupation of the Manchuria area of China by Japanese troops and settlers. In protest, the United States sent support to the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, starting with the Lend-Lease Act. In July 1941, Japanese military units occupied southern French Indochina, violating a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement. Japanese bombers quickly moved into bases in Saigon and Cambodia, from which they could attack British Malaya. As a result, the US government imposed trade sanctions on Japan, including the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States; this effectively created an embargo of oil exports, as Japan did not have the necessary currency with which to buy American oil. 

Dean Acheson, a senior U.S. State Department official, was the key decision maker. He shifted American policy away from export restrictions and toward &quot;full-blooded financial warfare against Japan&quot;. This financial freeze was described by Miller as &quot;the most devastating American action against Japan&quot;.

==Final attempts at peace==
On November 5, 1941, Emperor Hirohito approved, in Imperial Conference, the plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor. At the same time, his government made a last effort to arrive at a diplomatic solution of their differences with the United States. Ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura presented two proposals to the American government.

The first, Proposal A, was presented by him on November 6, 1941. It proposed making a final settlement of the Sino-Japanese War with a partial withdrawal of Japanese troops. United States military intelligence had deciphered some of Japan&#x27;s diplomatic codes so they knew that there was a second proposal in case it failed. The United States government stalled and then rejected it on November 14, 1941.

On November 20, 1941, Nomura presented Proposal B, which offered to withdraw Japanese forces from southern Indochina if the United States agreed to end aid to the Nationalist Chinese, freeze military deployments in Southeast Asia (except for Japan&#x27;s reinforcement of northern Indochina), provide Japan with &quot;a required quantity of oil&quot;, and assist Japan in acquiring materials from the Dutch East Indies. The United States was about to make a counteroffer to this plan, which included a monthly supply of fuel for civilian use. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt received a leak of Japan&#x27;s war plan and news that Japanese troopships were on their way to Indochina. He then decided that the Japanese were not being sincere in their negotiations and instructed Secretary Hull to drop the counterproposal.

By November 26, top American officials at the White House, State, Navy and War departments believed that Japan was moving invasion forces toward Thailand. They also believed that the Japanese foreign ministry had put an absolute deadline on negotiations of November 29 because &quot;after that things are automatically going to happen&quot;. The Americans were convinced that war would start in a matter of days, probably with a surprise Japanese attack.

The previous plan, to present Japan with a temporary &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, was strongly opposed by China and Britain and dropped.

==Content==
The Hull Note consists of two sections. The first section is a &quot;Draft mutual declaration of policy&quot; by stating these principles:

# inviolability of territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations.
# non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
# equality, including equality of commercial opportunity and treatment.
# reliance upon international cooperation and conciliation for the prevention and pacific settlement of controversies
# non-discrimination in international commercial relations.
# international economic cooperation and abolition of extreme nationalism as expressed in excessive trade restrictions.
# non-discriminatory access by all nations to raw material supplies.
# full protection of the interests of consuming countries and populations as regards the operation of international commodity agreements.
# establishment of such institutions and arrangements of international finances 

The second section consists of 10 points and is titled &quot;Steps to be taken by the Government of the United States and by the Government of Japan&quot;

# multilateral non-aggression pact among the British Empire, China, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Thailand and the United States
# pledge itself to respect the territorial integrity of French Indochina 
# withdraw of all military, naval, air and police forces from China and from Indo-China
# no support (militarily, politically, economically) of any Government or regime in China other than the national Government of the Republic of China
# Both Governments to give up all extraterritorial rights in China
# enter into negotiations for the conclusion between the United States and Japan of a trade agreement, based upon reciprocal most favored-nation treatment
# remove the freezing restrictions on Japanese funds in the United States and on American funds in Japan
# agree upon a plan for the stabilization of the dollar-yen rate
# no agreement with any third powers to conflict with the fundamental purpose of this agreement
# influence other Governments to adhere to the basic political and economic principles in this agreement

==Delivery to and reception by the Japanese government==
On November 26, 1941, Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note, which, as one of its conditions, demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from French Indochina and China. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki said to his cabinet that &quot;this is an ultimatum&quot;, although the note was marked as &quot;tentative&quot; and contained no deadline.

==Final decision made to attack==
The strike force that attacked Pearl Harbor had set sail the day before, on the morning of November 26, 1941, Japan time, which was November 25, Washington time. It could have been recalled along the way, but no further diplomatic progress was made.

At an Imperial Conference on December 1, Emperor Hirohito approved attacks against the United States, the British Empire and the Dutch colonial empire. On December 4, President Roosevelt was warned by a 26-page ONI memo that the Japanese were showing particular interest in the (US) West Coast, the Panama Canal and the Territory of Hawaii. On , the Japanese began attacks against the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Hawaii.

<doc id="288487" wikidata="Q621384" url="?curid=288487" title="Xserve">
<text>The Xserve is a discontinued series of rack-mounted servers that was manufactured by Apple Inc. between 2002 and 2011. It was Apple&#x27;s first rack-mounted server, and could function as a file server, web server or run high-performance computing applications in clusters – a dedicated cluster Xserve, the Xserve Cluster Node, without a video card and optical drives was also available. The first Xserve had a processor, replaced by a in 2004, and by Intel Xeon processors in 2006; each was available in single-processor and dual-processor configurations. The Xserve was discontinued in 2011, and replaced with the Mac Pro Server and the Mac Mini Server.

Before the Xserve, Apple&#x27;s server line included the Apple Workgroup Server, Macintosh Server, and Apple Network Server.

== Xserve G4 ==
Apple introduced the Xserve on May 14, 2002 (released in June). Initially, two configuration options were available: a single-processor Xserve at US$2999, and a dual-processor Xserve at US$3999. Xserves sold before August 24, 2002 shipped with Mac OS X v10.1 &quot;Puma&quot; Server, while those sold after shipped with Mac OS X v10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; Server.

On February 10, 2003, Apple released an improved and expanded Xserve lineup. Improvements included one or two 1.33 GHz PowerPC G4 processors, faster memory, and higher capacity Ultra ATA/133 hard disk drives. The front plate was redesigned for a slot-loading optical drive. A new model, the Xserve Cluster node was announced at the same price as the single-processor Xserve, featuring two 1.33 GHz processors, no optical drive, a single hard drive bay, no video or Ethernet cards, and a 10-client version of &quot;Jaguar&quot; server.

On April 2, 2003 the Xserve RAID was introduced, providing a much higher capacity and higher throughput disk subsystem for the Xserve.

== Xserve G5 ==

On January 6, 2004 Apple introduced the Xserve G5, a redesigned higher-performance Xserve. The 32-bit PowerPC G4s were replaced with one or two 64-bit PowerPC 970 processors running at 2 GHz. Ventilation issues restricted it to three SATA hot-swap drive bays, with the original space for the fourth drive bay used for air vents. The front plate and slot-loading optical drive were retained from the last Xserve G4. The higher memory capacity and bandwidth as well as the stronger floating-point performance of the PowerPC 970 made it more suitable for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. System X is one such cluster computer built with Xserves.

Three configuration options were available: a single-processor model at US$2,999, a dual-processor model at $3,999, and a dual-processor cluster node model (with an unchanged appearance from the G4 cluster node) at US$2,999.

On January 3, 2005, Apple updated the Xserve G5 with faster processors in the dual-processor configurations. 400 GB hard disks were made available for up to 1.2 TB of internal storage. The slot-loading optical drive was upgraded to a combination DVD-ROM/CD-RW standard, DVD-/+RW optional. Soon after, Apple updated the Xserve and Xserve RAID to allow the use of 500 GB Hard Drives.

Xserve G5 models before April 2005 shipped with Mac OS X v10.3 &quot;Panther&quot;, after April 2005 shipped with Mac OS X v10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;.

== Intel Xserve ==
The Intel-based Xserves were announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference on August 7, 2006, and are significantly faster compared to the Xserve G5. They use Intel Xeon (&#x27;Woodcrest&#x27;) processors, DDR2 ECC FB-DIMMs, ATI Radeon graphics, a maximum storage capacity of 2.25 TB when used with three 750 GB drives, optional redundant power supplies and a 1U rack form factor. The Intel Xserves now had on board video, freeing up an expansion slot.

On January 8, 2008 Xserve was updated with Intel Xeon (&#x27;Harpertown&#x27;) processors, faster memory, and a maximum storage capacity of 3 TB when used with three 1 TB drives. The front-mounted FireWire 400 port featured in previous models was also replaced with a USB 2.0 port. The Xserve RAID was discontinued on February 19, 2008.

On April 7, 2009 Xserve was updated to use Intel Xeon (&#x27;Gainestown&#x27;) processors, DDR3 memory, and NVIDIA graphics with Mini DisplayPort output. The update also saw an increase to the maximum storage capacity, bringing it to 6 TB when used with three 2 TB drives. An option to add a SSD boot-drive that does not occupy a drive bay was also implemented. The addition of the SSD boot drive allows all drives to be swapped whilst the server remains online. It is also Apple&#x27;s first Xserve to use PVC-free internal cables and components and contain no brominated flame retardants.

On August 28, 2009 Xserve was updated to ship standard with Mac OS X Server 10.6 Unlimited Client Server. In addition to improved functionality Mac OS X 10.6 Server added support for up to 96 GB of RAM.

On November 5, 2010, Apple announced that it would not be developing a future version of Xserve. While accepting orders for the current model until January 31, 2011, and &quot;honoring&quot; all Xserve warranties and extended support programs, the company suggested users switch to Mac Pro Server or Mac Mini Server.

After the Xserve&#x27;s discontinuation, an annoyed customer emailed Steve Jobs, who responded that &quot;hardly anyone was buying them&quot;.

<doc id="288490" wikidata="Q2035136" url="?curid=288490" title="Tom Thomson">
<text>Thomas John Thomson (August 5, 1877July 8, 1917) was a Canadian artist active in the early 20th century. During his short career, he produced roughly 400 oil sketches on small wood panels and approximately 50 larger works on canvas. His works consist almost entirely of landscapes, depicting trees, skies, lakes, and rivers. He used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson is considered by many Canadians as the archetypal painter, and his later work has heavily influenced Canadian art – paintings such as &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; and &quot;The West Wind&quot; have taken a prominent place in the culture of Canada and are some of the country&#x27;s most iconic works. His accidental death by drowning at 39 shortly before the founding of the Group of Seven is seen as a tragedy for Canadian art.
Raised in rural Ontario, Thomson was born into a large family of farmers and displayed no immediate artistic talent. He worked several jobs before attending a business college, eventually developing skills in penmanship and copperplate writing. At the turn of the 20th century, he was employed in Seattle and Toronto as a pen artist at several different photoengraving firms, including Grip Ltd. There he met those who eventually formed the Group of Seven, including J. E. H. MacDonald, Lawren Harris, Frederick Varley, Franklin Carmichael and Arthur Lismer. In May 1912, he visited Algonquin Park—a major public park and forest reservation in Central Ontario—for the first time. It was there that he acquired his first sketching equipment and, following MacDonald&#x27;s advice, began to capture nature scenes. He became enraptured with the area and repeatedly returned, typically spending his winters in Toronto and the rest of the year in the Park. His earliest paintings were not outstanding technically, but showed a good grasp of composition and colour handling. His later paintings vary in composition and contain vivid colours and thickly applied paint.

Thomson developed a reputation during his lifetime as a veritable outdoorsman, talented in both fishing and canoeing, although his skills in the latter have been contested. The circumstances of his drowning on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park, linked with his image as a master canoeist, led to unsubstantiated but persistent rumours that he had been murdered or committed suicide.

Although he died before the formal establishment of the Group of Seven, Thomson is often considered an unofficial member. His art is typically exhibited with the rest of the Group&#x27;s, nearly all of which remains in Canada—mainly at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.

==Life==
===Early years===
Thomas John &quot;Tom&quot; Thomson was born on August 5, 1877, in Claremont, Ontario, the sixth of John and Margaret Thomson&#x27;s ten children. He was raised in Leith, Ontario, near Owen Sound, in the municipality of Meaford. Thomson and his siblings enjoyed both drawing and painting, although he did not immediately display any major talents. He was eventually taken out of school for a year because of ill health, including a respiratory problem variously described as &quot;weak lungs&quot; or &quot;inflammatory rheumatism&quot;. This gave him free time to explore the woods near his home and develop an appreciation of nature.

The family were unsuccessful as farmers; both Thomson and his father often abandoned their chores to go hiking, hunting and fishing. Thomson regularly went on walks in Toronto with Dr. William Brodie (1831–1909), his grandmother&#x27;s first cousin. Brodie was a well-known entomologist, ornithologist and botanist, and Thomson&#x27;s sister Margaret later recounted that they collected specimens on long walks together.

Thomson was also enthusiastic about sports, once breaking his toe while playing football. He was an excellent swimmer and fisherman, inheriting his passion for the latter from his grandfather and father. Like most of those in his community, he regularly attended church. Some stories say that he sketched in the hymn books during services and entertained his sisters with caricatures of their neighbours. His sisters later said that they had fun &quot;guessing who they were&quot;, indicating that he was not necessarily adept at capturing people&#x27;s likeness.

Each of Thomson&#x27;s nine siblings received an inheritance from their paternal grandfather. Thomson received $2000 in 1898 but seems to have spent it quickly. A year later, he entered a machine shop apprenticeship at an iron foundry owned by William Kennedy, a close friend of his father, but left only eight months later. Also in 1899, he volunteered to fight in the Second Boer War, but was turned down because of a medical condition. He tried to enlist for the Boer War three times in all, but was denied each time.

In 1901, Thomson enrolled at Canada Business College in Chatham, Ontario. The school advertised instruction in stenography, bookkeeping, business correspondence and &quot;plain and ornamental penmanship&quot;. There, he developed abilities in penmanship and copperplate—necessary skills for a clerk. After graduating at the end of 1901, he travelled briefly to Winnipeg before leaving for Seattle in January 1902, joining his older brother, George Thomson. George and cousin F. R. McLaren had established the Acme Business School in Seattle, listed as the 11th largest business school in the United States. Thomson worked briefly as an elevator operator at The Diller Hotel. By 1902, two more of his brothers, Ralph and Henry, had moved west to join the family&#x27;s new school.

===Graphic design work===
====Seattle (1901–1904)====
After studying at the business school for six months, Thomson was hired at Maring &amp; Ladd as a pen artist, draftsman and etcher. He mainly produced business cards, brochures and posters, as well as three-colour printing. Having previously learned calligraphy, he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting. While working at Maring &amp; Ladd, he was known to be stubbornly independent; his brother Fraser wrote that, instead of completing his work according to the direction provided, he would use his own design ideas, which angered his boss. Thomson may have also worked as a freelance commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work.

He eventually moved on to a local engraving company. Despite a good salary he left by the end of 1904. He quickly returned to Leith, possibly prompted by a rejected marriage proposal after his brief summer romance with Alice Elinor Lambert. Lambert, who never married, later became a writer; in one of her stories, she describes a young girl who refuses an artist&#x27;s proposal and later regrets her decision.

====Toronto (1905–1912)====


Thomson moved to Toronto in the summer of 1905. His first job upon his return to Canada was at the photo-engraving firm Legg Brothers, earning $11 a week. He spent his free time reading poetry and going to concerts, the theatre and sporting events. In a letter to an aunt, he wrote, &quot;I love poetry best.&quot; Friends described him during this time as &quot;periodically erratic and sensitive, with fits of unreasonable despondency&quot;. Apart from buying art supplies, he spent his money on expensive clothes, fine dining and tobacco. Around this time, he may have studied briefly with William Cruikshank, a British artist who taught at the Ontario College of Art. Cruikshank was likely Thomson&#x27;s only formal art instructor.

In 1908 or 1909, Thomson joined Grip Ltd., a firm in Toronto that specialized in design and lettering work. Grip was the leading graphic-design company in the country and introduced Art Nouveau, metal engraving and the four-colour process to Canada. Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that Thomson&#x27;s early work at the firm was mostly in lettering and decorative designs for booklets and labels. He wrote that Thomson made friends slowly but eventually found similar interests to his coworkers. Several of the employees at Grip had been members of the Toronto Art Students&#x27; League, a group of newspaper artists, illustrators and commercial artists active between 1886 and 1904. The members sketched in parts of eastern Canada and published an annual calendar with illustrations depicting Canadian history and rural life.

The senior artist at Grip, J. E. H. MacDonald, encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills. It was at Grip that many of the eventual members of the Group of Seven would meet. In December 1910, artist William Smithson Broadhead was hired, joined by Arthur Lismer in February 1911. Robson eventually hired Frederick Varley, followed by Franklin Carmichael in April 1911. Although Thomson was not himself a member, it was at the Arts and Letters Club that MacDonald introduced Thomson to Lawren Harris. The club was considered the &quot;centre of living culture in Toronto&quot;, providing an informal environment for the artistic community. Every member of what would become the original Group of Seven had now met. MacDonald left Grip in November 1911 to do freelance work and spend more time painting, after the Ontario government purchased his canvas &quot;By the River (Early Spring)&quot; (1911).

===Painting career===
====Exploring Algonquin Park (1912–13)====


Algonquin Park was established in 1893 by Oliver Mowat and the Ontario Legislature. Covering eighteen rectangular townships in Central Ontario, the Park was created to provide a space dedicated to recreation, wildlife and watershed protection, though logging operations continued to be permitted. Thomson learned of the Park from fellow artist Tom McLean. In May 1912, aged 34, he first visited the Park, venturing through the area on a canoe trip with his Grip colleague H. B. (Ben) Jackson. Together, they took the Grand Trunk Railway from Toronto to Scotia Junction, then transferred to the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, arriving at Canoe Lake Station. McLean introduced Thomson to the Park superintendent, G. W. Barlett. Thomson and Jackson later met ranger Harry (Bud) Callighen while they camped nearby on Smoke Lake.

It was also at this time that Thomson acquired his first sketching equipment. He did not yet take painting seriously. According to Jackson, Thomson did not think &quot;his work would ever be taken seriously; in fact, he used to chuckle over the idea&quot;. Instead, they spent most of their time fishing, except for &quot;a few notes, skylines and colour effects&quot;.

During the same trip, Thomson read Izaak Walton&#x27;s 1653 fishing guide &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;. Primarily a fisherman&#x27;s bible, the book also provided a philosophy of how to live, similar to the one described in Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s 1854 book &quot;Walden, or Life in the Woods&quot;, a reflection on simple living in natural surroundings. His time in Algonquin Park gave him an ideal setting to imitate Walton&#x27;s &quot;contemplative&quot; life. Ben Jackson wrote:

Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson&#x27;s experience in the Park in the &quot;Toronto Sunday World&quot;, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson&#x27;s transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.

In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip&#x27;s art director, moved to the design firm Rous &amp; Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous &amp; Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson&#x27;s loyalty, calling him &quot;a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman&quot;. Robson&#x27;s success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson&#x27;s success &quot;was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress. Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies ... Tom Thomson, so far as I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park.&quot;
In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists&#x27; (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson&#x27;s and Jackson&#x27;s talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to &quot;take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.&quot; MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson&#x27;s sketches, he recognized their &quot;truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.&quot; He described Thomson&#x27;s paintings as &quot;dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects&quot;. After Thomson&#x27;s death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocated for his work.

Thomson accepted MacCallum&#x27;s offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: &quot;The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.&quot; He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few weeks in the Park the previous year. Thomson became as familiar with logging scenes as with nature in the Park and painted them both.

While returning to Toronto in November 1912, Thomson stopped in Huntsville. The visit was possibly to meet with Winifred Trainor, a woman whose family owned a cottage on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. Trainor was later rumoured to have been engaged to Thomson with a wedding planned for the late 1917, although little is known about their relationship.

Thomson first exhibited with the OSA in March 1913, selling his painting &quot;Northern Lake&quot; (1912–13) to the Ontario Government for $250 (). The sale afforded him time to paint and sketch through the summer and fall of 1913.

====Early recognition (1914–15)====


Thomson often experienced self-doubt. A. Y. Jackson recalled that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration, and was &quot;so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches&quot;. Harris expressed similar sentiments, writing that Thomson &quot;had no opinion of his own work&quot;, and would even throw burnt matches at his paintings. Several of the canvases he sent to exhibitions remained unsigned. If someone praised one of his sketches, he immediately gave it to them as a gift. A turning point in his career came in 1914, when the National Gallery of Canada, under the directorship of Eric Brown, began to acquire his paintings. Although the money was not enough to live on, the recognition was unheard of for an unknown artist.

For several years he shared a studio and living quarters with fellow artists, initially living in the Studio Building with Jackson in January 1914. Jackson described the Studio Building as &quot;a lively centre for new ideas, experiments, discussions, plans for the future and visions of an art inspired by the Canadian countryside&quot;. It was there that Thomson, &quot;after much self-deprecation, finally submitted to becoming a full-time artist&quot;. They split the rent—$22 a month—on the ground floor while construction on the rest of the building was finished. After Jackson moved out in December to go to Montreal, Carmichael took his place. Thomson and Carmichael shared a studio space through the winter. On March 3, 1914, Thomson was nominated as a member of the OSA by Lismer and T. G. Greene. He was elected on the 17th. He did not participate in any of their activities beyond sending paintings for annual exhibitions. Harris described Thomson&#x27;s strange working hours years later:

In late April 1914, Thomson arrived in Algonquin Park, where he was joined by Lismer on May 9. They camped on Molly&#x27;s Island in Smoke Lake, travelling to Canoe, Smoke, Ragged, Crown and Wolf Lakes. He spent his spring and summer divided between Georgian Bay and Algonquin Park, visiting James MacCallum by canoe. His travels during this time have proved difficult to discern, with such a large amount of ground covered in such a short time, painting the French River, Byng Inlet, Parry Sound and Go-Home Bay from May 24 through August 10. H. A. Callighen, a park ranger, wrote in his journal that Thomson and Lismer left Algonquin Park on May 24. By May 30, Thomson was at Parry Sound and on June 1 was camped at the French River with MacCallum.

Art historian Joan Murray noted that Thomson was at Go-Home Bay for the next two months, or at least until August 10 when he was seen again in Algonquin Park by Callighan. According to Wadland, if this timeline is correct, it would require &quot;an extraordinary canoeist ... The difficulty is augmented by the fact of stopping to sketch at intervals along the way.&quot; Wadland suggested that Thomson may have travelled by train at some point and by steamship thereafter. Addison and Harwood instead said that Thomson had found much of the inland &quot;monotonously flat&quot; and the rapids &quot;ordinary&quot;. Wadland found this characterization unhelpful, pointing out that the rapids Thomson had faced were hardly &quot;ordinary&quot;.

MacCallum provided specific dates for two of Thomson&#x27;s paintings—May 30 and June 1 for &quot;Parry Sound Harbour&quot; and &quot;Spring, French River&quot;, respectively. These are some of the only instances of precise dating for his work. &quot;Cottage on a Rocky Shore&quot; is a depiction of MacCallum&#x27;s cottage contrasted with the vast expanse of sky and water. &quot;Evening, Pine Island&quot; is of a nearby island MacCallum took Thomson to visit. He continued to paint around the islands until he departed, probably because he found MacCallum&#x27;s cottage too demanding socially, writing to Varley that it was &quot;too much like north Rosedale&quot;.

Thomson continued canoeing alone until he met with A. Y. Jackson at Canoe Lake in mid-September. Though World War I had erupted that year, he and Jackson went on a canoe trip, in October meeting up with Varley and his wife Maud, as well as Lismer and his wife Esther, and daughter Marjorie. This marked the first time three Group of Seven members painted together, and the only time they worked with Thomson. In his 1958 autobiography, &quot;A Painter&#x27;s Country&quot;, A. Y. Jackson wrote that, &quot;Had it not been for the war, the Group [of Seven] would have formed several years earlier and it would have included Thomson.&quot;

Why Thomson did not serve in the war has been debated. Mark Robinson and Thomson&#x27;s family said that he was turned down after multiple attempts to enlist, likely due to his poor health and age but also possibly because he had flat feet. Blodwen Davies wrote that Thomson&#x27;s artist friends tried to convince him to not risk his life, but he decided to secretly volunteer anyway. Andrew Hunter has found this scenario to be improbable, especially given that other artist friends volunteer for the war, such as A. Y. Jackson. Thomson&#x27;s sister suggested that he was a pacifist and that &quot;he hated war and said simply in 1914 that he never would kill anyone but would like to help in a hospital, if accepted&quot;. William Colgate wrote that Thomson &quot;brooded much upon&quot; the war and that &quot;he himself did not enlist. Rumour has it that he tried, and failed to pass the doctor. This is doubtful.&quot; Edward Godin, a companion, said &quot;We had many discussions on the war. As I remember it he did not think that Canada should be involved. He was very outspoken in his opposition to Government patronage. Especially in the Militia. I do not think that he would offer himself for service. I know up until that time he had not tried to enlist.&quot; There is only one verifiable example of Thomson&#x27;s opinion on the war, taken from a letter he wrote to J. E. H. MacDonald in 1915:

With MacCallum&#x27;s year of financial support over, Thomson&#x27;s financial future became uncertain. He briefly looked into applying for a position as a park ranger, but balked after seeing that it could take months for the application to go through. Instead, he considered working in an engraving shop over the winter. He made little effort to sell his paintings, preferring to give them away, though he brought in some money from the paintings he sold. In mid-November, he donated &quot;In Algonquin Park&quot; to an exhibition organized to raise money for the Canadian Patriotic Fund. It was sold to Marion Long for $50 ().

In the spring of 1915, Thomson returned to Algonquin Park earlier than he had in any previous year and had already painted twenty-eight sketches by April 22. From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes, and sketching when he had time. In July, he was invited to send paintings to the Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition in September. Because he was in Algonquin Park, his friends selected three works to send—two unidentified works from 1914 and the sketch &quot;Canadian Wildflowers&quot;. From the end of September to mid-October, he spent his time at Mowat, a village on the north end of Canoe Lake. By November, he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Robert McComb. In late November, he returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him, renting it for $1 a month.

In 1915, MacCallum commissioned MacDonald, Lismer and Thomson to paint decorative panels for his cottage on Go-Home Bay. In October of that year, MacDonald went up to take dimensions. Thomson produced four panels which were probably meant to go over the windows. In April 1916, when MacDonald and Lismer went to install them, they found that MacDonald&#x27;s measurements were incorrect and the panels did not fit.

====Artistic peak (1916–17)====
In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: &quot;In the Northland&quot; (at that time titled &quot;The Birches&quot;), &quot;Spring Ice&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;October&quot; (then titled &quot;The Hardwoods&quot;), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase &quot;In the Northland&quot;, but Montreal trustee Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase &quot;Spring Ice&quot; instead. The reception of Thomson&#x27;s paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Tom Thomson&#x27;s &#x27;The Birches&#x27; and &#x27;The Hardwoods&#x27; show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.&quot; A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;:

 In &quot;The Canadian Courier&quot;, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as &quot;one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects&quot;.

In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left, Harris and Thomson paddled together to Aura Lee Lake. Thomson produced many sketches which varied in composition, although they all had vivid colour and thickly-applied paint. MacCallum was present when he painted his &quot;Sketch for &quot;The Jack Pine&quot;&quot;, writing that the tree fell over onto Thomson before the sketch was completed. He added that Harris thought the tree killed Thomson, &quot;but he sprang up and continued painting&quot;.

At the end of May, Thomson took a job as a fire ranger stationed at Achray on Grand Lake with Ed Godin. He followed the Booth Lumber Company&#x27;s log drive down the Petawawa River to the north end of the park. He found that fire ranging and painting did not mix well together, writing, &quot;[I] have done very little sketching this summer as the two jobs don&#x27;t fit in... When we are travelling two go together, one for canoe and the other the pack. And there&#x27;s no place for a sketch outfit when your fire ranging. We are not fired yet but I am hoping to get put off right away.&quot; He likely returned to Toronto in late October or early November.

Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career, with Thomson writing in a letter that he &quot;got quite a lot done&quot;. Despite this, he did not submit any paintings to the OSA exhibition in the spring of 1917. It was during this time that he produced many of his most famous works, including &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; and &quot;The West Wind&quot;. MacCallum suggested that several canvas works were unfinished, including &quot;Woodland Waterfall&quot;, &quot;The Pointers&quot; and &quot;The Drive&quot;. Barker Fairley similarly described &quot;The West Wind&quot; as unfinished. Charles Hill has written that there are no reasons to believe &quot;Woodland Waterfall&quot; was unfinished. Similarly, while it has sometimes been suggested that &quot;The Drive&quot; was modified after Thomson&#x27;s death, a reproduction from 1918 displays no discernible differences.

Thomson returned to Canoe Lake at the beginning of April, arriving early enough to paint the remaining snow and the ice breaking up on the surrounding lakes. He had little money but wrote that he could manage for about a year. On April 28, 1917, he received a guide&#x27;s licence. Unlike previous years, he remained at Mowat with Lieutenant Crombine and his wife, Daphne. Thomson invited Daphne Crombie to select something from his spring sketches as a gift, and she selected &quot;Path Behind Mowat Lodge&quot;.

Besides the deep love he had come to develop for Algonquin Park, Thomson was beginning to show an eagerness to depict areas beyond the park and explore other northern subjects. In an April 1917 letter to his brother-in-law, he wrote that he was considering taking the Canadian Northern Railway west so he could paint the Canadian Rockies in July and August. A. Y. Jackson suggested Thomson would have travelled even further north, just as the other members of the Group of Seven eventually did.

===Death===


On July 8, 1917, Thomson disappeared during a canoeing trip on Canoe Lake. His upturned canoe was spotted later in the afternoon, and his body was discovered in the lake eight days later. It was noted that he had a four-inch cut on his right temple and had bled from his right ear. The cause of death was officially determined to be &quot;accidental drowning&quot;. The day after the body was discovered, it was interred in Mowat Cemetery near Canoe Lake. Under the direction of Thomson&#x27;s older brother George, the body was exhumed two days later, and re-interred on July 21 in the family plot beside the Leith Presbyterian Church in what is now the Municipality of Meaford, Ontario.

In September 1917, J. E. H. MacDonald and John William Beatty erected a memorial cairn at Hayhurst Point on Canoe Lake, to honour Thomson where he died.

There has been much speculation about the circumstances of Thomson&#x27;s death, including that he was murdered or committed suicide. Though these ideas lack substance, they have continued to persist in the popular culture. Andrew Hunter has pointed to Park ranger Mark Robinson as being largely responsible for the suggestion that there was more to his death than accidental drowning. Hunter expands on this thought, writing, &quot;I am convinced that people&#x27;s desire to believe the Thomson murder mystery/soap opera is rooted in the firmly fixed idea that he was an expert woodsman, intimate with nature. Such figures aren&#x27;t supposed to die by &#x27;accident.&#x27; If they do, it is like Grey Owl&#x27;s being exposed as an Englishman.&quot;

==Art and technique==
===Artistic development===
Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto&#x27;s Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.

Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson&#x27;s transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson&#x27;s art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European Post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

Thomson&#x27;s artwork is typically divided into two bodies: the first are the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around 50 larger works on canvas. The smaller sketches were typically done &quot;en plein air&quot; in &quot;the North&quot;, primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall. Mark Robinson later recounted that Thomson usually had a particular motif he wanted to depict before going into nature to find a comparison. The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson&#x27;s studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist&#x27;s enclave in Rosedale, Toronto. About a dozen of the major canvases were derived directly from smaller sketches. Paintings like &quot;Northern River&quot;, &quot;Spring Ice&quot;, &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; and &quot;The West Wind&quot; were only later expanded into larger oil paintings.

Sketches from 1913 and earlier use a variety of supports, including canvas laid down on paperboard, canvas laid down on wood and commercial canvas-board. In 1914, he began to favour the larger birch wood panels used by A. Y. Jackson, typically measuring around 21.6 × 26.7 cm (8½ × 10½ in.). From late 1914 on, Thomson alternated between painting on these inexpensive pieces of wood—some from crates, bookbinder&#x27;s board, and other assorted sources—and composite wood-pulp boards.

Although the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Compared to the panels, they display an &quot;inherent formality&quot;, and lack much of the &quot;energy, spontaneity, and immediacy&quot; of the original sketches. The transition from small to large required a reinvention or elaboration of the original details; by comparing sketches with their respective canvases, one can see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns. Although few of the larger paintings were sold during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at Wembley in London in 1924, that eventually brought his work to international attention.

Described as having an &quot;idiosyncratic palette&quot;, Thomson had exceptional control of colour. He often mixed available pigments to create new, unusual colours that, along with his brushwork, made his art instantly recognizable regardless of its subject. His painting style and the atmosphere, colours and forms of his work influenced the work of his colleagues and friends, especially Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald, Harris and Carmichael.

===Series and themes===
====Trees====


Thomson&#x27;s most famous paintings are his depictions of pine trees, particularly &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; and &quot;The West Wind&quot;. David Silcox has described these paintings as &quot;the visual equivalent of a national anthem, for they have come to represent the spirit of the whole country, notwithstanding the fact that vast tracts of Canada have no pine trees&quot;, and as &quot;so majestic and memorable that nearly everyone knows them&quot;. Arthur Lismer described them similarly, saying that the tree in &quot;The West Wind&quot; was a symbol of the Canadian character, unyielding to the wind and emblematic of steadfastness and resolution.

Thomson had a great enthusiasm for trees and worked to capture their forms, their surrounding locations, and the effect of the seasons on them. He normally depicted trees as amalgamated masses, giving &quot;form structure and colour by dragging paint in bold strokes over an underlying tone&quot;. His favourite motif was of a slight hill next to a body of water. His enthusiasm is especially apparent in an anecdote from Ernest Freure, who invited Thomson to camp on an island on Georgian Bay:

The theme of the single tree is common in Art Nouveau, while the motif of the lone, heroic tree goes back even further to at least Caspar David Friedrich and early German Romanticism. Thomson may also have been influenced by the work of MacDonald while working at Grip Limited. MacDonald in turn was influenced by the landscape art of John Constable, whose work he likely saw while in England from 1903 to 1906. Constable&#x27;s art influenced Thomson&#x27;s as well, something apparent when Constable&#x27;s &quot;Stoke-by-Nayland&quot; () is compared with Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Poplars by a Lake&quot;.

Thomson&#x27;s earlier paintings were closer to literal renderings of the trees in front of him, and as he progressed the trees became more expressive as Thomson amplified their individual qualities. &quot;Byng Inlet, Georgian Bay&quot; shows the broken, high-keyed colour that Thomson and his colleagues experimented with later in his career, and is similar to Lismer&#x27;s &quot;Sunglow&quot;. While Lismer only applied the technique to the water, Thomson applied it throughout the composition. According to MacCallum, Thomson worked on &quot;Pine Island, Georgian Bay&quot; over an extended period. He wrote that this painting had &quot;more emotion and feeling than any other of [Thomson&#x27;s] canvases&quot;. In contrast, MacDonald found it &quot;rather commonplace in color &amp; composition &amp; not representative of Thomson at his best&quot;.

====Skies====
Thomson was preoccupied with capturing the sky, especially near the end of his career from 1915 onward. Paintings like &quot;Sunset&quot;—which was painted at water level in a canoe—illustrate his excited brushstrokes in capturing the lake&#x27;s reflection. The painting was done over a grey-green ground, adding depth to both the light of the sky and the reflecting water. Paintings from 1913 and on consistently utilize the perspective of the canoe, with a narrow foreground of water, a distant shoreline and a dominating sky.

The 1915 volcanic eruption of Lassen Peak in California provided dramatic sunrises and sunsets in the northern hemisphere for the year. These skies provided artistic inspiration for Thomson and other artists in the same way that the eruption of Krakatoa in the previous century had inspired Edvard Munch. Sky effects were one of Thomson&#x27;s main interests for the entire year, indicated by his heightened use of colour.

Harold Town has compared &quot;Sky (The Light That Never Was)&quot; to the works of J. M. W. Turner. In particular, he notes the way that the sky &quot;[creeps] into the landscape, big rhythms supplanting small movement&quot;. The horizon disappears and pure movement is left behind.

====Nocturnes====
Thomson produced more nocturnes than the rest of the Group of Seven combined—roughly two dozen. MacCallum recalled that Thomson often spent his nights lying in his canoe in the middle of the lake, stargazing and avoiding mosquitoes. Besides capturing the nighttime sky, he also captured silhouettes of spruce and birch trees, lumber camps, two moose emerging from water and the northern lights, painting five different sketches of the aurora.

Mark Robinson recounted that Thomson stood and contemplated the aurora for an extended period of time before going back into his cabin to paint by lamplight. He sometimes completed nocturnes this way, going back and forth between painting indoors and looking at the subject outside until he completed the sketch. Other times, given the difficulty of painting by moonlight, many of the nocturnes were painted entirely from memory. MacCallum confirmed that the sketch &quot;Moose at Night&quot; was completed in this way, writing on the back &quot;Winter 1916—at studio&quot;, implying it was probably painted in Toronto. His moonlight paintings use a &quot;dreamy, pale-toned style&quot;, applying the techniques of Impressionism in his observations of light, reflection and atmosphere.

====Flowers====
As was typical for painters of the early twentieth century, Thomson produced still lifes of flowers, all of which appear in the form of sketches. His love of flowers may have developed from his father who, as a neighbour noted, had &quot;a permanent half acre of a really good garden which was always worth going to see&quot;. Thomson&#x27;s time spent as a child collecting samples with his naturalist relative William Brodie may have similarly influenced him, though his interest in painting flowers seems to have been more focused on patterning and decoration than on the horticultural specifics of the subject.

These paintings, especially &quot;Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch&quot; and &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, are particularly powerful examples of the genre. J. E. H. MacDonald—himself deeply invested in floral imagery—was so captured by &quot;Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch&quot; that he kept it for himself, writing &quot;Not For Sale&quot; on the back. Thomson&#x27;s work is contrasted from MacDonald&#x27;s by what Joan Murray calls, &quot;its elegant, slightly funky form and throwaway spontaneity.&quot; Lawren Harris instead noted &quot;Wildflowers&quot; as a favourite, writing &quot;1st class&quot; on the verso. The colour of the sketch is less brilliant, but has superb brushwork and is well coordinated, setting blues against yellows and reds against whites.

Responding to his subject with improvisation, every painting is different in its colour scheme and arrangement. In all the sketches, he redirected emphasis from the delicacy of the flowers towards simple broad strokes of colour, something Harold Town thought &quot;[imparted] a toughness of design sometimes missing in his harder themes of rock and bracken&quot;. In &quot;Water Flowers&quot; particularly, the shapes are handled so summarily that the focus moves entirely to the colour of the flowers. This, combined with the black background, produces a more abstract effect. The black backdrop also causes the colours of the flowers to appear more vivid.

====Industry in nature====


During Thomson&#x27;s time in Algonquin Park, logging and the lumber industry were a constant presence. He often painted the machinery left behind by lumber companies; Lismer, MacDonald and he were especially drawn to the subject. A. Y. Jackson wrote, 

Around 1916, Thomson followed the drive of logs down the Madawaska River, painting the subject in &quot;The Drive&quot;. MacDonald similarly expressed the drive in his 1915 painting &quot;Logs on the Gatineau&quot;. Besides the dams, pointer and alligator boats and log drives that appear in Thomson&#x27;s work, other less obvious depictions of the lumber industry are evident. For example, areas cleared out due to logging appear in early sketches, such as &quot;Canoe Lake&quot; (1913) and &quot;Red Forest&quot;. The painting &quot;Drowned Land&quot; similarly displays the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. As well, the white birches present in many paintings only thrive in &quot;sunny, open areas whose previous tree cover had been removed&quot;, meaning that logging was in some way necessary for them to flourish.

Thomson&#x27;s and the Group of Seven&#x27;s work reflects the typical Canadian attitudes of the time, namely that the available natural resources were meant to be exploited. Harold Town has argued that, while Thomson was not directly critical of industry, mining and logging, he &quot;did not glorify industry in the bush.&quot; Paul Walton of McMaster University noted that Thomson occasionally referenced both the lumbering and tourism practices of Algonquin Park and &quot;did not entirely ignore the damaging effects of logging on the environment... but for the most part he concentrated on newly opened vista of sky and water or on finding decorative patterns of colour, form, and texture in the tangle of underbrush, smaller trees, and bared rock, the &#x27;bush&#x27; that was often the remnant of the original forest.&quot; Jackson first noted these distinctions in Thomson&#x27;s works, from those &quot;showing a low shore line and a big sky&quot; and those &quot;finding happy color motives amid [the] tangle and confusion&quot; of &quot;his waste of rock and swamp.&quot;
====People====
Thomson, like most of the members of the Group of Seven, rarely painted people. When he did, the human subject was usually someone close to him personally, such as the depiction of Shannon Fraser &quot;In the Sugar Bush&quot;. Harold Town observed that both Thomson and Canadian artist David Milne &quot;shared in common a similar inability to draw the human figure&quot;, something professor John Wadland thought was &quot;embarrassingly evident&quot; in several of Thomson&#x27;s portraits. Thomson&#x27;s most successful attempts at capturing people typically feature figures far off in the distance, allowing them to blend in to the scene. This is apparent in paintings like &quot;Little Cauchon Lake&quot;, &quot;Bateaux&quot;, &quot;The Drive&quot;, &quot;The Pointers&quot; and &quot;Tea Lake Dam&quot;.

Town described paintings like &quot;Man with Axe (Lowery Dixon) Splitting Wood&quot; as stiff, yet still held together in a cohesive crudity. He described &quot;Figure of a Lady, Laura&quot; differently, interpreting it as a tender work, &quot;well-designed and plainly expressed, this loving picture is so secure in intention that it survives, indeed triumphs, over the severe cracking of the paint&quot;. The figure in &quot;The Poacher&quot; is recorded deliberately, including his hat, hunting vest and blue shirt. The hot coal grill in front of him is drying his poach—likely venison.

==Legacy and influence==


Since his death, Thomson&#x27;s work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he &quot;is the manifestation of the Canadian character&quot;. Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, &quot;Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one&#x27;s mind.&quot; Murray notes that Thomson&#x27;s influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Rae Johnson, Joyce Wieland, Gordon Rayner and Michael Snow. Sherrill Grace wrote that for Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he &quot;is a haunting presence&quot; and &quot;embodies the Canadian artistic identity&quot;. Canadian contemporary artists still cite Thomson as an influence, particularly Kim Dorland.

As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was &quot;Early Spring, Canoe Lake&quot;, which sold in 2009 for CAD$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost &quot;Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park&quot;; discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market, such as those produced by convicted forger William Firth MacGregor. Art historian Joan Murray assembled a catalogue raisonné of Thomson works until her retirement in 2016.

In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson&#x27;s shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The gravesite has become a popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Though best known for his painting, Thomson is often mythologized as a veritable outdoorsman. James MacCallum contributed stories to this image. He has often been remembered as an expert , though David Silcox has argued that this image is romanticized. In the case of fishing, he was no doubt proficient. He had a deep love of fishing for his entire life, so much so that his reputation through Algonquin Park was equally divided between art and angling. Most who visited the Park were led by hired guides, but he travelled through the park on his own. Many of his fishing locations appear in his work.

<text>iPhoto is a discontinued image editing software application developed by Apple Inc. for use on its Mac OS X operating system. It was included with every Mac computer from 2002 to 2015, when it was replaced with Apple&#x27;s Photos application in OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Originally sold as part of the iLife suite of digital media management applications, iPhoto is able to import, organize, edit, print, and share digital photos.

==History==
iPhoto was announced at Macworld 2002, during which Steve Jobs (then-CEO of Apple) also announced that macOS-X would be the default operating system on new Macs, and revealed new iMac and iBook models.

On March 7, 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an iOS-native version of iPhoto alongside the third-generation iPad.

On June 27, 2014, Apple announced that they would cease development of iPhoto and work on a transition to their new Photos app. On February 5, 2015 Apple included a preview of Photos with a beta release of OS X Yosemite.

On April 8, 2015, Apple released OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, which included the new Photos app. iPhoto and Aperture were discontinued and removed from the Mac App Store, but can still be downloaded by users who previously purchased them.

macOS Mojave 10.14 was the last version of macOS to officially support iPhoto. A free, open-source application called Retroactive can modify iPhoto to enable it to continue running on macOS Catalina and later macOS releases.

==Features==

===macOS version===
iPhoto is designed to allow the importing of pictures from digital cameras, local storage devices such as USB flash drives, CDs, DVDs and hardrives to a user&#x27;s iPhoto Library. Almost all digital cameras are recognized without additional software. iPhoto supports most common image file formats, including several Raw image formats. iPhoto also supports videos from cameras, but editing is limited to trimming clips.

After photos are imported, they can be titled, labeled, sorted and organized into groups (known as &quot;events&quot;). Individual photos can be edited with basic image manipulation tools, such as a red-eye filter, contrast and brightness adjustments, cropping and resizing tools, and other basic functions. iPhoto did not, however, provide the comprehensive editing functionality of programs such as Apple&#x27;s own Aperture, Adobe&#x27;s Photoshop, Album) or GIMP.

iPhoto offers numerous options for sharing photos. Photo albums can be made into dynamic slideshows, with the option to add music imported from iTunes. Photos can be shared via iMessage, Mail, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter. Creating and sharing iCloud Photostreams is possible as well. iPhoto is also able to sync photo albums to any iPod with a color display. These iPods might also have an audio/video output to allow photos to be played back, along with music, on any modern television. Additionally, photos can be printed to a local printer, or, in certain markets, be sent over the internet to Kodak for professional printing. iPhoto users can order a range of products, including standard prints, posters, cards, calendars, and 100-page hardcover or softcover volumes, although such services are available only to users in certain markets.

===iOS version===

At an Apple media event on March 7, 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a new version of iPhoto for iOS. iPhoto for iOS was made available that day on the App Store for 4.99, alongside the already-released iMovie and GarageBand for iOS. It officially supports the iPhone 4 and later, iPod Touch (4th and 5th generations), iPad 2 and later and iPad Mini (1st and 2nd generations), but users discovered that it could be installed manually on older devices using Apple&#x27;s iPhone Configuration Utility.

iPhoto for iOS offers a feature set fairly comparable to that of its Mac counterpart. It can organize photos that are synced to the device or taken with its camera. Editing features include color correction tools and photo effects, as well as cropping and straightening tools. iPhoto for iOS lacks tools for creating books, calendars, cards and ordering prints. It can, however, create &quot;Photo Journals&quot;: digital photo collages that can be uploaded to iCloud and shared.

iPhoto for iOS was highly praised for its professional tools, good performance and compatibility.

iPhoto for iOS was discontinued in 2014 and removed from the App Store in favor of the Photos app, which shipped with iOS 8.
