<text>3G refers to the third-generation of cellular network technology. These networks were rolled out beginning in the early 2000s and represented a significant advancement over the second-generation (2G), particularly in terms of data transfer speeds and mobile internet capabilities. The major 3G standards are UMTS (developed by 3GPP, succeeding GSM) and CDMA2000 (developed by Qualcomm, succeeding cdmaOne); both of these are based on the IMT-2000 specifications established by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

While 2G networks such as GPRS and EDGE supported limited data services, 3G introduced significantly higher-speed mobile internet and enhanced multimedia capabilities, in addition to improved voice quality. It provided moderate internet speeds suitable for general web browsing and multimedia content including video calling and mobile TV, supporting services that provide an information transfer rate of at least 144 kbit/s. 

Later 3G releases, often referred to as 3.5G (HSPA) and 3.75G (HSPA+) as well as EV-DO, introduced important improvements, enabling 3G networks to offer mobile broadband access with speeds ranging from several Mbit/s up to 42 Mbit/s. These updates improved the reliability and speed of internet browsing, video streaming, and online gaming, enhancing the overall user experience for smartphones and mobile modems in comparison to earlier 3G technologies. 3G was later succeeded by 4G technology, which provided even higher data transfer rates and introduced advancements in network performance.

== Overview ==

=== Context ===
A new generation of cellular standards has emerged roughly every decade since the introduction of 1G systems in 1979. Each generation is defined by the introduction of new frequency bands, higher data rates, and transmission technologies that are not backward-compatible due to the need for significant changes in network architecture and infrastructure. 

=== Standards ===
Several telecommunications companies marketed wireless mobile Internet services as &quot;3G&quot;, indicating that the advertised service was provided over a 3G wireless network. However, 3G services have largely been supplanted in marketing by 4G and 5G services in most areas of the world. Services advertised as 3G are required to meet IMT-2000 technical standards, including standards for reliability and speed (data transfer rates). To meet the IMT-2000 standards, Third-generation mobile networks, or 3G, must maintain minimum consistent Internet speeds of 144 Kbps. However, many services advertised as 3G provide higher speed than the minimum technical requirements for a 3G service. Subsequent 3G releases, denoted 3.5G and 3.75G, provided mobile broadband access of several Mbit/s for smartphones and mobile modems in laptop computers.

3G branded standards:
*The UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) system, standardized by 3GPP in 2001, was used in Europe, Japan, China (with a different radio interface) and other regions predominated by GSM (Global Systems for Mobile Communications) 2G system infrastructure. The cell phones are typically UMTS and GSM hybrids. Several radio interfaces are offered, sharing the same infrastructure:
** The original and most widespread radio interface is called W-CDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access).
** The TD-SCDMA radio interface was commercialized in 2009 and only offered in China.
** The latest UMTS release, HSPA+, can provide peak data rates up to 56 Mbit/s in the downlink in theory (28 Mbit/s in existing services) and 22 Mbit/s in the uplink.
*The CDMA2000 system, first offered in 2002, standardized by 3GPP2, used especially in North America and South Korea, sharing infrastructure with the IS-95 2G standard. The cell phones are typically CDMA2000 and IS-95 hybrids. The latest release EVDO Rev. B offers peak rates of 14.7 Mbit/s downstream.

The 3G systems and radio interfaces are based on spread spectrum radio transmission technology. While the GSM EDGE standard (&quot;2.9G&quot;), DECT cordless phones and Mobile WiMAX standards formally also fulfill the IMT-2000 requirements and are approved as 3G standards by ITU, these are typically not branded as 3G and are based on completely different technologies.

The common standards complying with the IMT2000/3G standard are:
* EDGE, a revision by the 3GPP organization to the older 2G GSM based transmission methods, which utilizes the same switching nodes, base station sites, and frequencies as GPRS, but includes a new base station and cellphone RF circuits. It is based on the three times as efficient 8PSK modulation scheme as a supplement to the original GMSK modulation scheme. EDGE is still used extensively due to its ease of upgrade from existing 2G GSM infrastructure and cell phones.
** EDGE combined with the GPRS 2.5G technology is called EGPRS, and allows peak data rates in the order of 200 kbit/s, just like the original UMTS WCDMA versions and thus formally fulfill the IMT2000 requirements on 3G systems. However, in practice, EDGE is seldom marketed as a 3G system, but a 2.9G system. EDGE shows slightly better system spectral efficiency than the original UMTS and CDMA2000 systems, but it is difficult to reach much higher peak data rates due to the limited GSM spectral bandwidth of 200 kHz, and it is thus a dead end.
** EDGE was also a mode in the IS-136 TDMA system, no longer used.
** Evolved EDGE, the latest revision, has peaks of 1 Mbit/s downstream and 400 kbit/s upstream but is not commercially used.
* The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, created and revised by the 3GPP. The family is a full revision from GSM in terms of encoding methods and hardware, although some GSM sites can be retrofitted to broadcast in the UMTS/W-CDMA format.
** W-CDMA is the most common deployment, commonly operated on the 2,100 MHz band. A few others use the 850, 900, and 1,900 MHz bands.
*** HSPA is an amalgamation of several upgrades to the original W-CDMA standard and offers speeds of 14.4 Mbit/s down and 5.76 Mbit/s up. HSPA is backward-compatible and uses the same frequencies as W-CDMA.
*** HSPA+, a further revision and upgrade of HSPA, can provide theoretical peak data rates up to 168 Mbit/s in the downlink and 22 Mbit/s in the uplink, using a combination of air interface improvements as well as multi-carrier HSPA and MIMO. Technically though, MIMO and DC-HSPA can be used without the &quot;+&quot; enhancements of HSPA+.
* The CDMA2000 system, or IS-2000, including CDMA2000 1x and CDMA2000 High Rate Packet Data (or EVDO), standardized by 3GPP2 (&quot;differing&quot; from the 3GPP), evolving from the original IS-95 CDMA system, is used especially in North America, China, India, Pakistan, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa.
** CDMA2000 1x Rev. E has an increased voice capacity (by three times the original amount) compared to Rev. 0 EVDO Rev. B offers downstream peak rates of 14.7 Mbit/s while Rev. C enhanced existing and new terminal user experience.

While DECT cordless phones and Mobile WiMAX standards formally also fulfill the IMT-2000 requirements, they are not usually considered due to their rarity and unsuitability for usage with mobile phones.

=== Break-up of 3G systems ===
The 3G (UMTS and CDMA2000) research and development projects started in 1992. In 1999, ITU approved five radio interfaces for IMT-2000 as a part of the ITU-R M.1457 Recommendation; WiMAX was added in 2007.

There are evolutionary standards (EDGE and CDMA) that are backward-compatible extensions to pre-existing 2G networks as well as revolutionary standards that require all-new network hardware and frequency allocations. The cell phones use UMTS in combination with 2G GSM standards and bandwidths, but &quot;do not support EDGE&quot;. The latter group is the UMTS family, which consists of standards developed for IMT-2000, as well as the independently developed standards DECT and WiMAX, which were included because they fit the IMT-2000 definition.

While EDGE fulfills the 3G specifications, most GSM/UMTS phones report EDGE (&quot;2.75G&quot;) and UMTS (&quot;3G&quot;) functionality.

== History ==

3G technology was the result of research and development work carried out by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the early 1980s. 3G specifications and standards were developed in fifteen years. The technical specifications were made available to the public under the name IMT-2000. The communication spectrum between 400 MHz to 3 GHz was allocated for 3G. Both the government and communication companies approved the 3G standard. The first pre-commercial 3G network was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1998, branded as FOMA. It was first available in May 2001 as a pre-release (test) of W-CDMA technology. The first commercial launch of 3G was also by NTT DoCoMo in Japan on 1 October 2001, although it was initially somewhat limited in scope; broader availability of the system was delayed by apparent concerns over its reliability.

The first European pre-commercial network was an UMTS network on the Isle of Man by Manx Telecom, the operator then owned by British Telecom, and the first commercial network (also UMTS based W-CDMA) in Europe was opened for business by Telenor in December 2001 with no commercial handsets and thus no paying customers.

The first network to go commercially live was by SK Telecom in South Korea on the CDMA-based 1xEV-DO technology in January 2002. By May 2002, the second South Korean 3G network was by KT on EV-DO and thus the South Koreans were the first to see competition among 3G operators.

The first commercial United States 3G network was by Monet Mobile Networks, on CDMA2000 1x EV-DO technology, but the network provider later shut down operations. The second 3G network operator in the US was Verizon Wireless in July 2002, also on CDMA2000 1x EV-DO. AT&amp;T Mobility was also a true 3G UMTS network, having completed its upgrade of the 3G network to HSUPA.

The first commercial United Kingdom 3G network was started by Hutchison Telecom which was originally behind Orange S.A. In 2003, it announced first commercial third generation or 3G mobile phone network in the UK.

The first pre-commercial demonstration network in the southern hemisphere was built in Adelaide, South Australia, by m.Net Corporation in February 2002 using UMTS on 2100 MHz. This was a demonstration network for the 2002 IT World Congress. The first commercial 3G network was launched by Hutchison Telecommunications branded as &quot;Three&quot; or &quot;3&quot; in June 2003.

In India, on 11 December 2008, the first 3G mobile and internet services were launched by a state-owned company, Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited (MTNL), within the metropolitan cities of Delhi and Mumbai. After MTNL, another state-owned company, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), began deploying the 3G networks country-wide.

Emtel launched the first 3G network in Africa.

=== Adoption ===

Japan was one of the first countries to adopt 3G, the reason being the process of 3G spectrum allocation, which in Japan was awarded without much upfront cost. The frequency spectrum was allocated in the US and Europe based on auctioning, thereby requiring a huge initial investment for any company wishing to provide 3G services. European companies collectively paid over 100 billion dollars in their spectrum auctions.

Nepal Telecom adopted 3G Service for the first time in southern Asia. However, its 3G was relatively slow to be adopted in Nepal. In some instances, 3G networks do not use the same radio frequencies as 2G, so mobile operators must build entirely new networks and license entirely new frequencies, especially to achieve high data transmission rates. Other countries&#x27; delays were due to the expenses of upgrading transmission hardware, especially for UMTS, whose deployment required the replacement of most broadcast towers. Due to these issues and difficulties with deployment, many carriers could not or delayed the acquisition of these updated capabilities.

In December 2007, 190 3G networks were operating in 40 countries and 154 HSDPA networks were operating in 71 countries, according to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA). In Asia, Europe, Canada, and the US, telecommunication companies use W-CDMA technology with the support of around 100 terminal designs to operate 3G mobile networks.

The roll-out of 3G networks was delayed by the enormous costs of additional spectrum licensing fees in some countries. The license fees in some European countries were particularly high, bolstered by government auctions of a limited number of licenses and sealed bid auctions, and initial excitement over 3G&#x27;s potential. This led to a telecoms crash that ran concurrently with similar crashes in the fibre-optic and dot.com fields.

The 3G standard is perhaps well known because of a massive expansion of the mobile communications market post-2G and advances of the consumer mobile phone. An especially notable development during this time is the smartphone (for example, the iPhone, and the Android family), combining the abilities of a PDA with a mobile phone, leading to widespread demand for mobile internet connectivity. 3G has also introduced the term &quot;mobile broadband&quot; because its speed and capability made it a viable alternative for internet browsing, and USB Modems connecting to 3G networks, and now 4G became increasingly common.

=== Market penetration ===
By June 2007, the 200 millionth 3G subscriber had been connected of which 10 million were in Nepal and 8.2 million in India. This 200 millionth is only 6.7% of the 3 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide. (When counting CDMA2000 1x RTT customers—max bitrate 72% of the 200 kbit/s which defines 3G—the total size of the nearly-3G subscriber base was 475 million as of June 2007, which was 15.8% of all subscribers worldwide.) In the countries where 3G was launched first – Japan and South Korea – 3G penetration is over 70%. In Europe the leading country for 3G penetration is Italy with a third of its subscribers migrated to 3G. Other leading countries for 3G use include Nepal, UK, Austria, Australia and Singapore at the 32% migration level.

According to ITU estimates, as of Q4 2012 there were 2096 million active mobile-broadband subscribers worldwide out of a total of 6835 million subscribers—this is just over 30%. About half the mobile-broadband subscriptions are for subscribers in developed nations, 934 million out of 1600 million total, well over 50%. Note however that there is a distinction between a phone with mobile-broadband connectivity and a smart phone with a large display and so on—although according to the ITU and informatandm.com the US has 321 million mobile subscriptions, including 256 million that are 3G or 4G, which is both 80% of the subscriber base and 80% of the US population, according to ComScore just a year earlier in Q4 2011 only about 42% of people surveyed in the US reported they owned a smart phone. In Japan, 3G penetration was similar at about 81%, but smart phone ownership was lower at about 17%. In China, there were 486.5 million 3G subscribers in June 2014, in a population of 1,385,566,537 (2013 UN estimate).

=== Decline and decommissions ===
Since the increasing adoption of 4G networks across the globe, 3G use has been in decline. Several operators around the world have already or are in the process of shutting down their 3G networks (see table below). In several places, 3G is being shut down while its older predecessor 2G is being kept in operation; Vodafone UK is doing this, citing 2G&#x27;s usefulness as a low-power fallback. EE in the UK, plans to switch off their 3G networks in early 2024. In the US, Verizon shutdown their 3G services on 31 December 2022, T-Mobile shut down Sprint&#x27;s networks on and shutdown their main networks on 1 July 2022, and AT&amp;T has done so on 22 February 2022.

Currently 3G around the world is declining in availability and support. Technology that depends on 3G for usage are becoming inoperable in many places. For example, the European Union plans to ensure that member countries maintain 2G networks as a fallback, so 3G devices that are backwards compatible with 2G frequencies can continue to be used. However, in countries that plan to decommission 2G networks or have already done so as well, such as the United States and Singapore, devices supporting only 3G and backwards compatible with 2G are becoming inoperable. As of February 2022, less than 1% of cell phone customers in the United States used 3G; AT&amp;T offered free replacement devices to some customers in the run-up to its shutdown.

== Patents ==
It has been estimated that there are almost 8,000 patents declared essential (FRAND) related to the 483 technical specifications which form the 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards. Twelve companies accounted in 2004 for 90% of the patents (Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola, Philips, NTT DoCoMo, Siemens, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu, Hitachi, InterDigital, and Matsushita).

Even then, some patents essential to 3G might not have been declared by their patent holders. It is believed that Nortel and Lucent have undisclosed patents essential to these standards.

Furthermore, the existing 3G Patent Platform Partnership Patent pool has little impact on FRAND protection because it excludes the four largest patent owners for 3G.

== Features ==

=== Data rates ===
ITU has not provided a clear definition of the data rate that users can expect from 3G equipment or providers. Thus users sold 3G service may not be able to point to a standard and say that the rates it specifies are not being met. While stating in commentary that &quot;it is expected that IMT-2000 will provide higher transmission rates: a minimum data rate of 2 Mbit/s for stationary or walking users, and 348 kbit/s in a moving vehicle,&quot; the ITU does not actually clearly specify minimum required rates, nor required average rates, nor what modes of the interfaces qualify as 3G, so various data rates are sold as &#x27;3G&#x27; in the market.

In a market implementation, 3G downlink data speeds defined by telecom service providers vary depending on the underlying technology deployed; up to 384 kbit/s for UMTS (WCDMA), up to 7.2 Mbit/sec for HSPA, and a theoretical maximum of 21.1 Mbit/s for HSPA+ and 42.2 Mbit/s for DC-HSPA+ (technically 3.5G, but usually clubbed under the tradename of 3G).

=== Security ===

3G networks offer greater security than their 2G predecessors. By allowing the UE (User Equipment) to authenticate the network it is attaching to, the user can be sure the network is the intended one and not an impersonator. 3G networks use the KASUMI block cipher instead of the older A5/1 stream cipher. However, a number of serious weaknesses in the KASUMI cipher have been identified.

In addition to the 3G network infrastructure security, end-to-end security is offered when application frameworks such as IMS are accessed, although this is not strictly a 3G property.

=== Applications of 3G ===
The bandwidth and location capabilities introduced by 3G networks enabled a wide range of applications that were previously impractical or unavailable on 2G networks. Among the most significant advancements was the ability to perform data-intensive tasks, such as browsing the internet seamlessly while on the move, as well as engaging in other activities that benefited from faster data speeds and enhanced reliability. 

Beyond personal communication, 3G networks supported applications in various fields, including medical devices, fire alarms, and ankle monitors. This versatility marked a significant milestone in cellular communications, as 3G became the first network to enable such a broad range of use cases. By expanding its functionality beyond traditional mobile phone usage, 3G set the stage for the integration of cellular networks into a wide array of technologies and services, paving the way for further advancements with subsequent generations of mobile networks.

== Evolution ==
Both 3GPP and 3GPP2 are working on the extensions to 3G standards that are based on an all-IP network infrastructure and using advanced wireless technologies such as MIMO. These specifications already display features characteristic for IMT-Advanced (4G), the successor of 3G. However, falling short of the bandwidth requirements for 4G (which is 1 Gbit/s for stationary and 100 Mbit/s for mobile operation), these standards are classified as 3.9G or Pre-4G.
3GPP plans to meet the 4G goals with LTE Advanced, whereas Qualcomm has halted UMB development in favour of the LTE family.

On 14 December 2009, TeliaSonera announced in an official press release that &quot;We are very proud to be the first operator in the world to offer our customers 4G services.&quot; With the launch of their LTE network, initially they are offering &quot;pre-4G&quot; (or &quot;beyond 3G&quot;) services in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway.

<text>A drongo is a member of the family Dicruridae of passerine birds of the Old World tropics. The 28 species in the family are placed in a single genus, Dicrurus.

Drongos are mostly black or dark grey, short-legged birds, with an upright stance when perched. They have forked tails and some have elaborate tail decorations. They feed on insects and small birds, which they catch in flight or on the ground. Some species are accomplished mimics and have a variety of alarm calls, to which other birds and animals often respond. They are known to utter fake alarm calls that scare other animals off food, which the drongo then claims.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot; was introduced by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot for the drongos in 1816. The type species was subsequently designated as the balicassiao (&quot;Dicrurus balicassius&quot;) by English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1841. The name of the genus combines the Ancient Greek words &quot;dikros&quot; &quot;forked&quot; and &quot;oura&quot; &quot;tail&quot;. &quot;Drongo&quot; is originally from the indigenous language of Madagascar, where it refers to the crested drongo; it is now used for all members of the family.

This family now includes only the genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot;, although Christidis and Boles (2007) expanded the family to include the subfamilies Rhipidurinae (Australasian fantails), Monarchinae (monarch and paradise flycatchers), and Grallininae (magpie larks).

The family was formerly treated as having two genera, &quot;Chaetorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Dicrurus&quot;. The genus &quot;Chaetorhynchus&quot; contains a single species, the New Guinea-endemic &quot;C. papuensis&quot;. On the basis of both morphological and genetic differences, it is now placed with the fantails (Rhipiduridae) and renamed from the pygmy drongo to the drongo fantail.

The genus &quot;Dicrurus&quot; contains 28 species:
The family Dicruridae is most likely of Indo-Malayan origin, with a colonization of Africa about 15 million years ago (Mya). Dispersal across the Wallace Line into Australasia is estimated to have been more recent, around 6 Mya.

==Characteristics==

These insectivorous birds are usually found in open forests or bush. Most are black or dark grey in colour, sometimes with metallic tints. They have long, forked tails; some Asian species have elaborate tail decorations. They have short legs and sit very upright whilst perched, like a shrike. They flycatch or take prey from the ground. Some drongos, especially the greater racket-tailed drongo, are noted for their ability to mimic other birds and even mammals.

Two to four eggs are laid in a nest high in a tree. Despite their small size, they are aggressive and fearless, and will attack much larger species if their nests or young are threatened.

Several species of animals and birds respond to drongos&#x27; alarm calls, which often warn of the presence of a predator. Fork-tailed drongos in the Kalahari Desert use alarm calls in the absence of a predator to cause animals to flee and abandon food, which they eat, getting up to 23% of their food this way. They not only use their own alarm calls, but also imitate those of many species, either their victim&#x27;s or that of another species to which the victim responds. If the call of one species is not effective, perhaps because of habituation, the drongo may try another; 51 different calls are known to be imitated. In one test on pied babblers, the babbler ignored an alarm call repeated three times when no danger was present, but continued to respond to different calls. Researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess theory of mind, not fully shown in any animal other than humans.

==Insult==
The word &quot;drongo&quot; is used in Australian English as a mild form of insult meaning &quot;idiot&quot; or &quot;stupid fellow&quot;. This usage derives from an Australian racehorse of the same name (apparently after the spangled drongo, &quot;D. bracteatus&quot;) in the 1920s that never won despite many places. The word also has been frequently used among friends and can be used in a casual or serious tone.

<text>2G refers to the second-generation of cellular network technology, which were rolled out globally starting in the early 1990s. The main differentiator to previous mobile telephone systems, retrospectively dubbed 1G, is that the radio signals of 2G networks are digital rather than analog, for communication between mobile devices and base stations. In addition to voice telephony, 2G also made possible the use of data services.

The most common 2G technology has been the GSM standard, which became the first globally adopted framework for mobile communications. Other 2G technologies include cdmaOne and the now-discontinued Digital AMPS (D-AMPS/TDMA), as well the Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) and Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) in Japan.

The transition to digital technology enabled the implementation of encryption for voice calls and data transmission, significantly improving the security of mobile communications while also increasing capacity and efficiency compared to earlier analog systems. 2G networks were primarily designed to support voice calls and Short Message Service (SMS), with later advancements such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) enabling always-on packet data services, including email and limited internet access. 2G was succeeded by 3G technology, which provided higher data transfer rates and expanded mobile internet capabilities.

== History ==
2G was first commercially launched in 1991 by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa Oyj) in Finland in the form of GSM, which was defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) defined the cdmaOne (IS-95) 2G standard, with an eight to ten fold increase in voice call capacity compared to analog AMPS. The first deployment of cdmaOne was in 1995. In North America, Digital AMPS (IS-54 and IS-136) and cdmaOne (IS-95) were dominant, but GSM was also used. 

Later 2G releases in the GSM space, often referred to as 2.5G and 2.75G, include General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). GPRS allows 2G networks to achieve a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 40 kbit/s (5 kB/s). EDGE increases this capacity, providing a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 384 kbit/s (48 kB/s).

Three primary benefits of 2G networks over their 1G predecessors were:

* Digitally encrypted phone conversations, at least between the mobile phone and the cellular base station but not necessarily in the rest of the network.
* Significantly more efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum enabling more users per frequency band.
* Data services for mobile, starting with SMS text messages then expanding to Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).

== Evolution of GSM 2G ==
=== 2.5G (GPRS) ===

2.5G (&quot;second-and-a-half generation&quot;) refers to 2G systems that incorporate a packet-switched domain alongside the existing circuit-switched domain, most commonly implemented through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). GPRS enables packet-based data transmission by dynamically allocating multiple timeslots to users, improving network efficiency. However, this does not inherently provide faster speeds, as similar techniques, such as timeslot bundling, are also employed in circuit-switched data services like High-Speed Circuit-Switched Data (HSCSD). Within GPRS-enabled 2G systems, the theoretical maximum transfer rate is 40 kbit/s (5 kB/s).
=== 2.75G (EDGE) ===

2.75G refers to the evolution of GPRS networks into EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) networks, achieved through the introduction of 8PSK (8 Phase Shift Keying) encoding. While the symbol rate remained constant at 270.833 samples per second, the use of 8PSK allowed each symbol to carry three bits instead of one, significantly increasing data transmission efficiency. Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), also known as Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS) or IMT Single Carrier (IMT-SC), is a backward-compatible digital mobile phone technology built as an extension to standard GSM. First deployed in 2003 by AT&amp;T in the United States, EDGE offers a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 384 kbit/s (48 kB/s).

=== 2.875G (EDGE Evolution) ===
Evolved EDGE (also known as EDGE Evolution or 2.875G) is an enhancement of the EDGE mobile technology that was introduced as a late-stage upgrade to 2G networks. While EDGE was first deployed in the early 2000s as part of GSM networks, Evolved EDGE was launched much later, coinciding with the widespread adoption of 3G technologies such as HSPA and just before the emergence of 4G networks. This timing limited its practical application.

Evolved EDGE increased data throughput and reduced latencies (down to 80 ms) by utilizing improved modulation techniques, dual carrier support, dual antennas, and turbo codes. It achieved peak data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s, significantly enhancing network efficiency for operators that had not yet transitioned to 3G or 4G infrastructures. However, despite its technical improvements, Evolved EDGE was never widely deployed. By the time it became available, most network operators were focused on implementing more advanced technologies like UMTS and LTE. As of 2016, no commercial networks were reported to support Evolved EDGE.

== Phase-out ==

2G, understood as GSM and CdmaOne, has been superseded by newer technologies such as 3G (UMTS / CDMA2000), 4G (LTE / WiMAX) and 5G (5G NR). However, 2G networks were still available in most parts of the world, while notably excluding the majority of carriers in North America, East Asia, and Australasia.

Many modern LTE-enabled devices have the ability to fall back to 2G for phone calls, necessary especially in rural areas where later generations have not yet been implemented. In some places, its successor 3G is being shut down rather than 2G – Vodafone previously announced that it had switched off 3G across Europe in 2020 but still retains 2G as a fallback service. In the US T-Mobile shut down their 3G services while retaining their 2G GSM network.

Various carriers have made announcements that 2G technology in the United States, Japan, Australia, and other countries are in the process of being shut down, or have already shut down 2G services so that carriers can re-use the frequencies for newer technologies (e.g. 4G, 5G).

As a legacy protocol, 2G connectivity is considered insecure. Specifically, there exist well known methods to attack weaknesses in GSM since 2009 with practical use in crime. Attack routes on 2G CdmaOne were found later and remain less publicized.

Android 12 and later provide a network setting to disable 2G connectivity for the device. iOS 16 and later can disable 2G connectivity by enabling Lockdown Mode.

=== Criticism ===
In some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, 2G remains widely used for older feature phones and for internet of things (IoT) devices such as smart meters, eCall systems and vehicle trackers to avoid the high patent licensing cost of newer technologies. Terminating 2G services could leave vulnerable people who rely on 2G infrastructure unable to communicate even with emergency contacts, causing harm and possibly deaths.

<text>Polymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are mineral concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. As nodules can be found in vast quantities, and contain valuable metals, deposits have been identified as a potential economic interest. Depending on their composition and authorial choice, they may also be called ferromanganese nodules. Ferromanganese nodules are mineral concretions composed of silicates and insoluble iron and manganese oxides that form on the ocean seafloor and terrestrial soils. The formation mechanism involves a series of redox oscillations driven by both abiotic and biotic processes. As a byproduct of pedogenesis, the specific composition of a ferromanganese nodule depends on the composition of the surrounding soil. The formation mechanisms and composition of the nodules allow for couplings with biogeochemical cycles beyond iron and manganese. The high relative abundance of nickel, copper, manganese, and other rare metals in nodules has increased interest in their use as a mining resource.

Nodules vary in size from tiny particles visible only under a microscope to large pellets more than across. However, most nodules are between in diameter, about the size of hen&#x27;s eggs. Their surface textures vary from smooth to rough. They frequently have botryoidal (mammillated or knobby) texture and vary from spherical in shape to typically oblate, sometimes prolate, or are otherwise irregular. The bottom surface, buried in sediment, is generally rougher than the top due to a different type of growth.

==Occurrence==
Nodules lie on the seabed sediment, often partly or completely buried. They vary greatly in abundance, in some cases touching one another and covering more than 70% of the sea floor surface. The total amount of polymetallic nodules on the sea floor was estimated at 500 billion tons by Alan A. Archer of the London Geological Museum in 1981.

Polymetallic nodules are found in both shallow (e.g. the Baltic Sea) and deeper waters (e.g. the central Pacific), even in lakes, and are thought to have been a feature of the seas and oceans at least since the deep oceans were oxygenated in the Ediacaran period over 540 million years ago.

Polymetallic nodules were discovered in 1868 in the Kara Sea, in the Arctic Ocean of Siberia. During the scientific expeditions of HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; (1872–1876), they were found to occur in most oceans of the world.

Their composition varies by location, and sizeable deposits have been found in the following areas:
* Penrhyn Basin within the Cook Islands.
* North central Pacific Ocean in a region called the Clarion–Clipperton zone (CCZ) roughly midway between Hawaii and Clipperton Islands.
* Peru Basin in the southeast Pacific, and
* Southern tropical Indian Ocean in a region termed the Indian Ocean Nodule Field (IONF) roughly 500 km SE of Diego Garcia Island.
*In the Eastern Pacific, including the area around Juan Fernández Islands and the abyssal plain offshore Loa River.

The largest of these deposits in terms of nodule abundance and metal concentration occur in the Clarion–Clipperton zone on vast abyssal plains in the deep ocean between . The International Seabed Authority estimates that the total amount of nodules in the Clarion–Clipperton zone exceeds 21 billions of tons (Bt), containing about 5.95 Bt of manganese, 0.27 Bt of nickel, 0.23 Bt of copper and 0.05 Bt of cobalt.

All of these deposits are in international waters apart from the Penrhyn Basin, which lies within the exclusive economic zone of the Cook Islands.

==Growth and composition==

In both marine and terrestrial environments, ferromanganese nodules are composed primarily of iron and manganese oxide concretions supported by an aluminosilicate matrix and surrounding a nucleus. Typically terrestrial nodules are more enriched in iron, while marine nodules tend to have higher manganese to iron ratios, depending on the formation mechanism and surrounding sedimentary composition. Regardless of where they form, the nodules are characterized by enrichment in iron, manganese, heavy metals, and rare earth element content when compared to the Earth&#x27;s crust and surrounding sediment. However, organically-bound elements in the surrounding environment are not readily incorporated into nodules. 

=== Marine nodules ===
On the seabed the abundance of nodules varies and is likely controlled by the thickness and stability of a geochemically active layer that forms at the seabed. Pelagic sediment type and seabed bathymetry (or geomorphology) likely influence the characteristics of the geochemically active layer.

Nodule growth is one of the slowest of all known geological phenomena, on the order of a centimeter over several million years. Several processes are hypothesized to be involved in the formation of nodules, including the precipitation of metals from seawater, the remobilization of manganese in the water column (diagenetic), the derivation of metals from hot springs associated with volcanic activity (hydrothermal), the decomposition of basaltic debris by seawater and the precipitation of metal hydroxides through the activity of microorganisms (biogenic). The sorption of divalent cations such as Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ at the surface of Mn- and Fe-oxyhydroxides, known to be strong sorbents, also plays a main role in the accumulation of these transition metals in the manganese nodules. These processes (precipitation, sorption, surface complexation, surface precipitation, incorporation by formation of solid solutions...) may operate concurrently or they may follow one another during the formation of a nodule.

Manganese nodules are essentially composed of hydrated phyllomanganates. These are layered Mn-oxide minerals with interlayers containing water molecules in variable quantities. They strongly interact with trace metals (Co2+, Ni2+) because of the octahedral vacancies present in their layers. The particular properties of phyllomanganates explain the role they play in many geochemical concentration processes. They incorporate traces of transition metals mainly via cation exchange in their interlayer like clay minerals and surface complexation by formation of inner sphere complexes at the oxide surface as it is also the case with hydrous ferric oxides, HFO. Slight variations in their crystallographic structure and mineralogical composition may result in considerable changes in their chemical reactivity.

The mineral composition of manganese-bearing minerals is dependent on how the nodules are formed; sedimentary nodules, which have a lower Mn2+ content than diagenetic, are dominated by Fe-vernadite, Mn-feroxyhyte, and asbolane-buserite while diagenetic nodules are dominated by buserite I, birnessite, todorokite, and asbolane-buserite. The growth types termed diagenetic and hydrogenetic reflect suboxic and oxic growth, which in turn could relate to periods of interglacial and glacial climate. It has been estimated that suboxic-diagenetic type 2 layers make up about 50–60% of the chemical inventory of the nodules from the Clarion–Clipperton zone (CCZ) whereas oxic-hydrogenetic type 1 layers comprise about 35–40%. The remaining part (5–10%) of the nodules consists of incorporated sediment particles occurring along cracks and pores.

The chemical composition of nodules varies according to the type of manganese minerals and the size and characteristics of their core. Those of greatest economic interest contain manganese (27–30 wt. %), nickel (1.25–1.5 wt. %), copper (1–1.4 wt. %) and cobalt (0.2–0.25 wt. %). Other constituents include iron (6 wt. %), silicon (5 wt. %) and aluminium (3 wt. %), with lesser amounts of calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, titanium and barium, along with hydrogen and oxygen as well as water of crystallization and free water. In a given manganese nodule, there is one part of iron oxide for every two parts of manganese dioxide.

A wide range of trace elements and trace minerals are found in nodules with many of these incorporated from the seabed sediment, which itself includes particles carried as dust from all over the planet before settling to the seabed.

The size of marine ferromanganese nodules can range from a diameter of 1–15 cm, surrounding a nucleus. The nucleus itself can be made from a variety of small objects in the surrounding environment, including fragments from previously broken down nodules, rock fragments, or sunken biogenic matter. Total nodule composition varies based on the formation mechanism, broadly broken down into two major categories: hydrogenetic and diagenetic. Hydrogenetic nodules have a higher iron and cobalt enrichment with manganese to iron ratios less than 2.5, while diagenetic nodules are more enriched with manganese, nickel, and copper with manganese to iron ratios typically between 2.5 and 5 but upwards to 30+ in sub-oxic conditions. The parent mineral for hydrogenetic nodules is vernadite and buserite for diagenetic nodules. The majority of observed nodules are a mixture of hydrogenetic and diagenetic regions of growth, preserving the changes in formation mechanisms over time. Generally, diagenetic layers are found on the bottom where the nodule is either buried in or touching the sea floor sediment and hydrogenetic layers are found towards the top where it is exposed to the overlying water column. Nodule layers are discontinuous and vary in thickness on micro to nanometer scale with those composed of higher manganese content typically brighter and those with higher iron content dark and dull.

=== Terrestrial nodules ===
Terrestrial ferromanganese nodules form in a variety of soil types, including but not limited to ultisols, vertisols, inceptisols, alfisols, and mollisols. Similar to the marine nodules, concretion layers are defined based on iron and manganese content as well as their combination. High iron content nodules appear a red or brown color, while high manganese content appears black or grey. The dominant metal oxide is related to the elements enriched in the nodule. In manganese-dominated nodules, enriched elements include barium, strontium, nickel, cobalt, copper, cadmium, lead, and zinc. In contrast, iron-dominated nodules are enriched in vanadium, phosphorus, arsenic, and chromium.

== Formation ==

=== Marine origin ===
Marine ferromanganese nodules form from the precipitation of primarily iron, manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt, and zinc around the nucleus. The mechanism is defined based on the source of the precipitation. Precipitation sourced from the above water column is referred to as hydrogenetic, while precipitation from the sediment pore water is diagenetic. Nodule growth occurs more readily in oxygenated environments with relatively low sedimentation rates that provide adequate levels of labile organic matter to fuel precipitation. When sedimentation rates are too high, nodules can be completely covered in sediments, lowering the local oxygen levels and preventing precipitation. Growth rates for nodules are a current topic for research complicated by the irregular and discontinuous nature of their formation, but average rates have been calculated using radiometric dating. In general hydrogenetic nodules grow slower than diagenetic at approximately 2–5 mm per million years versus 10 mm per million years. The formation of polynodules from multiple nodules growing together is possible and hypothesized to be facilitated by deposited encrusting organisms.

=== Terrestrial origin ===
Formation of terrestrial ferromanganese nodules involves the accumulation of iron and manganese oxides followed by repeated redox cycles of reductive dissolution and oxidative precipitation. The oscillating redox cycle is controlled by pH, microbial activity, organic matter concentration, groundwater level, soil saturation, and redox potential. Anthropogenic activity could influence these cycles through increased nutrient loading via fertilizers. Assessment of the changing paleoclimate conditions during soil evolution can be explored by analyzing the nodule&#x27;s concretion structure when combined with dating techniques. Manganese layers typically form at higher redox potentials compared to iron layers, but a period of rapid increase in redox potential can form a mixed layer. As the nodules are formed, trace elements including but not limited to nickel, cobalt, copper, and zinc are incorporated. Trace metals composition is a product of three processes: uptake of parent material in surrounding soil, accumulation of the products of microbial iron or manganese-reducing bacteria, and complexation on the nodule&#x27;s surface.

==Proposed mining – history of mining activities ==
Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s. Almost half a billion dollars was invested in identifying potential deposits and in research and development of technology for mining and processing nodules. These studies were carried out by four multinational consortia composed of companies from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, and two groups of private companies and agencies from France and Japan. There were also three publicly sponsored entities from the Soviet Union, India and China.
In the late 1970s, two of the international joint ventures collected several hundred-ton quantities of manganese nodules from the abyssal plains ( + depth) of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Significant quantities of nickel (the primary target) as well as copper and cobalt were subsequently extracted from this &quot;ore&quot; using both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods. In the course of these projects, a number of ancillary developments evolved, including the use of near-bottom towed side-scan sonar array to assay the nodule population density on the abyssal silt while simultaneously performing a sub-bottom profile with a derived, vertically oriented, low-frequency acoustic beam. Since then, deep sea technology has improved significantly: including widespread and low cost use of navigation technology such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and ultra-short baseline (USBL); survey technology such as multibeam echosounder (MBES) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV); and intervention technology including remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) and high power umbilical cables. There is also improved technology that could be used in mining including pumps, tracked and screw drive rovers, rigid and flexible drilling risers, and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene rope. Mining is considered to be similar to the potato harvest on land, which involves mining a field partitioned into long, narrow strips. The mining support vessel follows the mining route of the seafloor mining tools, picking up the about potato-sized nodules from the seafloor.

In the 2010s, increased demand for nickel and other metals prompted commercial interest in seabed nodules. The International Seabed Authority has granted new exploration contracts and is progressing development of a mining code for the area, with most interest being in the Clarion–Clipperton zone.

Since 2011, a number of commercial companies have received exploration contracts. These include subsidiaries of larger companies including Lockheed Martin, DEME (Global Sea Mineral Resources, GSR), Keppel Corporation, The Metals Company, and China Minmetals, and smaller companies like Nauru Ocean Resources, Tonga Offshore Mining and Marawa Research and Exploration.

In July 2021, Nauru announced a plan to exploit nodules in this area, which requires the International Seabed Authority, which regulates mining in international waters, to finalize mining regulations by July 2023. Environmentalists have criticized this move on the grounds that too little is known about seabed ecosystems to understand the potential impacts of deep-sea mining, and some of the major tech companies, including Samsung and BMW, have committed to avoid using metals derived from nodules.

=== Proposed mining areas of manganese nodules ===

The Clarion–Clipperton zone serves as the largest and most popular area for mining manganese nodules. Extending from approximately 120W to 160W, the Clarion–Clipperton zone can be located in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Hawaii and Mexico. According to the ISA, it covers an area of about four million square kilometers which almost equals the size of the European Union. The huge potential of the Clarion–Clipperton zone is based on an estimated amount of 21 billion tons of nodules. Around 44 million tons of cobalt are stored in that area alone, which is around three times more than the land reserves could provide. Manganese nodule fields are not equally distributed on the seafloor within the Clarion–Clipperton zone but rather occur in patches. Economically interesting patches with a high distribution of manganese nodules can cover an area of several thousand square kilometers. This rather irregular nodule distribution in the South Pacific can be found as a possible result of the greater topographic and sedimentological diversity of the South Pacific.

=== The economic interest of mining manganese nodules ===
The high natural abundance of nickel, copper, cobalt, zinc, iron, and manganese in ferromanganese nodules has promoted research into their use as a rare metal resource. The Clarion–Clipperton zone in the northeastern Pacific Ocean has been observed as an area containing the highest concentration of resource-grade nodules. A bulk weight greater than 3% for nickel, copper, and cobalt is required to be considered resource-grade. Nodule formation in oxic waters at or below the carbonate compensation depth produces the most desirable rare metal ratio in hydrogenic nodules. As the grade of ores from terrestrial mines has decreased over time, ferromanganese nodules may offer a way to meet the growing global demand for rare metals. However, the low estimated growth rate of hydrogenic nodules of about 2–5 mm per million years categorizes them as a non-renewable resource.

Technologies like electric car batteries, wind turbines and solar panels require rare types of resources that can be found in the seabed. Manganese nodules provide various sources of these metals, especially cobalt. The ongoing digitalization, transport and energy transition causes a rising demand for metals such as copper, nickel cobalt and many other metals used in technology. Manganese Nodules are therefore needed for batteries, laptops, and smartphones, in e-bikes and e-cars, solar and wind turbines as well as for the storage of green electricity. This enormous demand in cobalt sets the ocean into a new light — many countries have already staked their claims. Yet at the same time, mining them might cause even greater damages to the deep-sea ecosystem. Some scientists question the prime economical interest in manganese nodules. As far as they are concerned, such biological resources could be an untapped value for biotechnologies and medicines and should therefore be protected at all cost.

==Ecology==
Ferromanganese nodules are highly redox active, allowing for interaction with biogeochemical cycles primarily as an electron acceptor. Notably, terrestrial nodules uptake and trap nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon. The higher rate of organic carbon uptake allows nodules to enhance a soil&#x27;s ability to sequester carbon, creating a net sink. Phosphorus concentration in the nodules ranges from 2.5 to 7 times the value of the surrounding soil matrix. Microbes in the soil can utilize the nutrient enrichment on the surface of nodules coupled with their redox potential to fuel their metabolic pathways and release the once immobile phosphorus. Along with nutrients, ferromanganese nodules can sequester toxic heavy metals (lead, copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, and cadmium) from the soil, improving its quality. However, similar to the release of phosphorus by microbes, reductive dissolution of the nodules would release these heavy metals back into the soil.

===Abiogenesis theory===
A recent study hypothesizes that the nodules are a source of &quot;dark oxygen&quot;, oxygen produced without light, which provides the seafloor in the deep ocean with oxygen. However, this study contrasts with many other studies conducted over decades in the deep sea that did not detect oxygen production - and in fact showed only oxygen consumption. If the nodules can produce both electrical energy and oxygen, they may challenge the conventional theory of abiogenesis because, previously only living things such as plants and algae were known to be capable of producing oxygen via photosynthesis which requires sunlight.

== Environmental impacts of mining manganese nodules ==
Very little is known about deep sea ecosystems or the potential impacts of deep-sea mining. Polymetallic nodule fields are hotspots of abundance and diversity for a highly vulnerable abyssal fauna, much of which lives attached to nodules or in the sediment immediately beneath it. Nodule mining could affect tens of thousands of square kilometers of these deep sea ecosystems, and ecosystems take millions of years to recover. It causes habitat alteration, direct mortality of benthic creatures, or smothering of filter feeders by sediment. Due to the complexity and remoteness of the deep-sea, environmental scientists work in a knowledge poor situation with many gaps and high uncertainty. Nevertheless, there are several sources of cumulative impacts caused within a mining operation that must be considered. These impacts can be directly caused by the mining activities themselves but also occur as indirect impacts such as sedimentation plumes and disposition. Multiple impacts can be caused from the same mining activity but affect the deep-sea environment in different ways.

These could include:

* discharge plumes that have effects of clogging feeding mechanisms of plankton
* Noise and light pollution that cause reduced visibility for predators
* Ecotoxicological or chemical temperature changes in the water quality

=== Destruction of seabed and habitat ===
The dump-truck-sized collection vehicles that scour the seafloor for nodule-bearing sediment, do necessarily destroy the top of the seabed at a depth of often more than three kilometers below the surface. Scientists found that collection vehicles can have long-lasting physical and biological effects on the seafloor and cause an altering of various deep-sea ecosystems that scientists are still working to understand. This mining method leads to an inevitable loss of life among animals while the plow tracks remained visible decades later. Recent growth estimates suggest that &quot;microbially mediated biogeochemical functions&quot; need over 50 years to return to their undisturbed initial state. The DISCOL impact study aimed to reveal the potential long-term impacts of deep-sea mining-related disturbances on seafloor integrity by revisiting 26-year-old plough tracks. While nodules appeared outside the tracks dusted with sediments, the plough tracks themselves were clearly devoid of nodules.

The contracts to explore for manganese nodules are typically for areas up to , but the total area affected by the extractions is much greater. The extent of physically disturbed seabed area in one mine contract area only can be assumed to be between each year, which equals the size of a large town.

=== Sediment laden plumes ===
The mining robots operating on the seabed floor emit plumes of sediment, which could cover fauna in the area around the mining site and therefore have a great impact on the ecosystem of the seabed. The produced plumes contain a mixture of dissolved material and suspended particles of a range of sizes. Dissolved material is transported inextricably by the water that contains it, whereas suspended particles tend to sink. The contained area can be estimated much bigger than the actual mined area, since finer particles and dissolved material will be transported greater distances away from the actual mined area. Seabed accumulations of plume material will therefore be thicker and contain larger particles close to the source of the plume.

In addition to the plumes created by mining activities on the seabed, discharge plumes should also be considered, that will be created by the return of excess water. Excess water occurs during the dewatering process on board of the surface vessel as well as when ore slurries are transported from the mothership to the transport barges. Predictions of the net impact of plumes should therefore consider a range of scenarios. A lot of unknowns remain, scientists warn that there might be toxic impacts.

=== Noise pollution ===
Human generated sound can cause direct damage to marine animals, as many of them use sound as their primary mode of communication. The extreme background noise caused by the mining machines can interfere with the communication between animals and limit their ability to detect prey. Furthermore, noise and vibration can affect auditory senses and systems of marine animals. Noise can be caused during different processes of deep-sea mining:

* noise and vibration from seabed production tools
* midwater plumes used to transfer ores to the surface ship
* the surface ship itself

The surface vessel produces several high intensities sounds for example caused by the propellers, engines, generators, and hydraulic pumps. It is also important to consider the fact that the ship will operate almost continuously for many years during the mining contract which usually lasts for 20–30 years.

=== Light pollution ===
Mining activities could impair the feeding and reproduction of deep-sea species through the creation of intense noise and light pollution in a naturally dark and silent environment. Light pollution is another important factor that causes environmental impacts on sea life. The light that is used to make mining work undersea possible could attract or repel some animal species, bright lights can also blind certain marine animals. Strong lights used at the vessel and ships can influence birds as well as near surface animals.

===Reduced oxygen content===
If these nodules are shown to produce a significant quantity of oxygen, removal of this oxygen source may impact communities.

== Mitigation of environmental impacts ==
There is still a gap in research of how to reduce these environmental impacts. This is partly because the entire ocean ecosystem still needs to be discovered and researched much more. Some scientists suggest that one possibility would be to reduce the weight of mining vehicles. This could reduce compaction and lessen the amount of disturbed sediment at the rear of the vehicle. Since many deep seas are extremely dependent on the hard substrate of manganese nodules in their food chain, another option would be to leave at least a few tracks of nodules left and to not harvest them. Due to the extremely long growth rate, the mined manganese nodules will not return for millions of years. To combat this, distributing manufactured replacement nodules could be an option. But these possibilities also need to be further explored. The most beneficial mitigation effect would bring a reduction of the sediment plumes and their spreading, as these not only affect the immediate surroundings, but also affect the ecosystem at considerable distances from the nodule harvesting sites.Experimental studies in the 1990s concluded in part that trial mining at a reasonable scale would likely help best constrain real impacts from any commercial mining.

=== Recovery potential of seabed ecosystems ===
The slow recovery potential of ecosystems can be seen as one of the major concerns of nodule mining. Seabed areas that contain nodules will be massively disturbed and the recovery of epifauna is exceptionally slow within the mined areas. A significant proportion of the animals are dependent on the nodules, which create a hard substrate for them. These substrates will not return for millions of years until new nodules are formed. Nodules grow from a few to a few tens of millimeters per million years. Their extreme slow growth rate is not continuous or regular and differs regarding the environment and surface. They may also not grow at all or be completely buried for periods of time. Altogether, manganese nodules grow with an average of 10–20 mm per million years and usually have an age of several million years – if they are not mined. Because many deep-sea species are rare, long-lived and slow to reproduce, and because polymetallic nodules (which may take millions of years to develop to a harvestable size) are an important habitat for deep-sea species, scientists can not rule out that some species would face extinction from habitat removal due to mining. The affected ecosystems would require extremely long time periods to recover, if ever. Nodule mining could affect tens of thousands of square kilometers of deep-sea ecosystems, and ecosystems take millions of years to recover.

<text>Donald Lamont Jack (6 December 1924 – 2 June 2003) was an English and Canadian novelist and playwright.

==Life==
Jack was born in Radcliffe, Bury, England and grew up in Britain, attending the well regarded Bury Grammar School and Marr College and later serving in the RAF in World War II (1943–47).

After the war he emigrated to Canada in 1951, and became a Canadian citizen in 1964. From 1955 to 1957 he was a scriptwriter for Crawley Films. After 1957 he became a full-time freelance writer.

He wrote for the stage, radio, and for television programs such as &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Unforeseen&quot;, &quot;Playdate&quot;, &quot;Hatch&#x27;s Mill&quot;, &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot;, and &quot;On Camera&quot;, but he is most famous for his novels, the &quot;Bandy Papers&quot;, which recount the humorous adventures of Bartholomew Bandy, a World War I fighter pilot. His play &quot;The Canvas Barricade&quot; was the first Canadian play produced at the Stratford Festival of Canada. Other stage plays included &quot;Exit Muttering&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Minuet for Brass Band&quot;. He had 39 TV plays produced, 22 radio plays, and numerous documentaries. Most of Jack&#x27;s book-length works are being re-published, or published for the first time, by Sybertooth.

Jack died of a stroke at his home in Warwickshire, England in June 2003.

<doc id="282496" wikidata="Q1215876" url="?curid=282496" title="Hiberno-Latin">
<text>Hiberno-Latin was a learned style of literary Latin first used and subsequently spread by Irish monks during the period from the sixth century to the twelfth century.

==Vocabulary and influence==
Hiberno-Latin was notable for its curiously learned vocabulary. While neither Hebrew nor Greek was widely known in Western Europe during this period, odd words from these sources, as well as from Irish and British sources, were added to Latin vocabulary by these authors. It has been suggested that the unusual vocabulary of the poems was the result of the monks learning Latin words from dictionaries and glossaries which did not distinguish between obscure and common words; unlike many others in Western Europe at the time, the Irish monks did not speak a language descended from Latin. During the sixth and seventh centuries AD, Irish monasticism spread through Christian Europe; Irish monks who founded these monasteries often brought Hiberno-Latin literary styles with them.

Notable authors whose works contain something of the Hiberno-Latin spirit include St Columba, St Columbanus, St Adamnan, and Virgilius Maro Grammaticus. St Gildas, the Welsh author of the , is also credited with the , or &quot;Breastplate&quot;, an apotropaic charm against evil that is written in a curiously learned vocabulary; this too probably relates to an education in the Irish styles of Latin. John Scotus Eriugena was probably one of the last Irish authors to write Hiberno-Latin wordplay. St Hildegard of Bingen preserves an unusual Latin vocabulary that was in use in her convent, and which appears in a few of her poems; this invention may also be influenced by Hiberno-Latin. According to Charles D. Wright, the Hiberno-Latin language went extinct around the twelfth century as the Visio Tnugdali was also written in the Hiberno-Latin as a final flourish for the language.
The style reaches its peak in the , which means roughly &quot;Western orations&quot;; these are rhetorical descriptive poems couched in a kind of free verse. is understood as a portmanteau word combining , Ireland, and , the semi-legendary &quot;Western Isles&quot; that may have been inspired by the Azores or the Canary Islands; the coinage is typical of the wordplay used by these authors. A brief excerpt from a poem on the dawn from the shows the Irish poet decorating his verses with Greek words:
One usage of in classical times was as a synonym for Italy, and it is noticeable that some of the vocabulary and stylistic devices of these pieces originated not among the Irish, but with the priestly and rhetorical poets who flourished within the world dominated ecclesiastically by Rome (especially in Italy, Gaul, Spain and Africa) between the fourth and the sixth centuries, such as Juvencus, Avitus of Vienne, Dracontius, Ennodius and Venantius Fortunatus. (Thus the very word , plural – a pseudo-archaic coinage from the classical verb , &#x27;to speak&#x27; – is first recorded in the metrical Gospels of Juvencus. Similarly, the word-arrangement often follows the sequence &quot;adjective 1 - adjective 2 - verb - noun 1 - noun 2&quot;, known as the &quot;golden line&quot;, a pattern used to excess in the too-regular prosody of these poets; the first line quoted above is an example.) The underlying idea, then, would be to cast ridicule on these Roman-oriented writers by blending their stylistic tricks with incompetent scansion and applying them to unworthy subjects.
On a much more intelligible level, the sixth-century abecedarian hymn shows many of the features of Hiberno-Latin: the word , the &quot;first sower&quot; meaning &quot;creator&quot;, refers to God using an unusual neologism. The text of the poem also contains the word , meaning &quot;hands;&quot; this is probably from Hebrew (, &quot;two hands&quot;). The poem is also an extended alphabetical acrostic, another example of the wordplay typical of Hiberno-Latin. Irish (but not Continental) manuscripts traditionally attributed the poem to the sixth-century Irish mystic Saint Columba, but this attribution is doubtful. Marking with an asterisk (*) words that are learned, neologisms, unusually spelled, or unusual in the context they stand, the poem begins:
==Similar usage==
* In Italian, Francesco Colonna created a similar style (in prose), packed with neologisms drawn from Hebrew, Greek and Latin, for his allegory (1499).
* The Spanish Golden Century poet Luis de Góngora was the champion of culteranismo (sometimes called &quot;gongorism&quot; in English), a style that subjected Spanish to abstruse Latinate neologism, obscure allusions to Classical mythology and violent hyperbaton.
* In English, euphuism – a 16th-century tendency named after the character Euphues who appears in two works by its chief practitioner John Lyly – shows similar qualities.

<text>Nicholas of Cusa (1401 – 11 August 1464), also referred to as Nicholas of Kues and Nicolaus Cusanus (), was a German Catholic bishop and polymath active as a philosopher, theologian, jurist, mathematician, and astronomer. One of the first German proponents of Renaissance humanism, he made spiritual and political contributions to European culture. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on &quot;learned ignorance,&quot; as well as his participation in power struggles between Rome and the German states of the Holy Roman Empire.

As papal legate to Germany from 1446, he was appointed cardinal for his merits by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 and Prince-Bishop of Brixen two years later. In 1459, he became vicar general in the Papal States.

Nicholas has remained an influential figure. In 2001, the sixth centennial of his birth was celebrated on four continents and commemorated by publications on his life and work.

==Life==

Nicholas was born in Kues (Latinized as &quot;Cusa&quot;) in southwestern Germany. He was the second of four children of Johan Krebs (or Cryfftz) and Katherina Roemer. His father was &quot;a prosperous boat owner and ferryman.&quot; Nicholas entered the Faculty of Arts of the Heidelberg University in 1416 as &quot;a cleric of the Diocese of Trier,&quot; studying the liberal arts. He seemed to have left Heidelberg soon afterwards, as he received his doctorate in canon law from the University of Padua in 1423. In Padua, he met the later cardinals Julian Cesarini and Domenico Capranica and became friends with the mathematician Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. Afterwards, he entered the University of Cologne in 1425 as &quot;a doctor of canon law,&quot; which he appears to have both taught and practiced there. In Cologne, he made friends with the scholastic theologian Heymeric de Campo.

Following a brief period in Cologne, Nicholas returned to his hometown and became secretary to Otto of Ziegenhain, the Prince-Archbishop of Trier. Otto appointed him canon and dean at the stift of Saint Florinus in Koblenz affiliated with numerous prebends. In 1427 he was sent to Rome as an episcopal delegate. The next year he travelled to Paris to study the writings of Ramon Llull. At the same time he rejected a calling by the newly established University of Leuven. He acquired great knowledge in the research of ancient and medieval manuscripts as well as in textual criticism and the examination of primary sources. In 1433 he identified the &quot;Donation of Constantine&quot; as a fake, confirmed by Lorenzo Valla a few years later, and revealed the forgery of the &quot;Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals&quot;. He made friends with the Austrian astronomer Georg von Peuerbach and advocated a reform of the Julian calendar and the Easter computus, which, however, was not realized until the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582.

After the Archbishop Otto of Trier had died in 1430, Pope Martin V appointed the Speyer bishop Raban of Helmstatt his successor. Nevertheless, the Electorate was contested by opposing parties, and in 1432 Nicholas attended the Council of Basel representing the Cologne dean Ulrich von Manderscheid, one of the claimants, who hoped to prevail against the new Pope Eugene IV. Nicholas stressed the determining influence of the cathedral chapter and its given right to participate in the succession policy, which even places the pope under an obligation to seek a consent. His efforts were to no avail in regard to Ulrich&#x27;s ambitions; however, Nicholas&#x27;s pleadings earned him a great reputation as an intermediary and diplomat. While present at the council, he wrote his first work, &quot;De concordantia catholica&quot; (&quot;The Catholic Concordance&quot;), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent. This work remained useful to critics of the papacy long after Nicholas left Basel.

Initially as conciliarist, Nicholas approached his university friend Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who had tried to reconcile pope and council, combining reform and hierarchic order. Nicholas supported transfer of the council to Italy to meet with the Greeks, who needed aid against the Ottoman Turks. He arbitrated in the conflict with the Hussites. Between the summer of 1437 and early 1438 he was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope&#x27;s approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the papally summoned Council of Florence of 1439, which was attempting to bring the Eastern Orthodox Church into union with the Western Catholic Church. The reunion achieved at this conference turned out to be very brief. Nicholas would later claim (in the postfaced dedicatory letter of &quot;On Learned Ignorance&quot;, which Nicholas finished writing on 12 February 1440) that he had chosen to write on this metaphysical topic because of a shipboard experience of divine illumination while on the ship returning from this mission to Constantinople.

After a successful career as a papal envoy, he was made a cardinal by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 or 1449. In 1450 he was both named Bishop of Brixen, in Tyrol, and commissioned as a papal legate to the German lands to spread the message of reform. In 1444, the White Tower of Brixen caught fire and in 1459 he commissioned its reconstruction in a Gothic style. This latter role, his &#x27;Great Legation&#x27; of 1450–1452, involved travel of almost 3000 miles, preaching, teaching and reforming. He became known as the &quot;Hercules of the Eugenian cause.&quot; His local councils enacted reforms, many of which were not successful. Pope Nicholas canceled some of Nicholas&#x27;s decrees, and the effort to discourage pilgrimages to venerate the bleeding hosts of Wilsnack (the so-called Holy Blood of Wilsnack) was unsuccessful. His work as bishop between 1452 and 1458 – trying to impose reforms and reclaim lost diocesan revenues – was opposed by Duke Sigismund of Austria. The duke imprisoned Nicholas in 1460, for which Pope Pius II excommunicated Sigismund and laid an interdict on his lands. Nicholas returned to Rome, but was never able to return to his bishopric.

He died at Todi in Umbria on 11 August 1464. Sigismund&#x27;s capitulation came a few days after Nicholas&#x27;s death.
Upon his death, Nicholas&#x27;s body was interred in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, probably near the relic of Peter&#x27;s chains; but it was later lost. His monument, with a sculpted image of the cardinal, remains. Two other tombstones, one medieval and one modern, also are found in the church. In accordance with his wishes, his heart rests within the chapel altar at the Cusanusstift in Kues. To this charitable institution that he had founded he bequeathed his entire inheritance; it still stands, and serves the purpose Nicholas intended for it, as a home for the aged. The Cusanusstift also houses many of his manuscripts.

==Philosophy==
Nicholas&#x27;s &quot;De Docta Ignorantia&quot; (&#x27;Of Learned Ignorance&#x27;) is an epistemological and metaphysical treatise. He maintains the finite human mind cannot fully know the divine, infinite mind (&#x27;the Maximum&#x27;). Nonetheless, he holds that the human intellect can become aware of its limitations in knowing God and thus attain &quot;learned ignorance&quot;. His theory shows the influence of neoplatonism and negative theology, and he frequently cites Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.

Nicholas was noted for his deeply mystical writings about Christianity. He wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and their unfolding in creation. He was suspected by some of holding pantheistic beliefs, but his writings were never accused of being heretical. Nicholas also wrote in &quot;De coniecturis&quot; about using conjectures or surmises to rise to better understanding of the truth. The individual might rise above mere reason to the vision of the intellect, but the same person might fall back from such vision.

Theologically, Nicholas anticipated the implications of Reformed teaching on the harrowing of Hell (Sermon on Psalm 30:11), followed by Pico della Mirandola, who similarly explained the &quot;descensus&quot; in terms of Christ&#x27;s agony.

==Science and mathematics==
Most of Nicholas&#x27;s mathematical ideas can be found in his essays, &quot;De Docta Ignorantia&quot; (&quot;Of Learned Ignorance&quot;), &quot;De Visione Dei&quot; (&quot;On the Vision of God&quot;) and &quot;De coniecturis&quot; (&quot;On Conjectures&quot;). He also wrote on squaring the circle in his mathematical treatises.

Mathematics plays a key role for Cusanus in orienting the human mind towards God. Mathematical figures provide a means for the mind to consider how figures may be deformed and transformed, and thus prepares the mind to reach the &quot;coincidence of opposites&quot; in the &quot;Absolutely maximal Being&quot;. 

From the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1913 edition):
The astronomical views of the cardinal are scattered through his philosophical treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the universe, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had Copernicus been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work.

Like Nicole Oresme, Nicholas also wrote about the possibility of the plurality of worlds.

Norman Moore tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:
In medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ...Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ...The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa.
==Politics==
In 1433, Nicholas proposed reform of the Holy Roman Empire and a method to elect Holy Roman Emperors. Although it was not adopted by the Church, his method was essentially the same one known today as the Borda count, which is used in many academic institutions, competitions, and even some political jurisdictions, in original form and a number of variations. His proposal preceded Borda&#x27;s work by over three centuries.

Nicholas&#x27;s opinions on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were cited against papal claims of temporal power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Protestant writers were happy to cite a cardinal against Rome&#x27;s assertions. Protestants, however, found his writings against the Hussites wrong. Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self-interpreting and self-sufficient for salvation, the principle of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;.

Nicholas&#x27;s own thought on the church changed with his departure from Basel. He tried arguing that the Basel assembly lacked the consent of the church throughout the world, especially the princes. Then he tried arguing that the church was unfolded from Peter (&quot;explicatio Petri&quot;). This allowed him to support the pope without abandoning ideas of reform. Thus, he was able to propose to Pius II reform of the church, beginning with the pope himself. Then it was to spread through the Roman curia and outward throughout Christendom.

Nicholas noted that government was founded on the consent of the governed:
:Accordingly, since by nature all men are free, any authority by which subjects are prevented from doing evil and their freedom is restrained to doing good through fear from penalties, comes solely from harmony and from the consent of the subjects, whether the authority reside in written law or in the living law which is in the ruler. For if by nature men are equally strong and equally free, the true and settled power of one over the others, the ruler having equal natural power, could be set up only by the choice and consent of the others, just as a law also is set up by consent.

==Other religions==
Shortly after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Nicholas wrote &quot;De pace fidei&quot;, &quot;On the Peace of Faith&quot;. This visionary work imagined a summit meeting in Heaven of representatives of all nations and religions. Islam and the Hussite movement in Bohemia are represented. The conference agrees that there can be &quot;una religio in varietate rituum&quot;, a single faith manifested in different rites, as manifested in the eastern and western rites of the Catholic Church. The dialog presupposes the greater accuracy of Christianity but gives respect to other religions. Nicholas&#x27;s position was for Europeans not to retake Constantinople but simply to trade with the Ottomans and allow them their conquests. Less irenic but not virulent, is his &quot;Cribratio Alchorani&quot;, &quot;Sifting the Koran&quot;, a detailed review of the Koran in Latin translation. While the arguments for the superiority of Christianity are still shown in this book, it also credits Judaism and Islam with sharing in the truth at least partially.

== Influence ==
Nicholas was widely read, and his works were published in the sixteenth century in both Paris and Basel. Sixteenth-century French scholars, including Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples and Charles de Bovelles, cited him. Lefèvre even edited the Paris 1514 &quot;Opera&quot;. Nonetheless, there was no Cusan school, and his works were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, though Giordano Bruno quoted him, while some thinkers, like Gottfried Leibniz, were thought to have been influenced by him. Neo-Kantian scholars began studying Nicholas in the nineteenth century, and new editions were begun by the &quot;Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot; in the 1930s and published by Felix Meiner Verlag. In the early twentieth century, he was hailed by Ernst Cassirer as the &quot;first modern thinker,&quot; and much debate since then has centered around the question whether he should be seen as essentially a medieval or Renaissance figure. What is more, Cassirer presented Cusanus as the main focal point (&quot;einfachen Brennpunkt&quot;) of Italian Renaissance philosophy. Eminent scholars like Eugenio Garin and Paul Oskar Kristeller challenged Cassirer’s thesis, and went so far as to practically deny any considerable link between Nicholas of Cusa and Marsilio Ficino or Giovanni Pico. In the following decades, new hypotheses on the relationship between Cusanus and Italian humanists appeared, more balanced and focused on the sources.

Societies and centers dedicated to Nicholas can be found in Argentina, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. His well-known quote about the infinity of the universe is found paraphrased in the Central Holy Book of the Thelemites, The Book of the Law, which was &quot;received&quot; from the Angel Aiwass by Aleister Crowley in Cairo in April 1904: &quot;In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.&quot;

<doc id="282526" wikidata="Q922335" url="?curid=282526" title="Cantharellus">
<text>Cantharellus is a genus of mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles (), a name which can also refer to the type species, &quot;Cantharellus cibarius&quot;. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants. Chanterelles may resemble a number of other species, some of which are poisonous.

The name comes from the Greek word &quot;kantharos&quot; (&#x27;tankard, cup&#x27;). Chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms.

== Description ==
Mushrooms in the genus are generally shaped like cups or trumpets. The hue is mostly yellow, with the gills sometimes pinkish.

=== Similar species ===
The false chanterelle (&quot;Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca&quot;) has finer, more orange gills and a darker cap. It is sometimes regarded as poisonous.

The very similar jack-o&#x27;-lantern mushroom (&quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot;) and its sister species (&quot;Omphalotus olivascens&quot;) are very poisonous, though not lethal. They have true gills (unlike chanterelles) which are thinner, have distinct crowns, and generally do not reach up to the edge. Additionally, the jack-o-lantern mushroom is bioluminescent and grows on wood – possibly buried – whereas &quot;Cantharellus&quot; species grow on the ground.

Species in the genera &quot;Craterellus&quot;, &quot;Gomphus&quot;, and &quot;Polyozellus&quot; may also look like chanterelles.

== Taxonomy ==

The genus &quot;Cantharellus&quot; is large and has a complex taxonomic history. &quot;Index Fungorum&quot; lists over 500 scientific names that have been applied to the genus, although the number of currently valid names is less than 100. In addition to synonymy, many species have been moved into other genera such as &quot;Afrocantharellus&quot;, &quot;Arrhenia&quot;, &quot;Craterellus&quot;, &quot;Gomphus&quot;, &quot;Hygrophoropsis&quot;, and &quot;Pseudocraterellus&quot;. Molecular phylogenetic analyses are providing new information about relationships between chanterelle populations.
The genus has been divided into eight subgenera &quot;Afrocantharellus&quot; Eyssart. &amp; Buyck, &quot;Cantharellus&quot; Adans. ex Fr., &quot;Cinnabarinus&quot; Buyck &amp; V. Hofst., &quot;Magni&quot; T. Cao &amp; H.S. Yuan, &quot;Parvocantharellus&quot; Eyssart. &amp; Buyck, &quot;Pseudocantharellus&quot; Eyssart. &amp; Buyck, and &quot;Rubrini&quot; Eyssart. &amp; Buyck.

=== Selected species ===
=== Etymology ===
The name comes from the Greek κάνθαρος, &quot;kantharos&quot; &#x27;tankard, cup&#x27;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Cantharellus&quot; species are found throughout the world in association with mycorrhizal host plants, including Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia.

== Ecology ==
Chanterelles are associated with either conifers or hardwood trees, depending on species. They are often found with oaks in California, Texas. and Mexico. In Scotland, chanterelles grow in mixed forests of silver birch and Scots pine, especially when the forest has plenty of moist, mossy undergrowth. In Fife they are common under beech. They are usually (but not always) found in the same places as wild blueberries. In Spain they associate with sweet chestnut. They are abundant after from late July through autumn. In the coastal forests of Washington and British Columbia, they are often found in damp, mossy riparian zones in the vicinity of western hemlock.

==Uses==
Many species of chanterelles contain antioxidant carotenoids, such as beta-carotene in &quot;C. cibarius&quot; and &quot;C. minor&quot;, and canthaxanthin in &quot;C. cinnabarinus&quot; and &quot;C. friesii&quot;. They also contain significant amounts of vitamin D.

Their mycorrhizal nature makes the species very difficult to cultivate.

=== Culinary ===

Chanterelles in general go well with eggs, curry, chicken, pork, fish, beef and veal, can be used as toppings on pizzas, be stewed, marinated, sauteed, or used as filling for stuffed crêpes. Of course these are just examples; chanterelles are versatile and can be added as an ingredient to most dishes.

In European cuisine, chanterelles are often served with venison. A traditional method of preparing these mushrooms is sauteed and then used to make scrambled eggs.

In Polish tradition, chanterelles are used for making creamy sauces that top chicken.

Many mushroom enthusiasts just like chanterelles sauteed in butter, with a pinch of salt, a clove of fresh crushed garlic, and some whipping cream. This recipe is said to bring out the subtle flavor of the chanterelle without masking it with other aromas. This recipe has the added benefit of retaining flavor even after being stored frozen.

It is a feature of Viennese cuisine.

==== Preparation and storage ====
Since the mushrooms hold a lot of water, they are often prepared using a &quot;dry sauté&quot; method: after cleaning, the mushrooms are sliced and put in a covered pan over high heat with no oil or butter. The mushrooms then release much of their water, which can be allowed to boil off or be poured off and used as a stock. Many people often cook the mushrooms with butter because it &quot;sweetens&quot; them.

Chanterelles can also be pickled in brine. Salted water is brought to a boil and pickling spices such as peppercorns, mustard seeds, and thyme are added. The mushrooms are then cooked in this solution for 5–10 minutes before being transferred to sterilized bottles along with some of the liquid. Sliced garlic and dill can be added to the bottles for extra flavor. The remaining liquid forms an excellent stock for making soup. When pickled in this way, chanterelles can last from six to twelve months.

Another storage technique is drying. Mushrooms can be dried with gentle heat in an oven at temperatures of or less. A vacuum process is also practical on large orders. A few hours before final preparation, put dry mushrooms in water which they absorb for returning to nearly original size. Mushrooms can then be used as fresh and will last indefinitely as dry. 

Fresh chanterelles can generally be stored up to ten days in a refrigerator.

<doc id="282536" wikidata="Q4056126" url="?curid=282536" title="Austrian post offices in the Ottoman Empire">
<text>Austria and other European nations maintained an extensive system of post offices in the Ottoman Empire, typically motivated by the unreliable postal system of the Ottomans.

==First and last service period==
Austria gained permission in 1721 from the Ottoman Empire to operate a postal service for official correspondence only and subsequently this was extended to the opening of post offices and carrying mail for merchants. This resulted in 1748 with the establishment of a post office in Galata outside of Istanbul, and eventually extended to 65 locations throughout the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The oldest known cancellation is a double linear &quot;CONSTAN-TINOPEL&quot; in 1787.
The latest remaining Austrian post offices in Turkey area were closed on 30 September 1914.

==Stamp issues==
Beginning in 1863, stamps of Lombardy-Venetia were used: 2 to 15 soldi, which can be recognized only by the cancellation.
After the losses of Lombardy in 1859 and Venetia in 1866, Austria issued in 1867 and 1883 specific stamps, in appearance identical to Austrian stamps of the same period, but valued in soldi (2 to 50 soldi). 
Details on Levant Austria post-offices using the 1867 issue are given in Part III &quot;Postämter in der Levante&quot;.
In 1886 this was changed to paras and piasters to match the Turkish money already used by other countries, by surcharging the existing stamps of the offices, with further issues between 1888 and 1907: values ranging from 10 paras to 20 piasters.

The Jubilee issue of 1908–1914 included directly values in paras and in piasters.

==Gallery==
Some of the 1867–1883 soldi issues are rather common in unused state, contrary to the kreuzer equivalent. An extreme case is the 2 soldi yellow &quot;fine beard&quot;, lately issued in 1882: the ratio in value is 5000!

==Postal stationery==

The first items of Postal stationery to be made available to Austrian post offices in the Turkish Empire were envelopes in 1863. A total of 10 different envelopes in soldi currency were issued up to 1877, these were valid for use till 31 October 1884. Only one envelope was ever issued in French currency in 1908 (5 Centesimi for Jerusalem).

Postal stationery postcards were first issued in 1873 in soldi currency, five different postcards were issued. Then in 1888 these were replaced by an issue in Turkish currency, a total of 13 different items were issued before these were replaced by postcards in French currency in 1903. A total of eight different postcards are known in French currency.

Only one 10 soldi lettercard was issued in 1886. Four different 1 Piaster lettercards were issued in 1888, 1890, 1900 and 1908.

During the period of Turkish currency three different newspaper wrappers were issued in 1899, 1900 and 1908. One newspaper 5 Centimes wrapper was issued in 1908 for Jerusalem.

<text>The Argentine Confederation (Spanish: &quot;Confederación Argentina&quot;) was the last predecessor state of modern Argentina; its name is still one of the official names of the country according to the Argentine Constitution, Article 35. It was the name of the country from 1831 to 1852, when the provinces were organized as a confederation without a head of state. The governor of Buenos Aires Province (Juan Manuel de Rosas during most of the period) managed foreign relations during this time. Under his rule, the Argentine Confederation engaged in conflicts with Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, France and the United Kingdom, as well as other Argentine factions during the Argentine Civil Wars.

Rosas was ousted from power in 1852 by Justo José de Urquiza, after the battle of Caseros. Urquiza convened the 1853 Constituent Assembly to write a national constitution. Buenos Aires resisted Urquiza and seceded from the Confederation in 1852, becoming the State of Buenos Aires; the province would return to Argentina in 1861.

==History==
The territory of modern Argentina was a subset (approx. 1/3) of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, a colony of Spain which also included present-day Bolivia, Uruguay, part of Chile and Peru and most of Paraguay. The May Revolution in Buenos Aires began the Argentine War of Independence, which it won. The country was renamed the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Modern Bolivia and Paraguay were lost during the conflict and became new states. Uruguay was invaded and annexed by Brazil in 1816, until the Thirty-Three Orientals led an insurrection to rejoin the United Provinces. This began the Cisplatine War, which ended with the Treaty of Montevideo that made Uruguay a new state.

=== Coup, civil war, and unrest ===
In 1828, after Argentine forces returned to Buenos Aires from the war, federalist governor Manuel Dorrego was overthrown and executed by Juan Lavalle, of the Unitarian Party. The latter began a campaign against all federals, supported by José María Paz in Córdoba, who deposed Juan Bautista Bustos and took similar measures. The rancher Juan Manuel de Rosas, who joined parties pragmatically, organized the resistance against Lavalle. He allied with Estanislao López, caudillo and ruler of Santa Fe Province, and they defeated Lavalle at the Battle of Márquez Bridge in April 1829. When Rosas entered the city of Buenos Aires in November of that year, he was hailed both as a victorious military leader and as the head of the Federalists. Lavalle was forced out of government and the Legislature restored.

Paz organized the Unitarian League with the provinces that joined him, and Rosas signed the Federal Pact with the provinces Entre Ríos and Santa Fe. All the unitarian provinces were defeated and joined the Pact, and became the Argentine Confederation. Nevertheless, Rosas declined to continue as governor after victory and his term ended in 1832. 

After attaining independence, Argentina had attacked and conquered large areas of indigenous land. The indigenous people conducted raids called malones. Rosas left Buenos Aires and waged the first campaign in the desert in the south, to prevent more such raids. The campaign combined military actions and negotiations and succeeded in preventing malones for several years. Despite being absent, the political influence of Rosas in Buenos Aires was still strong, and his wife Encarnación Ezcurra was in charge of keeping good relations with the people of the city. 

On October 11, 1833, the city was filled with announcements of a trial against &quot;The restorer of laws&quot; (a newspaper, but it was misunderstood as a trial against Rosas himself, who held that title). A large number of gauchos and poor people instigated the Revolution of the Restorers, a demonstration at the gates of the legislature, praising Rosas and demanding the resignation of Governor Juan Ramón Balcarce, a former minister of Rosas. The troops who were organized to fight the demonstration instead mutinied and joined it. The legislature finally gave up the trial, and a month later ousted Balcarce and replaced him with Juan José Viamonte, a former supporter of unitarians. Still, the social unrest led many people to believe that only Rosas could secure order and that Viamonte or Manuel Vicente Maza, who had been appointed governor in 1834 as a compromise, would be unable to do so. The murder in Córdoba in February of 1835 of Facundo Quiroga, a federalist mediator who Maza had sent to a dispute between provinces, increased this belief, so the legislature appointed Rosas governor later in the year, with the sum of public power.

=== Rule of Rosas and war ===
Rosas faced a difficult military threat during first years of his second administration. First, the Peru–Bolivian Confederation in the north declared the War of the Confederation against Argentina and Chile. Then, France made diplomatic requests which were denied by Rosas and subsequently imposed a naval blockade as a result. France invaded Martín García island and deposed the Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, appointing instead the loyal Fructuoso Rivera, who declared war on Argentina in support of France. Domingo Cullen, from Santa Fe, promoted the secession of all provinces, leaving Buenos Aires alone in the conflict. Berón de Astrada, from Corrientes, opposed Rosas as well, and Juan Lavalle organized an army to take Buenos Aires. The ranchers mutinied in Chascomús and organized the &quot;Freemen of the South&quot; militia.

Rosas overcame all these threats. The Peru–Bolivian Confederation was defeated by Chile and ceased to exist. Cullen was defeated and shot, and Astrada was defeated by Justo José de Urquiza. The ranchers were defeated as well. The diplomat Manuel Moreno channeled the protests of the British merchants in Buenos Aires who were impacted by the blockade; this added to French doubts about maintaining a conflict that they had expected to be quite short. France finally lifted the blockade with the Mackau-Arana treaty. Lavalle lost French support but sought to continue the conflict anyway. He retreated before reaching Buenos Aires, without starting any battles, and escaped to the North. He was chased by Oribe, now in charge of Argentine armies, and died in unclear circumstances.

Despite the French defeat, Uruguay was still an open war theater. Manuel Oribe claimed to be the rightful president of Uruguay, and waged the Uruguayan Civil War against Rivera. Rosas supported Oribe in the conflict, as Uruguay was still at war with Argentina. Oribe laid siege to Montevideo. Britain and France joined forces with Rivera, captured the Argentine navy, and began a new naval blockade against Buenos Aires. Giuseppe Garibaldi helped to secure the Uruguay river, aided by Italian soldiers. A new expedition tried to secure the Paraná river by navigating to Paraguay and returning. The Argentine army resisted the invasion of the river at several points along the Paraná (most notably during the battle of Vuelta de Obligado), but could not stop them. The damage to the British and French ships, however, were so great that both countries eventually resigned and lifted the blockade.

==== Ranchers&#x27; demands and exile of Rosas ====
Justo José de Urquiza, governor of Entre Ríos, had supported Rosas so far, but the ranchers of his province had an expanding economy and wanted to have a local customs, able to engage in commerce with other countries directly. The port of Buenos Aires had that exclusive right. Entre Ríos also requested the federalization of the national income generated by exports, and the calling of a constituent assembly to write a constitution, as laid out in the Federal Pact. Urquiza made a &quot;pronunciamiento&quot;, resuming the rights of Entre Ríos to commerce and negotiations with other countries, instead of delegating such powers to Buenos Aires. Rosas declared war against him, but Urquiza defeated Rosas at the battle of Caseros, forcing him into exile.

===Secession and return of Buenos Aires===

Urquiza was not a unitarian, but another federalist like Rosas. Thus, the unitarians did not support him, but opposed him as they did Rosas. Urquiza&#x27;s ambition to reduce the national centralism of Buenos Aires and promote a higher federalization of the country generated conflicts with the unitarians. Urquiza called the San Nicolás Agreement, so that all provinces agreed to convene the 1853 Constituent Assembly. This was resisted in Buenos Aires, and the unitarians took advantage of a temporary absence of Urquiza from the city to stage the Revolution of 11 September and secede Buenos Aires from the confederation. It was now the State of Buenos Aires, and the other Argentine provinces were now the Argentine Confederation.

Manuel Guillermo Pinto was appointed governor of Buenos Aires, and removed the delegates from the constituent assembly. The capital of the Confederation was now located in Paraná, Entre Ríos. Buenos Aires attempted military actions against the Confederation, to prevent the work of the Assembly, but failed. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 was sanctioned on May 1, 1853, inviting Buenos Aires to return. Buenos Aires wrote its own constitution in 1854. Both countries, the Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires, accepted the status quo, with a serious danger of the secession becoming permanent.

The Confederation attacked Buenos Aires in 1856, led by Jerónimo Costa, who was defeated by Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre got 140 prisoners: he executed 125 of them.

In 1857, Mitre and other politicians in Buenos Aires considered making the secession a definitive one, renaming the state to the &quot;Republic of the Río de la Plata&quot;. The project was resisted by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who began his conflicts with Mitre. The project did not find popular support, and was forgotten.

The Confederation had a political commotion with the murder of Nazario Benavídez, from San Juan, carried out by supporters of Sarmiento. Urquiza defeated Mitre at the Battle of Cepeda, and laid siege to the city. Most federals thought that Urquiza should occupy Buenos Aires and impose the Constitution on the rebellious province. However, Urquiza just stayed outside, and sought the mediation of the Paraguayan Francisco Solano López. Buenos Aires would call a Constituent Assembly, to accept the National Constitution or requesting amendments, and rejoin the Confederation.

The Assembly requested several amendments, the most important of which was that Buenos Aires would not be the capital city of Argentina. This would allow the city to keep the exclusive use of the port. With Santiago Derqui as the new president of the Confederation, the amendments were accepted, and the new National constitution promulgated. However, the murder of governor José Antonio Virasoro generated new military conflicts between Buenos Aires and the Confederation. Mitre defeated Urquiza at the battle of Pavón in 1861, and Buenos Aires returned to the Confederation, which would then become the modern Republic of Argentina.

<text>Leicester Silk Buckingham (29 June 1825 – 15 July 1867) was an English dramatist, who achieved considerable popularity as a playwright, several of his free adaptations of French comedies being produced in London between 1860 and 1867.

==Early life==
Buckingham, the youngest son of James Silk Buckingham, the oriental traveller, and Elizabeth Jennings, was born at 11 Cornwall Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, 29 June 1825. In his early life he was the companion of his father in visits made to America, France, and the East, and the experience thus acquired rendered his services valuable as a lecturer on several occasions.

When the Royal Panopticon (afterwards the Alhambra in Leicester Square) was originated in 1854 as a scientific institution, Buckingham was selected to write and deliver the explanatory description of the views of various countries, and later at the Egyptian Hall he was the lecturer engaged to illustrate Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Tour of Europe.&quot;

Connecting himself in early life with the stage he produced several light pieces at the Strand Theatre when that establishment was under Mr. J. Payne&#x27;s direction in 1856–7, and for a short time undertook the responsibilities of management. Among the most successful comedies he afterwards wrote may be mentioned &quot;The Merry Widow,&quot; 1863; &quot;Silken Fetters,&quot; 1863; &quot;The Silver Lining,&quot; 1864; and &quot;Faces in the Fire,&quot; 1865.

==Dramatist and writer==
As a dramatist he borrowed from the French stage, and the majority of his pieces were founded on the works of Parisian writers. He was from 1857 to 1867 dramatic and musical critic of the &quot;Morning Star.&quot;

Buckingham commenced writing at the early age of nineteen, when he compiled for R. Bentley &quot;Memoir of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland,&quot; 1844. This was followed by &quot;Life and Times of Louis Philippe, by the Rev. G. N. Wright. Continued to the Revolution of 1848 by L. F. A. Buckingham,&quot; 1850. &quot;Belgium, the Rhine, Italy, Greece, and the Mediterranean, by the Rev. G. N. Wright and L. F. A. Buckingham,&quot; appeared in 1851, and in 1853 he published &quot;The Bible in the Middle Age, with Remarks on the Libraries, Schools, and Religious Aspects of Mediaeval Europe.&quot; He was also the author of upwards of thirty-five burlesques, comedies, and farces.

==Personal life==
On 5 April 1844, at the age of 18 he married at Gretna Green, under the name of L. S. F. Y. Buckingham, Caroline Sarah, fourth daughter of Captain Frederic White, of H.M.&#x27;s packet service Weymouth. This lady was afterwards a well-known and much respected actress, under the name of Mrs. Buckingham White. On 25 Nov 1854 Caroline divorced Leicester in the Court of Session, Scotland.

Meanwhile he had married Maria Louisa Rowswell (1829-1909) on 20 Jun 1848 at St James, Piccadilly, London.

Few persons have been known under a greater variety of Christian names than Buckingham was during his comparatively short life, the following being the names used by him on various occasions: Leicester, Leicester Ambrose, Leicester Silk, Leicester Forbes Ambrose, Leicester Stanhope, Leicester Stanhope Forbes, Leicester Stanhope Forbes Young, and Leicester Stanhope Forbes Young Ambrose. He also made use of the pseudonym Matthews &amp; Co. when producing his first drama, called &quot;Aggravating Sam,&quot; in 1854.

He died at Margate 15 July 1867, a convert to the Roman Catholic faith. His copyrights passed to Thomas Hailes Lacy, theatrical publisher, who in September 1873 bequeathed them to the Royal General Theatrical Fund.

<text>The Polyporales are an order of about 1,800 species of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. The order includes some (but not all) polypores as well as many corticioid fungi and a few agarics (mainly in the genus &quot;Lentinus&quot;). Many species within the order are saprotrophic, most of them wood-rotters. Some genera, such as &quot;Ganoderma&quot; and &quot;Fomes&quot;, contain species that attack living tissues and then continue to degrade the wood of their dead hosts. Those of economic importance include several important pathogens of trees and a few species that cause damage by rotting structural timber. Some of the Polyporales are commercially cultivated and marketed for use as food items or in traditional Chinese medicine.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
The order was originally proposed in 1926 by Swiss mycologist Ernst Albert Gäumann to accommodate species within the phylum Basidiomycota producing basidiocarps (fruit bodies) showing a gymnocapous mode of development (forming the spore-bearing surface externally). As such, the order included the ten families Brachybasidiaceae, Corticiaceae, Clavariaceae, Cyphellaceae, Dictyolaceae, Fistulinaceae, Polyporaceae, Radulaceae, Tulasnellaceae, and Vuilleminiaceae, representing a mix of poroid, corticioid, cyphelloid, and clavarioid fungi.

In a series of publications in 1932, E. J. H. Corner explained the occurrence of different types of hyphae in the fruit bodies of polypore fungi. He introduced the concept of hyphal analysis, which later become a fundamental character in polypore taxonomy.

The order Polyporales was not widely adopted by Gäumann&#x27;s contemporaries; most mycologists and reference works preferring to use the catch-all, artificial order Aphyllophorales for polypores and other &quot;non-gilled fungi&quot;. When an attempt was made to introduce a more natural, morphology-based classification of the fungi in the 1980s and 1990s, the order was still overlooked. A standard 1995 reference work placed most polypores and corticioid fungi in the Ganodermatales, Poriales, and Stereales.

===Current status===

Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has resurrected and redefined the Polyporales (also known as the polyporoid clade). Studies using a combination of rRNA gene sequences, single-copy protein-coding genes,
 and genome-based phylogenetic analyses have shown that the Polyporales are a monophyletic group. They are a member of the class Agaricomycetes, but have not been assigned to a subclass. Though the precise boundaries of the order and its constituent families are yet to be resolved, it retains the core group of polypores in the family Polyporaceae, with additional species in the Fomitopsidaceae and Meripilaceae. It also includes polypores in the Ganodermataceae, which were previously assigned to their own separate order, the Ganodermatales, based on their distinctive basidiospore morphology. Corticioid fungi belonging to the Cystostereaceae, Meruliaceae, Phanerochaetaceae, and Xenasmataceae are also included, as are the cauliflower fungi in the Sparassidaceae.

In an extensive molecular analysis, Manfred Binder and colleagues analyzed 6 genes from 373 species and confirmed the existence of four previously recognized lineages of Polyporales: the antrodia, core polyporoid, phlebioid, and residual polyporoid clades. Extending this work, Alfredo Justo and colleagues proposed a phylogenetic overview of the Polyporales that included a new family-level classification. They assigned family names to 18 clades and four informal unranked clades. The families are listed below, followed by their taxonomic authorities and year of publication:
*Phanerochaetaceae Jülich (1981)
*Irpicaceae Spirin &amp; Zmitr. (2003)
*Meruliaceae Rea (1922)
*Steccherinaceae Parmasto (1968)
*Cerrenaceae Miettinen, Justo &amp; Hibbett (2017)
*Panaceae Miettinen, Justo &amp; Hibbett (2017)
*Hyphodermataceae Jülich (1981)
*Meripilaceae Jülich (1981)
*Podoscyphaceae D.A.Reid (1965)
*Polyporaceae Corda (1939)
*Fomitopsidaceae Jülich (1981)
*Laetiporaceae Jülich (1981)
*Dacryobolaceae Jülich (1981)
*Sparassidaceae Jülich (1981)
*Grifolaceae Jülich (1981)
*Gelatoporiaceae Miettinen, Justo &amp; Hibbett (2017)
*Incrustoporiaceae Jülich (1981)
*Ischnodermataceae Jülich (1981)

Other families that putatively belong to the Polyporales, but for which molecular confirmation is absent or lacking, include Diachanthodaceae Jülich, (1981); Fragiliporiaceae Y.C.Dai, B.K.Cui &amp; C.L.Zhao (2015); Hymenogrammaceae Jülich (1981); and Phaeotrametaceae Popoff ex Piątek (2005). The Nigrofomitaceae, formerly placed in the Polyporales, was shown to be nested as a distinct lineage within the Hymenochaetales.

The family Steccherinaceae was redefined in 2012 to contain most species of the poroid and hydnoid genera &quot;Antrodiella&quot;, &quot;Junghuhnia&quot;, and &quot;Steccherinum&quot;, as well as members of 12 other hydnoid and poroid genera that had been traditionally classified in the families Phanerochaetaceae, Polyporaceae, and Meruliaceae. Several new genera were added to the Steccherinaceae in 2016–17.

==Ecology==
The order is cosmopolitan and contains around 1800 species of fungi worldwide—about 1.5% of all known fungus species. All species in the Polyporales are saprotrophs, most of them wood-rotters. Their fruit bodies are therefore typically found on living or moribund trees or on dead attached or fallen wood. Polyporales species that fruit on the ground are either root rot species–such as &quot;Laetiporus cincinnatus&quot; and &quot;Grifola frondosa&quot;, or are fruiting from buried pieces of substrate–such as &quot;Polyporus radicatus&quot; and &quot;P. melanopus&quot;.

Wood-decay Polyporales reduce the volume of dead wood in the forest and are an important component of the carbon cycle. Wood is composed of primarily three types of tissue: lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses. White rot species of Polyporales are efficient degraders of the decay-resistant polymer lignin, leaving partially degraded cellulose as a residue. Brown rot species break down the cellulose fibres, leaving a brittle, brown lignin residue. Brown-rot residues such as humus can remain in the soil for hundreds of years, increasing aeration and water-holding capacity.

Peroxidase enzymes that degrade lignin, such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, or versatile peroxidase, are present in all white-rot members of the Polyporales, but absent in brown-rot species. Oxidase enzymes, including members of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family, play a key role in the breakdown of plant polymers because they generate hydrogen peroxide, which acts as the ultimate oxidizer in both white-rot and brown-rot decay.

Two species of Polyporales, &quot;Daedalea quercina&quot; and &quot;Fomitopsis pinicola&quot;, use paralysing toxins to destroy and colonize nematodes that feed on their fruit bodies.

==Importance==
Many wood-decay fungi in the genera &quot;Fomes&quot;, &quot;Fomitopsis&quot; and &quot;Ganoderma&quot; are pathogenic, causing butt and root rot of living trees and consequent losses in forestry plantations. Several species, such as the mine fungus &quot;Fibroporia vaillantii&quot;, can rot and damage structural timber.

Several of the Polyporales, notably &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot; (ling-zhi), &quot;Grifola frondosa&quot; (maitake), &quot;Taiwanofungus camphoratus&quot; (niú zhāng zhī), &quot;Lignosus rhinocerotis&quot;, and &quot;Trametes versicolor&quot; (yun-zhi), are commercially cultivated and marketed for use in traditional Chinese medicine. The polypores &quot;Laetiporus sulphureus&quot;, &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;, &quot;Fomitopsis pinicola&quot;, &quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot;, and &quot;Laricifomes officinalis&quot; have been widely used in central European folk medicine for the treatment of various diseases.

Some species, including several members of the genera &quot;Laetiporus&quot; and &quot;Sparassis&quot;, are used as food. Blackfellow&#x27;s bread, or &quot;Laccocephalum mylittae&quot;, is an edible that is prized by Aboriginal Australians. &quot;Lentinus squarrosulus&quot; is collected and eaten in Asian and African communities.

&quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot; was formerly used in the manufacture of charcoal crayons. Amadou, a spongy material derived from the fruit bodies of &quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;, has been used since ancient times as a tinder. More recently, it has been used by dentists as a styptic, or as a felt-like material for making hats and other items. The anise-scented fruit bodies of &quot;Haploporus odorus&quot; were used by some tribes of Plains Indians as a component of sacred objects. &quot;Laricifomes officinalis&quot; was used by nineteenth century Pacific northwest shamans for carving spirit figures. Some species, including dyer&#x27;s polypore (&quot;Phaeolus schweinitzii&quot;) and purple dye polypore (&quot;Hapalopilus nidulans&quot;) are used in mushroom dyeing.

==Sequenced genomes==
Several member of the Polyporales have had their genomes sequenced to help understand the genetic basis for the production of enzymes involved in the synthesis of bioactive compounds, or to elucidate the metabolic pathways of wood decay, including &quot;Ganoderma lucidum&quot;, &quot;Lignosus rhinocerotis&quot;, &quot;Dichomitus squalens&quot;, &quot;Fomitopsis pinicola&quot;, &quot;Trametes versicolor&quot;, and &quot;Wolfiporia cocos&quot;. Two sequenced fungi, &quot;Phanerochaete chrysosporium&quot;, and &quot;Postia placenta&quot;, serve as model species for researchers investigating the mechanism of white rot and brown rot, respectively. , there have been 46 Polyporales genomes sequenced, representing about 7% of all sequenced fungal genomes.

==Fossil record==
Fossilized fruit bodies of a &quot;Fomes&quot; species dating back to the Tertiary (66–2.6 Ma) were reported in Idaho in 1940. A fossil fruit body of &quot;Ganodermites libycus&quot; was reported from the Early Miocene (23–2.6 Ma) in the Libyan Desert. This specimen is the earliest convincing fossil evidence for the Polyporales.

Molecular clock techniques have been used to estimate the age of the Polyporales, suggesting that the order evolved either during the late Jurassic, about 203–250 Ma, or, in more recent study, about 114 Ma.

==Genera &quot;Incertae sedis&quot;==
There are several genera classified in the Polyporales that for various reason have not been assigned to a specific family. They are &quot;incertae sedis&quot; with respect to familial placement. Some may be poorly known and/or not included in DNA phylogenetic studies, or when they have been, did not clearly group with any named family (In some cases a new family must be created rather than the placement clarified.). These include:
*&quot;Aegis&quot; Gómez-Montoya, Rajchenb. &amp; Robledo (2017)
*&quot;Anthoporia&quot; Karasiński &amp; Niemelä (2016)
*&quot;Bourdotiella&quot; Duhem &amp; Schultheis (2011)

<text>Eugen Waldemar Schauman (; – ) was a Finnish nationalist activist and member of the noble Schauman family. In 1904, Schauman assassinated Nikolai Bobrikov, the Governor-General of Finland.

== Early life and family==
Eugen Schauman was born in Kharkov, Russia (now Kharkiv, Ukraine) to Swedish-speaking Finnish parents. His mother was Elin Maria Schauman, and his father was Fredrik Waldemar Schauman, a general-lieutenant in the Imperial Russian army, who also served as a privy councillor and senator in the Finnish government. His brother Rafael was born in 1873, and his sister Sigrid in 1877. The family moved often due to Waldemar&#x27;s work with the government.

As a young child, he was inspired by his mother&#x27;s reading of &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot; by Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Runeberg&#x27;s tales became an important connection to Schauman&#x27;s distant homeland, which he longed to see. At the age of eight, Schauman heard that there was a collection going on in Nykarleby, Finland to erect a memorial to the victory over the Russians that had occurred in the 1808 Battle of Jutas in the Finnish War. Inspired by Runeberg&#x27;s tales, Schauman wanted to contribute to the plan, and sent a letter from Radom, Poland to Finland that contained a single ruble and read: &quot;Please accept this small contribution to the memorial of Jutas. Eugen Schauman, Radom 24 May 1883&quot; Schauman&#x27;s mother died the following year, in autumn 1884, when he was nine years old. 

Schauman attended secondary school in Helsinki, Finland while the rest of the family was living in Poland. He had poor hearing, however, and this had an effect on his studies. Nonetheless, Schauman matriculated at the Nya Svenska Läroverket in 1895; graduated from the University of Helsinki with an upper degree in government studies in 1899; and began his career as a clerk in the senate in 1901. He was a temporary employee working as an assistant to the school governing board. The job became permanent in 1903. In addition to his job at the senate, Schauman arranged for a series of marksmanship courses aimed at local students in Helsinki. These courses later became a part of the White Guards training.

== Political activism ==

=== Language manifesto ===
Schauman observed and experienced the formalization of the controversial policy of Russification firsthand with the February 1899 decree of the February Manifesto. His father, Waldemar Schauman, resigned as senator in the summer 1900 as a protest against the manifesto, that had made the Russian language a compulsory subject in all Finnish schools. At first Schauman acted against the oppression like the other students: joining protests at the Runeberg statue; spreading leaflets calling for the will to battle and hatred towards the Russians; and gathering names for the Great Petition in Uusimaa.

=== Shooting practice ===
Gradually Schauman, like other students and activists, started to move from passive resistance to active resistance. He organised shipments of weapons from abroad by shipping American rifles to Finland with the help of the Finnish Hunting Association, which were then distributed to students. In addition to this, he organised shooting clubs around the Helsinki area that taught marksmanship to students and other youths. Soon Schauman and other activists started planning an armed revolution. As well as his father&#x27;s loss of his job, Schauman was angered by the dismissal of his uncle, Colonel Theodor Schauman, from the command of the Finnish Dragoon Regiment, a unit from Lappeenranta, in December 1901, after Nikolai Bobrikov had not been satisfied with his inspection of it.

=== Draft riot ===
Schauman became personally involved with Russian authorities during the riots in Helsinki connected to the draft strikes on 18 April 1902. Thousands of Finns participated in demonstrations at Senate Square angered by the draft conducted at the Russian Guard barracks. The governor of the Uusimaa Province, Mikhail Kaigorodov, had sent the Cossacks to end the demonstrations. Schauman was returning from work to his home on Koulukatu, but went to see what was happening on the square. A group of a few Cossacks intercepted him on Hallituskatu, pushed him against a wall, and started to whip him on the head. When one of the Cossacks went for his sabre, Schauman took his knife and stabbed at his chest. The blade of the knife twisted when it hit a metal part of the Cossack&#x27;s uniform. The Cossack was, however, thrown off his horse and Schauman escaped to the stairway of the chemistry building of the university. According to a witness, he was &quot;...shaking with anger...&quot;.

=== Kagal ===
After the Cossack riots, Bobrikov became convinced that Finland was undergoing a &quot;kramola&quot; (or &quot;secret rebellion&quot;). The Tsar awarded Bobrikov dictatorial powers in 1902. As the Russian oppression worsened, the underground passive-resistance organisation, Kagal, decided that it was time to move to stronger acts of defiance, as passive-resistance methods were no longer effective. For example, in 1902 over half of the age class had skipped the draft to the Russian army, which had been made mandatory for Finns. In 1903 the draft strike was no longer as effective, and only 22 percent skipped the draft. &quot;Emergency measures&quot;, meaning assassination, was accepted as a new way to act against the strengthening Russification. Many leading Kagal members had already been exiled at this point. At first, the plan was to strike against Finnish politicians agreeing with the Russification, but soon the activists, the Kagal organization, and Schauman decided it was best to strike against the Governor-General Nikolai Bobrikov, who was seen as the leader and main activist of the oppression politics.

== Assassination ==

The possible assassination of Bobrikov was a topical question among the Finnish activists of the time. Other activist groups are known to have made assassination plans, but Schauman convinced them to give him two weeks before they would intervene. When Bobrikov came to the Senate house on 16 June, Schauman shot him three times—and then himself twice in the chest—using an FN Browning M1900 pistol. Schauman died instantly. Two of the bullets that hit Bobrikov ricocheted off his military decorations, but the third bounced back from his buckle and caused severe damage to his stomach. Bobrikov did not die immediately but was taken to the Helsinki Surgical Hospital. Surgeon worked to save his life, but Bobrikov died the following day at 1:10 a.m.
=== Aftermath ===
Schauman&#x27;s body was taken to an unmarked grave in the Malmi cemetery in Helsinki. After the political situation eased up he was reburied in the Schauman family grave in the and a monument was built on the grave.

=== Schauman&#x27;s legacy ===
Schauman left a letter in which he stated that he justified his actions as a punishment for Bobrikov&#x27;s crimes against the people of Finland. He addressed the letter to the Tsar and wanted him to pay attention to the problems in the whole of the Russian empire, especially in Poland and the Baltic Sea region. He claimed he had acted alone and emphasized that his family was not involved in the assassination.

Schauman became something of an icon for the resistance to Imperial Russia, and many Finns still consider him a hero. His fame can be characterized by his ranking as the 34th greatest Finn of all time in the 2004 &quot;Suuret suomalaiset&quot; (Greatest Finns) television poll. At the location of the assassination in the hallway of the Council of State, there is a memorial plaque that states &quot;Se Pro Patria Dedit&quot; (&quot;He Gave Himself for His Country&quot;). Jean Sibelius composed the funeral march &quot;In Memoriam&quot; in memory of him.

==Historical perspective==
The importance of Schauman in history divides opinions. In the summer of 2004, a hundred years after Bobrikov&#x27;s murder, Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen condemned the act, calling Schauman a terrorist. According to him, events like the assassination of Bobrikov are not appropriate to celebrate in the era of the war on terror. A discussion arose from the statement, in which Unto Vesa, amanuensis of the Peace and Conflict Research Institute, agreed with Vanhanen.

<text>Vestey Holdings, formerly Vestey Group and previously also known as Vestey Brothers, is a privately owned United Kingdom group of companies comprising an international business focused mainly on food products and services. The company has owned vast holdings overseas, mainly in South America and Australia, and continues to own some.

The Vestey family were estimated to be the second wealthiest family in Britain (after the King) in 1940. Vestey Brothers was the largest privately owned multinational company and the largest retailer of meat in the world in the 1980s. In 1980, it was discovered that the company had operated a tax avoidance scheme,

Union International, formerly the core of the Vestey family business as the Union Cold Storage Company, entered receivership in 1995. The company has been restructured several times.

==Current holdings and governance==
 Vestey Holdings owns Vestey Foods, Albion Fine Foods &amp; FineFrance UK, Cottage Delight, Donald Russell (butchers) and Western Pension Solutions.

Vestey Foods (incorporated 16 November 1994) owns Vestey Foods UK, Vestey Foods Benelux, Vestey Foods France, Vestey Foods International, Vestey Foods Baltics, and Vestey Foods Middle East. The company&#x27;s main business is in sourcing, processing and distribution of products made from meat, fish, seafood, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, and convenience foods. It trades in 70 countries, with customers in the retail, food service, wholesale, government and manufacturing sectors.

The 3rd Baron Vestey (19 March 1941 – 4 February 2021), great-grandson of co-founder William Vestey (later Lord Vestey), was Chairman of the Vestey Group from 1995 until his death in 2021.

George Vestey has been CEO of Vestey Holdings since 2010, and his brother Robin Non-Executive Chairman since 2013 (after becoming a main board director after their father Edmund’s retirement in 2004).

The family was still immensely wealthy in 2015; 160th on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2015, with an estimated fortune of £700 million. Actor Tom Hiddleston is the great-great-grandson of co-founder Sir Edmund Vestey, 1st Baronet.

, the Vestey family&#x27;s farming interests are mainly in Brazil, in both the cattle industry and sugar cane production. A tree-planting programme is set to supply eucalyptus wood to the iron ore industry in Brazil. The family also has two wine companies in Australia: The Lane Vineyard in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia, and Delatite Wines in Victoria, Australia.

==History==
William and his younger brother Edmund (later Sir Edmund) established the Vestey empire in 1897 from a family butchery business in Liverpool. They were pioneers of refrigeration, opening a cold store in London in 1895 and developing stores across the UK, and then throughout Russia, the Baltic nations, and Western Europe. The company supplied large quantities of food to the growing UK population during the Industrial Revolution.

William Vestey earlier worked in stockyards in Chicago in the late 19th century, and realised that the meat waste could be used in products which were then in short supply in Britain. He and Edmund started a canning business, before foreseeing that the meat could be worth even more if the vast supplies of beef in the Americas could be transported and delivered fresh rather than canned, so they first experimented with a friend&#x27;s cold store. The invention of the first ammonia-compression plant enabled refrigerated shipments, and their business grew.

===International expansion===
The first expansion was into China, in the early 20th century, where the company developed a huge egg processing enterprise. Creating their own shipping company, the Blue Star Line, they supplied outlets in the UK, USA, Europe and South Africa for over fifty years.

In 1911, the Vestey brothers expanded into meat production, processing and distribution, with pastoral properties as well as meatworks in Venezuela, Australia and Brazil, and meatworks in New Zealand and Argentina. In the UK, they bought market stalls on the Smithfield Market in London, and butcher shops throughout the UK, the Dewhurst the Butchers chain.

In 1912 they purchased for £250,000 the Ord River cattle station in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia from investor Sam Copley.
In 1914, they established the North Australia Meat Company in Darwin, Northern Territory in Australia, but it failed after three years. In the same year, it bought the Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory of Australia.

In 1915, the brothers, after being refused a request for income tax exemption made to David Lloyd George, moved to Buenos Aires to avoid paying income tax in the UK. The family later administered the business through a Paris trust that enabled it to legally avoid an estimated total of £88m in UK tax until the loophole was closed in 1991.

In 1924, Vesteys bought the Liebig Extract of Meat Company in Uruguay, created Frigorífico Anglo del Uruguay out of it, which marketed Fray Bentos meat extract spread. also known as the &quot;Anglo Meatpacking Company&quot;.

It is said that by 1930 Vesteys had 30,000 employees worldwide and a net value of £300,000.

The Vestey family were estimated to be the second wealthiest family in Britain (after the King) in 1940. In 1980, it was discovered that the company had operated a tax avoidance scheme, and Vestey Brothers was the largest privately owned multinational company and the largest retailer of meat in the world in the 1980s.

===UK developments===
In the course of their expansion, Vestey bought a number of other companies, acquiring Oxo and London&#x27;s Oxo Tower through the purchase of the Liebig Extract of Meat Company.

In the middle of the 20th century, Vestey companies dominated the UK wholesale and retail meat trade, selling refrigerated and canned meats, as well as leather and other by-products. Having saved cash reserves for the purpose, they entered into a price war with the US-owned importers to largely drive them from the UK market. Vestey developed the country-wide Dewhurst the Butchers chain, which was eventually sold in 1995 in the face of increasing competition from the supermarket chains. Dewhurst was among the first retailers to introduce glass windows in its butcher&#x27;s shops – previously meat had been exposed to the elements and pollution. The business also owned the Downsway supermarket group, which was based in East Anglia and had 80 stores at the time of its sale to rival Fine Fare in 1978.

===1966 Gurindji Strike, Australia===

By the middle of the twentieth century, the Vestey Group had acquired a large amount of grazing land in Australia, and used many Aboriginal Australians as cheap labour. They were paid less than a quarter of the minimum wage of non-Indigenous workers and sometimes only received salt beef, bread, tobacco, flour, sugar and tea instead of a salary. Samuel Vestey, 3rd Baron Vestey, through the company, owned the Wave Hill Station in Australia at the time.

In 1966, this unfair treatment, coupled with earlier dispossession of their land by the colonial government, sparked the Gurindji strike (also known as the Wave Hill walk-off) at Wave Hill. This was a landmark event in the land rights movement in Australia and lasted for eight years. With much public support, the Whitlam government entered negotiations with Vestey and a small grant of land at Daguragu/Wattie Creek was handed back to the Gurindji people, as an initial step towards the final land handback.

==Shipping==
The first two ships for the Blue Star Line (&quot;Pakeha&quot; renamed &quot;Broderick&quot;, and &quot;Rangatira&quot; renamed &quot;Brodmore&quot;) were bought in 1909, and the company registered on 28 July 1911 in London and Liverpool with a capital of £100,000.

In 1946 the Vesteys also became founders of Repremar Shipping, a Uruguay-based ship agency which was then taken over a few decades later by the Pena family, who to this day remain in control of the Repremar Group of Companies.

The line owned a number of refrigerated ships (Reefers), and business later expanded to countries as far apart as Egypt and China, carrying passengers in addition to various foodstuffs. Blue Star was finally sold to P&amp;O Nedlloyd for £60 million in 1998, although most of the refrigerated ships were retained by Vestey&#x27;s Albion Reefers subsidiary, which later merged with Hamburg Süd to form Star Reefers, finally sold off in July 2001.

The company had to be rebuilt twice, in the years following the world wars, before being sold in 1998.

==21st century==
By 2000, the vertically integrated model was broken up, and separate companies created to run farming, cold storage, and food import and distribution businesses.

===2005 Venezuela handback===
In Venezuela in 2005, state troops occupied a cattle ranch owned by the Vestey Group, under a 2001 land use reform programme instituted by the Hugo Chávez government. In March 2006, the Group reached an agreement with the Venezuelan government, ceding two ranches to the state while retaining ownership of eight.

==Philanthropy==
There was a &quot;Vestey Chair of Food Safety and Veterinary Public Health&quot; at the Royal Veterinary College, University of London recorded in 1992, and 2000, &quot;the first post of its kind in the UK&quot;.

==Former subsidiaries==
* The Blue Star Line was sold to P&amp;O Nedlloyd for £60 million in 1998.
* Dewhurst butchers – sold to Lloyd Maunder 2005, entered administration in 2006.

<doc id="282603" wikidata="Q313752" url="?curid=282603" title="Prince Michael of Kent">
<text>Prince Michael of Kent (Michael George Charles Franklin; born 4 July 1942) is a member of the British royal family who is 53rd in line to the British throne as of 2025. The younger son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, he is a grandson of George V, nephew of Edward VIII and George VI, and first cousin of Elizabeth II. Michael&#x27;s mother was also a first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Elizabeth II, making him both a second cousin and first cousin once removed to Charles III.

Prince Michael occasionally represented Elizabeth II at some functions in Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom during her reign. Otherwise, he manages his own consultancy business and undertakes various commercial work around the world. He has also presented some television documentaries on the royal families of Europe.

==Early life==
Prince Michael was born on 4 July 1942, at Coppins, Iver, Buckinghamshire. He was the third child of Prince George, Duke of Kent, who was the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary and a younger brother of kings Edward VIII and George VI. At birth, Michael was seventh in line to the British throne. His mother was Princess Marina, a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.

At Michael&#x27;s baptism on 4 August 1942 in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle, his godparents were his paternal uncle the King; Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands (for whom her son-in-law Prince Bernhard stood proxy); King Haakon VII of Norway (his great-uncle); US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (for whom the Duke of Kent stood proxy); Frederica of Hanover, Hereditary Princess of Greece (his first cousin once removed, who was absent); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (his paternal uncle, who was absent); the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven (his paternal first cousin twice removed); and Lady Patricia Ramsay (his paternal first cousin twice removed). Because of the war, newspaper reports did not identify the location of the baptism and said instead that it took place at &quot;a private chapel in the country&quot;.

Seven weeks after Michael&#x27;s birth, his father was killed in a plane crash near Dunbeath, Caithness, Scotland, on 25 August 1942.

At the age of five, Prince Michael was a page boy at the wedding of his cousins Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten.

==Education and military service==
Michael was educated at Sunningdale School and Eton College and is fluent in French as well as having a &quot;working knowledge&quot; of German and Italian. He is the first member of the royal family to learn Russian, of which he is a qualified interpreter.

Michael was commissioned into the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert&#x27;s Own) in 1963. He later served in The Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own) after the amalgamation between the 11th Hussars and the 10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own) in 1969. He saw service in Germany, Hong Kong, and Cyprus, where his squadron formed part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in 1971. Subsequent tours of duty, during a military career that spanned twenty years, included a number of appointments on the Defence Intelligence Staff. He retired from the Army with the rank of Major in 1981.

In 1994, Michael was made Honorary Commodore (later Honorary Rear Admiral and then Vice Admiral) of the Royal Naval Reserve, and in 2002, he was made Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Benson (promoted to Honorary Air Marshal in 2012). From 2009 to 2012, he was Regimental Colonel of the Honourable Artillery Company and on 31 January 2012 became its Royal Honorary Colonel. He is also Colonel-in-Chief of the Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment in Canada.

==Activities and patronages==
As the third child of George V&#x27;s fourth son, it was not expected that Prince Michael, as the only second son in the extended royal family, would undertake many engagements on behalf of the royal family. He has performed official duties in the Commonwealth realms other than the United Kingdom and has represented the Queen abroad.

He has, however, never received a parliamentary annuity or an allowance from the British Privy Purse, unlike both his elder brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and his sister, Princess Alexandra, who both carry out official royal duties. The Prince was given the use of a grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace upon his marriage in 1978.

Michael represented the Queen at state funerals in India, Cyprus and Swaziland and, with his wife, Princess Michael of Kent, represented the Queen at the independence celebrations in Belize, and at the coronation of King Mswati III of Swaziland.

Michael supports a large number of charities and organisations. Some of his patronages and presidencies include: the Kennel Club, Children&#x27;s Burns Trust, Maritime Volunteer Service, the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, Life Saving Society, Royal Automobile Club, National Eye Research Centre, Motor Sports Association, Brooklands Museum Trust, the Light Aircraft Association, and the London School of Business and Finance.

He announced his retirement from public life in June 2022 as he approached his 80th birthday.

==Marriage and personal life==

On 30 June 1978, Michael married, at a civil ceremony, at the City Hall (&quot;Wiener Rathaus&quot;) in Vienna, Austria, the German noblewoman Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz. After receiving Pope John Paul II&#x27;s permission (a previous pontiff, Pope Paul VI, had barred them from having a Catholic wedding), the couple later received a blessing of their marriage in a Catholic ceremony on 29 June 1983 at Archbishop&#x27;s House, London.

At the time of the marriage, Marie-Christine von Reibnitz was both a Roman Catholic and a divorcée. She had been married to the banker Thomas Troubridge (1939–2015); they separated in 1973, divorced in 1977, and had their marriage annulled by the Catholic Church a year later, two months before her marriage to Michael. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, Michael forfeited his place in the line of succession to the throne through his marriage to a Catholic. He was reinstated to the line of succession on 26 March 2015 with the coming into force of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, and was 51st in line to the throne .

Michael and Marie-Christine have two children, both brought up as members of the Church of England and therefore in the line of succession to the throne since birth:
* Lord Frederick Windsor, born 6 April 1979 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London; married, 12 September 2009, Sophie Winkleman. Educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. They have two daughters, Maud and Isabella.
* Lady Gabriella Kingston, born 23 April 1981 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London; married, 18 May 2019, Thomas Kingston. Educated at Downe House, Brown University in the US, and Linacre College, Oxford. Her husband shot himself on 25 February 2024 in the Cotswolds, Gloucestershire, leaving her widowed at 42 years old.

In 2014, Michael was successfully treated for prostate cancer.

Prince Michael manages his own consultancy business, and undertakes business throughout the world. He is also a qualified interpreter of Russian.

===Masonic===
Prince Michael is an active Freemason. He is the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons, and Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Middlesex.

===Russia===

Prince Michael speaks fluent Russian and has a strong interest in Russia, where he is a well-known figure (he is a former recipient of the Order of Friendship). Tsar Nicholas II was a first cousin of three of his grandparents: George V, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. When the bodies of the Tsar and some of his family were recovered in 1991, the remains were later identified by DNA using, among others, a sample from Michael for recognition. He attended the 1998 burial of the Tsar and his family in St Petersburg. He is an honorary member of the Romanov Family Association. He is also the second cousin of Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, who is a claimant to the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia. They share the same great-grandfather, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich. Michael is the patron of organisations which have close ties with Russia, including the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce and the St Gregory&#x27;s Foundation. In his capacity as patron of Children&#x27;s Fire and Burns Trust, Prince Michael has led fundraising rallies in 1999 and 2003 in Russia to raise money for the charity. He also led another rally in 2005 and raised money for the Royal Marsden Hospital and Britain&#x27;s Charities Aid Foundation Russia.

On 4 March 2022, Michael returned the Order of Friendship in the aftermath of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Finland ===
Prince Michael of Kent made a visit to Finland in 2017, during which he visited Helsinki, Espoo, Porvoo, Pori, and Tampere. The visit concluded with a gala dinner at the House of Nobility in Helsinki. The purpose of the multi-day visit was to enhance trade and investment relations between Britain and Finland.

In 2022, HRH Prince Michael of Kent visited Finland again, this time focusing on Tampere, Lempäälä, and Helsinki during the British Week. As part of his visit, he participated in various events, including a gala dinner at Svenska Klubben in Helsinki. One of the highlights of his trip was attending the British Week Platinum Jubilee 2022 Banquet in Helsinki. Additionally, Prince Michael and the British delegation visited several locations in Tampere, such as the Naistenlahti Powerplant, Nokia Arena, and the Kokkovuori Shooting Center in Lempäälä. During his visit, Prince Michael of Kent visited the Mannerheim Museum, which is the former home of Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in Helsinki.

===Sport===
Prince Michael was a part of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst rowing crew that won the Maiden Fours at Bedford in 1961. Prince Michael competed for Great Britain in the 1971 FIBT World Bobsleigh Championships but crashed and failed to finish the event. He was official non-travelling reserve for the 1972 Winter Olympics. He took part in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally in an Austin Maxi, but he and his crew failed to finish the event.

==Media scrutiny==
In 2002, both Michael and his wife were the subject of criticism over the rent paid on their accommodation at Kensington Palace following scrutiny by the House of Commons Public Accounts committee on the cost of royal palaces and whether they were value for money. The committee had called on the Queen to evict its residents and put the apartments on a more commercial footing. When it was claimed that the couple paid a rent of only £69 per week for the use of their apartments at Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace announced that &quot;The Queen is paying the rent for Prince and Princess Michael of Kent&#x27;s apartment at a commercial rate of £120,000 annually, from her own private funds. This rent payment by The Queen is in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding.&quot;

Prince Michael has been scrutinized for financial assistance given to him by exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky through offshore companies, with a reported total of £320,000 in payments over the period 2002–2008. In an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Berezovsky stated, &quot;There is nothing underhand or improper about the financial assistance I have given Prince Michael. It is a matter between friends.&quot;

In May 2021, reports were published stating that Michael was &quot;selling access&quot; to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s political representatives. Footage from a Zoom call was released of Michael, alongside Simon Isaacs, 4th Marquess of Reading, interacting with undercover reporters posing as business executives seeking to make contacts with the Kremlin. In the video, he assured the men that his close ties with the country would be of benefit, and that he could introduce them to high-ranking figures within the Russian government in exchange for money. The call took place the day after the European Union imposed sanctions on the Kremlin. Michael was being offered £143,000 for a proposal and £36,000 a month by the faux businessmen, which he expressed satisfaction with. The Marquess claimed that Michael was the Queen&#x27;s &quot;unofficial ambassador to Russia&quot; and had direct access to Putin. He later stated that he had &quot;overpromised&quot;, while the prince said that he had not had contact with Putin since 2003. In a 2019 interview, Michael stated that he visited Russia twice a year as part of his work for the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce.

Marina Litvinenko denounced the prince&#x27;s actions, saying that it demonstrated that he did not &quot;care about human rights, democracy, about the people who are dying in Russia or what he did to your own citizens on UK soil&quot;. Conservative MP Bob Seely released a statement saying, in part: &quot;We have sanctions against President Putin&#x27;s regime for good reason. I&#x27;d love to know what Prince Michael thinks he is doing by making the UK&#x27;s values and standards look optional.&quot;

<doc id="282617" wikidata="Q186950" url="?curid=282617" title="Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest">
<text>The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest (BLFC) was a tongue-in-cheek contest, held annually and sponsored by the English Department of San José State University in San Jose, California until 2025. Entrants were invited &quot;to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels&quot; – that is, one which was deliberately bad.

According to the official rules, the prize for winning the contest was &quot;a pittance&quot;. The 2008 winner received $250, while the 2014 winners&#x27; page said the grand prize winner received &quot;about $150&quot;. In 2023, the prize was &quot;a cheap certificate and bragging rights&quot;.

The contest was started in 1982 by Professor Scott E. Rice of the English Department at San Jose State University and was named for English novelist and playwright Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, author of the much-quoted first line &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot;. This opening, from the 1830 novel &quot;Paul Clifford&quot;, reads in full:

The first year of the competition attracted just three entries, but it went public the next year, received media attention, and attracted 10,000 entries. The contest eventually expanded into several subcategories, such as detective fiction, romance novels, Western novels, and purple prose. Sentences that were notable but not quite bad enough to merit the Grand Prize or a category prize were awarded Dishonorable Mentions.

==Winning entrants==

The winning entries are available at the contest website.

==Collections==
Six books collecting the best BLFC entries have been published:
* &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot; (1984), 
* &quot;Son of &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot;&quot; (1986), 
* &quot;Bride of Dark and Stormy&quot; (1988), 
* &quot;It Was a Dark &amp; Stormy Night: The Final Conflict&quot; (1992), 
* &quot;Dark and Stormy Rides Again&quot; (1996), 
* &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot; (2007), 

An audio cassette of the winning entries in the BLFC was also released:
* &quot;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&quot; (1997), audio cassette, .

<doc id="282620" wikidata="Q1017702" url="?curid=282620" title="Pond Inlet">
<text>Pond Inlet () is a small, predominantly Inuit community in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada, located on northern Baffin Island. To the Inuit the name of the place &quot;is and always has been Mittimatalik.&quot; The Scottish explorer Sir John Ross had named an arm of the sea that separates Bylot Island from Baffin Island as Pond&#x27;s Bay, and the hamlet now shares that name. On 29 August 1921, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened its trading post near the Inuit camp and named it Pond Inlet, marking the expansion of its trading empire into the High Arctic.

At the 2021 Canadian census the population, which is predominantly Inuit, was 1,555, a decrease of 3.7% from the 2016 census.

Pond Inlet, the largest community in northern Baffin Island—part of the Arctic Cordillera—with mountains visible from all sides, is called the &quot;Jewel of the North&quot;. At the ice flow edge there is an abundance of wildlife, including polar bears, caribou, wolves, Arctic foxes, ringed seal, and narwhals. It attracts hundreds of visitors each year, who travel by air or by cruise ship. The Nattinnak Visitors Centre on Tasiujaq (Eclipse Sound) which overlooks Bylot Island, showcases Pond Inlet artists. The Sirmilik National Park on Bylot Island, the Tamaarvik Territorial Park, and the Qilaukat Thule site are near the hamlet.

==Geography==

Mittimatalik, known in English as Pond Inlet, is located on the northerly tip of Baffin Island in the Lancaster Sound region on the east side of Eclipse Sound.

The region has one of Canada&#x27;s most inhospitable climates—with long, dark winters and temperatures averaging (December to February, meteorological reckoning). By 2021, Pond Inlet with a population of 1,555, along with Clyde River with 1,181 and Qikiqtarjuaq with 593, comprised the population of the Arctic Cordillera—about 3,300 people. Most of the people who live in the region survive by hunting, fishing, and trapping.

Significant geographic features near Pond Inlet include its ice edge which attracts a diversity of wildlife, particularly ringed seals, Arctic cod, murres and some other sea birds that thrive there, because of its &quot;greater access to preferred foods&quot;.
A wide arm of the sea separates Pond Inlet from Bylot Island, a large uninhabited island of . The waterways between Bylot Island and Baffin Island are Navy Board Inlet, which opens into Lancaster Sound and Tasiujaq, which opens to Baffin Bay. Navy Board Inlet is the entrance to the Northwest Passage. Tasiujaq separates Pond Inlet from Bylot Island and has a series of deeply cut inlets west of Pond Inlet, including Milne Inlet, a small inlet, flows south from Navy Board Inlet at the confluence of Tasiujaq. The Pond Inlet region, including Bylot Island, is covered by the Arctic Cordillera, a terrestrial ecozone in Canada, characterized by a vast, deeply dissected chain of mountain ranges. There are mountains visible from all sides of Pond Inlet. From the summit of Mount Herodier at , which is east of the hamlet, the entire area is visible. Inuit from Pond Inlet travel to the Island regularly and its mountains form a backdrop to the hamlet&#x27;s landscape.

Bylot Island along with Sirmilik National Park, is a protected area. The Bylot Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary, which is across Tasiujaq from Pond Inlet, has been a federally protected area since 1962 and is the second largest Migratory Bird Sanctuary (MBS). It was created to protect the nesting grounds of thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake and greater snow goose.

In 2016, an Elder and a youth from Pond Inlet joined Parks Canada&#x27;s archaeologists to excavate one of the sod houses at the Thule site, known as Qaiqsut, in Bylot Island&#x27;s Sirmilik National Park—one of Canada&#x27;s most northerly parks. The site, which still has a handful of sod houses, had been used by the ancestors of Inuit for centuries, and had also been used by Scottish whalers 200 years ago.

Mary River, with its fresh water lake, which is about south of Pond Inlet—where caribou graze in the summer season—was an annual meeting place for the semi-nomadic Inuit for hundreds of years.

Pond Inlet Inuit have names for about 150 geographic features in the area immediately surrounding the hamlet that have been added to detailed maps in a collaboration between the Inuit Heritage Trust Incorporated (IHTI) and Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office (CNGO). The sound which forms the entrance to the open sea west of the hamlet is called Tursukattak, or ᑐᕐᓱᑲᑦᑕᒃ in Inuktitut syllabics,—&quot;heading west from a narrow passage to a large opening&quot; as it resembles the narrow entrance of an igloo. One of the place names refers to Captain James Bannerman, a Scottish whaler of the 1875 British Arctic Expedition, whose great-grandson is a resident of Pond Inlet.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Pond Inlet had a population of 1,555 living in 365 of its 466 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,617. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Of the total population in 2021, about 49.8% were female and 50.2% male. There were 1,345 Indigenous peoples (1,335 Inuit and 10 First Nations) and 110 non-Indigenous people. Compared to the rest of Canada, Pond Inlet&#x27;s population is fairly young with 36.7% of the population being under 15 compared to 16.3% for Canada as a whole. The average age of people in Pond Inlet is 26.6, compared to Nunavut at 28.3 and the general Canadian population at 41.9.

According to the Qikiqtani Truth Commission, in 2013, 1,549 people—92% of them Inuit—lived in Pond Inlet.

Pond Inlet&#x27;s population in 1976 was 504 people, and within a radius, of what was to become the Mary River Mine, there were 2,209 people. By the 2021 census there were 6,670 people in the same area.

==Wildlife==
By 2011, many Inuit continued to live off the land in the Pond Inlet area. Wildlife in the region includes caribou, polar bears, Arctic foxes, ermines, lemmings, and Arctic hares. The coastal waters have walrus, seals, beluga whales (white whale), and narwhals. A report on community histories, said that an important part of the traditional diet in Pond Inlet came from ringed seals.

A 1982 article in the journal &quot;Arctic&quot; based on 1979 studies of the Pond Inlet ice edge, observed the behaviours of northern fulmars (&quot;Fulmarus glacialis&quot;), black-legged kittiwakes (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;), thick-billed murres (&quot;Uria lomvia&quot;), and black guillemots (&quot;Cepphus grylle&quot;), narwhals (&quot;Monodon monoceros&quot;), beluga whales (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;), Arctic cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;), and ringed seals (&quot;Pusa hispida&quot;). Researchers found that both ringed seals and Arctic cod preferred land fast ice and that the Arctic cod that remained close to the undersurface of land fast ice, were larger and older than those offshore.

The variety of wildlife so close to the hamlet is one of its tourist attractions.

===Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization===

Pond Inlet&#x27;s Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization (MHTO) have been actively participating in discussions regarding Baffinland&#x27;s Phase 2 Proposal for expansion of the Mary River project by submitting presentations to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association&#x27;s (QIA). The Nunavut Impact Review Board was criticized for rushing through the process by limiting the number of questions each party could ask Baffinland. MHTO board member, elder and hunter Elijah Panipakoocho expressed frustration with the process. The MHTO and the Hamlet of Pond Inlet said that the NIRB process was not supporting Inuit interests. Panipakoocho said that now the caribou are gone, and the seal that they used to hunt in Milne Inlet during the fall freeze-up are no longer abundant. MHTO chairperson, Eric Ootoovak, said that &quot;This project deserves and needs more work, and more attention, and that is what we bring to the table. More questions, not less, are absolutely necessary...Instead of developing more questions based on what we&#x27;ve heard, our technical advisor has spent two days trying to find ways to cut corners and limit our incredibly important questions.&quot; Milne Inlet, where Baffinalnd have their port, is a &quot;small inlet&quot; that &quot;opens into Eclipse Sound, a primary summering area for Nunavut&#x27;s largest population of narwhal. After years of negotiations, communities say they still haven&#x27;t been given a clear picture of how the mine will impact Inuit land use and hunting rights for themselves and following generations.&quot;

==Place name==
To the Inuit, the place &quot;is and always has been Mittimatalik.&quot; The hamlet shares its name with an arm of the sea that separates Bylot Island from Baffin Island. The place name for the body of water, an arm of the ocean that separates Baffin Island from Bylot Island to the north – Pond&#x27;s Bay – was chosen by the explorer John Ross in 1818 in honour of the English astronomer John Pond, at the time the sixth Astronomer Royal. The hamlet shares that English name, Pond Inlet, used by the early Scottish whalers and traders, the &quot;Sikaatsi&quot;. On 29 August 1921, when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened its trading post near an Inuit camp called Pond&#x27;s Inlet, they named the HBC post, Pond Inlet.

==Pond Inlet community histories==

According to the 2013 Qikiqtani Truth Commission, the people of the region around Pond Inlet are known as &quot;Tununirmiut&quot;—&quot;people of the shaded place&quot; or &quot;Mittimatalingmiut&quot;—people of Mittimatalik.&quot;

Archaeologists have identified the four thousand years of land use—hunting and fishing on land, sea, and ice—in the Pond Inlet area as pre-Dorset people, Dorset, Thule, and modern Inuit.

Many Inuit in &quot;present-day Pond Inlet are related to families in Igloolik&quot;. The Igloolik Inuit, are part of the Amitturmiut groups of Inuit—the historic Inuit groups that occupied the coast of northern Foxe Basin—encountered Scottish whalers and British explorers searching for the Northwest Passage in the 1820s. The Amitturmiut were semi-nomadic, travelled great distances on foot and by dog sled on traditional routes to follow the caribou and sea mammals, from hunting caribou to fishing spots.

The settlement that was later named Pond Inlet &quot;grew along a shoreline inhabited as long as any other part of Eclipse Sound— Tasiujaq. Tasiujaq—which has several arms—is a natural Qikiqtaaluk Region waterway through the Arctic Archipelago that separates Bylot Island from Baffin Island.

Starting in 1903, Scottish entrepreneurs had set up a small whaling station at Igarjuaq. Other non-Inuit (&quot;Qallunaat&quot;) traders established trading posts in the area. There was some contact with Inuit during the short annual whaling season. By 1903, the whaling industry was declining and the year-round station closed down. The area used by non-Inuit traders at that time &quot;extended 65 kilometres from Button Point on Bylot Island to Salmon River, which was near Mittimatalik.

During the 1920s, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) trading post, Anglican and Catholic mission stations, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police post were established. In 1922, the RCMP built a detachment at Pond Inlet. The Commission reported on community histories, explaining how an important part of the traditional diet in Pond Inlet came from ringed seals. The report also noted that preserved cultural objects provided archaeological evidence of a &quot;rich material and intangible culture&quot; in the area. Among these were two &quot;superb&quot; &quot;angakkuq&quot; (shamans) Dorset period masks from Button Point, that had been carved c. 500-1000 CE and are now in the permanent collection of the Canadian Museum of History.
The &quot;angakkuq&quot; masks were originally collected by Guy Mary-Rousselière, a French-Canadian anthropologist, missionary Catholic priest, who spent 56 years in the Canadian Arctic including 36 years in Mittimatalik, from 1958 until his 23 April 1994 death there at the age of 81. Father Mary, as he was known, &quot;died in a fire at the Catholic mission in Pond Inlet&quot;—a &quot;wise and somewhat eccentric elder of the church&quot;.

In 1923, Nuqallaq, following Inuit customary law killed a fur trader Robert Janes, originally from Newfoundland, in Pond Inlet following the communities collective decision to sanction Janes for his dangerous behaviour. Janes had &quot;reportedly threatened the Inuit and their valuable sled dogs&quot;. Nuqallaq was tried according to Canadian law and his wife&#x27;s testimony in his defence was recorded by Father Mary-Rousselière. Nuqallaq was found guilty and sentenced to ten years of hard labour in the Stony Mountain Penitentiary. In her 2002 non-fiction, &quot;Arctic Justice: On Trial for Murder, Pond Inlet, 1923&quot;, Shelagh Grant said that the trial and sentence were motivated by &quot;Canada&#x27;s international political concerns for establishing sovereignty over the Arctic.&quot; In his 2017 non-fiction &quot;Thou Shalt Do No Murder: Inuit, Injustice, and the Canadian Arctic&quot;, Kenn Harper said that the trial &quot;marked a collision of two cultures with vastly different conceptions of justice and conflict resolution...It hastened the end of the Inuit traditional way of life and ushered in an era in which Inuit autonomy was supplanted by dependence on traders and police, and later missionaries&quot;.

When the first hospital was built in 1962, in what is now Nunavut—the Baffin Regional Hospital in Iqaluit—pregnant Inuit women were sent there to deliver their babies.

In 1964, the Cape Dorset (now Kinngait) art studio manager, Terrence Ryan, travelled to several communities in North Baffin, provided drawing materials, commissioned and collected drawings from local Inuit Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Arctic Bay and Igloolik, which resulted in a collection of approximately 1,860 sheets of drawings — drawn by 159 local residents. It was a time of &quot;social, economic and spiritual upheaval&quot; and the images recorded and reflected that experience in the northern hamlets. The drawings were digitized and published online by the Agnes Etherington Art Centre.

Inuit youth from Pond Inlet were taken from their families and sent to the Churchill Vocational School in Manitoba, which operated from 9 September 1964 to 30 June 1973. The students were housed in hostels that were segregated based on the students&#x27; religious affiliation—Roman Catholic or Anglican. According to the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2008 to 2015), organized by the parties of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the Churchill Vocational Centre in northern Manitoba, housed Inuit youth from Pond Inlet and about 16 other remote hamlets—all at that time still part of the Northwest Territories—Nunavut was created in 1999. Some of the students at the Indigenous residential school at Churchill travelled &quot;staggering&quot; distances with some Inuit communities separated by as much as . Over the years, the Churchill Vocational Centre had &quot;provided academic and vocational training to about 1,000 to 1,200 Inuit youth&quot;. The September 2007 landmark compensation deal, the federal government-approved agreement amounted to nearly $2 billion in compensation to former students who had attended 130 schools. By 2008, different levels of government, including Tununiq MLA James Arvaluk and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, worked with some former Churchill residential school students, as the school records had not been properly maintained, and many former students were not able to receive adequate and fair compensation. While at Churchill, the young Inuit met other young people from different regions and they discussed common problems and considered political change. The new organizations they founded upon returning to the Arctic, included the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (formerly the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada or ITK) in the eastern Arctic in 1971.

By the 1970s, Inuit had gradually &quot;moved, or been moved, from land-based hunting and trapping camps to new settlements&quot;, like Pond Inlet, that had been developed in the eastern Arctic, and over the years, attempts had been made by the federal government, to integrate Inuit into a &quot;modern industrial economy&quot;.

By the 1970s, the three main sections in Pond Inlet were the area around the cliff called Qaiqsuarjuk, the beach area known as Mittimatalik, and the upper hill area called Qaqqarmiut.

In the 1990s, in response to one of the recommendations of the 1992 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, three generations of Pond Inlet women participated in a project with author and researcher Nancy Wachowich to record and publish their stories. Apphia Agalakti Awa was born on the land in the Eastern High Arctic in 1931, for four decades lived the semi-nomadic life style travelling &quot;across tundra and sea ice, between hunting camps, fishing spots, and trading posts.&quot; Mandatory federal day schools opened in Pond Inlet in 1960 and for families that lived on the land, the government built hostels in Igloolik, where even young children—like 8-year old Rhoda Kaukjak Katsak—were housed. Sandra Pikujak Katsak, was born in the regional hospital in Iqaluit as Pond Inlet did not have the hospital facilities. She grew up in Pond Inlet.

By the 2000s, the Aboriginal Healing Foundation through the Saluqat Committee&#x27;s Mittimatalik Healing project in Pond Inlet were providing on-the-land healing camps where elders and residential school survivors addressed many issues related to the aftermath of the residential schools experience.

==Mixed economy: wage-based and traditional subsistence==
Pond Inlet&#x27;s economy is mixed—including both traditional subsistence and wage-based activities. The wildlife economy, &quot;including hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering...continues to play an important role in Pond Inlet and contributes to the foundation of Inuit culture and economy&quot;. As part of the decentralization process that was adopted by the new Nunavut government as a job creation strategy, Pond Inlet became the Qikiqtani regional centre for Nunavut&#x27;s Department of Economic Development and Transportation. Growth sectors in Nunavut include arts and crafts and wildlife harvesting for future economic development.

When Nunavut was established, its government adopted a decentralized strategy for job creation. As part of the decentralization process, Pond Inlet became the Qikiqtani regional centre for Nunavut&#x27;s Department of Economic Development and Transportation. The government is now the largest employer in Pond Inlet. Growth sectors in Nunavut include small businesses, usually related to serving the community, tourism, arts and crafts and wildlife harvesting.

Employment areas include sales and service, social science, education, &quot;government service and religion occupations, business finance and administration, trades, transport and equipment operators.&quot;

Pond Inlet has a higher unemployment rates than most of Nunavut.

When announcing lay-offs in November 2019, Baffinland said that 586 contract employees were affected, which included 96 Inuit.

===Tourism===
As a tourist destination, Pond Inlet is considered one of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Jewels of the North&quot;. It is one of the most picturesque communities with mountain ranges visible in all directions. Icebergs are most often accessible from the community within walking distance or a short snowmobile ride in winter. Pond Inlet boasts a nearby floe edge, several dozen glaciers, explorable ice caves, and many grand and picturesque inlets. Barren-ground caribou, ringed seal, narwhals and polar bears are just some of the wildlife that can be encountered while travelling out on the land. The area is also home to Sirmilik National Park (; Inuktitut: &quot;the place of glaciers&quot;), name for the glaciers that can be observed there.
By 1999, Pond Inlet was receiving about 1,500 visitors from six to eight cruise ships with tours usually organized around the hamlet&#x27;s newly built Nattinnak Visitor Centre and the Rebecca P. Idlout Public Library and archives. The Nattinnak Centre offers a variety of on-shore programs, which may include a walking tour of the hamlet, a visit to the Qilaukat Thule site near Salmon River, and/or a cultural performance—with a focus on the creation of Nunavut. Pond Inlet carvers, artists, performers, and others benefit from this &quot;locally-generated economic activity.&quot; In 1996, the Rebecca P. Idlout library was moved to its current location in the building it shares with the Nattinnak centre. The building, which is on the waterfront, overlooks Tasiujaq and Bylot Island. The library, which first opened in November 1988, was named after Idlout, who was a graduate of the Nunavut Teacher Education Program and was very involved in young people&#x27;s education in Nunavut.

===Tununiq Sauniq Co-op===
The Tununiq Sauniq Co-operative, a member of Arctic Co-operatives Limited, was incorporated in 1968. In Pond Inlet, businesses include a retail store, convenience store, hotel, fuel delivery, Yamaha snowmobile and ATV repair shop, cable television services and property rentals. It serves the community by managing contracts and delivering goods and services to the citizens of Pond Inlet. Some of the services the Co-op provides are: school bus services, Canadian North airline agents, Qilaut heavy equipment rentals and services, construction contracts, TV cable services, a grocery and department store, Yamaha snowmobile and ATV repair shop, and others. It also has the largest hotel in the community, the Sauniq Inns North Hotel.

===Inuit land use and occupation===
The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) initiated the 1973 Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project (ILUOP). The ILUOP &quot;presented a detailed, comprehensive, and verifiable basis for the claim that Inuit used and occupied an area in excess of 2.8 million square kilometres at the time the ILUOP was completed in the Northwest Territories and northeast Yukon&quot;. Hugh Brody (1943–), who was an anthropologist, associated with the Scott Polar Research Institute, operated by the University of Cambridge, and a Canada Research Chair at the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. did extensive field work in Pond Inlet in the 1970s, as a research officer with the Northern Science Research Group. In 1976–78 he coordinated the land use mapping in the North Baffin region for the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project and assembled accounts of Inuit perceptions of land occupancy across the Arctic which were included in the Project&#x27;s final publications.

In the mid-1980s there were two &quot;longitudinal surveys of local economic changes in Pond Inlet&quot; undertaken and more data was gathered in 1997. At that time, job opportunities remained limited. There was some expectation for increased employment with the creation of the new Nunavut government.

In Pond Inlet in 2006, the Mary River Inuit Knowledge Study (MRIKS) began with a series of workshops and interviews that were also undertaken in Arctic Bay, Clyde River, Sanirajak (Hall Beach), and Igloolik from 2007 and 2010. MRIKS, which was informed by the 1976 ILAOP, asked participants about &quot;Inuit use and understanding of the land, caribou, marine mammals, fish, birds and other land mammals.&quot; Participants were asked about the &quot;names for the major land and water features and thirty-six key words were recorded. The study included Inuit Heritage Trust place names. The Qikiqtani Inuit Association had outstanding concerns about the interpretation of MRIKS data and impacts, and how traditional knowledge from MRIKS will be integrated into the Final Environmental Impact Statement.

In June 2019, at a Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation&#x27;s Mary River Mine technical review meeting in Pond Inlet as part of the Nunavut Impact Review Board (NIRB) process, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association presented their study that they had compiled with residents of the nearest community to Mary River Mine—Pond Inlet. Pond Inlet had raised concerns Baffinland contracted article that seemed to &quot;reduce traditional knowledge or &quot;Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit&quot; (IQ) to static data&quot;. QIA conducted interviews with 35 Pond Inlet residents on &quot;how they live their daily life, including where they hunt, fish and just enjoy the outdoors&quot; and used Google Earth mapping to &quot;mark hunting routes, burial sites and other areas of importance to the community&quot;.

==The creation of Nunavut==
In 1976, the nonprofit organization, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITC), now known as the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami—who represent all Canadian Inuit—submitted its first Inuit land claims proposal, calling for the creation of a new territory.

In 1999, Nunavut was established, brought about by the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement—the largest and most all-encompassing land claims and self-determination agreement in Canadian history.

==Mineral development projects==
Two large mineral development projects that were located close to Pond Inlet included Nanisivik Mine which operated from 1976 until 2002. and Baffinland Iron Mine Corporation&#x27;s open-pit iron ore mine—the Mary River Mine has been operational since 2014 and is now seeking major expansion which includes a railway and a dramatic increase in shipping.

In a 2000 article in the journal &quot;Arctic&quot;, co-authors reported that &quot;[m]any of the obstacles to development...identified in 1987 still persist&quot;—&quot;lack of infrastructure, insufficient local control of economic forces, and sometimes inappropriate development models&quot;. Much of the literature on northern development was &quot;triggered&quot; by potential mega-project hydrocarbon and mineral development where discussions focused on comparisons of the &quot;relative merits of the new &#x27;formal&#x27; economy and the traditional...informal economy&quot;. According to a 2013 &quot;Inuit Studies&quot; journal article based on archival records of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Department of Energy, Mines, and Resources, the decision-making process surrounding development in the eastern Arctic was flawed. The researchers examined the &quot;relationship between Inuit as hunters and Inuit as wage earners&quot; with reference to &quot;contemporary mining development in Nunavut&quot;.

===Baffinland Iron Mine Corporation&#x27;s Mary River Mine===

In 2014, after years of negotiations, the Baffinland Iron Mine Corporation opened its open-pit iron ore mine—the Mary River Mine—located south-southwest of Pond Inlet, the nearest community. In 2011, the Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal SA—the largest steel maker in the world—and an American hedge fund, had jointly purchased the Baffinland Iron Mine Corporation. Their plans included a proposed northern railway that would carry the iron ore to tidewater. The mine has been the source of much debate over cultural and environmental issues.

In Baffinland&#x27;s 2019 annual report, Pond Inlet reported that in 2018 there were 49 people employed by Baffinland in Pond Inlet and the number was decreasing. Concerns were raised for hunters - the lack of animals was noticeable. There were concerns about sound pollution and ships in summer affecting wildlife as there are fewer seals and narwhals. It was also noted that QIA received the royalties not the affected communities.

The mine has attracted international attention for its planned phase two expansion, that would see a dramatic increase in shipping from its Milne Inlet port in Tasiujaq, near Pond Inlet, through a narwhal habitat in the waters near Greenland. Milne Inlet is a &quot;small inlet&quot; that &quot;opens into Eclipse Sound, a primary summering area for Nunavut&#x27;s largest population of narwhal&quot;. Ships from Baffinland&#x27;s port in Milne Inlet will have to enter and exit Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area—a national marine conservation area. In a 2021 letter to the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Arreak, said that the hamlet would not support the phase two project unless Baffinland agreed to slow down their increase in production to yearly increments of 1.5 million tonnes per year.&quot;

The Kingdom of Denmark, concerned by the environmental impacts of the next phase of Baffinland&#x27;s Mary River Mine on nearby Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has been included by the Canadian government in the Nunavut Impact Review Board assessment process for the planned expansion. The iron ore shipping lanes, which go through a narwhal habitat, will threaten this population which is just beginning to return after a hundred years.
The two weeks of Nunavut Impact Review Board environmental hearings regarding the Mary River Mine ended on 6 February. By 6 February peaceful protesters from Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay were blockading the Mary River Aerodrome and trucking road at Mary River Mine. They are concerned that expansion would result in an &quot;increase the number of ore carriers that visit during the ice free season&quot;. The expansion would double output from 6 to 12 million tonnes a year and would include a railway. It would increase shipping through its port at Milne Inlet and impact a crucial habitat for narwhal in the Canadian Arctic. Elder and hunter Elijah Panipakoocho, who is a Pond Inlet&#x27;s Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization board member, &quot;participated in early wildlife research&quot; undertaken before the mine opened in 2014.

Nunavut communities had serious concerns about the mine&#x27;s proposed expansion and were engaged in protests and public hearings.
On 4 February 2021, as the two-week long scheduled Nunavut Impact Review Board review on the Baffinland expansion was nearing its end, eight hunters from Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay, set up a peaceful blockade at Mary River project&#x27;s tote road and airstrip. The communities of Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay are nearest the mine site. The hunters feel their wildlife economy is threatened—protesting the expansion and the review process itself. The protesters have formed a line of snowmobiles, their gear-laden wooden sleds, and their tent. The hunters are asking other protesters to not destroy Baffinland&#x27;s equipment. Dozens of Baffinland&#x27;s Inuit employees are being paid to stay home to avoid bringing COVID-19 into the small communities. The vast majority of mine workers are non-Inuit who are flown into the work camps.

A concern is the dust from the tote road. Pond Inlet residents are worried that the water and the food chain will be contaminated with trace metals. An added concern is that the water and the food chain will be contaminated with trace metals. Baffinland had built a tote road to carry truckloads of iron ore from Mary River Mine to Milne Inlet instead of the special cold-weather railway and a new port, Steensby Inlet, planned in 2011 and proposed in 2008. With a global decrease in the price of iron ore, Baffinland said that the railway and Steensby Inlet port was too expensive an option. The bulk carrier &quot;Federal Tiber&quot; departed from Milne Inlet on 8 August 2015, with the first shipment of ore from the mine. In 2021, Baffinland said that the &quot;railway and a new indoor crushing facility will decrease dust.&quot;

===Geological Survey===
In 2017 and 2018, researchers from the Geological Survey of Canada and the Département des sciences de la Terre et de l’atmosphère, at the Université du Québec à Montréal conducted extensive fieldwork for the &quot;bedrock mapping for the GEM-2 North Baffin project&quot; in the area around Pond Inlet and part of Sirmilik National Park which is situated on Bylot Island, as well as in the area bordering Steensby Inlet and the Barnes Ice Cap, including included the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation&#x27;s Mary River iron mine.

===Environmental concerns===
In 1991, the Northern Contaminants Program (NCP) began monitoring the levels of contaminants in wildlife species that continued to be an important part of the traditional diet of Inuit, such as beluga, ringed seals, and arctic char. Their third assessment focused on persistent organic pollutants (POP)s. In Pond Inlet a specific focus was placed on sea run Arctic char.

==Transportation==

Pond Inlet is most readily accessible by aircraft through a connection in Iqaluit, Nunavut&#x27;s capital, to Pond Inlet Airport. The ocean is ice free for as long as three and a half months when cruise ships bring tourists to visit and goods can be transported to the community by sealift cargo carrying ships. Fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables and milk are flown from Montreal to Pond Inlet several times a week, a distance of about .

Because of such great distances the cost of food and other materials such as construction supplies can be much higher than that of southern Canada. Milk is approximately $3.75/L, and carbonated drinks can be as much as $4.50/can.

Although the community is not more than long, snowmobiles and ATV four-wheelers are the main modes of transportation. With the decentralization of the Nunavut government and increased economic opportunities in the community, the number of vehicles has been increasing.

==Education==
Ulaajuk Elementary School and Nasivvik High School together teach kindergarten through grade 12 to approximately 450 students. Nunavut Arctic College hosts a variety of programs for adult learners. Pond Inlet is also the headquarters of the Qikiqtani School Operations which runs schools throughout the Qikiqtaaluk Region. Nunavut uses the Alberta curriculum, which may not be appropriate for high schools in Nunavut.

== Broadband communications ==
The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSi Canada. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

==Climate==
Pond Inlet has a polar arctic climate (ET) with long cold winters and short cool summers. Pond Inlet&#x27;s average high for the year is while the average low for the year is . The daily mean for the coldest month, February, is . The daily mean for the warmest month, July, is . The annual average during the 30 year period from 1991–2020 is up from the 1981–2010 average of . The record high for Pond Inlet is on 12 July 2001. The record low for Pond Inlet is on 12 February 1979.

<doc id="282622" wikidata="Q999897" url="?curid=282622" title="Middle management">
<text>Middle management is the intermediate management level of a hierarchical organization that is subordinate to the executive management and responsible for &quot;team leading&quot; line managers and/or &quot;specialist&quot; line managers. Middle management is indirectly (through line management) responsible for junior staff performance and productivity.

Unlike line management, middle management is considered to be a senior (or semi-executive) position as middle managers are authorised to speak and act on behalf of the organisation to line managers, junior staff and customers. Included in this level of management are division, plant and department managers.

American business historian Alfred D. Chandler Jr. argued in &quot;The Visible Hand&quot; (1977) that in the nineteenth century, Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible&quot; hand was supplanted by the &quot;&quot;visible&quot; hand&quot; of middle management, which became &quot;the most powerful institution in the American economy&quot;. He credited middle managers with a central importance like the inventors, empire builders, and financiers.

A 2023 study in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; found that middle management has increased over time and that the role of middle management increasingly revolves around the task of collaboration rather than supervision.

==Role in an organization==

===Functions of a middle manager===
A middle manager is a link between the senior management and the lower (junior) levels of the organization. Due to involvement into day-to-day running of a business, middle managers have the opportunity to report valuable information and suggestions from the inside of an organization. They are in charge of putting into practice guidelines established previously in the strategic plans by top level managers. Moreover, the middle manager is a channel of communication within the organization, as they pass on major decisions of executives and the main goals of an organization to lower levels of employees. This contributes to better coordination between workers and makes a company more united.

The primary responsibility of a middle manager is to implement a strategy, created by the executive level, in the most efficient way possible. In order to reach the target goals, a manager may adjust and interpret the initial plan. Other functions can be divided into three main categories:
* Technical
Middle managers are responsible for facilitating any necessary changes within an organization and creating an effective working environment. They oversee daily routines, monitor performance, and ensure that everything is done in compliance with the organization&#x27;s needs.
* Human resources
One of the most important functions of a middle manager is motivating, leading and inspiring their subordinates. This also includes building a team and supporting any team member when necessary. 
* Strategic
Strategic functions involve analyzing a subordinate group in terms of productivity and financial effectiveness, creating a strategy of improving the current situation and reporting to the executive management in the form of attending a boardroom meeting or a discussion.

===Competencies===
A number of competencies are critical to become an effective middle manager.
* Leadership. The most important competency that consists of many skills. As an inherent leader, middle managers have to possess sense-making and persuading skills. They must be able to motivate, influence and guide their subordinates, become a role model for them, demonstrate the quality and the level of work contribution necessary for the organization and engage in continuous self-development and learning.
* Decision-making. Ability to quickly solve the problems, make decisions under pressure and take responsibility for the outcome.
* Creativity &amp; Visioning. Managers should have a clear vision of the strategy implementation and be creative in overcoming the possible difficulties.
* Performance management. Involves managing the performance of subordinates and, specifically, the line managers, effectively, by setting clear and measurable objectives for them and provide coaching. Middle managers must be also skilled in presenting, persuading and influencing people.

===Middle manager vs. line manager===
A middle management position is often mistakenly described as a similar to the line management one. However, there are some differences:
* Middle manager is a semi-executive position – line managers are promoted to become middle managers. Thus, middle managers enjoy greater salary, benefits and a closer position to a boardroom.
* System of subordination – line managers are subordinate to middle managers. Middle managers are responsible for large teams and are unable to control performance of every single individual. Thus, direct or line manager measures the team performance and reports to the middle manager.
* Set of duties – unlike line managers, who have a clear procedure of work and set of duties, middle managers have only target goals. The way of achieving those goals is decided by the manager independently.

==Criticism==
The role of middle management is subject to a number of criticisms. This position is often seen as unnecessary, and middle managers are blamed for holding the organization back from achieving its full potential and using their influence for their own purposes.

===Influence===
Middle management is often accused of possessing too much influence. Their central position in an organization allows them to influence strategy and actions in &quot;both upward and downward direction&quot;. When supplying information to the executive level, middle managers interpret it subjectively and may insinuate it with their own opinion and evaluation. Further, proximity to the boardroom makes it easy for the manager to promote their own interests, by &quot;synthesizing&quot; the information and presenting data from a certain strategic perspective. The same level of influence can be exploited by a middle manager towards the lower staff.

===Resistance===
Middle managers&#x27; reluctance to lose control in their teams and satisfaction with a settled situation could lead to their resistance in any changes in the strategy or direction of an organization. Usually, the resistance does not take an aggressive form such as refusal to carry out tasks or unconcealed confrontation, but result in a lack of support and eagerness to convey only those tasks, impact of which is clearly visible to the top management. This creates barriers to a growth of a company and lags the overall working process.

===Necessity===
The overall necessity of middle managers in an organization is questioned. They are said to be too costly, non-effective and constantly under-performing employees. It has been stated that middle managers do not carry out their main duties of linking the organization and reporting effectively, which leads to a block of communication between different levels of staff. Thus, as rapid growth of globalization put pressures on businesses in terms of cost effectiveness and speed of information flow within the organization, middle management make companies less flexible and competitive.

==Future==
The development of information technology has enabled an increase in the span of control and reduced the need for middle management. Moreover, an increasing number of modern organizations are becoming flatter and downsized in pursuit of flexibility, higher competitiveness, and innovation. According to David Williams, flat organizations promote greater intercommunication and efficiency among workers. As a result, many organizations are being restructured, middle management is being reduced, and their roles are considered outdated and unnecessary.

At the same time, there is still a need in a middle manager as an employee and they continue playing a significant role in organizations, specifically in setting an overall strategy and targets. Changes in the global market forced them to become more flexible, stress-resistant, acquire new skills.

<text>Hiawatha National Forest is a National Forest in the Upper Peninsula of the state of Michigan in the United States. Commercial logging is conducted in some areas. The United States Forest Service administers this National Forest; it is physically divided into two subunits, commonly called the Eastside and Westside .

==Etymology==
According to the forest service, it was &quot;named after the Mohawk chief, Hiawatha, who brought about the confederation known as the Five Nations of the Iroquois. He was also the hero of Longfellow&#x27;s poem, &#x27;Hiawatha&#x27;.&quot;

In descending order of land area it lies in parts of Chippewa, Delta, Mackinac, Alger, Schoolcraft, and Marquette counties. Chippewa and Mackinac counties are in the East Unit, whereas the rest are in the West Unit. The smaller East Unit contains about 44% of the forest&#x27;s area, whereas the larger West Unit has about 56%. Forest headquarters are located in Gladstone, Michigan. East Unit ranger district offices are located in Sault Ste. Marie and St. Ignace, while West Unit offices are in Manistique, Munising, and Rapid River.

The East Unit was a large infertile sandy area that was never homesteaded or developed. It was designated Marquette National Forest by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. This land was administered with Huron National Forest as the Michigan National Forest from 1918 until 1962, when it was transferred to Hiawatha. The forest was authorized to buy an additional in 1925 and in 1935. The government began purchasing land for the West Unit in 1928, this land and was designated Hiawatha National Forest in 1931. This unit was extensively replanted by the Civilian Conservation Corps.

The Hiawatha National Forest contains six designated wilderness areas:
*Big Island Lake Wilderness
*Delirium Wilderness
*Horseshoe Bay Wilderness
*Mackinac Wilderness
*Rock River Canyon Wilderness

<text>Program management deals with overseeing a group or several projects that align with a company’s organizational strategy, goals, and mission. These projects, are intended to improve an organization&#x27;s performance. Program management is distinct from &quot;project&quot; management.

Many programs focus on delivering a capability to change and are normally designed to deliver the organization&#x27;s strategy or business transformation. Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of resources across projects, managing links between the projects and the overall costs and risks of the program.

== Summary ==

Program management is used in many business sectors such as business transformation, change management, construction, engineering, event planning, health care and information technology. In the defense sector, it is the preferred approach to managing large scale projects. Given major defense programs entail working with contractors, it is also called acquisition management, indicating that the government buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors.

The program manager has an oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program. In program management, the manager supports all project-level activity by ensuring program goals are met at each milestone of the project. In addition, the  program manager is ultimately responsible for execution of projects to include decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by a project manager. Typically, the project manager uses the program manager as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. The program manager provides insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers, although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required.

== Program management skills ==

The skills needed to be a successful program manager consist of the ability to work well with others and communicate clearly and effectively. For a program manager, time management, problem solving and critical thinking are key skills needed to manage, plan, and execute multiple projects. Since a program manager is leading a project and working with others, leadership attributes, stakeholder management, and decision making are critical to project success.

To obtain the necessary skills to become an effective program manager, obtaining a certification will demonstrate that you have the required skill set. The available certifications to obtain this knowledge are Project Management Professional (PMP), Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), or PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP). These various certifications can be obtained in many colleges and universities.

==Key factors==
There are several key factors of program management which considerably differ from project management. In general, these fall under several categories and range from overall strategic vision, resource and change management, and benefits of completion. Program management deals with strategy of the company as opposed to a shorter term look in project management&quot;.&quot;

===Alignment===

The program must support a higher-level vision, goals, and objectives. These are set out in the program vision and blueprint, which defines the future state for the organization, sector or community that will be significantly changed. Individual projects align to a program set by the executive team. These projects can vary in scope, intent, and priority but all are part of the greater portfolio.

===Management===

The program manager may be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the Project Managers although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required. Program management necessitates consistent progress checks to ensure the projects are matching the portfolio’s direction. These checks should ensure accountability and confirm that stakeholders and suppliers are being utilized.

===Program objectives===

A program will deliver major change, whether it is within an organization, a sector or a community. As such, the management of change and transition is a key characteristic of a program, not just the building of a major capability. The program will adhere to set standards and incorporate planning, quality assurance, integration, and the eventual implementation. The planning phase brings together the various projects, resources, and milestones. Program changes and improvement go through a greater level of scrutiny compared to project management. Whereas a project might get approval for a change from its sponsor or director, a program level change would likely need executive approval. Quality assurance is pivotal to the success of each individual project and the success of the implementation.

===Benefits===

The key difference between a project and a program is that benefits are delivered within the program lifecycle compared to a project when they are delivered after the project has finished. These benefits in a program are felt as they are implemented and not when the project is rolled out to users. Successful program implementations are felt by the business affect all users in the organization.

== Comparison with project management==
Program management and project management represent two fundamental approaches to achieving organizational change and success. While both are integral to an organization’s strategic execution, they differ significantly in their objectives, scope, and operational focus. Programs oversee and coordinate related projects to achieve broader organizational outcomes, whereas projects aim to deliver specific, tangible outputs within clearly defined parameters. Understanding these distinctions is essential for businesses to allocate resources effectively and align activities with strategic goals.

=== Key differences ===

==== Outputs vs. outcomes ====
Projects are designed to produce well-defined outputs. These outputs are discrete, measurable deliverables that contribute to a specific goal, such as constructing a new facility, implementing an IT solution, or launching a marketing campaign. These efforts are generally confined to meeting precise objectives that are critical to the organization&#x27;s immediate needs.

Programs, by contrast, manage the interdependencies between multiple projects to deliver broader organizational outcomes. For instance, while a project might deliver a new hospital building, a program integrates this infrastructure with initiatives such as staff recruitment, training, and community outreach to enhance overall healthcare accessibility. This broader focus ensures that the strategic benefits extend beyond the sum of individual project outputs.

==== Scope and duration ====
The finite nature of projects is a defining characteristic. Each project operates within a fixed timeline and budget, with a clear start and end point. The deliverables of a project are specific, and its success is often measured by the extent to which it achieves its defined scope.

In contrast, programs are ongoing and adaptive. Programs encompass a series of related projects, evolving over time in response to organizational goals, external factors, and changing priorities. Programs often operate within an extended timeline, allowing for adjustments that maximize their strategic impact. For example, a corporate sustainability program might continuously add projects addressing renewable energy use or carbon footprint reduction.

Management focus

Project Managers are primarily concerned with the successful execution of their specific projects. Their focus is on delivering outputs that meet predefined standards of scope, cost, and quality. They oversee the project lifecycle from initiation through to completion, emphasizing efficiency, adherence to schedule, and budgetary constraints.

Program Managers, in contrast, take on a broader and more strategic role. They ensure that all projects under a program are aligned with organizational objectives and complement each other. Program managers must also address risks, resource allocation, and stakeholder expectations at a macro level. Their role involves monitoring the interdependencies between projects and adjusting optimize outcomes.

==== Measurements of success ====
In project management, success is assessed based on the delivery of outputs that meet specified criteria. A project is deemed successful if it achieves its objectives within the agreed time, budget, and scope. For example, a project to develop a new software application would be considered successful if the application functions as intended and is delivered on schedule. 

Program management, on the other hand, evaluates success based on long-term strategic benefits and overall organizational impact. A program encompassing projects to reduce operating costs, for instance, would measure success by the extent to which these cost savings contribute to improved financial performance over time.

=== Theoretical perspectives ===
Different perspectives exist regarding the distinctions between programs and projects.

==== Outputs vs. outcomes perspective ====
Programs deliver outcomes that reflect strategic changes, whereas projects deliver outputs that meet specific, tactical needs. In this view, program managers ensure that all constituent projects collectively achieve desired end states, while project managers focus on completing their projects effectively.

==== Flexibility and adaptation perspective ====
Programs are more adaptable than projects, often evolving in response to changing conditions. Unlike projects, which adhere strictly to defined scopes, programs may shift priorities and allocate resources dynamically to maximize organizational benefits.

==== Practical implications ====
An organization’s approach to program and project management has significant implications for its operational and strategic success: 

In launching a new product line, project management would oversee specific tasks such as market research, product design, and manufacturing setup. Each of these projects would have clearly defined outputs, such as a functional prototype or a marketing campaign. 

Program management, by contrast, would ensure that all these projects align with broader organizational goals, such as increasing market share or achieving revenue growth. The program manager would address interdependencies, such as ensuring that production capabilities align with marketing timelines and sales targets.

=== Conclusion ===
Program and project management are complementary disciplines, each playing a vital role in achieving organizational success. Projects deliver outputs efficiently and effectively, while programs ensure that these outputs contribute to broader strategic outcomes. While the distinctions provide a useful framework, the practical application often depends on organizational culture, the complexity of the initiatives, and strategic priorities. Effective integration of both approaches is crucial for organizations aiming to achieve sustained growth and innovation.

<text>Management consulting is the practice of providing consulting services to organizations to improve their performance or in any way to assist in achieving organizational objectives. Organizations may draw upon the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and accessing consultants&#x27; specialized expertise regarding concerns that call for additional oversight.

As a result of their exposure to and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry &quot;best practices&quot;. However, the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the ability or appropriateness of transferring such practices from one organization to another. Management consulting is an additional service to internal management functions and, for various legal and practical reasons, may not be seen as a replacement for internal management. Unlike interim management, management consultants do not become part of the organization to which they provide services.

Consultancies provide services such as: organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, process analysis, technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services. Management consultants often bring their own proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems and to serve as the basis for recommendations with a view to more effective or efficient ways of performing work tasks.

The economic function of management consulting firms is in general to help and facilitate the development, rationalization and optimization of the various markets pertaining to the geographic areas and jurisdictions in which they operate. However, the exact nature of the value of such a service model may vary greatly across markets and its description is therefore contingent.

== History ==
Management consulting grew with the rise of management, as a unique field of study. One of the first management consulting firms was Arthur D. Little Inc., founded in 1886 as a partnership, and later incorporated in 1909. Although Arthur D. Little later became a general management consultancy, it originally specialized in technical research.

As Arthur D. Little focused on technical research for the first few years, the first management consultancy was that of Frederick Winslow Taylor, who in 1893 opened an independent consulting practice in Philadelphia. His business card read &quot;Consulting Engineer – Systematizing Shop Management and Manufacturing Costs a Specialty&quot;. By inventing Scientific Management, also known as Taylor&#x27;s method, Frederick Winslow Taylor invented the first method of organizing work, spawning the careers of many more management consultants. For example, one of Taylor&#x27;s early collaborators, Morris Llewellyn Cooke, opened his own management consultancy in 1905. Taylor&#x27;s method was used worldwide until industry switched to a method invented by W. Edwards Deming.

The initial period of growth in the consulting industry was triggered by the Glass–Steagall Banking Act in the 1930s, and was driven by demand for advice on finance, strategy and organization. From the 1950s onwards, consultancies expanded their activities considerably in the United States, and also opened offices in Europe and later in Asia and South America.

The management consulting firms Stern Stewart, Marakon Associates, and Alcar pioneered value-based management (VBM), or &quot;managing for value&quot;, in the 1980s based on the academic work of Joel Stern, Bill Alberts, and Professor Alfred Rappaport. Other consulting firms including McKinsey and BCG developed VBM approaches. Value-based management became prominent during the late 1980s and 1990s.

The industry experienced significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s, gaining considerable importance in relation to national gross domestic product.

A period of significant growth in the early 1980s was driven by demand for strategy and organization consultancies. The wave of growth in the 1990s was driven by both strategy and information technology advice. In the second half of the 1980s, the big accounting firms entered the IT consulting segment. The then Big Eight, now Big Four, accounting firms (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) had always offered advice in addition to their traditional services, but after the late 1980s these activities became increasingly important in relation to the maturing market of accounting and auditing. By the mid-1990s these firms had outgrown those service providers focusing on corporate strategy and organization. While three of the Big Four legally divided the different service lines after the Enron scandal and the ensuing breakdown of Arthur Andersen, they are now back in the consulting business. In 2000, Andersen Consulting broke off from Arthur Andersen and announced their new name Accenture. The name change was effective starting January 1, 2001, and Accenture is currently the largest consulting firm in the world in employee headcount. They are publicly traded on the NYSE with ticker ACN.

The industry stagnated in 2001 before recovering after 2003 and then enjoying a period of sustained double-digit annual revenue growth until the financial crisis of 2007–2008. As financial services and government were two of the largest spenders on consulting services, the financial crash and the resulting public sector austerity drives hit consulting revenues hard. In some markets such as the UK there was a recession in the consulting industry, something which had never happened before or since. There has been a gradual recovery in the consulting industry&#x27;s growth rate in the intervening years, with a current trend towards a clearer segmentation of management consulting firms. In recent years, management consulting firms actively recruit top graduates from Ivy League universities, Rhodes Scholars, and students from top MBA programs.

In more recent times, traditional management consulting firms have had to face increasing challenges from disruptive online marketplaces that are aiming to cater to the increasing number of freelance management consulting professionals.

== Function ==
The functions of consulting services are commonly broken down into eight task categories. Consultants can function as bridges for information and knowledge, and external consultants can provide these bridging services more economically than client firms themselves. Consultants can be engaged proactively, without significant external enforcement, and reactively, with external pressure. Proactive consultant engagement is engaged mainly with aim to find hidden weak spots and improve performance, while the reactive consultant engagement is mostly aimed at solving problems identified by external stakeholders.

Marvin Bower, McKinsey&#x27;s long-term director, has mentioned the benefits of a consultant&#x27;s externality, that they have varied experience outside the client company.

Management consulting could be classified into two categories:
* General management consulting, which concerns strategy, corporate finance, organization, environmental social and corporate governance, risk and compliance, and so forth. It entails questions that are relevant to the entirety of the client organization as a whole, on a management level.
* Specialized management consulting, which concerns questions that are specific to a certain function or subset of the client organization, such as legal management consulting, financial management consulting, digital management consulting, technology management consulting, operations management consulting, and Executive search.

Management consulting often involves a mix of both of these categories. In the modern economic environment, management consulting firms are typically classified under the umbrella term of corporate service providers.

Consultants have specialized skills on tasks that would involve high internal coordination costs for clients, such as organization-wide changes or the implementation of information technology. In addition, because of economies of scale, consultants&#x27; focus on and experience in gathering information across markets and industries enables a higher cost-efficiency than if clients were to perform research themselves.

== Trends ==
=== Big Three management consultancies ===

Three consulting firms are widely regarded as the Big Three or MBB:
*McKinsey &amp; Company
*Boston Consulting Group
*Bain &amp; Company

=== Big Four accounting firms in the management consulting market ===

The Big Four audit firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, Ernst &amp; Young) have been working in the strategy consulting market since 2010. In 2013, Deloitte acquired Monitor Group—now Monitor Deloitte—while PwC acquired PRTM in 2011 and Booz &amp; Company in 2013—now Strategy&amp;. From 2010 to 2013, several Big Four firms have tried to acquire Roland Berger. EY followed the trend, with acquisitions of The Parthenon Group in 2014, and both the BeNeLux and French businesses of OC&amp;C in 2016 and 2017, with all now under the EY-Parthenon brand.

=== Trends ===
In 2013, an article in &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; discussed the prevalent trends within the consulting industry to evolve. The authors noted that with knowledge being democratized and information becoming more and more accessible to anyone, the role of management consultants is rapidly changing. Moreover, with more online platforms that connect business executives to relevant consultants, the role of the traditional &#x27;firm&#x27; is being questioned.

Large management consulting firms and professional networks have adopted a structure of industry-specific branches, with one branch per industry or market segment served. As such, the firms utilize their ability to serve as knowledge brokers within each market segment and industry addressed.

== Nonprofit consultants ==
Some for-profit consulting firms, including McKinsey and BCG, offer consulting services to nonprofits at subsidized rates as a form of corporate social responsibility. Other for-profit firms have spun off nonprofit consulting organizations, e.g. Bain creating Bridgespan.

Many firms outside of the Big Three offer management consulting services to nonprofits, philanthropies, and mission-driven organizations. Some, but not all, are nonprofits themselves.

== Liability ==
As with all client-contractor work, liability depends heavily on the subject of contract terms. While the management consulting service provider for obvious reasons has a business reputation to protect, legally there is little protection for the client. This is due to the scope of the contract being the only thing subject to potential insurance claims as well as lawsuits.

As with other client-contractor relationships, settling for liabilities that exist outside the scope of the contract deliverables has been proven to be of considerable difficulty, also in management consulting. For this reason, it is important that clients procuring management consulting services think twice about what type of help they need, so that the scope, length and content of contract reflects such need.

== Criticism ==

Management consultants are sometimes criticized for the overuse of buzzwords, reliance on and propagation of management fads, and a failure to develop plans that are executable by the client. As stated above, management consulting is an unregulated profession; anyone or any company can style themselves as management consultants. A number of critical books about management consulting argue that the mismatch between management consulting advice and the ability of executives to actually create the change suggested results in substantial damages to existing businesses. In his book, &quot;Flawed Advice and the Management Trap&quot;, Chris Argyris believes that much of the advice given today has real merit. However, a close examination shows that most advice given today contains gaps and inconsistencies that may prevent positive outcomes in the future.

Ichak Adizes and coauthors also criticize the timing of consultant services. Client organizations, which are usually lacking the knowledge they want to obtain from the consultant, cannot correctly estimate the right timing for an engagement of consultants. Consultants are usually engaged too late when problems become visible to the top of the client&#x27;s organizational pyramid. A proactive checkup, like a regular medical checkup, is recommended. On the other side, this opens additional danger for abuse from disreputable practitioners.

== International standards ==
ISO published the international standard ISO 20700 &quot;Guidelines for Management Consultancy Services&quot; on June 1, 2017, replacing EN 16114.

This document represents the first international standard for the management consultancy industry.

== Training and certification ==
An international qualification for a management consulting practitioner is Certified Management Consultant (CMC) available in the United States through the Institute of Management Consultants USA. Additional trainings and courses exist, often as part of an MBA training;

<text>Senior management, executive management, or upper management is an occupation at the highest level of management of an organization, performed by individuals who have the day-to-day tasks of managing the organization, sometimes a company or a corporation.

==Overview== 
Executive managers hold powers delegated to them with and by authority of a board of directors and/or the shareholders. Generally, higher levels of responsibility exist, such as a board of directors and those who own the company (shareholders), but they focus on managing the senior or executive management instead of on the day-to-day activities of the business. The executive management typically consists of the heads of a firm&#x27;s product and/or geographic units and of functional executives such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the chief strategy officer. In project management, senior management authorises the funding of projects.

Senior management are sometimes referred to, within corporations, as executive management, top management, upper management, higher management, or simply seniors.

== Top management ==
A top management is a specific form of which typically consists of some of the top managers in a firm. However, there is no clear definition to what the top management of an organization is. It is put together by the chief executive officer (CEO) to work on a specific task. In working on this task, the generally has a much higher responsibility and considerable autonomy than other types of teams.

Possible tasks include:
* ensuring the organization is effective and successful by taking on responsibility for the implementation of an appropriate strategy that the organization can adapt to,
* effectively managing the demands of stakeholders, 
* giving clear definitions of what constitutes effectiveness and success, 
* ensuring the implementation of the strategy and the targeting of resources towards success,
* reviewing if their actions are relevant to the organization&#x27;s overall goals.
The way top management is put together and work together as a team can greatly differ from other teams. This is mainly based on the fact that top managers have succeeded as individuals which often leads to a focus on functional team objectives rather than to working interdependently on a shared goal. Top management consist of top managers from different functional areas of the firm, so they usually have different areas of expertise. Diversity and heterogeneity in teams can have a positive effect on teamwork. Nevertheless, there are also negative effects which have to be overcome as a team like not valuing different opinions and perspectives. A CEO that models valuing behavior and ensures the team has both a clear purpose and clear objectives can do just that. This also reduces social categorization effects because it leads to team members focusing more on their shared goals than on their differences.

The exchange of information during the working process is as important for top managements as it is for all other kinds of teams. In order to work effectively, the team needs to understand how to communicate, share information, set goals, give feedback, manage conflict, engage in joint planning and task coordination and solve problems collaboratively. The CEO plays a key role in enabling the team to do so. The CEO must take on the responsibility to coach the team and to reflect on their work. In their research in 2005, Simsek and colleagues found that especially a CEO&#x27;s collectivistic orientation has a positive influence on team work behavior. Collectivistic orientation means that the CEO subordinates his or her personal to the group interests and goals, emphasizes sharing and cooperation within the team and enhances task-relevant processes of teamwork like gathering, processing and interpreting strategic information. This in turn enhances a process called behavioral integration which was developed by Hambrick (1994). It describes the degree to which a group, here the top management, engages in mutual and collective interaction.

Hambrick divided this concept into three parts:
# The level of collaborative behavior within the team
# The quantity and quality of exchanged information
# The emphasis on joint decision making

Top managements can face multiple difficulties which mainly derive from their individualistic views and strong opinions. It is therefore of great importance that the team works through these conflicts, creating a climate of safety, keeping their vision and mission in mind and build an appropriate work environment for themselves and the organization.

<doc id="282643" wikidata="Q3042615" url="?curid=282643" title="History of rail transport in Great Britain">
<text>The railway system of Great Britain started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in the 1560s. A patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies developed in the late 18th century. These isolated links expanded during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network, although initially being run by over one hundred competing companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many of these were amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained. The period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters, such as the Railway Inspectorate.

The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War, during which time a number of advantages of amalgamation and central planning were demonstrated. However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network. In 1923, almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the &quot;Big Four&quot;: the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway. The &quot;Big Four&quot; were joint-stock public companies. During the 1920s and 1930s, rising competition from road transport reduced revenues, leading to a lack of investment and thus a period of slow decline. The &quot;Big Four&quot; cooperated closely during the Second World War and continued to run the railway system up until 31 December 1947.

From the start of 1948, the &quot;Big Four&quot; were nationalised to form British Railways. Though there were few initial changes to services, usage increased and the network became profitable. A rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam was enacted under the 1955 Modernisation Plan. However, declining passenger numbers and financial losses in the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted the controversial Beeching cuts, which saw the closure of many branch and main lines alike. High-speed intercity trains were introduced in the 1970s. During the 1980s, severe cuts in rail subsidies and above-inflation increases in fares were enacted, decreasing losses. Following the sectorisation of British Rail, InterCity became profitable.

Between 1994 and 1997, railway operations were privatised, under which the ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services were sold outright. Since privatisation, passenger volumes have increased to their highest ever level, but whether this is due to privatisation is disputed. The Hatfield accident set in motion a series of events that resulted in the ultimate collapse of Railtrack and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company. By 2018, government subsidies to the rail industry in real terms were roughly three times that of the late 1980s, while train fares cost more than under British Rail.

==Before 1830: The pioneers==

A wagonway, essentially a railway powered by animals drawing the cars or wagons, was used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away.

Another wagonway was Sir Francis Willoughby&#x27;s Wollaton Wagonway in Nottinghamshire built between 1603 and 1604 to carry coal.

As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway. Many of these &quot;tramroads&quot; or &quot;wagon ways&quot; were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. The first public railway in the world was the Lake Lock Rail Road, a narrow-gauge railway built near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England.

The early wooden railways were improved on in 1793 when Benjamin Outram constructed a mile-long tramway with L-shaped cast iron rails. These rails became obsolete when William Jessop began to manufacture cast iron rails without guiding ledges – the wheels of the carts had flanges instead. Cast iron is brittle and so the rails tended to break easily. Consequently, in 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling wrought iron rails, which were used from then onwards.
The first passenger-carrying public railway was opened by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway at Oystermouth in 1807, using horse-drawn carriages on an existing tramline.

In 1802, Richard Trevithick designed and built the first (unnamed) steam locomotive to run on smooth rails.

The first commercially successful steam locomotive was &quot;Salamanca&quot;, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the gauge Middleton Railway. Salamanca was a rack and pinion locomotive, with cog wheels driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler.

In 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth designed a locomotive (&quot;Puffing Billy&quot;) for use on the tramway between Stockton and Darlington. &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames which, in turn, drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, George Stephenson improved on that design with his first locomotive &quot;Blücher&quot;, which was the first locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.

That design persuaded the backers of the proposed Stockton and Darlington Railway to appoint Stephenson as Engineer for the line in 1821. While traffic was originally intended to be horse-drawn, Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage. The Act was subsequently amended to allow the usage of steam locomotives and also to allow passengers to be carried on the railway. The 25-mile (40 km) long route opened on 27 September 1825 and, with the aid of Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Locomotion No. 1&quot;, was the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world.

==1830–1922: Early development==

In 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened. Being the world&#x27;s first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have &#x27;scheduled&#x27; services, terminal stations and services as we know them today, it set the pattern for modern railways. The railways carried freight and passengers with also the world&#x27;s first goods terminal station at the Park Lane railway goods station at Liverpool&#x27;s south docks, accessed by the 1.26-mile Wapping Tunnel. In 1836, at the Liverpool end the line was extended to Lime Street station in Liverpool&#x27;s city centre via a 1.1 mile long tunnel.

Many of the first public railways were built as local rail links operated by small private railway companies. With increasing rapidity, more and more lines were built, often with scant regard for their potential for traffic. The 1840s were by far the biggest decade for railway growth. In 1840, when the decade began, railway lines in Britain were few and scattered but, within ten years, a virtually complete network had been laid down and the vast majority of towns and villages had a rail connection and in some cases even two or three. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the pioneering independent railway companies amalgamated or were bought by competitors, until only a handful of larger companies remained (see Railway Mania).

Other nations quickly sought to obtain British expertise in this field to develop their own railways. The British-built &quot;Patentee&quot; class locomotive Le Belge was constructed for the first main line on the European mainland, the Brussels-Mechelen line, while Adler, another &quot;Patentee&quot; class locomotive, hauled the first commercially successful passengers and goods trains in Germany. To several of these customers, Britain&#x27;s pioneering railway industry was associated with power, daringness and rapidity.

The period also saw a steady increase in government involvement, especially in safety matters. The 1840 &quot;Act for Regulating Railways&quot; empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840, to enquire into the causes of accidents and recommend ways of avoiding them. As early as 1844, a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead to the introduction of minimum standards for the construction of carriages and the compulsory provision of 3rd class accommodation for passengers – so-called &quot;Parliamentary trains&quot;.

The railway companies ceased to be profitable after the mid-1870s. Nationalisation of the railways was first proposed by William Ewart Gladstone as early as the 1840s, and calls for nationalisation continued throughout that century, with F. Keddell writing in 1890 that &quot;The only valid ground for maintaining the monopoly would be the proof that the Railway Companies have made a fair and proper use of their great powers, and have conduced to the prosperity of the people. But the exact contrary is the case.&quot; The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War, and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were achieved. However, the Conservative members of the wartime coalition government resisted calls for the formal nationalisation of the railways in 1921.

== 1923–1947: The Big Four ==
On 1 January 1923, almost all the railway companies were grouped into the Big Four: the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway companies. A number of other lines, already operating as joint railways, remained separate from the Big Four; these included the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway and the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The &quot;Big Four&quot; were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.
The competition from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue available to the railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the construction of roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry&#x27;s ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.

Several highpoints and innovations did occur during this period. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the Southern Railway invested heavily into railway electrification; by the end of 1929, the Southern operated over route miles () of third rail electrified track and in that year ran 17.8 million electric train miles. During 1933, the Great Western Railway introduced the first of its diesel-powered railcars, an early move towards the long term future of the passenger trains. On 3 July 1938, the London and North Eastern Railway&#x27;s Class A4 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; set a world speed record of .

During the Second World War, the companies&#x27; managements joined together, effectively operating as one company, to assisting the country&#x27;s war effort. The railway network suffered heavy damage in some areas due to German Luftwaffe bombing, especially in cities such as London and Coventry; 482 locomotives, 13,314 passenger and 16,132 freight vehicles were damaged. This damage put a severe strain on the railways&#x27; resources and a substantial maintenance backlog developed. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail industry into the public sector.

==1948–1994: British Rail==
From the start of 1948, the railways were nationalised to form British Railways (latterly &quot;British Rail&quot;) under the control of the British Transport Commission. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and stations was completed by 1954. Rail revenue fell and, in 1955, the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the hasty introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam in a modernisation plan costing many millions of pounds but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount. This failure to make the railways more profitable through investment led governments of all political persuasions to restrict rail investment to a drip feed and seek economies through cutbacks.

The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s. Dr. Richard Beeching was given the task by the government of re-organising the railways (&quot;the Beeching Axe&quot;). This policy resulted in many branch lines and secondary routes being closed because they were deemed uneconomic; the closure of one-third of all stations, typically serving rural communities, removed much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. The closure of many freight depots that had been used by larger industries such as coal and iron led to much freight transferring to road haulage. The sweeping closures were extremely unpopular with the general public at that time and remain so today.

Passenger levels decreased steadily from the late fifties to late seventies. Passenger services then experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the high-speed InterCity 125 trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-inflation increases in fares, but the service became more cost-effective. Investment was made into the electrification of the East Coast Main Line (ECML) and the InterCity 225 electric high speed train introduced during the late 1980s. In the mid 1980s, British Rail begun to replace its large fleet of first generation DMUs with a new rolling stock, namely the Pacer and Sprinter families.

During 1972, British Rail was reorganised; under sectorisation, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; London &amp; South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; Provincial (renamed Regional Railways in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services. Following sectorisation, InterCity became profitable and one of Britain&#x27;s top 150 companies, operating city centre to city centre travel across the nation from Aberdeen and Inverness in the north to Poole and Penzance in the south.

Between 1994 and 1997, British Rail was privatised by the Conservative government under John Major. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the freight services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer).

== 1995 onwards: Post-privatisation ==


Since privatisation, numbers of passengers have grown rapidly; by 2010 the railways were carrying more passengers than at any time since the 1920s. and by 2014 passenger numbers had expanded to their highest level ever, more than doubling in the 20 years since privatisation. Train fares cost more than under British Rail.

The railways have become significantly safer since privatisation and are now the safest in Europe. However, the public image of rail travel was damaged by some prominent accidents shortly after privatisation. These included the Southall rail crash (where a train with its faulty Automatic Warning System disconnected passed a stop signal), the Ladbroke Grove rail crash (also caused by a train passing a stop signal) and the Hatfield accident (caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks).

Following the Hatfield accident, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The consequential severe operational disruption to the national network and the company&#x27;s spiralling costs set in motion the series of events which resulted in the ultimate collapse of the company and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-dividend company.

Since April 2016, the British railway network has been severely disrupted on many occasions by wide-reaching rail strikes, affecting rail franchises across the country. The industrial action began on Southern services as a dispute over the planned introduction of driver-only operation, and has since expanded to cover many different issues affecting the rail industry; as of February 2018, the majority of the industrial action remains unresolved, with further strikes planned. The COVID-19 pandemic of the early 2020s caused a massive drop in passenger numbers,

As of 2018, government subsidies to the rail industry in real terms were roughly three times that of the late 1980s.

<doc id="282661" wikidata="Q7769607" url="?curid=282661" title="The Topper (comics)">
<text>The Topper was a UK comic published by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd that ran from 7 February 1953 to 15 September 1990, when it merged with &quot;The Beezer&quot;.

A strip named &quot;Mickey the Monkey&quot; originally appeared on the front cover. In 1973, it was replaced by &quot;Send for Kelly&quot;, by &quot;Danny&#x27;s Tranny&quot; in 1975, briefly by &quot;The Whizzers from Oz&quot; in 1979, and again in 1979 by &quot;Tricky Dicky&quot;. &quot;Beryl the Peril&quot; took over on 24 May 1986, and remained there until the merger with &quot;The Beezer&quot;.

Unlike most other comics at the time, which were half tabloid size, the Topper was for many years full tabloid. It changed to A4 in 1980, one year before &quot;The Beezer&quot;.

Two comics were merged into &quot;The Topper&quot; during its run: these were &quot;Buzz&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Sparky&quot; in issue 1276 (16 July 1977). In issue 1260 on 26 March 1977, &quot;Big News&quot; was announced on the front cover redirecting the reader to page 7 of the comic. The announcement was that starting from issue number 1261 the comic would include a &quot;Special Pull-out section&quot; that brought back classic Topper Characters such as Splodge and Big Uggy. These lasted until issue 1276, when the pull out section was used for the Sparky comic, creating the &quot;Special Sparky Pull-Out&quot;. The Sparky Pull out section was continued until the change to the A4 format.

&quot;The Topper&quot; also produced an annual collection, &quot;The Topper Book&quot;.

==Rebrand, closure and reprints==

In the late 1980s and 1990s, with the expansion of children&#x27;s television and video games taking a greater share of children&#x27;s time, sales of comics began to fall. So D. C. Thomson decided to modernise the &quot;Topper&quot;, relaunching it as &quot;Topper &#x27;89&quot; from February 1989.

In September 1990, it was decided to merge the &quot;Topper&quot; with another of D. C. Thomson&#x27;s long-running comics, &quot;The Beezer&quot; and the two comics combined as &quot;Beezer and Topper&quot;. This continued in publication until 1993; it subsequently closed, with a small amount of content from the combined comic subsequently relocating into other D. C. Thomson publications &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;.

Despite the closure of the &quot;Topper&quot; as a standalone title, &quot;The Topper Book&quot; continued as an annual, separate from &quot;The Beezer Book&quot;, until the 1994 annual (published 1993, the year new issues of &quot;Beezer and Topper&quot; ceased).

Vintage stories from the &quot;Topper&quot; appeared alongside stories from other D. C. Thomson publications in Classics from the Comics, a compilation magazine series which ran from 1996 to 2010.

In March 2012, the Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain&#x27;s rich comic book history. The collection featured &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;The Topper&quot;, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Bunty&quot;, &quot;Buster&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Twinkle&quot; and &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

<doc id="282712" wikidata="Q3595598" url="?curid=282712" title="Patrick Nagel">
<text>Patrick Nagel (November 25, 1945 – February 4, 1984) was an American artist and illustrator. He created popular illustrations on board, paper, and canvas, most of which emphasize the female form in a distinctive style, descended from Art Deco and pop art. 

He produced many illustrations for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. His cover for the rock group Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Rio&quot; album has been acclaimed as one of the greatest album covers of all time.

== Early life and education ==
Nagel was born in Dayton, Ohio, on November 25, 1945, but was raised and spent most of his life in the Los Angeles area. After serving in the United States Army with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, Nagel attended the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles in 1969, and in that same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton.

== Career ==
=== Illustration and design ===
In 1971, Nagel worked as a graphic designer for ABC Television, producing graphics for promotions and news broadcasts. The following year, he began work as a freelance artist for major corporations and magazines, including &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, IBM, ITT Corporation, MGM, &quot;Oui&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, United Artists, and Universal Studios.

Nagel produced album covers for recording artists such as Tommy James, Charlene, Thelma Houston and Cissy Houston. 

Nagel&#x27;s 1982 painting for the album cover of rock group Duran Duran&#x27;s hit album &quot;Rio&quot;, designed by Malcolm Garrett, became one of his best known images. The model in Nagel&#x27;s painting has been identified as Marcie Hunt, who featured in a 1981 issue of &quot;Vogue Paris&quot;. A lithograph of the album cover is part of the collection of MoMA.

He worked for many commercial clients, including Intel, Lucky Strike cigarettes, Ballantine&#x27;s Whiskey, and Budweiser.

Nagel contributed to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine between August 1975 and July 1984, with one of his paintings being published in every issue, most notably in the &quot;Playboy Advisor, Playboy Forum&quot; and &quot;Playboy After Hours&quot; columns. This helped to improve his exposure to a wider audience and encouraged the popularity of &quot;the Nagel Woman&quot; image. He created roughly 285 pieces of art work for &quot;Playboy&quot; during his career. In the early part of his time with &quot;Playboy&quot; he was given very specific illustration instructions, but that ended sometime between 1977 and 1978; thereafter, Nagel chose his theme and approach and submitted his work for approval before publication. In 1993, roughly nine years after Nagel&#x27;s death, his widow Jennifer Dumas went into litigation with &quot;Playboy&quot; over the rights to the artwork published in the magazine. See &quot;Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Dumas.&quot;

=== The Nagel woman ===
In 1977, Nagel made his first poster image for Mirage Editions, with whom he printed many images, his most famous being those of &quot;Nagel women&quot;. The &quot;Nagel woman&quot; was developed over time and increased in popularity after Nagel began publishing his work with &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1975. The women were drawn as &quot;Nagel&#x27;s ideal woman&quot;. His female figures tended to have black hair, and bright white skin. Nagel worked with many models, including &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmates Cathy St. George, Tracy Vaccaro and Shannon Tweed, and also painted several celebrity portraits, including those of Joan Collins and Joanna Cassidy.

Nagel’s portraits were created by tracing a photograph of the subject with Nagel usually making edits to hair and clothing to better match his tastes and style. The source material for much of his work was found objects that included fashion magazine spreads and advertisements. In many cases the original model had no idea it was their image that was used. Model Marcie Hunt, whose image Nagel picked from a &quot;Vogue Paris&quot; feature, did not know she was used for the cover of &quot;Rio&quot; until forty-two years later.

There has been much discussion about the inspiration for Nagel&#x27;s style; since little is known about Nagel&#x27;s art background, there is no definite answer to this.

Art historians have speculated that he may have been influenced by Japanese-style art, but there is no specific evidence for that. His mapmaking experiences in Vietnam possibly did more to steer him into high contrast imagery than anything else.

== Death and legacy ==

===Death===
Nagel died February 4, 1984, after participating in a 15-minute celebrity &quot;aerobathon&quot; to raise funds for the American Heart Association in Santa Monica. An autopsy determined his cause of death was a heart attack, and a further autopsy revealed that Nagel had a congenital heart defect that went undetected his entire life. He was survived by his wife, Jennifer Dumas, and his daughter from a previous marriage, Carole Nagel LaVigne. Against his parents&#x27; wishes and through no direction attributable to him, Patrick Nagel was cremated and his ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean.

=== Legacy ===

Nagel&#x27;s works &quot;capture the emotional state of an era: 1980s American desire, collective materialistic aspiration, a &quot;Less than Zero&quot; state of mind&quot;, said Alex Israel, whom Duran Duran hired to create the album art for their 2015 release &quot;Paper Gods&quot;, which visually references Nagel&#x27;s famous &quot;Rio&quot; cover.

=== Art market ===
Nagel prints flooded the market in the 1980s. Nagel&#x27;s manager, Karl Bornstein, president of Mirage Editions Inc., continued publication of Nagel&#x27;s works after his death, including open edition prints and mass-market posters. In addition, in 1991, the FBI discovered and dismantled a counterfeiting ring which flooded the market with forged serigraphs. While this contributed to Nagel&#x27;s cultural ubiquity—Nagel artwork was in a reported two million homes worldwide—it also served to exploit the brand and ultimately, dramatically lowered its value.

By 2019, the market showed signs of a comeback, with one of his original works from 1982 selling for $112,500 at auction, nearly doubling its estimated value, while limited-run silkscreen posters can go for several thousand dollars. Nagel has also had a resurgence in the form of collaborations with mass-market brands. In 2020, fast fashion retailer Forever 21 launched an apparel collection featuring Nagel portraits.

<doc id="282713" wikidata="Q8038189" url="?curid=282713" title="Wright Brothers flights of 1909">
<text>Airplane inventors Wilbur and Orville Wright are famed for making the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flights on 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Lesser-known are other flights of theirs which played an important role at the dawn of aviation history. In 1909 Wilbur was invited by the Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee to make paid exhibition flights to help mark 300 years of New York history, including Henry Hudson discovering Manhattan and Robert Fulton starting a successful commercial steamboat service on the Hudson River. The committee wanted the Wrights to demonstrate flights over the water around New York City. Orville was making flights for customers in Germany, so Wilbur, who had just finished training U.S. Army pilots, accepted the job.

==The flights==
Another acclaimed aviator, Glenn Curtiss, had agreed to participate. Curtiss had recently set the world airspeed record in France, and the Wrights had just filed suit against him for patent infringement of their control systems. The public&#x27;s anticipation was fueled by news of the patent disputes. These flights would be a showdown between the two fliers.

They were both scheduled to make a series of flights from Governors Island in New York harbor. On September 29, Wilbur took off at 9:15 AM in windy conditions. Curtiss felt his airplane could not handle the winds and he declined to fly. When Curtiss admitted defeat to the wind, Wilbur is supposed to have said to him, &#x27;It looks pretty good. I think I will take a little spin in a few minutes.&#x27; He flew for about two miles, which took a little longer than seven minutes.

Later that day Wilbur took off again, at 10:18 AM. He flew over the ocean liner &quot;Lusitania&quot; and a flotilla of other watercraft on hand for the Hudson-Fulton celebration, many blowing their horns and tooting their whistles when the Flyer appeared overhead. As Wilbur flew toward the Statue of Liberty, many onlookers feared he would crash into it, but he skillfully circled the statue as planned. This flight caused a sensation in the press and became an iconic event, despite lasting less than five minutes.

Still unable to fly in the gusty weather, Curtiss had to depart for St. Louis due to a prior agreement. He was supposed to have flown up the Hudson River for several miles and returned to Governors Island.

Wilbur knew that if the engine failed and he had to set down, his skids would bite into the water, throwing him forward into the wires crisscrossing between the forward struts and possibly injuring him. As the wood-and-cloth wings would begin to settle and sink under the weight of the engine, they could drag him down before he could disentangle himself. So when Wilbur arrived on Governors Island, south of Manhattan, on the morning of September 29, he and Charlie Taylor, his mechanic, had made a strange modification to the Flyer: Beneath the lower wing, they had slung a bright red canoe, which Wilbur had purchased a few days earlier from the H&amp;D Folsom Arms Company. A top-of-the-line Indian Girl canoe made by the Rushton Canoe Company, it featured a sturdy 16-foot frame made of northern white cedar, which Rushton claimed was nearly a third lighter than other cedars.

The canoe’s light weight (approximately 60 pounds) and sturdy construction attracted mostly Adirondack hunters and anglers used to portaging around rapids and waterfalls. Wright was drawn not only by these features but also by the canoe’s aerodynamic shape. To reduce drag, Wilbur had removed the Flyer’s second passenger seatback, and for waterproofing had tightly sealed the open canoe top with nailed-down canvas.
In essence, the canoe turned the Flyer into the world’s first floatplane. Wilbur hoped that in the event the engine failed and the airplane ended up in the water, the canoe would keep the aircraft afloat. With luck, as the airplane glided into the water, the canoe might even hold the craft upright. As the airplane floated, the pilot would have time to extricate himself and swim away. The addition of a life vest next to him, which he could don before swimming clear, suggests that Wilbur had characteristically thought the matter through and come up with a contingency plan. 

A blown engine cylinder that afternoon prevented any more flights. This series of flights marked Wilbur&#x27;s last flying before a public audience. 
On Monday, October 4, Wilbur took off at 9:53 AM. He flew north over the Hudson along the west shore of Manhattan, passing Grant&#x27;s Tomb, then returned by the same route, finishing the 21 mile, 33-minute flight with a safe landing on Governor&#x27;s Island. As many as a million people witnessed the flight. This was the exact flight that Curtiss had been unable to make. Before the flight, Wilbur attached a red canoe to the bottom of the airplane as a safety precaution in case of an emergency landing in the water. 
After Wilbur&#x27;s death in 1912, Orville put the canoe in Hawthorn Hill, his estate in Oakwood, Ohio, as a memento. This first airborne canoe was later moved to Carillon Historical Park in Ohio and exhibited in a room adjacent to the Wright Flyer III in Wright Hall.

The flight around the Statue of Liberty was duplicated on May 26, 2003 by the Dayton &#x27;Wright B Flyer, Inc.&#x27; group, with a replica of the Wright airplane as a part of the celebrations of the anniversary of the Wright brothers&#x27; first flight.

<doc id="282726" wikidata="Q3498675" url="?curid=282726" title="Stephen Ward">
<text>Stephen Thomas Ward (19 October 1912 – 3 August 1963) was an English osteopath and artist who was one of the central figures in the 1963 Profumo affair, a British political scandal which brought about the resignation of John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and contributed to the defeat of the Conservative government a year later.

== Outline of events ==

In 1945, Ward began practising osteopathy in London, and rapidly became quite prominent and fashionable, with many distinguished clients. In his spare time he also studied at the Slade School and developed a talent for sketching portraits which provided a profitable sideline. His practice and his art brought considerable social success, and he made many important friends. Among these was Lord Astor, at whose country house, Cliveden, in the summer of 1961, Ward introduced Profumo to a 19-year-old showgirl and night-club model, Christine Keeler. Profumo, who was married to the actress Valerie Hobson, embarked on a brief affair with Keeler. Most of their assignations took place in Ward&#x27;s home in Wimpole Mews.

Ward&#x27;s friendship with the Soviet military attaché Yevgeny Ivanov, known by MI5 to be an intelligence officer, drew him to the attention of British intelligence, who sought to use him in an attempt to secure Ivanov&#x27;s defection. The matter became complicated when, through Ward, Ivanov met Keeler, raising the possibility of a Profumo–Keeler–Ivanov triangle. Profumo ended his relationship with Keeler, which remained largely unsuspected until early in 1963, when the disintegration of Keeler&#x27;s private life brought matters to public and press attention. Profumo denied any impropriety in a statement to the House of Commons but a few weeks later admitted his affair. He resigned from his ministerial office, parliamentary seat and membership in the Privy Council. Amid a range of rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, the police began to investigate Ward. In June 1963, he was charged with prostitution offences and committed for trial.

In the trial, in July 1963, Ward was abandoned by his society friends, and exposed to the contempt and hostility of the prosecuting counsel and judge. Despite the relative paucity of evidence and the dismissal of most of the charges against him, he was convicted on two counts of living off the earnings of prostitution. Before the verdict was announced, Ward took an overdose of sleeping pills and died three days later. In 2014, the trial verdict was put under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, but in 2017, the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal because the original transcript of the judge&#x27;s summing up could not be found.

== Early life ==
Born in Lemsford, Hertfordshire, Stephen Ward was the second son of Arthur Evelyn Ward, Vicar of Lemsford, and Eileen Esmée, the daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors. The Ward family had a military and clerical background; the Vigors family were of Anglo-Irish stock. The explorer Wilfred Thesiger was a cousin; his father, Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger, son of Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, married Eileen&#x27;s elder sister, Kathleen. Stephen&#x27;s siblings were John (b. 1911), Raymond (b. 1916), and twins Bridget and Eileen (b. 1925). In 1920, the family moved to Twickenham, where Arthur Ward served as the vicar of Holy Trinity Church, then in 1922 to Torquay in Devon, when he became the vicar of St. Matthias. Arthur Ward later became a Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and, in 1934, a Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral.

== Education ==
Ward was educated at Canford School, in the village of Canford Magna (near the market town of Wimborne Minster) in Dorset, as a boarder, where he was punished for an assault on a fellow pupil after refusing to name the real culprit. This experience left a longstanding mark. Somewhat lazy and a regular underachiever, Ward had few realistic career choices when he left Canford in 1929.

== Life and career ==
Ward moved to London, where he worked for a few months as a carpet salesman in Houndsditch before an uncle found him a job in Hamburg as a translator in the German branch of Shell Oil. After a year, he left the Hamburg job for Paris and registered for a course at the Sorbonne, while eking out a living as a tour guide. In 1932, he returned briefly to Torquay, before moving again to London where he worked as a tea salesman.

In 1934, he was persuaded by his mother to seek qualification as an osteopath, by studying at the Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery in the United States. He spent four years there, completing a course that qualified him as a general medical practitioner in the US.

Ward was greatly impressed by the United States. He later commented: &quot;I loved America and Americans, a warm-hearted, open and dynamic people. Their kindness and hospitality made me feel ashamed of the standoffish way the British treat people.&quot;

=== Second World War ===
On his return from the United States, Ward set up as an osteopath in Torquay. When war broke out in September 1939, he volunteered for service in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) but was rejected because his American qualifications were not recognised. In 1941, he was conscripted as a private into the Royal Armoured Corps, based at Bovington. His osteopathic skills became known, and, for much of his time at Bovington, he was relieved from general duties and permitted to practise his profession. This arrangement offended the RAMC, and, after an inquiry, Ward&#x27;s activities were stopped. However, in view of his evident talents, he was recommended for a commission in the RAMC within the new category of &quot;stretcher-bearer&quot;. On 19 June 1943, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the non-medical section of the RAMC.

In March 1944, Ward was posted to India. The army still found it difficult to accommodate him, and he spent much time canvassing for the proper recognition of osteopathy while being officially assigned to non-medical duties. However, he found opportunities to practise his skills; among those whom he treated was Mahatma Gandhi, who impressed Ward: &quot;Although much of his policy was opposed to that of my own country. I knew that when I was with him I was in the presence of greatness, and my encounter with him was certainly the most important meeting of my life&quot;. Following a nervous collapse that led to a period in a psychiatric hospital, Ward returned to England in October 1945 and was discharged from the army &quot;on grounds of disability&quot;.

=== Society osteopath ===
After the Second World War, Ward worked for the Osteopathic Association Clinic in Dorset Square, London. While there, he had opportunities to treat well-known public figures, the first of whom was the American ambassador, W. Averell Harriman. Later, Ward treated Winston Churchill&#x27;s son-in-law Duncan Sandys, who recommended Ward to Churchill himself.

Ward now had sufficient status and recommendations to set up his own private practice, in Cavendish Square just off Harley Street. He soon attracted a clientele from the worlds of politics, society, and show business, and his social life became absorbed into this milieu. Ward&#x27;s polished manners and conversational skills assured him social success. He befriended the cartoonist and socialite Arthur Ferrier, whose parties Ward attended regularly and where he mixed with, among others, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, later the Duke of Edinburgh but then a junior officer in the Royal Navy. Ward&#x27;s own parties were noted for their social mix: &quot;a barrister, a barrow-boy, a writer, a motor salesman, a peer, and always, for some reason, a steady stream of pretty girls&quot;.

Ward enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but his relationships were often platonic. His preference was for the type he called &quot;alley-cats&quot;, city girls he could impress and dominate. He generally enjoyed discussing and watching sexual activity rather than participating, a factor which may have contributed to the failure of his marriage, on 27 July 1949, to an actress, Patricia Mary Baines, who came from a prosperous middle-class background.

Throughout the 1950s Ward&#x27;s practice grew. Among his new patients was Lord Astor, who became a close friend and who helped Ward to cement his place in London society. In return, Ward introduced the shy Astor to his own world of nightclubs, parties, and girls. In 1956, for a nominal rent, Astor gave Ward the use of a riverside cottage in the grounds of his Astor family estate at Cliveden, in Buckinghamshire. Many of Ward&#x27;s assorted friends from all walks of life joined him for weekends at the cottage, where from time to time they would be joined by Astor and his guests from the main house. Sometimes Ward and his party would mingle with the gatherings at the main house.

In his spare time, Ward had attended art classes at the Slade school, and subsequently developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960, he was commissioned by &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the royal family, among them Prince Philip and Princess Margaret.

Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Soviet leaders; to help him, one of his patients, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; editor Sir Colin Coote, arranged an introduction to Yevgeny Ivanov, listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy. British Intelligence (MI5) knew from the Soviet double agent Oleg Penkovsky that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet GRU.

Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews and sometimes joined Ward&#x27;s weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.

MI5 considered Ivanov a possible defector and sought Ward&#x27;s help to this end, allocating him to a case officer known as &quot;Woods&quot;. Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a backchannel, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union, and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

== Profumo affair ==
In 1959, Ward met Christine Keeler, a 17-year-old showgirl who was working at Murray&#x27;s Cabaret Club in Beak Street, Soho. She agreed to move in with him, although their relationship was not sexual, merely platonic. She stayed with him, on and off, for the next several years and often spent time at the riverside cottage. During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961, Keeler was among several guests at the cottage with Ward. At the main house, among a large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts, was John Profumo, the Secretary of State for War, and his wife, the actress Valerie Hobson.

On the Saturday evening, Ward&#x27;s and Astor&#x27;s parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Ward introduced Keeler to Profumo, who was greatly attracted to her and promised to keep in touch. Ward later reported to MI5 that Profumo and Ivanov had met, and that Profumo had shown considerable interest in Keeler. This information was an unwelcome complication in MI5&#x27;s plans to use her in a honeytrap operation against Ivanov which might secure his defection.

Keeler and Profumo embarked on a brief affair; some suggest that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. Keeler and Profumo usually met at Ward&#x27;s house in Wimpole Mews. Profumo did not pay Keeler for her time, apart from a few small presents and once, a sum of £20 (equivalent to £455 in 2020) as a gift for her mother. On 9 August 1961, Profumo was warned by Sir Norman Brook, the Cabinet Secretary, of the dangers of mixing with Ward&#x27;s group, since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward&#x27;s dependability. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning &quot;Darling...&quot;, cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association; Keeler insists that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.

The press and public remained largely ignorant of the Keeler-Profumo liaison until early in 1963, when Keeler became a focus of newspaper attention as the &quot;missing witness&quot; in a case involving one of her former lovers, Johnny Edgecombe. At that point Keeler began talking indiscriminately and attempted to sell her story to newspapers. None at this stage dared print it, but rumours of the affair were widespread, and there was much speculation. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: &quot;Mr James Montesi&quot;, &quot;Miss Gaye Funloving&quot;, &quot;Dr Spook&quot;, and &quot;Vladimir Bolokhov&quot;.

In a statement to the House of Commons on 22 March 1963, Profumo denied any impropriety with Keeler. Ward, who knew the truth, at first supported Profumo; however, when he found himself the target of an aggressive police investigation and facing prostitution charges, he revealed his knowledge to Profumo&#x27;s political masters and to the press.

Profumo found the burden of sustaining his lie too much, confessed his guilt, and resigned from government and parliament. Two days after the resignation, amid growing rumours of widespread sex scandals in government and high society, Ward was arrested and charged with several counts of living off the earnings of prostitution and of procuring.

== Trial and death ==
Ward&#x27;s committal proceedings began on 28 June, at Marylebone magistrates&#x27; court, where the Crown&#x27;s evidence was fully reported in the press. Ward was committed for trial at the Old Bailey but was released on bail pending trial. In his account of the trial, which began on 22 July, Richard Davenport-Hines describes it as an act of political revenge: &quot;The exorcism of scandal in high places required the façade of [Ward&#x27;s] conviction on vice charges&quot;. While living with Ward, Keeler and her fellow model Mandy Rice-Davies had made small contributions to household expenses, and had repaid money lent to them by Ward. The thrust of the prosecution&#x27;s case, in which Keeler and Rice-Davies were their principal witnesses, was that these payments indicated that Ward was living off their earnings from prostitution (and was thus a pimp). Ward&#x27;s approximate income, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time (). However, one of the police officers involved in the investigation, Sergeant Arthur Eustace, stated that &quot;Ward had no money in his British bank account&quot; at the time, and that they could find nothing to indicate that he had been living off &quot;immoral earnings&quot;. Despite being a prosecution witness, Rice-Davies &quot;truculently tried to testify [...] on behalf of the defendant&quot; claiming that &quot;you might as well prosecute every bachelor in London.&quot;

The prosecution case looked weak, but Ward&#x27;s perceived image had been tarnished in the committal proceeding. None of his well-known friends offered to speak on his behalf, and MI5 did not reveal the uses they had made of Ward as a channel of communication to the Soviets. The prosecuting counsel, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who adopted a tone of moral outrage, &quot;pronounced words like &#x27;prostitute&#x27;, &#x27;pimp&#x27;, and even &#x27;sexual intercourse&#x27; with obvious distaste&quot;, portrayed Ward as a man who represented &quot;the very depths of lechery and depravity&quot;, and described him as &quot;a thoroughly filthy fellow&quot;, while the judge, Sir Archie Marshall, adopted a similarly hostile attitude. Ward was represented by James Burge, who described Griffith-Jones as somebody who could &quot;make even a honeymoon sound obscene.&quot;

Towards the end of the trial, information relating to another case, in which Keeler had been a leading witness, was revealed by the Court of Appeal. This indicated that Keeler&#x27;s evidence in that earlier case had been false. Marshall did not reveal the salient fact to the Ward trial jury that the reliability of the prosecution&#x27;s chief witness had been compromised, and invited the jury to disregard the appeal court&#x27;s decision. 

On 30 July, Marshall began his summary in a speech which was so damning that Ward despaired. That evening, after writing numerous letters to friends and to the authorities, Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. The next day, Marshall completed his summary and the jury found Ward guilty &quot;in absentia&quot; on the charges of living off the earnings of prostitution, while acquitting him of several other counts. Sentencing was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but he died on 3 August.

On 9 August, a coroner&#x27;s jury ruled Ward&#x27;s death as suicide by barbiturate poisoning. According to reports, Ward left several notes, one of which read, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to disappoint the vulture [...] I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face it&quot;. On the day of the inquest, after a private memorial service at the chapel in St Stephen&#x27;s Hospital, Ward&#x27;s remains were cremated at Mortlake Crematorium. &quot;Though his solicitor had asked that no flowers be sent, there was a wreath of two hundred roses from, among others&quot;, English playwrights John Osborne and Arnold Wesker, theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, writers Angus Wilson and Alan Sillitoe, and musician Acker Bilk, &quot;who later withdrew his name&quot;. &quot;With the flowers came a note: “To Stephen Ward, victim of British hypocrisy.”&quot; Tynan stated that &quot;British society created him, used him, and ruthlessly destroyed him. The Establishment has closed its ranks around its body.&quot;

In their accounts of the security aspects of the Profumo affair, Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril provide extra information concerning Ward&#x27;s last hours, his movements and his visitors. They also quote from an interview with &quot;a former MI6 operative&quot;, who asserted that Ward had been murdered by an agent working on behalf of MI6. The main motive for the killing was Ward&#x27;s ability to embarrass the government and the royal family. The method, apparently, was to encourage Ward to continue to take barbiturates until a fatal dose had been ingested. The reporter Tom Mangold, one of the last to see Ward alive, dismisses the murder theory, while allowing that there are unexplained circumstances relating to Ward&#x27;s death.

== Aftermath ==
The government appointed Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, to investigate the various rumours that had emanated from and around the Profumo affair. Denning&#x27;s report, published on 26 September 1963, concluded that there had been no security leaks nor evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals. He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an &quot;utterly immoral&quot; man whose diplomatic activities were &quot;misconceived and misdirected&quot;.

The Profumo affair had damaged Harold Macmillan&#x27;s government; Macmillan resigned as prime minister in October 1963, citing health reasons. His successor was Lord Home who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the October 1964 general election, the Conservative government was narrowly defeated by the Labour Party and Harold Wilson became prime minister.

Ward&#x27;s role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982, when the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; located his former contact, &quot;Woods&quot;. Keeler, in one of several accounts of her life, denounced Ward as a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, but without providing any evidence.

Many commentators share Davenport-Hines&#x27;s view that Ward was a scapegoat and that his trial was an &quot;historical injustice&quot;, and while not in his text, the emotive term show trial appears as a chapter heading. The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson, who has written a book on the trial, &quot;Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK&quot;, has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summation. Above all, the judge failed to disclose Keeler&#x27;s perjury at an earlier trial, which made her a tainted witness. Robertson has argued that &quot;Ward was obviously not guilty of the two charges on which he was convicted, namely living off the earnings of prostitutes, for the simple reason that Christine and Mandy were not prostitutes and the even simpler reason that they lived off his earnings as a successful osteopath and painter.&quot;

In January 2014, the case, which has been described as &quot;a gross miscarriage of justice&quot;, came under consideration by the Criminal Cases Review Commission but in 2017, the commission decided not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, one factor being the unavailability of a full transcript of the trial. The transcript of Marshall&#x27;s summing up, lodged at the National Archives, has been sealed until the year 2046, &quot;100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses&quot;, since the standard practice &quot;is to refuse access for one hundred years from the birth of the youngest witness in order to ensure that she is dead before revelations are made that could invade her privacy&quot;, although Rice-Davies was in fact born in 1944, not 1946.

== In popular culture ==
During a late 1963 episode of &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, Ward&#x27;s name was included on a list of those who had died during the outgoing year, among Édith Piaf, Jean Cocteau and John F. Kennedy. Referred to as a &quot;black sheep&quot;, Ward&#x27;s name was paired with that of Guy Burgess. In the 1989 film &quot;Scandal&quot;, which is about the Profumo affair, Ward is played by John Hurt. In Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Stephen Ward the Musical&quot;, which opened in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre on 19 December 2013 and closed in 2014, Ward was portrayed by Alexander Hanson. According to Geoffrey Robertson, the script of the musical is &quot;remarkably faithful to the facts&quot;. Ward appeared in the second season of the Netflix drama series &quot;The Crown&quot; in 2017, played by Richard Lintern. In the 2019 BBC television drama series &quot;The Trial of Christine Keeler&quot;, Ward was played by James Norton.

<text>Jollibee is a Filipino chain of fast food restaurants owned by Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) which serves as its flagship brand. Established in 1978 by Tony Tan Caktiong, it is the Philippines&#x27; top fast food restaurant and is among the world&#x27;s fastest growing restaurants, expanding its international presence from 2014 to 2024 almost sixfold. , there were over 1,668 Jollibee fast-food branches across 17 countries, with restaurants in Southeast Asia, East Asia (Hong Kong and Macau), the Middle East, North America, and Europe (including Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom). Jollibee is best known for its bestselling item, the Chickenjoy.

==History==
In 1975, Tony Tan Caktiong and his family opened a Magnolia ice cream parlor in Cubao, Quezon City. The outlet later began offering hot meals and sandwiches. When the food items became more popular than ice cream, the family decided to convert the ice cream parlor into a fast food restaurant, which became the first Jollibee outlet in 1978. Management consultant Manuel C. Lumba advised the family on the change in strategy. Jollibee was initially named &quot;Jolibe&quot;, but changed its name to &quot;Jollibee&quot;.

Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) was incorporated in January 1978. By the end of that year, there were seven Jollibee branches in Metro Manila. The first franchised outlet of Jollibee opened in Santa Cruz, Manila in 1979.

Jollibee experienced rapid growth. The chain was able to withstand the entry of McDonald&#x27;s into the Philippines in 1981 by focusing on the specific tastes of the Filipino market. The first provincial Jollibee outlet opened in Mabalacat.

The first overseas Jollibee opened in Singapore in 1985 at the Katong Shopping Centre; that location closed only a year later (since returned in 2013). In the same year, Jollibee opened branches in the Middle East and Guam. Jollibee continued to expand and set up outlets both within the country and abroad.

Jollibee would expand to North America with its first United States location in Daly City, California.

Jollibee first entered Europe in 2018 with the opening of a branch in Milan, Italy.

==Products==

Jollibee offers American-influenced fast food items and casual Filipino fare. Among the establishment&#x27;s best sellers are the Yumburger, the house hamburger first introduced during their early days of operation; the Chickenjoy, a fried chicken meal, introduced in the 1980s, with regular and spicy versions; and Jolly Spaghetti, a sweet Filipino spaghetti that includes a beef sauce with pieces of hot dog and ham. In 1995, Jollibee introduced the Burger Steak to its menu. At its international locations, Jollibee also offers localized products, such as chili chicken in Vietnam and nasi lemak in Brunei. Jollibee serves Coca-Cola products in Luzon and Visayas and Pepsi products in Mindanao and its overseas markets.

=== Chickenjoy ===
The Chickenjoy is a crispy fried chicken meal. The meal can be ordered with several sides, including rice and gravy, fries, buttered corn, and spaghetti.

=== Yumburger ===

The Yumburger (also spelled as Yum Burger, or Yum!), one of the first products sold by Jollibee, is a hamburger containing a beef patty topped with mayonnaise. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Michael Deacon described the Yumburger as &quot;a slim, floppy, somewhat damp hamburger slathered with a strangely sweet mayo&quot; in his three-star review of a Jollibee location in London.

In 2017, Jollibee introduced the Aloha Yumburger. That same year, an advertising video on YouTube about the Yumburger went viral in the Philippines. A 2019 Yumburger commercial about love on Father&#x27;s Day was the subject of memes. Merchandise depicting the Yumburger was released in 2018 as a collectible toy set with the Jolly Kiddie Meal.

==Ownership and management==
Jollibee is owned by the Jollibee Foods Corporation, which is based in Pasig, Philippines. JFC has operated as a franchisor since 1979. JFC also owns other fast food brands in the Philippines, including Chowking, Greenwich Pizza, Red Ribbon Bakeshop, and Mang Inasal, and it operates Burger King franchises.

==Branch locations==

, Jollibee operated over 1,300 stores, with 1,150 in the Philippines and 234 in foreign markets. Jollibee has locations in Southeast Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, North America, Europe, and Oceania. Outside of the Philippines, Vietnam and the United States are the biggest markets for Jollibee; with 200 outlets in the former as of 2024 and 100 outlets in North America (plus Canada) as of 2024.

Countries and territories with previous presence of Jollibee outlets include Taiwan, mainland China, Indonesia, Northern Mariana Islands and Papua New Guinea.

==Marketing and advertising==
===Customer base===
Outside of the Philippines, Jollibee&#x27;s customer base varies by region. In the Middle East, Jollibee&#x27;s primary market are overseas Filipino workers, while in Vietnam it is the local population. Vietnam has the most franchises outside of the Philippines, with over 100 locations.

===Mascots===

Introduced in 1980, Jollibee is a large anthropomorphic bee mascot dressed in a red blazer, shirt, and chef&#x27;s hat. Jollibee&#x27;s design is based on Mickey Mouse. The mascot was designed to epitomize Filipino optimism. Tony Tan, Jollibee&#x27;s founder, has compared the mascot&#x27;s character to the Filipino working class, stating that the bee &quot;hops around and produces sweet things for life, and is happy even though it is busy&quot;. Jollibee developed additional mascots, some of which were featured in &quot;Jollitown&quot;, a children&#x27;s show aired in the Philippines.

===Mass media===
====Television series====

On April 13, 2008, Jollibee premiered &quot;Jollitown&quot;, a children&#x27;s television show. The premiere was timed to coincide with Jollibee&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The show featured several characters, including Jollibee, Yum the scientist, Twirlie the star performer, Hetty the cheerleader, and Popo the gym coach. The show aired aired Sundays at 9:30 a.m. on GMA Network. On July 17, 2011, &quot;Jollitown&quot; moved to ABS-CBN for its fourth and fifth seasons, airing Sundays at 9:00 a.m. On July 20, 2013, the show moved back to GMA Network for its sixth season until it ended on October 12.

<doc id="282746" wikidata="Q236842" url="?curid=282746" title="Kelly Preston">
<text>Kelly Kamalelehua Smith (October 13, 1962 – July 12, 2020), known professionally as Kelly Preston, was an American actress. She appeared in more than 60 television and film productions, including &quot;Mischief&quot; (1985), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988), &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), and &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; (1999). She married John Travolta in 1991, and collaborated with him on the comedy film &quot;The Experts&quot; (1989) and the biographical film &quot;Gotti&quot; (2018). She also starred in the films &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; (2003), &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (2003), &quot;Sky High&quot; (2005), and &quot;Old Dogs&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Kelly Kamalelehua Smith (the middle name &quot;Kamalelehua&quot; means &quot;garden of lehuas&quot; in Hawaiian) was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. Her mother, Linda, was an administrator of a mental health center. Her father, who worked for an agricultural firm, drowned when she was four years old. Her mother subsequently married Peter Palzis, a personnel director. He adopted her, and she used his name at the start of her acting career. She also had a younger half-brother, Chris Palzis.

As a child, she lived in Iraq, and also Australia, where she attended Pembroke School, Adelaide. She then attended Punahou School in Honolulu, graduating in 1980, and studied drama and theater at the University of Southern California.

==Career==
While living in Australia, she was discovered at age 16 by a fashion photographer who helped her get work in commercials and other small parts. He arranged her first film audition for the role of Emmeline in &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1980), which she lost to the younger Brooke Shields. At that time she changed her last name to Preston.

Her first prominent film roles came in 1985—first as Marilyn McCauley in the romantic teen flick comedy &quot;Mischief&quot;; then as the beautiful but shallow Deborah Ann Fimple in another teen romantic comedy, &quot;Secret Admirer&quot;. Her other roles included &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), &quot;Twins&quot; (1988) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, Avery Bishop in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996) with Tom Cruise, Jane Aubrey in &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; with Kevin Costner and Kate Newell, and in &quot;Holy Man&quot; (1998) with Eddie Murphy and Jeff Goldblum. In 1997, she starred in &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, which co-starred Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence. She also starred in the movie &quot;Jack Frost&quot; (1998).

She played the girlfriend of her husband John Travolta&#x27;s character Terl in the film &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, for which she received &quot;Worst Supporting Actress&quot; at the 21st Golden Raspberry Awards. She appeared as the protagonist&#x27;s flying, superhero mother in the film &quot;Sky High&quot; (2005).

In 2004, she was in the Maroon 5 music video &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot;, which featured a love triangle and romantic scenes between her and Maroon 5 front man Adam Levine. She appeared in the crime thriller &quot;Death Sentence&quot; (2007), in which she played Helen Hume, the wife of Kevin Bacon&#x27;s character Nick. In 2008, she was cast in a television pilot called &quot;Suburban Shootout&quot;, and had a short term recurring role in &quot;Medium&quot;.

She starred in the Lifetime television film &quot;The Tenth Circle&quot; (2008), directed by Peter Markle. It was shot in Nova Scotia and featured Ron Eldard, Britt Robertson, Michael Riley, Jamie Johnston and Geordie Brown.

She was a spokeswoman for Neutrogena, appearing in its print and television ads.

Her final red carpet appearance came at the New York City premiere of her husband&#x27;s motion picture &quot;Gotti&quot; in 2018.

Her final film role was in the comedy-drama &quot;Off the Rails&quot;, which was released in late July 2021 in the UK.

==Personal life==
Preston was married to actor Kevin Gage from 1985 until their divorce in 1987. She also had a relationship with George Clooney in the late 1980s.

Preston was briefly engaged to Charlie Sheen in 1990, but ended the relationship shortly after an accidental gun discharge left shrapnel in her body. In a 2011 interview with TMZ, Preston said that Sheen did not shoot her.

Preston met John Travolta in 1987 while filming &quot;The Experts&quot;. They married in 1991, traveling to Paris on an Air France Concorde for a wedding ceremony at the Hotel de Crillon (on the Place de la Concorde) on September 5, 1991. However, a second ceremony was required because the first, performed by a French Scientology minister (both Preston and Travolta were Scientologists), was considered invalid. The second ceremony took place on September 12, 1991, in Daytona Beach, Florida. Preston and Travolta had three children: son Jett, daughter Ella Bleu, and a second son, Benjamin. Preston remained a Scientologist until her death.

===Death of Jett Travolta===
Preston&#x27;s son Jett Travolta was described as suffering from Kawasaki disease as an infant and had a history of seizures. In 2003, Preston appeared on &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; to promote L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s Purification Rundown, which she credited with helping her son.

On January 2, 2009, Jett Travolta died at the age of 16 while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas. His death was attributed to a seizure. 

On January 23, 2009, three people were arrested in the Bahamas in connection with a multimillion-dollar extortion plot against Travolta and Preston concerning the circumstances of their son&#x27;s death. One of the men, Obie Wilchcombe, a member of the Bahamian Parliament and former Bahamian Minister of Tourism, was described as a &quot;close friend&quot; of Travolta and Preston. Two others allegedly involved were an EMT named Tarino Lightbourne and a Bahamian senator named Pleasant Bridgewater. Bridgewater was charged with abetment to extort and conspiracy to extort and resigned from the Senate as a result of the allegations. Travolta and Preston confirmed longstanding speculations when they testified that their son had autism and suffered regular seizures. The first trial ended in a mistrial.

After a second jury had been selected, the Travoltas elected to drop the case and all charges against the defendants were dismissed.

==Death==
On July 12, 2020, Preston died at the age of 57 at her home in Clearwater, Florida, two years after she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her diagnosis was not widely publicized. Preston had been receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston; she had also been treated at other medical centers. Her death was announced in an Instagram post under an account belonging to John Travolta and Ella Bleu.

<text>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is an independent agency of the United States federal government that offers support and funding for projects exhibiting artistic excellence. It was created in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government by an act of the U.S. Congress, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 29, 1965 (20 U.S.C. 951). It is a sub-agency of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, along with the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

The NEA has its offices in Washington, D.C. It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1995, as well as the Special Tony Award in 2016. In 1985, the NEA won an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its work with the American Film Institute in the identification, acquisition, restoration and preservation of historic films. In 2016 and again in 2017, the National Endowment for the Arts received Emmy nominations from the Television Academy in the Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series category.

==History and purpose==
The National Endowment for the Arts was created during the term of President Lyndon B. Johnson under the general auspices of the Great Society. According to historian Karen Patricia Heath, &quot;Johnson personally was not much interested in the acquisition of knowledge, cultural or otherwise, for its own sake, nor did he have time for art appreciation or meeting with artists.&quot;

The NEA is &quot;dedicated to supporting excellence in the arts, both new and established; bringing the arts to all Americans; and providing leadership in arts education&quot;.
==Leadership and initiatives==

===Governance===
The NEA is governed by a chairman nominated by the president to a four-year term and subject to congressional confirmation. The NEA&#x27;s advisory committee, the National Council on the Arts, advises the chairman on policies and programs, as well as reviewing grant applications, fundraising guidelines, and leadership initiative.

===National Council on the Arts===
The council is composed of 25 members, 18 appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate, six &quot;ex officio&quot; members, and the chairperson of the NEA, who also serves as chair of the council. The six &quot;ex officio&quot; members are members of Congress, where two are appointed by the Speaker of the House, one by the Minority Leader of the House, two by the Majority Leader of the Senate, and one by the Minority Leader of the Senate. These six serve two-year terms, and serve as nonvoting members of the council.

The eighteen appointed by the President are selected from among private citizens of the United States who are widely recognized for their broad knowledge of, or expertise in, or for their profound interest in the arts; and have established records of distinguished service, or achieved eminence, in the arts; so as to include practicing artists, civic cultural leaders, members of the museum profession, and others who are professionally engaged in the arts; and so as collectively to provide an appropriate distribution of membership among major art fields and interested citizens groups. In making these appointments, the President shall give due regard to equitable representation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities who are involved in the arts and shall make such appointments so as to represent equitably all geographical areas in the United States. These are appointed to serve terms of six years. The terms are staggered so three terms end September 3 each year. These members are not eligible for reappointment during the two-year period following the expiration of their term. However, they may continue to serve on the council after their term&#x27;s expiration until a successor takes office.

Ten members of the council constitutes a quorum.

===Current council members===
The current council members :
===Nominations===
President Biden has nominated the following to fill seats on the commission. They await Senate confirmation.
===Budget and grants===
Between 1965 and 2008, the agency has made in excess of 128,000 grants, totaling more than $5 billion. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Congress granted the NEA an annual funding of between $160 and $180 million. In 1996, Congress cut the NEA funding to $99.5 million as a result of pressure from conservative groups, including the American Family Association, who criticized the agency for using tax dollars to fund highly controversial artists such as Barbara DeGenevieve, Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the performance artists known as the &quot;NEA Four&quot;. Since 1996, the NEA has partially rebounded with a 2015 budget of $146.21 million. In FY 2010, the NEA&#x27;s budget reached mid-1990s levels with a $167.5 million budget but fell again in FY 2011 with a budget of $154 million. On March 11, 2024, President Joe Biden released the President&#x27;s Budget for FY 2025, with $210.1 million budgeted for the NEA.

===Grantmaking===
The NEA provides grants in the categories of arts projects, national initiatives, and partnership agreements. Grants for arts projects support exemplary projects for artist communities, arts education, dance, design, folk and traditional arts, literature, local arts agencies, media arts, museums, music, musical theater, opera, presenting (including multidisciplinary art forms), theater, and visual arts.
The NEA also grants individual fellowships in literature to creative writers and translators of exceptional talent in the areas of prose and poetry.

The NEA offers partnerships for state, regional, federal, international activities, and design. The state arts agencies and regional arts organizations are the NEA&#x27;s primary partners in serving the American people through the arts. Forty percent of all NEA funding goes to the state arts agencies and regional arts organizations. Additionally, the NEA awards three Lifetime Honors: NEA National Heritage Fellowships to master folk and traditional artists, NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships to jazz musicians and advocates, and NEA Opera Honors to individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to opera in the United States. The NEA also manages the National Medal of Arts, awarded annually by the President.

===Relative scope of funding===
Artist William Powhida has noted that &quot;in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christie&#x27;s in New York.&quot; He further commented: &quot;If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights.&quot;

===Lifetime honors===
The NEA is the federal agency responsible for recognizing outstanding achievement in the arts. It does this by awarding three lifetime achievement awards. The NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships are awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the art of jazz. The NEA National Heritage Fellowships are awarded for artistic excellence and accomplishments for American&#x27;s folk and traditional arts. The National Medal of Arts is awarded by the President of the United States and NEA for outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States.

==Controversy==

===1981 attempts to abolish===
Upon entering office in 1981, the incoming Ronald Reagan administration intended to push Congress to abolish the NEA completely over a three-year period. Reagan&#x27;s first director of the Office of Management and Budget, David A. Stockman, thought the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities were &quot;good [departments] to simply bring to a halt because they went too far, and they would be easy to defeat.&quot; Another proposal would have halved the arts endowment budget. However, these plans were abandoned when the President&#x27;s special task force on the arts and humanities, which included close Reagan allies such as conservatives Charlton Heston and Joseph Coors, discovered &quot;the needs involved and benefits of past assistance,&quot; concluding that continued federal support was important. Frank Hodsoll became the chairman of the NEA in 1981, and while the department&#x27;s budget decreased from $158.8 million in 1981 to $143.5 million, by 1989 it was $169.1 million, the highest it had ever been.

===1989 objections===
In 1989, Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association held a press conference attacking what he called &quot;anti-Christian bigotry,&quot; in an exhibition by photographer Andres Serrano. The work at the center of the controversy was &quot;Piss Christ&quot;, a photo of a plastic crucifix submerged in a vial of an amber fluid described by the artist as his own urine. Republican Senators Jesse Helms and Al D&#x27;Amato began to rally against the NEA, and expanded the attack to include other artists. Prominent conservative Christian figures including Pat Robertson of the &quot;700 Club&quot; and Pat Buchanan joined the attacks. Republican representative Dick Armey, an opponent of federal arts funding, began to attack a planned exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe at the Corcoran Museum of Art that was to receive NEA support.

On June 12, 1989, The Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, saying that it did not want to &quot;adversely affect the NEA&#x27;s congressional appropriations.&quot; The Washington Project for the Arts later hosted the Mapplethorpe show. The cancellation was highly criticized and in September 1989, the Director of the Corcoran gallery, Christina Orr-Cahill, issued a formal statement of apology saying, &quot;The Corcoran Gallery of Art in attempting to defuse the NEA funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight, has instead found itself in the center of controversy. By withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition, we, the board of trustees and the director, have inadvertently offended many members of the arts community which we deeply regret. Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom of expression.&quot;

Democratic representative Pat Williams, chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the NEA reauthorization, partnered with Republican Tom Coleman to formulate a compromise bill to save the Endowment. The Williams-Coleman substitute increased funding to states arts councils for new programs to expand access to the arts in rural and inner city areas, leave the obscenity determination to the courts, and altered the composition of the review panels to increase diversity of representation and eradicate the possibility of conflicts of interest. After fierce debate, the language embodied in the Williams-Coleman substitute prevailed and subsequently became law.

Though this controversy inspired congressional debate about appropriations to the NEA, including proposed restrictions on the content of NEA-supported work and their grantmaking guidelines, efforts to defund the NEA failed.

===1990 performance artists vetoed===
Conservative media continued to attack individual artists whose NEA-supported work was deemed controversial. The &quot;NEA Four&quot;, Karen Finley, Tim Miller, John Fleck, and Holly Hughes, were performance artists whose proposed grants from the United States government&#x27;s National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) were vetoed by John Frohnmayer in June 1990. Grants were overtly vetoed on the basis of subject matter after the artists had successfully passed through a peer review process. The artists won their case in court in 1993 and were awarded amounts equal to the grant money in question, though the case would make its way to the United States Supreme Court in &quot;National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley&quot;. The case centered on subsection (d)(1) of which provides that the NEA Chairperson shall ensure that artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged. The court ruled in , that Section 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles.

===1995–1997 congressional attacks===
The 1994 midterm elections cleared the way for House Speaker Newt Gingrich to lead a renewed attack on the NEA. Gingrich had called for the NEA to be eliminated along with the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. While some in Congress attacked the funding of controversial artists, others argued the endowment was wasteful and elitist. However, despite massive budget cutbacks and the end of grants to individual artists, Gingrich ultimately failed in his push to eliminate the endowment.

===2017-18 proposed defunding===
The budget outline submitted by then-president Donald Trump on March 16, 2017, to Congress would have eliminated all funding for the program. Congress approved a budget that retained NEA funding. The White House budget proposed for fiscal year 2018 again called for elimination of funding, but Congress retained the funding for another year.

===2025 Trump administration restrictions===
In 2025, the NEA imposed restrictions on federal grant applications to comply with President Trump&#x27;s executive orders 14151 and 14168, barring federal funds for programs focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or used to &quot;promote gender ideology&quot;. In response, over 400 artists submitted a letter asking the NEA to reverse these changes.

=== Nancy Hanks (1969–77) ===
Nancy Hanks, the second chairman, was appointed by President Richard Nixon, continuing her service under Gerald Ford. During her eight-year tenure, the NEA&#x27;s funding increased from $8 million to $114 million.

According to Elaine A. King:
:Nancy Hanks perhaps was able to accomplish her mission because she functioned as a benevolent art dictator rather than mucking with multiple agendas and political red-tape. From 1969 through 1977, under Hanks&#x27; administration, the Arts Endowment functioned like a fine piece of oiled machinery. Hanks continuously obtained the requested essential appropriations from Congress because of her genius in implementing the power of the lobby system. Although she had not had direct administrative experience in the federal government, some people were skeptical at the beginning of her term. Those in doubt underestimated her bureaucratic astuteness and her ability to direct this complex cultural office. Richard Nixon&#x27;s early endorsement of the arts benefited the Arts Endowment in several ways. The budget for the Arts Endowment not only increased but more federal funding became available for numerous programs within the agency.

<text>West Zealand County () is a former county (Danish: &quot;amt&quot;) in the west-central part of the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The county was formed on 1 April 1970, comprising a few former counties. The county was abolished effective January 1, 2007, when it merged into Region Sjælland (i.e. &quot;Region Zealand&quot;).

The county was responsible for public hospitals, upper secondary schools and schools for Higher Preparatory Examination, public transport and social welfare for the disabled.

The County Hall was located in the town of Sorø, and became the seat of the new region. Sorø is by no means the biggest city in West Zealand, but it has great historical value. It is famed for the Sorø Academy (Danish, &quot;Sorø Akademi&quot;), an educational institution built in 1140 together with the church where Queen Margaret I of Denmark was buried (later moved to Roskilde Domkirke, Roskilde).

Many people who live in West Zealand commute to the greater metropolitan area of Copenhagen for work.

<text>Ringsted is a city located centrally in the Danish island of Zealand. It is the seat of a municipality of the same name.

Ringsted is situated approximately from Copenhagen.

==History==
Ringsted was the site of &quot;Sjællands Landsting&quot; (lit. &quot;Zealand&#x27;s county thing&quot;) during the Middle Ages, which in 1584 moved to St. Bendt&#x27;s church and became known as &quot;Sjællandsfar Landsting&quot;. In 1805 it moved to Copenhagen and was renamed Østre Landsret, and is still active under this name.

In 1131, Canute Lavard was killed in Haraldsted forest, leading to outbreaks of civil war.

The church was consecrated in 1170. In front of the church is the spacious town square leading to the shopping streets with shops and boutiques.

The town arms goes back to 1421. There has been much discussion about what it portrays. The traditional answer is at the top the hand of God and under that Virgin Mary with Jesus surrounded by three figures that worship her. The city officially interprets the three figures as Saint Canute Lavard, King Eric Plovpenning, and Saint Benedict of Nursia.

==Tourism==
* Danish Tramway Museum of Skjoldenæsholm, near Jystrup.
* St. Bendt&#x27;s Church — a Romanesque, former Benedictine, abbey church containing numerous tombs of medieval Danish royalty.

Ringsted features two shopping centers named RingStedet and Ringsted Outlet Center. Ringsted Outlet Center consists of 48 flagship outlets and 2 restaurants. Ringsted also has a wide selection of cafes and restaurants, as well as two local breweries (Dagmarbryggeriet in Ringsted town and Det lille Bryggeri in Bringstrup) .

During the summer months, a mobile tourist office is opened in the town square.

Ringsted was previously home to Santa World, a tourist attraction featuring hundreds of animatronic Christmas elves, which later became Fantasy World.

==Transportation==
Ringsted is one of Denmark&#x27;s busiest transit cities. The city is located in the very middle of the island of Zealand, connecting both the southern parts of Zealand as well as Funen and Jutland with the Copenhagen metropolitan area.

===Rail===

Ringsted is served by Ringsted railway station, which is located in the centre of the town, on the southern edge of the historic town centre, and immediately adjacent to the Ringsted bus station. It is an important railway junction, located where the Copenhagen–Fredericia, Copenhagen–Ringsted and South Line railway lines meet. The station offers frequent direct InterCity services to Copenhagen, Odense, Aarhus, Aalborg, and Esbjerg as well as regional train services to Næstved and Elsinore.

<text>Terentianus, surnamed Maurus (a native of Mauretania), was a Latin grammarian and writer on prosody who flourished probably at the end of the 2nd century AD.

His references to Septimius Serenus and Alphius Avitus, who belonged to the school of &quot;new poets&quot; (&quot;poetae neoterici&quot; or &quot;novelli&quot;) of the reign of Hadrian and later, seem to show that he was a near contemporary of those writers. He was the author of a treatise (incomplete) in four books (written in a variety of metres), on letters, syllables, feet and metres, of which considerable use was made by later writers on similar subjects. The most important part of it is that which deals with metres, based on the work of Caesius Bassus, the friend of Persius.

By some authorities Terentianus has been identified with the prefect of Syene mentioned in Martial (i. 86), which would make his date about a century earlier; others, again, who placed Petronius at the end of the 3rd century (a date no longer held), assigned Terentianus to the same period, from his frequent references to that author.

<text>Lionel John Kearns (born February 16, 1937) is a writer, educator, philosopher and polyartist, known for his innovative literary forms, and his contributions to the field of digital 
poetics. He is recognized as an early and significant poet in the history of Canadian avant-garde literature.

==Early life and education==

Kearns was born in Nelson, British Columbia, Canada. His parents were Dorothy Welch and Charles Francis Kearns, WW I aviator, short story writer, and conservationist. During WW II the family moved to the town of MacLeod, Alberta (now called Fort Macleod), where his father was a flying instructor in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). After the war the family returned to Nelson, where Kearns spent the next ten years as an active student, athlete (baseball &amp; hockey), and musician (bagpipes and saxophone). This period of his life was also marked by frequent trips with his father on foot and horseback through the natural wilderness of south-east British Columbia. These early activities and experiences are frequent subjects of Kearns&#x27; literary works.

In 1955 Kearns moved to Vancouver and enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where he began his language and media studies, and associated with a group of young writers that included George Bowering, Frank Davey and Fred Wah. Kearns was one of the originators of the influential poetry magazine, Tish.
Over the nine years that he was a student, graduate student, and instructor at UBC, his principal mentors were Earle Birney, Warren Tallman, and Ronald Baker, who introduced him to the works of Marshall McLuhan and Noam Chomsky.

In 1964, after graduating with an M.A. in Literature and Creative Writing from UBC, Kearns won a Commonwealth Scholarship to study Linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at London University. In England, he was an active participant in the British Poetry Revival, and came under the influence of Bob Cobbing, Dom Sylvester Houédard and various members of the Concrete Poetry movement. He also spent six weeks as a production assistant on the set of Peter Watkins&#x27; controversial BBC film, The War Game (1966), which dealt with nuclear war, and its devastating effects on life and civil order in Britain.

==Career==
In 1966, after a year of field work on the island of Trinidad, Kearns returned to Canada to take a position in the English Department at the newly established Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, where he taught for the next twenty years, with the exception of 1982-83, when he was the &quot;Writer in Residence &quot; at Concordia University in Montreal.

Kearns&#x27; early publications were mostly based in print. His books, such as &quot;By the Light of the Silvery McLune: Media Parables, Poems, Signs, Gestures, and Other Assaults on the Interface&quot; (1969), and &quot;Convergences&quot; (1984), reflected his focus on language and his novel approaches to literary presentation. In later years, he embraced newly developing technologies and applications, which allowed him to combine graphics, hyperlinked text, audio, and video. His work, which blurred the line between traditional forms and digital media, made him a pioneer in the widening field of electronic literature. He is a key figure in the evolution of poetry in the digital age.

Kearns first published book, &quot;Songs of Circumstance&quot; (1963) presented a study of variable meter in oral poetry, focusing on breath groups that exist in emotionally textured speech. The book proposed a new type of page notation for poems, called &quot;Stacked Verse&quot;, which featured a vertical line called a &quot;stress axis&quot; running through the prominent syllable of each &quot;stacked-foot&quot; of an utterance. Kearns used a set of his own poems to illustrate the system. Although he eventually abandoned this notation as impractical, given the constraints of typesetting at that time, &quot;Stacked-Verse&quot; was discussed in a variety of literary publications, drawing international attention to his early work. In 1964, the American Beat writer, Jack Kerouac, wrote, &quot;Lionel Kearns is brilliant, that&#x27;s mah opinion!&quot; 

In 1965, while studying generative linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London University, Kearns produced his best known and most durable work, &quot;The Birth of God &quot; mandala, now called &quot;Birth of God / uniVers &quot;, or &quot;BoG/uVr&quot;. Consisting of a zero made of ones encircling a one made of zeros, it is a simple algorithm that generates any number of distinct physical iterations. &quot;BoG/uVr&quot;, with its binary display of 1s and 0s, has been credited as the icon that announced in the Digital Age. It stands today as one of the earliest examples of digital art.

At Simon Fraser University, where he taught between 1966 and 1986, a period before the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web, Kearns set up electronic seminars for his students, using computer bulletin boards and available terminals connected to the university&#x27;s single primitive mainframe computer, which he also used to write, edit, and format his widely discussed work, &quot;Convergences&quot;, a book-length meditation on a 1778 incident at Nootka Sound, when Captain Cook and the crew members of his two ships mingled for an unprecedented month of historical social interaction. &quot;Convergences&quot;, with its unique page layout and extra-linear structure, has been described as hardcopy-hypertext, a unique post-modern glimpse of the colonial process, and Kearns&#x27; most important work.

After retiring from Simon Fraser University in 1986, Kearns taught a pre-internet online graduate course entitled, &quot;The Cybernetics of Poetry&quot;, for ConnectEd, the distance education facility of the New School for Social Research in New York City. In 1988 he became the first Writer-in-Electronic Residence, helping Trevor Owen establish the WIER project, an on-line creative writing program for school students that flourished across Canada for more than twenty years. When Apple&#x27;s HyperCard application became available, Kearns used it to construct interactive poems, later transposing them into Flash documents that ran on the Web. Kearns displayed his digital creations, including a colorful updated version of Convergences, on his own website, which is available on the Wayback Machine internet archive.

==Philosophy==
Kearns has claimed that the purpose of poetry is to stimulate consciousness, waking us up to the fact that we are still here, alive, and free to act. The poet&#x27;s job is to trick language into truth. Beneath the humor, irony, and sense of wonder that rises to the surface in much of his work, there lurks a layer of serious intellectual interrogation and philosophical statement. The fact that many of his digital works have now disappeared as a result of media obsolescence, parallels his acceptance of the transience of experience and the mutability of life. Presence and absence, like life and death or 1 and 0, are the interdependent binary opposites that straddle Being. Kearns’ major concerns remain: time, language, intelligence, and existence.

From 1989 to 1992, the Orioles&#x27; Double-A affiliate was located in Hagerstown, Maryland and called the Suns. When Major League Baseball added two teams in 1993, bids were offered for two new Triple-A franchises, and the Maryland Baseball Limited Partnership (which owned the Suns and also the Advanced-A Frederick Keys) got into the running to put one of the new franchises in central Maryland. Although their bid fell short, the idea of having a team in Bowie was so well-received that the MBLP decided to move the Double-A team across the state from Hagerstown. The Suns, meanwhile, were dropped to Low-A status.

A contest was held among the community to choose a new name for the team, and over 3,500 suggestions poured in. &quot;Baysox&quot; was chosen over the other finalists, which were &quot;BayBirds&quot; and &quot;Nationals&quot; (the latter was chosen for the nearby Washington major-league team when it moved to the area in 2005). The &quot;Bay&quot; references are to the Chesapeake Bay, which lies less than 20 miles to the east of Bowie.
A complex land deal hindered completion of the stadium, and in their inaugural season in 1993, the Baysox were forced to find an alternate site to play their home games. Eventually, a deal was reached that gave them Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, which had been vacated a year earlier when the Orioles moved into Camden Yards. A harsh winter prevented the new stadium from being completed in time for the beginning of the 1994 season, and the Baysox played 31 games that year at four other ballparks, including the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy. Finally, the Baysox moved into their permanent home on June 16, 1994.

After two losing seasons, the Baysox made it back to the playoffs in 1997, and were also named the top double-A franchise in America, in part because of their tremendous attendance figures despite their proximity to the Baltimore major-league market. Also in 1997 (June 28), the team introduced &quot;Louie&quot;, its green furry mascot with pink hair and long snout, but unknown species. It is believed his design is modeled off of Chessie due to the team&#x27;s name referencing the Chesapeake Bay. He continues to serve as mayor of &quot;Louieville, Maryland&quot;, a play on the real city of Louisville, Kentucky, and also a rhyme to the team&#x27;s home of Bowie.

The Baysox hosted the Double-A All-Star Game on July 12, 2000, bringing players from not only the Eastern League, but also the Southern and Texas leagues to Bowie. During that season, the Baysox also got a new owner, as the Maryland Baseball Partnership sold the team (along with the Frederick Keys and Delmarva Shorebirds) to the Comcast cable network.

The Baysox were again sold in October 2006 by Comcast Spectacor to Maryland Baseball Holding, LLC. A group headed by Ken Young, who is president of Ovations Food Service and also the owner of the Norfolk Tides, the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles and the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Triple-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies.

The Baysox went six straight seasons (1998–2003) without posting a winning record. In 2005, the team was in contention for the last playoff spot at the end of the season, but lost four straight games to Altoona on the final weekend to just miss the postseason once again. They won their first regular-season division championship in 2008, but lost to the Akron Aeros 3-1 in the Division Series.

The Baysox captured its first Eastern League Championship in 2015 with a 3–2 series victory over the Reading Fightin Phils. Its 79–63 regular season finish earned the ballclub its second-ever division title by five games over Altoona. The 3–1 Divisional Series win over the Curve sent Bowie to its first championship series in six attempts. One of the team&#x27;s stars was Trey Mancini, who hit .359 for the season but fell 29 plate appearances short of the 384 needed to qualify for the league batting title due to his having been promoted to the team in June.

After a 19–35 start, the 2019 Baysox won 11 of 14 matches to conclude the first half in fourth place at 30–38. The momentum propelled them to a 46–26 record and the EL Western Division second-half title. Buck Britton was rewarded for the turnaround by being named EL Manager of the Year. The Baysox won the Western Division over the Harrisburg Senators but lost the Championship Series to the Trenton Thunder, with both postseason series finishing 3–1.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Baysox were organized into the Double-A Northeast.

In 2021, The Baysox finished second in the Double-A Northeast League with a 73–47 record. This qualified them for the Double-A Northeast finals against the Akron RubberDucks. It was the third time Bowie has qualified for the playoffs in their history, and the third time since 2015. They lost the best-of-five series versus Akron, 3–0. Grayson Rodriguez was selected as the 2021 Double-A Northeast Pitcher of the Year and Adley Rutschman as the league&#x27;s Top MLB Prospect.

The Baysox were purchased from Maryland Baseball Holding, LLC by Attain Sports and Entertainment in January 2022. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On November 22, 2024, the Baysox changed their name from the Bowie Baysox to the Chesapeake Baysox to reflect the area of the team&#x27;s fan base.

==Media==
, Baysox games are streamed audio only on their Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts. Adam Pohl and Paul Fritschner share broadcasting duties. Pohl has been with the team since 2014, while Fritschner joined in 2021.

Previously, Baysox games were carried live by radio station WNAV. In 2019, 40 games were broadcast live on the radio, and all games were streamed live on the station&#x27;s website.

==Promotions==
On &quot;Office Space night&quot;, fans, for a $1 fee, are able to live out the famous &quot;Office Space&quot; moment by destroying office equipment with a baseball bat.

On July 9, 2010, the fourth annual Autism Awareness Night took place at Prince George&#x27;s Stadium. Fans that bought the Autism Awareness ticket had $3 of their ticket price donated to an autism charity of their choosing. Fans also took part in &quot;Bowie&#x27;s Largest Pillow Fight&quot;, which took place on the field following the game.

In 2016, the Baysox had a David Bowie night where the team temporarily renamed itself from the Bowie () Baysox to the Bowie (bowh-wy) Baysox. The jerseys were designed to look like similar outfits that he wore with his Ziggy Stardust persona. The team also played his songs during the game. They have events many nights, including fireworks.

One of the most popular promotions is Star Wars night. Characters such as Chewbacca and R2-D2 are available to meet and take pictures with, and a fireworks show set to music from the series follows the game.

The Baysox also hosts an annual Navy Night, with the plebes from the United States Naval Academy attending the game. After the game, a postgame fireworks show takes place set to patriotic music.

<doc id="282793" wikidata="Q8992" url="?curid=282793" title="Glasgow Prestwick Airport">
<text>Glasgow Prestwick Airport (), commonly referred to as Prestwick Airport, is an international airport serving the west of Scotland, situated northeast of the town of Prestwick Scotland, and southwest of Glasgow, Scotland. It is the less busy of the two airports serving the western part of Scotland&#x27;s Central Belt, after Glasgow Airport in Renfrewshire, within the Greater Glasgow conurbation. The airport serves the urban cluster surrounding Ayr, including Kilmarnock, Irvine, Ardrossan, Troon, Saltcoats, Stevenston, Kilwinning, and Prestwick itself.

Glasgow Prestwick is Scotland&#x27;s fifth-busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic, although it is the largest in terms of land area. Passenger traffic peaked at 2.4 million in 2007 following a decade of rapid growth, driven in part by the boom in low-cost carriers, particularly Ryanair, which uses the airport as an operating base. In recent years, passenger traffic has declined; around 670,000passengers passed through the airport in 2016. There has been much public debate and speculation over the association of the airport with Glasgow due to the fact Prestwick and Glasgow are considerably far apart. Calls have been made for the airport to be renamed Robert Burns International Airport, however, this was ruled out by the Scottish Government in 2014.

Prestwick has also had a long historical connection with transatlantic flight, being part of the Atlantic Bridge route between Europe and North America, and remains an important airport for both the United States Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force, who use it as a refuelling stop, and in the case of the former the favoured airport used by Air Force One whenever the President of the United States is visiting Scotland. 

The operations centre of Shanwick Oceanic Control is located close to the airport, which controls all air traffic on the north eastern quadrant of the North Atlantic Ocean, including Scottish airspace (Scottish Area Control Centre), as well as the airspace over much of the north of England, the Midlands and north Wales (Manchester Area Control Centre).

==History==
===Origins and passenger facilities===

Passenger facilities were added in 1938. These were used until further investment made Prestwick compatible with jet transportation. The October 1946 USAAF diagram shows a runway 14/32, with a runway 8/26 crossing just west of its midpoint. In 1958, runway 13/31 was long; in May 1960, the runway&#x27;s extension to opened.

A parallel taxiway, link road and an all-new terminal building were opened by the Queen Mother in 1964. The extension of runway 13/31 caused considerable disruption to road users, for the main road from Monkton into Prestwick now crossed the tarmac of the runway. This was controlled by a &quot;level crossing&quot; system until a new perimeter road was completed.

===Military use===
In the Second World War the RAF controlled trans-Atlantic flights from Prestwick.

Until February 2016, part of the Prestwick site was occupied by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm with RNAS Prestwick, officially known by the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;, where a detachment of three Sea Kings provided a search and rescue role, covering one of the largest SAR areas of the UK including Ben Nevis, the Lakes, Northern Ireland and past the Irish coast. Additionally, Gannet SAR provided a medical evacuation service to the Scottish island communities. Personnel at the base numbered 15 officers, 11 ratings, 28 civil servants and 50 civilian staff. The crews regularly featured as part of the popular Channel 5 documentary series &quot;Highland Emergency&quot;. In 2009, the unit broke a new record as they were tasked to 447 call-outs, 20% of the UK&#x27;s total military SAR call outs for 2009 and making them, for the second year in succession, the busiest search and rescue base in the UK.

There was controversy over the airport&#x27;s use in the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary rendition flights, as aircraft had used the airport as a stop-over point. Since November 2013, when the Scottish government took control of the facility, service contracts have been established with the USAF, USN, USMC, Defense Logistics Agency and National Guard.

Glasgow Prestwick Airport is the only place in the United Kingdom where Elvis Presley (who had distant Scottish ancestry) was known to have set foot, when the United States Air Force transport plane carrying him home to the United States stopped to refuel in 1960, en route from West Germany. However, on 21 April 2008, during a BBC Radio 2 interview with Ken Bruce, theatre impresario and chairman of Everton FC, Bill Kenwright, said that Elvis actually spent a day in the UK being shown around London by Tommy Steele in 1958.

===Commercial use===

In 1945, American Overseas Airlines began regular transatlantic commercial flights began between Prestwick and New York. AOA was later acquired by Pan Am, which used Prestwick as a stop between Europe and North America into the 1970s. BOAC also used Prestwick as a stop between London and New York in the late 1940s and 1950s.

In the 1980s, Prestwick continued to see scheduled transatlantic flights by Air Canada and Northwest Airlines. These carriers both moved their operations to Glasgow Airport after government restrictions were lifted in 1990.

Until 1990, the British government required all transatlantic flights to and from Scotland to use Prestwick.

===1990s===

1992 marked the beginning of a renaissance for the struggling airport when purchased by &quot;Canadian entrepreneur&quot; Matthew Hudson in a &quot;dramatic rescue&quot;. Hudson initiated the construction of the airport&#x27;s railway station on the existing Ayrshire Coast Line (Glasgow–Ayr), which runs past the airfield, making it the first Scottish airport with its own railway station. In her book about Prestwick Airport, South Ayrshire councillor Ann Galbraith writes about this tough time in the airport&#x27;s history, saying that &quot;if it hadn&#x27;t been for Matthew Hudson the airport wouldn&#x27;t be here today&quot;.

In 1994, Irish budget airline Ryanair opened a route to the airport from Dublin, followed by a second route in 1995 to London Stansted. In 1998, a third route to Paris-Beauvais was introduced and the airport was sold by Hudson to the Scottish transport company Stagecoach Group.

===2000s===
In 2001, the airport was purchased by Infratil, a New Zealand company and majority owner of Wellington International Airport. Infratil also owned Manston Airport until November 2013. Manston was sold to a shell company owned by Ann Gloag, a co-founder of Stagecoach, Prestwick&#x27;s previous owner. In April 2005, Infratil completed a major refurbishment of the terminal building, and rebranded the airport using the phrase &quot;pure dead brilliant&quot;, taken straight from the Glasgow patter. Some of the rebranding has been controversial, in particular the redecoration of the airport bar. The bar was rebranded in February 2006 with a logo depicting a man in a kilt, unconscious with an empty bottle of whisky.

Despite objections that it promoted the wrong image of Scotland to foreign visitors and embarrassed local travellers, the airport management insisted the logo was &quot;fun and visually stimulating&quot;. However, it was removed a matter of weeks after installation, after the South Ayrshire Licensing Board said the logo trivialised excessive drinking. The &quot;pure dead brilliant&quot; branding was removed from the main terminal building in January 2014.

Since 2007, the airport has occasionally been used by the BBC TV programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; as the location for various stunts and experiments. The best-known stunt was a scene similar to one featured in the film &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and featured both a Ford Mondeo and a Citroën 2CV parked behind the engines of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, in an experiment to investigate whether the thrust from the aircraft&#x27;s four jet engines really could lift a car off the ground.

The car park and A79 outside the terminal building have been reconstructed to comply with governmental movement and access restrictions mandated in the aftermath of the Glasgow International Airport terrorist attack. According to a 2008 Master Plan, the departure lounge is at capacity and congested during peak operations. The plan proposes &quot;a central pier that provides adequate circulation and waiting space prior to boarding the aircraft&quot; to cope with a continuing increase in passenger departures.

===2010s===

In 2010, NATS, the organisation responsible for en-route air traffic control services to flights within the UK flight information regions, consolidated its air traffic control operations from four facilities to two. The 86,000 square feet (8,000 square metre) operations room at Prestwick is solely responsible for all aircraft flying over Scottish aerospace (Scottish Area Control Centre), which includes all aircraft over Scotland, Northern Ireland, the North of England as well as over the North Sea from 2,500 feet up to 66,000 feet. In addition to being responsible for aircraft over Scottish aerospace as defined by the Scottish Area Control Centre, Prestwick is also responsible for the aerospace over much of the north of England, the Midlands and north Wales from 2,500 feet up to 28,500 feet (Manchester Area Control Centre). Its Oceanic Area Control Centre controls the aerospace over the eastern half of the North Atlantic to a designated boundary in place with Iceland. With a responsibility of aerospace covering , the operations centre at Prestwick has the largest area of aerospace responsibility in Europe, handing 42% of the total aircraft movement across the United Kingdom.

On 8 March 2012, the airport owner Infratil announced that it planned to sell the airfield. The airport remained unsold until October 2013 when the Scottish Government announced it was in negotiations to take the airport back into public ownership. Subsequently, the Scottish Government bought the airport on 22 November 2013 for £1, Infratil having incurred annual losses of £2,000,000. No job losses were anticipated after the government takeover. Then-Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that work would then begin on &quot;turning Prestwick around and making it a viable enterprise&quot;.

On 1 April 2014, the public petition committee at Holyrood heard that &quot;The Robert Burns World Federation&quot; wished to rename the airport to Robert Burns International Airport. In June 2014, Ryanair announced the relocation of some routes from Prestwick to Glasgow International Airport by October 2014; included among them were flights to Warsaw and Dublin.

In November 2014 Donald Trump signed a partnership agreement with Prestwick making it the Scottish base for all Trump Aviation Operations, in order to service his Trump Turnberry golf resort away.

As part of the privatisation of the UK&#x27;s search and rescue service, Bristow Helicopters based two Sikorsky S-92 helicopters in a new hangar at HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;. The handover took place in January 2016. In March 2016, the airport revealed new branding and a new look to the inside and outside of the airport building.

In 2015, Glasgow Prestwick Airport was shortlisted as a potential UK Spaceport, as part of the British commercial spaceport competition. In June 2019, the Scottish government announced that it was putting the airport up for sale. Bidders would be expected to commit to maintaining and developing aviation operations and employment.

===2020s===
In February 2021, the Scottish government announced that a preferred bidder had been selected to buy the airport. The unnamed bidder was believed to be a European transport infrastructure investor. However, the Scottish government announced in December 2021 that the bid had been rejected, and that the sale would not proceed. The airport would consequently remain in public ownership, but the government stated it was committed to &quot;returning it to the private sector at the appropriate time and opportunity.&quot; , no private investor has been found yet but there was ongoing debate if the airport is financially viable or will require further loans from the government.

==Scottish International Airshow==
Prestwick Airport used to host a bi-annual Air show, the first of which was held on 30 September 1967. While very small in scale compared to such shows as RAF Fairford or Farnborough International Airshow, the Scottish air show attracted up to 100,000 spectators to Prestwick in its heyday in the 1980s.

The revived Scottish International Airshow was brought back by 3 Ayrshire aviation and events professionals Danny Anderson, Bob Alexander (2014 and 2015) and Doug Maclean. The events company Zisys Events shouldered the organisation burden and financial risk. It was restarted on 6 and 7 September 2014; an air display was held at the Low green at Ayr Seafront and a static display on 7 September at the airport. The event included appearances by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, including the only two flying Avro Lancaster bombers, and the last airworthy Avro Vulcan bomber, famous for being part of the UK&#x27;s Nuclear &quot;V Force&quot; bomber fleet. The second Scottish Airshow was held on 5 and 6 September 2015. Danny Anderson and Doug Maclean were innovative in their ideas for displays. The 2016 Scottish International Airshow included the first night display in Scotland. It started with the RAF Typhoon doing a first dusk display and ended with the Aerosparx Formation Team flying in darkness and discharging pyrotechnics from the aircraft wing tips. 

Between 2014 and 2018 the Scottish International Airshow continued to develop and brought very respected formation teams and vintage aircraft and modern fighter jets from Denmark, Belgium The Netherlands, Ireland and Switzerland as well as the highly unusual Swiss Vintage Formation of 3 Beech 18s and a DC3 flying together in a unique display. The attendances continued to rise each year with over 200,000 people reported to attend over 2 days in 2018. The 2019 Airshow was planned to highlight the return to Prestwick of the CF104 Starfighter from Norway and a Spanish Air Force helicopter formation. It was also intended to include a static aircraft display at Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The show was cancelled at an early stage due to a dispute between the organisers and the local Council and the withdrawal of financial support by the Council. The 2020 Covid pandemic meant that there was no display planned.

It was announced that the airshow would return for 2023, organised by South Ayrshire Council and rebranded as The International Ayrshow - Festival Of Flight beginning on the weekend of 8 September 2023.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 28 August 1944, a United States Army Air Forces Douglas C54A Skymaster flying from Boston via Keflavik crashed into houses on the south side of the airport while attempting to land. All 20 crew and passengers as well as five people on the ground were killed. 
* On 20 October 1948, a Lockheed L-049 Constellation of KLM crashed on approach to Prestwick; all 40 aboard died.
*Early on 25 December 1954, at 03:30, the 1954 Prestwick air disaster involved a British Overseas Airways Corporation Boeing 377 Stratocruiser which crashed on landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. The crash has been attributed to a number of factors, including pilot fatigue (the captain was well over his duty limit due to the aircraft being delayed); the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair; and the first officer either not hearing a command from the captain for landing lights (which might have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.
*On 3 November 1973, Pan Am 160 crashed at Logan International Airport following a loss of control due to smoke; the aircraft was meant to stop over at Prestwick.
*On 17 March 1977, a British Airtours Boeing 707 crashed during a pilot training flight and caught fire. All four crew on board survived.
*On 6 October 1992, a BAe Jetstream 31 operated by British Aerospace on a training flight to East Midlands Airport crashed shortly after takeoff at Prestwick after simulating an engine failure. Both occupants were killed.
*On 15 June 2013, an Egyptair flight from Cairo bound for New York–JFK was diverted to Prestwick Airport under RAF escort due to a note found on board threatening to &#x27;set the plane on fire&#x27;. Roads surrounding the airport were closed as police dealt with the incident.
*On 5 September 2015, during the Scottish International Airshow, Avro Vulcan bomber XH558 suffered an issue with its nosewheel. The nosewheel failed to extend properly and lock into place. Once the crew were made aware, a displaying Spitfire was called upon to confirm whether the nosewheel was down and locked, to which they confirmed it wasn&#x27;t extended properly. The crew finally were able to secure the nosewheel in a fully down position and made a successful landing on runway 30 with an extended flare. There were no injuries and the aircraft and crew made a safe return journey to their home base with the gear extended.
*On the 28 October 2016, a Volaris Airbus A320 was diverted under RAF escort to Prestwick whilst on route to Keflavík International Airport following a loss of communications. There were only 7 crew onboard and some roads surrounding the airport were shut. 
*On 23 April 2024 a Piper PA-28-181 with two occupants crashed due to Carburetor icing near the airport.

<text>HMS &quot;Splendid&quot; was a Royal Navy nuclear-powered fleet submarine of the . From commissioning in 1979 to her decommission in 2004 she took part in many operations involving British forces around the globe.

==Construction==

HMS &quot;Splendid&quot; was ordered on 26 May 1976 as the sixth and last submarine of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class. The submarine was laid down at Vickers Shipbuilding Groups Barrow-in-Furness shipyard on 23 November 1977 and was launched on 5 October 1979 by Lady Eberle, wife of Admiral Sir James Eberle, then Commander-in-Chief Fleet. &quot;Splendid&quot; commissioned on 21 March 1981 under the command of Commander R. C. Lane-Nott.

==Operational history==
Her first major conflict came in 1982 during the Falklands War when Argentinian forces invaded the British Falkland Islands. &quot;Splendid&quot; was one of the first submarines to reach the islands, arriving mid-April, after sailing from Faslane. Unlike , &quot;Splendid&quot; did not directly engage Argentinian forces, however she shadowed the Argentine aircraft carrier &quot;25 de Mayo&quot;, with &quot;Splendid&quot; running within a mile outside of the Argentinian territorial line, off its Atlantic coast. The captain of &quot;Splendid&quot; claimed, that running on the edge of the exclusion zone around the Falklands, declared by the UK government, he had the right in international law and approval from the British PM, to fire at &quot;25 de Mayo&quot;, a couple of miles away within Argentine waters, and would have fired MK 8 torpedoes at &quot;25 de Mayo&quot;, if he had confirmed his precise position. But just at the moment, he lost sight through the periscope of the carrier and was not immediately able to regain contact. The Naval Commander of the task force, Admiral Sandy Woodward, does not appear to be entirely clear, that &quot;Splendid&quot; had the right to fire, but says he established, against his prior view, that &quot;Splendid&quot; had orders to engage and approval of the PM. &quot;Splendid&quot; did however provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements. &quot;Splendid&quot;″s presence along with &quot;Conqueror&quot; effectively restricted the freedom of action of the Argentine Navy, which spent most of the war confined to port.

In November 1998, the Royal Navy attained initial operational capability for the American-built Tomahawk cruise missile with the missile&#x27;s deployment aboard &quot;Splendid&quot;. In March 1999, &quot;Splendid&quot; fired Tomahawks in battle against Serbian targets when NATO forces intervened in the Kosovo War, becoming the first British submarine in the conflict to do so; she would fire 20 Tomahawks throughout the war. She again fired these weapons against Iraqi targets in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In July 2003 &quot;Splendid&quot; returned to her home at Faslane Naval Base on the River Clyde in Scotland. The youngest of the &quot;Swiftsure&quot; vessels, she was decommissioned in HMNB Devonport, Plymouth in 2004. Commander Burke was later awarded the OBE for his leadership of HMS &quot;Splendid&quot; in the Gulf.

==Alleged involvement in the loss of &quot;Kursk&quot;==

HMS &quot;Splendid&quot; was alleged by Russian officials to have been present, along with the US Navy submarines and 
at the Russian war games during which the Russian submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; exploded and sank, resulting in the loss of that submarine and all 118 sailors and officers on board. Despite the conclusions of independent forensic inquiries and the eventual corroborating admission by the Russian Navy that the explosion was triggered by a faulty torpedo on board the &quot;Kursk&quot;, various conspiracy theories posit that &quot;Kursk&quot; was actually sunk by one of the US or British submarines. This may partly stem from the Russian Navy&#x27;s initial attempts to shunt away criticism of its failed efforts to rescue the surviving crew members from the ocean floor and of the generally poor condition of its own equipment, which was eventually found to be the cause of both the sinking and the failure of the Russian rescue attempts. In the days immediately after the explosion, Russia suggested that the cause of the disaster was a collision with one of the US or British submarines present. Though the accusation proved to be unfounded, conspiracy theorists have picked up on and elaborated it in various directions over time.

<text>Peking duck is a dish from Beijing that has been prepared since the Imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred especially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber, and sweet bean sauce, with pancakes rolled around the fillings.

==History==
Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern dynasties. A variation of roast duck was prepared for the emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty. The dish, originally named &quot;shāo yāzi&quot; (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the &quot;Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages&quot; (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen. The Peking roast duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus. The first restaurant specialising in Peking duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.

By the Qianlong period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring some poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of &quot;Dūmén zhúzhīcí&quot;, a local Beijing poem, was &quot;Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig&quot;.
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks.

By the mid-20th century, Peking duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on 10 July 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking duck for lunch, which became Kissinger&#x27;s favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou&#x27;s death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking duck. Peking duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.

== Preparation ==
=== Raising the duck ===
The ducks used to prepare Peking duck originated in Nanjing. They were large, had black feathers, and lived in the canals that linked the city to major waterways.

With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barge traffic increased in that area. Often these barges spilled water into side-canals, providing a habitat for the ducks. By the time of adoption of five-spice powder, a new breed of duck had been domesticated by Chinese farmers.

Newly hatched ducks are raised in a free range environment for the first 45 days of their lives, and force fed 4 times a day for the next 15–20 days, resulting in ducks that weigh 5–7 kg (11–15 lbs). The force feeding of the ducks led to an alternate name for the animal, &quot;Peking &quot;stuffed&quot; duck&quot; ().

=== Cooking the duck ===

Fattened ducks are killed, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water. Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then blanched in boiling hot water for two to three minutes before it is hung up to dry. This tightens the skin. While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of syrup with honey, and the duck&#x27;s inside is rinsed once more with water. A second layer of glaze/marinade of soy sauce, five-spice powder, and more maltose is then applied inside and out, and the duck is left to stand for 24 hours in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator). It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.

Besides two traditional methods to prepare Peking duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs all around the world to produce the dish at home.

=== Closed-oven style ===
Peking duck is traditionally roasted in a closed oven (). Bianyifang, a restaurant in Beijing, China, is famous for keeping this tradition. The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (). The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw () at the base. The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven. Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill. In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.

=== Open-oven style ===
The open oven () was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing dynasty and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees. The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of for 30–40 minutes. While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals. In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy.

== Serving ==

Peking duck is traditionally carved in front of the guests and served in three stages. First, slices of duck skin are served with sugar and sweet bean sauce as a dip. Duck skin is best enjoyed hot and crisp to the bite. The meat is then served with steamed pancakes () and an assortment of vegetable dishes, typically julienned cucumber and spring onion. Traditionally, diners dip slices of duck into the condiments and wrap into the pancake with cucumber and any other ingredients. The wrap is then eaten by hand or with chopsticks. The carved duck (鸭架) – the remainder of the roast duck, with choice cuts removed – can be cooked in three ways. The traditional way is in a broth with ingredients such as Chinese cabbage and soft tofu. The carved duck can also be chopped and stir-fried in sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and pepper (椒鹽). Otherwise, the carved duck is packed to be taken home by the customers.

===Reheating===
Whole Peking ducks can be ordered as takeaway. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven or stovetop. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of for 20 minutes, and then at for another 10 minutes. The stove method involves submerging the duck in boiling water before placing it on a griddle above the cooking fire. The water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck is piping hot. To reheat the Peking duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of hot oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.

===Notable restaurants===
A number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking duck. Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店). Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or &quot;Lao zihao&quot; (老字号), literally &quot;old brand name&quot;. In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.

Duck Chang&#x27;s Restaurant, established in 1975 in Virginia, United States, was the first Chinese restaurant to prepare and serve Peking duck without a 24-hour advanced notice. In 2018, the James Beard Foundation awarded Sun Wah BBQ in Chicago, Illinois, with their America&#x27;s Classics award, specifically citing Sun Wah&#x27;s three-course &quot;Beijing Duck Feast&quot; in their announcement of the award.

==Crispy aromatic duck==
Crispy aromatic duck (香酥鴨 xiāng sū yā) is a similar dish to Peking duck. It is popular in the United Kingdom, where it was created in the latter half of the twentieth century.

The duck is first marinated with spices, then steamed until tender, and finally deep fried until crispy. The meat has less fat and is drier and crispier compared to that of Peking duck.

In Germany, some Asian fusion restaurants also serve crispy aromatic duck (&quot;Knusprige Ente&quot;), sometimes also labeled as Peking duck (&quot;Peking-Ente&quot;, also &quot;Pekingente&quot;). The duck is marinated with spices and deep-fried, served together with stir-fried vegetables (&quot;Wokgemüse&quot;) over fried noodles or with rice.

How to taste

The traditional way of eating is just to have the roasted duck carved into slices by the waiter on the spot, separate the duck skin and duck meat, and dip a little duck skin into each slice. Diners usually wrap slices of duck meat in pancakes, and add sweet bean sauce, green onions, cucumber strips and other ingredients to make it a unified meal.

=== Cultural symbol ===
Peking duck is a symbol of gourmet food and one of the representatives of Chinese food culture. Buying Peking duck has become one of the essential experiences for many foreign politicians and tourists not only when visiting Beijing. Time-honored roast duck restaurants such as Quanjude and Bianyifang have become the inheritors of this gourmet culture.

After a hundred years of inheritance and innovation, Beijing roast duck has become more than just a dish. It carries the memory of history and represents China’s rich food culture.

<text>Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg (18 August 1856 – 2 January 1927), primarily known by his Hebrew name and pen name Ahad Ha&#x27;am (, lit. &#x27;one of the people&#x27;, ), was a Hebrew journalist and essayist, and one of the foremost pre-state Zionist thinkers. He is known as the founder of cultural Zionism. With his vision of a Jewish &quot;spiritual center&quot; in Eretz Israel, his views regarding the purpose of a Jewish state contrasted with those of prominent figures within the Zionist movement such as Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism. Unlike Herzl, Ahad Ha&#x27;am strived for &quot;a Jewish state and not merely a state of Jews&quot;.

==Biography==
Ginsberg was born in Skvyra, in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) to wealthy Hasidic parents. The town was located in the Pale of Settlement, which constituted an area in the Russian Empire in which Jews were legally allowed to reside. Ginsberg felt little affection for the town, describing it as &quot;one of the most benighted spots in the Hasidic districts of Russia.&quot; Jewish segregation in the Russian Empire as well as his strong Orthodox upbringing served to cultivate an identity fundamentally based in Jewish Nationalism. At eight years old, he began to teach himself to read Russian. His father, Isaiah, sent him to heder until he was 12. When his father became the administrator of a large estate in the village of Gopitshitza in the Kiev Governorate, he moved the family there and took private tutors for his son, who excelled at his studies.

From a young age, Ginsberg was interested in the Haskalah movement. He was critical of the dogmatic nature of Orthodox Judaism, and began to distance himself from Orthodoxy by the time he was 16. Still, he remained loyal to his cultural heritage, especially the ethical ideals of Judaism. Ginsberg felt uncomfortable with taking the identity of mitnagid (non-Hasidic Orthodox jew) or maskil (Jewish Enlightener), so he simply referred to himself as &quot;Ohev Yisrael&quot;, or &quot;Lover of Israel&quot;. He married his wife Rivke at the age of 17. They had three children, Shlomo, Leah, and Rachel. In 1886 he settled in Odessa with his parents, wife and children, and entered the family business. In 1908, following a trip to Palestine, Ginsberg moved to London to manage the office of the Wissotzky Tea company. He settled in Tel Aviv in early 1922, where he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the city council until 1926. Plagued by ill health, Ginsberg died there in 1927.

== Education ==

=== Childhood education ===

Ginsberg&#x27;s childhood education was fundamentally steeped in Orthodox Judaism. At the age of 3, he was sent to Heder. He had a desire to learn the Russian alphabet, but had to do so in secret as his family forbade instruction in languages other than Hebrew; according to Ginsberg, &quot;my mother&#x27;s father had with his own ears heard one of the great &quot;tsaddikim&quot; [Hasidic leaders] say that the sight of a foreign letter made the eyes unclean.&quot; Still, he was able to persuade some of his classmates to teach him the letters of the Russian alphabet. From a young age, Ginsberg displayed intellectual independence from the doctrine of Hasidism. He attempted to further his knowledge of Russian by reading street signs on his way home from Heder. His learning of Russian was exposed, however, when he returned home late, and his habit was subsequently banned. Ginsberg was also interested in algebra and geometry and began to teach himself the subjects using a book he found in his father&#x27;s study. His pursuit was cut short again, though, when his grandmother told his parents he was practicing witchcraft after witnessing algebraic formulae written on the windows of the family&#x27;s home.

=== Teen years and early adulthood ===
After moving the family to Gopitshitza, Ginsberg&#x27;s father took tutors for his son. Asher excelled in the study of the Talmud, which contributed heavily to his affinity for the moral, ethical, and mystical teachings of Judaism. Additionally, his aptitude for Talmudic learning gave hope to his father that Ginsburg would become a rabbi. His hopes were diminished, however, as Asher broke away from Hasidism around the time of the family&#x27;s move to Gopitshitza. Although he displayed obvious intelligence, Ginsberg&#x27;s father forbade him from attending high school, which would later complicate his attempts to enroll in a university. Ginsberg displayed an interest in literature outside of Hasidism, particularly medieval Jewish works, the Bible, and Haskalah literature. His father did not forbid his reading outside of Hasidism, but did limit it heavily.

In his late teens and early twenties, Ginsberg dedicated himself to the study of religion, as well as subjects outside of Judaism such as Russian and German. During his first visit to Odessa in 1878, he became acquainted with another young man staying in the same hotel as him. There, he was introduced to the literature of Russian philosopher Dmitry Pisarev, who inspired him greatly. He returned home with the goal of enrolling in a university, and resolved to master the subjects required in a high school curriculum. However, he found that he had little time or desire to master the &quot;intrinsically unimportant details&quot; that students were required to learn in order to pass their exams, and abandoned the idea of enrolling at a Russian university. His subsequent attempts to attend university in Breslau, Berlin, Vienna and Leipzig faced various roadblocks, and his lack of higher education caused deep frustration. He experienced dissatisfaction with his lack of higher education, and this in part inspired his move to Odessa.

==Zionist activism==
In his early thirties, Ginsberg returned to Odessa where he was influenced by Leon Pinsker, a leader of the Hovevei Zion (&quot;Lovers of Zion&quot;) movement whose goal was settlement of Jews in Palestine. Unlike Pinsker, Ginsberg did not believe in political Zionism, which he fought, &#x27;with a vehemence and austerity which embittered that whole period&#x27;. Instead he hailed the spiritual value of the Hebrew renaissance to counter the debilitating fragmentation (&quot;hitpardut&quot;) in the diaspora, he believed that the ingathering of Jews in Palestine was not an answer. &quot;Kibbutz galuyot&quot; was a messianic ideal rather than a feasible contemporary project. The real answer lay in achieving a spiritual centre, or &#x27;central domicile&#x27;, within Palestine, that of Eretz Israel, which would form an exemplary model for the dispersed world of Jewry in exile to imitate; a spiritual focus for the circumferential world of the Jewish diaspora. He split from the Zionist movement after the First Zionist Congress, because he felt that Theodor Herzl&#x27;s program was impractical. In an essay entitled &quot;The First Zionist Congress&quot; (1897), he supports: &quot;the emancipation of ourselves from the inner slavery and the spiritual degradation which assimilation has produced in us, and the strengthening of our national unity by joint action in every sphere of our national life, until we become capable and worthy of a life of dignity and freedom at some time in the future.&quot; His criticism of political Zionism would give way to the development of his doctrine of cultural Zionism. From 1889 to 1906, Ginzberg flourished as a preeminent intellectual in Zionist politics.

== Journalism career ==
Ginsberg&#x27;s literary career began after moving to Odessa in 1886, adopting the pen name &quot;Ahad Ha&#x27;am&quot;. His first article was published in 1889. Ginsberg wrote a number of articles and essays during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries focused on the Jewish community and the direction of Zionism. He was mainly a proponent of a moderate movement focused on cultural Zionism in contrast to the practical Zionism he observed when visiting Palestine. Some of his famous essays include &quot;Truth from Eretz Israel&quot; and &quot;Lo zu haderekh&quot; (&quot;This is not the way&quot;).

He also founded the Hebrew monthly newspaper &quot;Ha-Shiloaḥ&quot;, a prominent Hebrew-language literary journal in the early twentieth century, and was chief editor from 1896 to 1902 before stepping down.

After his move to Tel Aviv in Palestine he published a 4-volume collection of his essays called &quot;Al Parashat Derakhim&quot; as well as a 6-volume collection of his edited letters.

=== &quot;Ha-Shiloah&quot; ===
With the collapse of his family business in 1896, Ginsberg had to turn to Hebrew literature to be his main source of income. He subsequently accepted a position as Director of the Ahiasaf Publishing Company, moving to Warsaw to be at the company&#x27;s headquarters. Ginsberg had to help produce the company&#x27;s annual almanac for 1896, but he soon switched focus to a more appealing project, a monthly Hebrew journal where he would take the role of chief editor.

Ginsberg named the publication &quot;Ha-Shiloah&quot; after a river in the Bible. The river in the Bible was known for water that goes softly, and he wanted his monthly to reflect the slow, methodical development of Hebrew literature he hoped his monthly would curate.

Ginsberg&#x27;s desire for a respected Hebrew journal drove him to run the monthly with a high standard and tight control. His goal was to create a journal that was Judeocentric with the same quality of respected European journals at the time. To create this standard, prose and fictional writings were kept to separate sections, and had to maintain the theme of focus on the Jewish experience. Ginsberg&#x27;s editorial style was also thorough and aggressive, often omitting entire pages of articles and restructuring whole essays where he deemed fit. Though the journal was respected by Western scholars, the sales were small and dwindled every year. Ginsberg eventually resigned in October 1902 when he predicted either the paper would be closed, or he would be fired.

Despite Ha-Shiloah&#x27;s low sales, Ginsberg&#x27;s strict curation and editorial style led to him being recognized as a key contributor in the development of a new, secular Hebrew essay writing style that is now known as the Odessa Style. This style is often described as being clear, succinct, positivist, and anti-romantic, and it almost entirely focuses on Jewish topics. As editor of Ha-Shiloah from 1896 until 1902, Ahad Ha&#x27;am established the Odessa Style as a benchmark for Hebrew writing.

==Visits to Eretz Israel==

Asher Ginsberg travelled frequently to Palestine and published reports about the progress of Jewish settlement there. The essays were generally critical, focusing on the shortcomings of the movement. They reported on hunger, on Arab dissatisfaction and unrest, on unemployment, and on people leaving Palestine. In an essay soon after his 1891 journey to the area he warned against the &#x27;great error&#x27;, believing the movement was doomed to failure with resistance in land purchases, local attitudes, economic feasibility, and lack of nationalist motivation.

=== &quot;Truth from Eretz Israel&quot; ===
Asher Ginsberg first visited Palestine (the Ottoman &quot;Vilayet&quot; (province) of Beirut and the &quot;Sanjak&quot; (district) of Jerusalem) in 1891, to observe the progress of the First Aliyah, or the first wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine (1882-1903). When he returned home, he published a series of five essays in the St. Petersburg-based Hebrew paper &quot;Ha-Melitz&quot; entitled &quot;Truth From Eretz Israel&quot;. The essays were a comprehensive critique of the immigration efforts from both logistical and ethical perspectives, presenting a somber report of future Jewish colonization efforts there.

&quot;Truth from Eretz Israel&quot; raised concerns about the Turkish government and native Arab population, both of whom would heavily resist the transformation of Palestine into a Jewish state. The essay also questioned the survival and prosperity of Jewish settlers currently in Palestine. The reliance on viticulture was unproven and currently unsustainable for Jewish farmers. This, along with inflated land prices, raised additional barriers to any goal of Zionism. Ahad Ha&#x27;am ultimately believed the Hovevei Zion movement would be a failure because the new villages were dependent on the largesse of outside benefactors, and the impoverished settlers of his day would struggle to build any Jewish homeland.

The series of essays is considered to be among the first works to seriously address the &quot;Arab Issue&quot; within the Zionist movement. Ahad Ha&#x27;am warned of future enmity between Arabs and Jews when relations would turn sour:
&quot;From abroad we are accustomed to believing that the Arabs are all desert savages, like donkeys, who neither see nor understand what goes on around them. But this is a big mistake. The Arab, like all children of Shem, has a sharp intellect and is very cunning. The cities of Syria and Eretz Israel are full of Arab merchants who also know how to exploit the public and to proceed furtively with all those with whom they deal, exactly as in Europe. The Arabs, and especially those in the cities, understand our deeds and our desires in Eretz Israel, but they keep quiet and pretend not to understand, since they do not see our present activities as a threat to their future. Therefore they try to exploit us as well, to extract some benefit from the new visitors as long as they can. Yet they mock us in their hearts. The farmers are happy to have a new Hebrew colony founded in their midst since they receive a good wage for their labor and get wealthier from year to year, as experience shows; and the owners of large properties are also happy with us, since we pay them a huge price-more than they dreamed possible-for stony and sandy land. However, if the time comes when the life of our people in Eretz Israel develops to the point of encroaching upon the native population, they will not easily yield their place...&quot;

He reported of the early Zionist settlers:

&quot;They were slaves in their land of exile, and they suddenly find themselves with unlimited freedom, the kind of wild freedom to be found only in a country like Turkey. This sudden change has engendered in them an impulse to despotism, as always happens when &quot;a slave becomes a king,&quot; and behold they walk with the Arabs in hostility and cruelty, unjustly encroaching on them, shamefully beating them for no good reason, and even bragging about what they do, and there is no one to stand in the breach and call a halt to this dangerous and despicable impulse. To be sure our people are correct in saying that the Arab respects only those who demonstrate strength and courage, but this is relevant only when he feels that his rival is acting justly; it is not the case if there is reason to think his rival&#x27;s actions are oppressive and unjust.&quot;

Ahad Ha&#x27;am believed the solution was to bring Jews to Palestine gradually, while turning it into a cultural centre. At the same time, it was incumbent upon Zionism to inspire a revival of Jewish national life in the Diaspora. Only then would the Jewish people be strong enough to assume the mantle of building a nation state.

The series was criticized heavily within the Zionist movement, with many claiming that the essays provided a one-sided view of the Jewish national efforts, and others claiming that the series defamed Jewish settlers, both generally and specifically in Palestine. Asher Ginsberg&#x27;s critiques of the Hovevei Zionists, an organization of which he was a member, cemented his reputation as an internal critic and moral compass for Zionism.

==Importance of Hebrew and Jewish culture==
Ahad Ha&#x27;am&#x27;s ideas were popular at a very difficult time for Zionism, beginning after the failures of the first Aliya. His unique contribution was to emphasize the importance of reviving Hebrew and Jewish culture both in Palestine and throughout the Diaspora, something that was recognised only belatedly, when it became part of the Zionist program after 1898. Herzl did not have much use for Hebrew, and many wanted German to be the language of the Jewish state. Ahad Ha&#x27;am played an important role in the revival of the Hebrew language and Jewish culture, and in cementing a link between the proposed Jewish state and Hebrew culture.

==Cultural Zionism==
The ideas perpetuated through Ginsberg&#x27;s essays and criticisms regarding the Zionist movement constituted what is known today as Cultural Zionism. This ideology promoted cultural and linguistic revival throughout the Jewish diaspora, and allowed for, but did not require, the creation of a Jewish state which would serve as a cultural and spiritual center for the diaspora. Ginsberg and the ideology of cultural Zionism placed importance on issues plaguing Judaism as an identity rather than the problems of individual Jews.

His first article criticizing practical Zionism, called &quot;Lo zu haderekh&quot; (&quot;This is not the way&quot;) published in 1888 appeared in &quot;HaMelitz.&quot; In it, he wrote that the Land of Israel will not be capable of absorbing all of the Jewish Diaspora, not even a majority of them. Ahad Ha&#x27;am also argued that establishing a &quot;national home&quot; in Zion will not solve the &quot;Jewish problem&quot;; furthermore, the physical conditions in Eretz Yisrael will discourage Aliyah, and thus Hibbat Zion must educate and strengthen Zionist values among the Jewish people enough that they will want to settle the land despite the greatest difficulties. The ideas in this article became the platform for Bnei Moshe (sons of Moses), a secret society he founded that year. Bnei Moshe, active until 1897, worked to improve Hebrew education, build up a wider audience for Hebrew literature, and assist the Jewish settlements. Perhaps more significant was &quot;Derekh Kehayim&quot; (1889), Ahad Ha&#x27;am&#x27;s attempt to launch a unique movement from a fundamentalist perspective incorporating all the elements of a national revival, but driven by force of intellect.

He eclipsed nationalists like Peretz Smolenskin arguing assimilative individualism in the west further alienated Russified Jewry, who were seeking to reduce migration: isolating it beggared Eastern European Jewry. Even those in &quot;Hovevei&quot; seeking to restrict emigration would, he feared, bring the extinguishment of national consciousness; and atomisation of Jewish identity. Only anti-Semitism had made Jews of us. &quot;Derekh&quot; argued that nations had waxed and waned throughout history, but nationalism had all but vanished from Jewish consciousness. Only a small group of nobles kept it going.

Throughout the 1890s Ahad Ha&#x27;am worked to keep the flame of nationalism alive. Emphasis fell on moral concepts, honor of the flag, self-improvement, national revitalisation. A departure occurred in &quot;Avdut betokh herut&quot; discussing pessimism about the future for independent Jewishness. Critic Simon Dubnov alluded to this but was compromised by his westernised idealizing of French Jewry. For the movement, the preoccupation with assimilation at Odessa was fatal for Ahad Ha&#x27;am&#x27;s progressive Zionism. The requirement arose in 1891 for a &quot;spiritual centre&quot; in Palestine; Bnei Moshe&#x27;s implacable opposition to his support for Vladimir (Zeev) Tiomkin&#x27;s ideal community at Jaffa compounded the controversy in &quot;Emet me&#x27;eretz Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The Truth from the Land of Israel&quot;).

In 1896, he became editor of &quot;Hashiloah,&quot; a Hebrew monthly, a position he held for six years. After stepping down as editor in 1903, he went back to the business world with the Wissotzky Tea Company.

In 1897, following the Basel Zionist Congress calling for a Jewish national home &quot;recognized in international law&quot; (&quot;völkerrechtlich&quot;), Ha&#x27;am wrote an article called &quot;Jewish State Jewish Problem&quot; ridiculing the idea of a &quot;völkerrechtlich&quot; recognized state, given the pitiful plight of the Jewish settlements in Palestine at the time. He emphasized that without a Jewish nationalist revival abroad, it would be impossible to mobilize genuine support for a Jewish national home. Even if the national home were created and recognized in international law, it would be weak and unsustainable.

In 1898, the Zionist Congress adopted the idea of disseminating Jewish culture in the Diaspora as a tool for furthering the goals of the Zionist movement and bringing about a revival of the Jewish people. Bnei Moshe helped to found Rehovot as a model for self-sufficiency, and established &quot;Achiasaf&quot;, a Hebrew publishing company.
==Political influence==

Asher Ginsberg&#x27;s political influence was relatively small when compared to the impact and proliferation of his published works. His desire to be seen as a neutral, apolitical commentator led to him often staying on the sidelines of political events. He spoke at many conferences and advised prominent leaders but would avoid opportunities for responsibility and leadership whenever they were presented.

Ginsberg&#x27;s first significant political action was founding the Bnei Moshe, a secret political organization, in 1889, and assuming leadership. He also joined the Odessa committee, a committee advocating for the immigration of Jewish people to Israel, along with many of his Bnei Moshe brethren from 1891 to 1895.

Ahad Ha&#x27;am&#x27;s influence in the political realm was more from his influence on political leaders and his spiritual authority rather than his official functions. For the &quot;Democratic Fraction&quot;, a party that espoused cultural Zionism (founded in 1901 by Chaim Weizmann), he served &quot;as a symbol for the movement&#x27;s culturalists, the faction&#x27;s most coherent totem. He was, however, not – certainly not to the extent to which members of this group, especially Chaim Weizmann, would later contend – its chief ideological influence.&quot; Though the party wished for Ahad&#x27;s participation or even endorsement, he would remain uninvolved.

Ahad Ha&#x27;am was a talented negotiator. He used his skills in compromise during the &quot;language controversy&quot; that accompanied the founding of the Haifa Technikum (today: the Technion) and in the negotiations culminating in the Balfour Declaration. Ahad Ha&#x27;am was also a close advisor to Chaim Weizmann and other British Zionists at the time of the negotiations. After the Balfour Declaration he held a position on the Zionist &quot;Political Committee&quot;, along with being a powerful advisor to the British Zionists as they battled anti-Zionist efforts.

Ahad Ha&#x27;am Versus Theodor Herzl

Ahad Ha&#x27;am had the potential to represent a political alternative to Herzl after the first Zionist Congress. His critique of the congress, along with his success in convincing the 160 delegates of the All-Russian Zionism Conference to support his beliefs, provided a strong foundation for a countermovement to Herzl&#x27;s vision. Despite this strong support, Ahad&#x27;s choices to not join the second Congress and defend his position, as well as call for the dissolution of Bnei Moshe in 1895 and 1897, resulted in Herzlian Zionism becoming the dominant approach. Ahad Ha&#x27;am and Theodor Herzl would remain rivals for years, and their conflicting views would spark disagreements between Eastern and Western Zionists throughout the early twentieth century.

==Legacy and commemoration==
Many cities in Israel have streets named after Ahad Ha&#x27;am. In Petah Tikva there is a high school named after him, Ahad Ha&#x27;am High School. There is also a room named after him at the Beit Ariela Library, Ahad Ha&#x27;am Room.

<text>Parqués () is the Colombian version of a board game in the cross and circle family (the category that includes Pachisi). The game is described as a &quot;random thinking&quot; game: the moves depend on the roll of the dice but players must consider possible strategies before executing their move. The objective of the game is to advance all the pieces to the end. Once in the safety zone player can use 2 dice until they are one space away from home, where they will then just use one die.

== Colombian culture ==
Parqués is the Colombian version of Parcheesi, which itself is a version of Pachisi (which originated in India). The
meaning of the word may be a translation of the pachisi word, also influenced by similar games such as Parcheesi. Parqués as a word in another context has no meaning.
Although it could be argued that the game&#x27;s origin is Spanish (from Parchís) due to the similarity between both games, there is wide agreement in Colombia that the game is completely Colombian. Parqués stems directly from Pachisi in the same way as Parcheesi, Parchís or Ludo. There is no proof to the claim that it stems from a country other than India, up to date. Moreover, no Parqués game is played in any other Latin American countries. Parqués is a mixture of the original Indian game and the influences of local Colombian culture.

In Colombia, people from all parts of the country play the game and there are local variations of it. It is very popular; played by both children and adults. Adults usually play the game by betting money on the first piece, on capturing pieces, or on winning the game, to make gameplay more interesting. There are boards for 4, 6 and 8 players. The boards usually contain pictures of soccer teams, singers, actors, or other cultural figures on the jail boxes. Also, most boards are made by fans of the game, by drawing and framing them.

The board itself is usually placed on a box covered by glass. The use of glass is to allow dice to be thrown more easily. There are versions of the board that are made of paper to make it portable.

==Gameplay==
Parqués is played with two dice; two to eight players can compete in the same match, depending on what type of game board is used. Each player is given four pieces and uses a specific color. That color is useful to identify the pieces, the jails and the arrival squares of each player. The most common colors are red, blue, yellow and green, usually arranged in that order. The game can also be played with fewer than four pieces.

The jail box is where the pieces are placed at the beginning of the match and it is where they go whenever an opponent &quot;captures&quot; them. The player throws the dice three times and attempts to get a pair in order to &quot;free&quot; the pieces.

Once the pieces are freed, they are placed in a special box next to the jail. This box is called &quot;Home&quot;, or &quot;Salida&quot; (literally, &quot;exit&quot; in Spanish. It means it is the place where the pieces exit or get out from the jail).

If a player does not roll any pairs during his turn, the dice are passed to the player on the right. Otherwise, the first player frees the pieces and wins an extra turn to move them. The player throws again and must move the points of the dice with either 1 or 2 pieces.

For example:

The player rolls 5-3
*The player can move 8 squares forward with one piece &quot;or&quot;
*The player can move 5 squares with one piece and 3 with another

If some points cannot be used, they are forfeited. After the player makes a move, the turn must be passed to the player on the right (anti-clockwise)

The pieces cannot advance backwards, and they cannot be in any of the four boxes before their &quot;Home&quot; box.

==Throws and turns==
Each player can throw the dice once. There are some exceptions to this rule:

*If the player has all his pieces in jail, he can throw up to three times until he frees them with a pair. If doubles are not rolled during the three tries, he passes the turn.
*If the player throws a pair during any turn, he wins an extra turn.
*If the player throws three consecutive doubles, he is rewarded by moving any piece of his/her to the goal. If the die hits a chest piece the person who rolled has to roll again

==Capturing pieces==
The player can capture an opponent&#x27;s piece by placing his own piece on the same box as the other player&#x27;s piece. However, he cannot capture a piece that is on a safe or a home box. Capturing in Colombia is called &quot;eating&quot; (&quot;comer&quot; in Spanish). The captured piece is sent to the player&#x27;s jail (nest).

However, the player can capture pieces on his home box. When he frees any piece from jail, the pieces placed on his home are captured, that is, sent to its jail, losing all their advances.

When a player avoids capturing a piece, it usually happens by mistake. On that case, an opponent must point the mistake out to all the players. The piece that did not capture its opponent must go to jail. Capturing opponents is mandatory and therefore takes priority above any other possible plays including the chance to leave jail.

== Special boxes ==
There are three types of special boxes.

* Home: (Salida) where the pieces are placed when freed.
* Safe: (Seguro) the pieces cannot be captured on this box
* Arrival: (Llegada) a player must move his pieces through nine final boxes to try to win the game. These boxes are usually the same color as that player&#x27;s pieces. The ninth box is the last box in the game for each person. If a piece reaches that box, it is removed from the game. When all of a player&#x27;s pieces are out of the game, the player wins.

==Variations==
*&quot;Vuelta obligada&quot; (mandatory restart): If the player has its piece near the end and he gets the exact value to capture a piece in the four boxes before his HOME box, he must capture it and move that piece from there in subsequent moves, losing all the advance of the piece.
*&quot;Cielo robado&quot; (stolen heaven): if the player gets the exact value to capture a piece on alien arrival boxes, he can win the game from there, as if they were his own arrival point.
*&quot;De piedra en piedra&quot; (from stone to stone): the player can only move its pieces on the safe and home boxes. Thus, he can only move when the dice values are exactly 7, 5, 10 or 12, depending on the position of his pieces. Capturing can only be done in SAFE boxes, never on home.
*&quot;Con Policía&quot; (With Policeman): An additional piece is placed on each safe and players are able to capture pieces by moving this &quot;policeman&quot; to the position required. If a player fails to realize the move, his most advanced piece is sent to jail. Sometimes, to make things more interesting, the policeman is allowed to move backwards also.

==Comparison to similar games==

===Parcheesi===
*Parcheesi is also played with 2 dice it has the same goal: be the first to advance all the pieces to the end.
*Parqués has 8 safe boxes and 96 in total; Parcheesi has 16 and 68, respectively.
*In Parcheesi, doublets (pairs) also have the same special purpose (getting an extra turn).
*Capturing is done the same way.
*In Parcheesi, 5 has a special meaning, allowing to get pieces out of the nest. It is different from Parqués, where 5 is a regular value.
*It is not possible more than 2 pawns in the same square; Parqués has no restriction of this type.
*Parcheesi game has blockades, supporting different variations concerning the way to break them.
*If all the pawns are outside the jail, the values below the dice can also be used. For example, if the player gets 6-6, 1-1 can be moved also. For example, with 2 pawns he could move 7 with one pawn and 7 with another one. With 3 pawns he would move 6-1-7, respectively. With 4 he could move 6-6-1-1. Therefore, with this type of play, the player would always move 14. If all of the 14 cannot be used, the turn is forfeited.
*If a player gets three consecutive doublets, he can get a pawn out of the game, as in Parqués.
*After eating a pawn, it is possible to advance the score left with the same pawn (this is forbidden in Parqués)
*When a player sends another player&#x27;s pawn to jail, he gains 20 points that he may move with only one of his pawns.
*When a pawn gets the arrival square, the player gains 10 points he can use to move a single pawn. If he cannot do it, the points are lost.

Variations by country:

*Človeče nehnevaj sa: Slovakia
*Člověče nezlob se: Czech Republic
*Ludo: England
*Mens Erger Je Niet: Netherlands
*Mensch ärgere dich nicht: Germany
*Non t&#x27;arrabiare: Italy
*Parcheesi: USA
*Parchís: Spain
*Parqués: Colombia

<doc id="282896" wikidata="Q106897030" url="?curid=282896" title="Battle of Sävar">
<text>The Battle of Sävar was fought on Saturday, 19 August 1809, between Swedish and Russian forces, during the Finnish War; it was the last pitched battle to be fought in Sweden. After the Russian conquest of eastern Sweden (present-day Finland) in 1808, the Swedish forces retreated to actual Sweden. In March the following year, Russian emperor Alexander I launched a threefold attack on Sweden, to force the country into the Continental System and to cede Finland to the Russian Empire; despite early advantages at Kalix and the Åland Islands, the attack failed to achieve a quick ending to the war. After further campaigning in northern Sweden, with battles such as Skellefteå and Hörnefors, the Russian forces under Nikolay Kamensky occupied all of Västerbotten by June.

The Swedes, who were ready to cede Finland, disputed Alexander I&#x27;s demands of having the border at the Kalix River. To improve the terms, a Swedish expedition to Västerbotten was prepared, under the command of Johan af Puke, to cut off Kamensky from Russian-occupied Finland by landing at Ratan (a village north of Umeå); Fabian Wrede would simultaneously come from the south, by which Kamensky would be crushed between the two Swedish forces. The Swedes landed at Ratan on 17 August and the army, led by Gustaf Wachtmeister, marched south towards Umeå. Wachtmeister, however, was excessively cautious and failed to reach Umeå before Kamensky had already passed through the city and marched straight at him, to break free.

On the 19th, the Swedish army was attacked in a disadvantageous position at Sävar and, instead of withdrawing across the river, Wachtmeister chose to fight over the vital heights of Krutbrånet. More fighting occurred further south towards Ytterboda as Kamensky sent a diversion force to attack the Swedish flank. Around midday, Wachtmeister withdrew his troops at Krutbrånet across the river to Sävar, even though he still had five battalions in reserve - while Kamensky was down to his last. Kamensky sent another force over the river of which half attacked the Swedes near Ytterboda, who had thus far been very successful, and the other assaulted Sävar itself. As he was now cut off from the Swedes at Ytterboda, and with intensified Russian pressure across the river, Wachtmeister chose to retreat; the battle was, along with the Battle of Oravais the previous year, the bloodiest of the war.

Instead of retaking a position at Djäkneboda, as planned, Wachtmeister fell back to Ratan, which allowed the Russians to use the main road north - Kamensky had thus managed to slip out of the intended trap; he sent a force the following day to attack the Swedes at Ratan, to cover his retreat. Wrede received word of the Swedish landing on the 19th (as the battle of Sävar had already ended) and set march north the following day. He took Umeå on the 24th, as the last Russian battalion marched north. The Swedish expedition had failed to destroy Kamensky&#x27;s army, but it had been forced out of Västerbotten. According to the subsequent Treaty of Fredrikshamn, the Swedes ceded Finland to Russia all the way to the Torne River; the somewhat weaker Russian demands were most likely a result of the Västerbotten expedition.

==Background==
Following the Convention of Olkijoki, signed on 19 November, the Swedish army withdrew over the Kemi River in December and thus abandoned the eastern part of the kingdom (present-day Finland), after nine months of fighting. In March the next year, in the midst of the Swedish revolution (in which Gustav IV Adolf was overthrown and subsequently replaced by his uncle Charles XIII), Alexander I ordered a threefold attack on actual Sweden, to force the country into submission; he demanded that Sweden would enter the Continental System, while also ceding its eastern territorium to the Russian Empire. The offensive, in which about 30,000 Russians participated, forced the Swedish armies to withdraw from Åland and Umeå, while another force capitulated at Kalix, in Norrbotten. Despite the early triumphs, however, another , which deprived the Russian emperor from achieving a quick victory.

Angered by the prolonged negotiations, Alexander I ordered a continued offensive in northern Sweden; in May, a small Swedish force was quickly overwhelmed at the Battle of Skellefteå—after an heroic defence which saved the vital provisions—leading to the Russian capture of Umeå. Västerbotten, all the way from the Kemi and Öre Rivers, was thus occupied by the Russians who, after being denied the Swedish magazines, suffered greatly from the lack of provisions. These could not be brought overseas, since the Swedes had naval supremacy over the Bothnian Bay. After a Swedish counterattack at the Battle of Hörnefors by Johan August Sandels, in July, the fighting once again died out in favor of the prolonged, but ongoing, peace negotiations. Many Russian deserters seized the opportunity to surrender themselves to the closest Swedish forces. The same month, Nikolay Kamensky replaced Pavel Andreyevich Shuvalov as the overall commander of the Russian army; he made plans to force the crossing at the Öre River (behind which Sandels&#x27; army was positioned) and march into Ångermanland the following month, to collect provisions. 
===Västerbotten expedition===
Sweden, while having accepted the loss of its eastern territorium, disputed the Russian demands by Alexander I of having the border (between Sweden and Russian–Finland) established behind the Kalix River; to somehow improve the terms, a Swedish council of war on 19 July decided upon a large combined naval–land operation against Kamensky&#x27;s troops occupying Västerbotten. The Swedes mustered 10,300–11,000 men (including naval personnel), under the Supreme Command of Johan af Puke, as part of a fleet which would land 6,800 men under Gustaf Wachtmeister behind enemy lines. Simultaneously, Fabian Wrede and Sandels (with 4,000 men) would advance from the Öre River in the south, the Russian army would thus be caught between the hammer and anvil. Kamensky&#x27;s forces around Umeå counted about 8,000 men, excluding 3,500 who either served on the Russian flotilla or patrolled the coastline between Umeå and Uleåborg.

The Swedish fleet anchored outside Ratan on 16 August and started disembarking the troops the following day accordingly. Puke ordered Wachtmeister to rapidly march south to retake Umeå. On his way, Wachtmeister received false intelligence of an enemy threat to the north, against which he unnecessarily dispatched the whole Uppland Regiment with two guns. Further south, at Djäkneboda and the nearby passage, about 420 Russians were quickly beaten back by the Swedish vanguard of 220 men, after having lost 10 men in captured. As Wachtmeister feared enemy counterattacks along the way, he had his army march at a remarkably slow pace of an hour, during which only minor engagements occurred; he reached Sävar around midday on the 18th and there decided to rest his troops for the whole day and night—against the given orders by Puke which advocated for a quick march to Umeå—he was soon informed that Kamensky had turned about and was marching right at him.

Kamensky had received news of Wachtmeister&#x27;s landing in his rear on the 17th and immediately cancelled his incipient southern campaign and marched north, to confront him; he left three battalions (1,200 men) against Wrede to mask the withdrawal, supported by a reserve of 1,000 men at Umeå. Contrary to his Swedish foe, Kamensky marched rapidly with his army, which went through Umeå the following day. Without the essential land support, an attempt made by the Swedish fleet to destroy the bridge going over the Ume River, to slow down the Russian troop movements, could easily be repulsed the same day; the two Swedish forces lacked in communication as well as cooperation, with neither general willing to make any significant movements before the other. Kamensky reached Täfteå the next day, after which he continued on towards Sävar to attack the Swedish general. Wachtmeister had dispatched a battalion northwest to Tväråmark to secure a side road towards Sävar, where he remained in a disadvantageous position which was exposed from the south; had he instead marched to Umeå as planned, or even Täfteå, he would have gained a much superior position to defend.

==Battle==

Wachtmeister had 4,644 men and 10 guns at his dispositional, as several dispatchments had been sent elsewhere to cover his flanks and rear, while Kamensky&#x27;s army counted between 5,000 and 6,000 men with 8 guns. Only the first out of three Swedish divisions was deployed west of the rather fordable Sävar River, which runs south to north through the village, while the second and third initially remained on the east side. The first brigade established outposts to the west of Sävar, as well as on the vital wooded heights further southwest, called Krutbrånet—referred to, by Wachtmeister, as &quot;virtually a fortress&quot;—on which the main confrontation would take place. The distance between Krutbrånet and the Sävar bridge was about over mainly open fields and valleys, which were split by a small stream (Oxbäcken) which ran in a north-western direction from the river.

Additional Swedish outposts were established along the river to the south, towards Ytterboda—about south of Sävar and east of the river—to observe possible crossings; the wadable river bay with its overgoing ferry was of particular strategic interest to both sides. The pathway between the two villages went over Finnberget (Finnish mountain), where much of the fighting on this side would take place. The bulk of the Russian army, which was hungry, exhausted and desperate to break through the Swedish trap, was marching northeast, from Täfteå, on the main road running over Krutbrånet; 600 men had been diverted to force the crossing at the ferry, northwest of Ytterboda, to fall upon Sävar in the Swedish flank (an additional 250 was sent over later). The battlefield was, apart from the fields around Sävar and a few lakes, mainly covered in woods and some bogland which could only be traversed after certain difficulty.
===Fighting over Krutbrånet===
At 06:30, the vanguard of the first Russian column encountered the outposts of a Södermanland battalion just south of Krutbrånet. The few Swedes resisted bravely and even brought a few prisoners back, as they were eventually forced to withdraw. When Kamensky had 1,200 men at hand, he ordered a general attack towards Krutbrånet, from where the whole Swedish battalion concurrently counter-attacked; it came down to a bitter bayonet struggle, until the Swedes were eventually overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the Russian attack, which had increased to about 2,500 men. A renewed attack by the Swedish battalion, reinforced with another, was repulsed. Sometime past 08:30, Kamensky was finally able to deploy his artillery near the road on the heights, which made him the master of the summit. The Swedes retook a position slightly north, at the down slope of Krutbrånet, just south of the small stream. The two armies faced each other in rough lines—as much as the terrain allowed—north to south, in a distance of less than : The Russian formation stretched from the river in the east to the nearest lake in the west (Kesen); the Swedes, who were outnumbered, had their left to the river and the right just past Krutbrånet, opposite the Russian centre.

Wachtmeister, alarmed by the gunfire coming from Krutbrånet, sent reinforcements which allowed battalions without ammo to march back to Sävar to resupply. From his centre, Kamensky observed the Swedish movements and ordered his left wing to sweep around the Swedish right, in an attempt to separate them from the main body. As a result, the Swedish right wing drifted further apart from the centre towards the lake and beyond, where the fighting resumed in a confusing state with shifting luck. The two lines would eventually reach a length of about . Kamensky then launched an attack on the exposed Swedish centre but was checked as Swedish reinforcements came over the stream. Swedish counterattacks—mainly done by a Jönköping battalion supported by a gun—along the main road towards the Russian artillery in the centre, managed to win ground and temporarily push the Russians back. Wachtmeister failed to organize a concentrated attack to exploit the advance, as his battalions arrived successively while also fighting uphill at a disadvantage of two against three. Deprived from the essential support, the Swedish attacks stranded against the last Russian centre-reserve, but two Russian major generals had already been wounded, one of them mortally.

The Russian artillery at Krubrånet completely dominated the battle, as it fired upon the Swedish troops marching across the field towards the heights; the elevated position, however, neglected the chance for their round shot to strike multiple battalions at once. Between 10:00 and 11:00, Wachtmeister ordered additional troops to reinforce the Swedish right, to roll up the Russian left wing all the way to their centre and capture the guns at the summit. A Swedish battalion then suddenly retreated near Krutbrånet, creating a large gap in the line which had to be filled by a Kronoberg battalion, initially instructed to support the right, to prevent a centre collapse. The Russians were repelled, as were two following attacks made by them. Without the necessary support on the right, however, the Russians managed to circumvent the Swedish flank and march into the rear of their enemies, threatening to cut them off from Sävar. At 11:30, Wachtmeister dispatched orders to his battalions near Krutbrånet to withdraw across the river. The lack of ammunition among the battalions was a contributing factor. The battalions withdrew successively, as they received the order, resulting in several rear attacks made by the pursuing Russians. The Swedes established defences in front of Sävar to cover the retreat, while the bridge was broken down and troops waded across the river.

===Fighting towards Ytterboda===
At 06:30, Wachtmeister received a report from the Swedish outpost (25 men) observing the ferry in the south, which informed him that a Russian column (600 men) alongside some Cossacks had forced the crossing half an hour earlier. The outpost fought a retreating action for over an hour, until it was reinforced by a Swedish Jäger battalion (250 men) sent by Wachtmeister, which temporary halted the Russian advance. The Russians soon gathered their strength and once again pushed the Swedes in front of them, towards Sävar. At this time, Kamensky dispatched two additional companies (250 men) over the river. After receiving additional reports from the retreating Swedes, Wachtmeister, who thought it had only been a Russian reconnaissance force, committed his elite units—the Queen&#x27;s battalion followed by the Svea battalion—to their assistance. The two forces fighting towards Ytterboda would thus, so far, be equally matched.

The Swedes marched in a formation resembling a line which stretched all the way to the closest lake (Finnsjön) to the east; around 08:00 the first guard battalion, while assembling the withdrawing Jäger battalion, encountered the enemy about from Sävar, at Finnberget. In their hasty advance, the Swedes endured the enemy fire until they were approximately away, at which distance they unleashed a volley of their own. The Russians, shaken by the Swedish attack, withdrew south over Finnberget, under fierce fighting. Around 12:00, as the Russians had been pushed behind Ytterboda, the fighting died out as only a few Russians could be seen further ahead, at the river bank. The Swedes marched back to Finnberget to await ammunition, while half of the Jäger battalion was sent back to Sävar with captured Russian soldiers.

Subsequently, however, the Russians turned about and counter-attacked, while three additional companies—which Kamensky had just sent over the river—marched at the Swedish battalions from the back; the left wing of the Queen&#x27;s battalion (merged with the remaining jäger company) shattered after 15 minutes of desperate fighting, as it was simultaneously hit in both the flank and rear. The Svea battalion then arrived and immediately initiated a bayonet charge which threw the Russians away, after which the two battalions consolidated. At 15:00 they received orders from Wachtmeister to carefully pull back towards Sävar (at this time the Swedish main army had already begun their retreat). The Svea battalion marched off first, while the Queen&#x27;s battalion remained near Ytterboda for another hour or two, to reassemble dispersed troops. It soon became evident to the Swedes, with Sävar occupied by the enemy, that they were completely cutoff and isolated. The two battalions, largely separated from each other, successfully paved their way through the encirclement with the bayonet and reached the main army at Ratan either late at night or the following day, with about 70 captured Russians.
===Retreat from Sävar===
Sometime past 12:00, as Wachtmeister withdrew his forces across the bridge (to the initial Swedish line of defence), Kamensky pushed his army forward to the opposite side of the river bank; the strong Swedish position, with their guns blazing from the heights at Sävar, denied every attempt made by him to cross the river. Kamensky contemplated his next move, for he still had to break through the Swedish lines to escape the trap. He then received intelligence of a wadable—and unguarded—crossing at the river delta (between Sävar and Ytterboda), just before the southern bay. Kamensky sent his last viable reserve of six companies (500–600 men) over the crossing, of which half were ordered towards Sävar, and the others to attack the Swedes near Ytterboda. He also stretched his forces further north, along the river, to threaten the Swedish right flank; around 13:00, his jägers occupied the river bank north of Sävar, with its wadable crossing, and started harassing the Swedes who stood ready to defend it.

Meanwhile, a Swedish courier whom Wachtmeister had dispatched south towards Ytterboda—with the orders to withdraw to Sävar—hastily returned and notified the general of the approaching Russians at his left flank. As Wachtmeister turned his left wing to face the southern threat, the Russians, while sustaining heavy losses from canister shot, forced the crossing near the destroyed bridge. While seemingly attacked frontally and in both his flanks, Wachtmeister ordered a general retreat towards Djäkneboda at 14:45. Three Swedish battalions with two guns acted as rearguard and exchanged fire with the Russian forces occupying Sävar, until they likewise withdrew around 16:00. The Russians, apart from some Cossacks, were too bloodied and exhausted to pursue. It has since been the very last pitched battle to be fought in Sweden.

===Casualties===

Generalstaben estimates the Swedish losses at Sävar to about 482 killed or captured (29 officers), and 362 wounded (37 officers); in total, 844 men. Kamensky stated that 265 unharmed Swedes had been captured and that an additional 300 wounded had been &quot;collected at the battlefield&quot;; if the reported number of 270 captured can be considered accurate, a conclusion can be drawn at about 212 Swedes killed. The report of Swedish losses at Sävar—included in Generalstaben&#x27;s work—however, also occasionally includes losses sustained the following day at Ratan. Kamensky, on the other hand, estimated the total Swedish losses to about 2,000 men. The Swedish regimental losses were (from highest to lowest): The Engelbrechten Regiment (141); the Queen&#x27;s Life Regiment (139); the Södermanland Regiment (136); the Jönköping Regiment (127); the Life Grenadier Regiment (98); the Svea Life Guards (95); the Kronoberg Regiment (46); the Västmanland Regiment (21); the Life Guards of Horse (19); the jägers of the Uppland Regiment (17); the Svea Artillery Regiment (4); the Kalmar Regiment (1).

According to Generalstaben, Kamensky reported his losses as 612 killed (5 officers), 738 wounded (33 officers) and 260 captured (1 officer); in total 1610 men, which includes the casualties sustained at Ratan (estimated by Kamensky as 150); Hornborg, however, believes that the figure of 612 killed Russians should instead be &quot;killed and missing&quot; and that it already accounts for the 260 captured; leaving 1,350 Russian casualties in total. Furthermore, he assumes that no more than 800 Russians were killed or wounded at Sävar which, together with an additional 200 captured, would give a total of about 1,000 losses. Hornborg also believes that the Russian casualty figure at Ratan, presented by Kamensky, is unreliable and that it should undoubtfully be a lot larger; other sources puts these as high as 500–700. In his work on the Finnish War, Alexander Mikhailovsky-Danilevsky gives Kamensky&#x27;s total losses as: One major general and four officers killed, one major general and 33 officers wounded and no less than 1,500 privates killed or wounded; leaving around 1,389 losses (after excluding the ones lost at Ratan). Other authors believes that the Russians had lost three major generals, about 30 to 40 officers and between 2,000 and 3,000 privates in total during the expedition.

==Aftermath==

Wachtmeister&#x27;s decision to retreat, as well as his indecisiveness in the battle, has since been strongly criticised by many: Instead of instantly withdrawing his troops behind the river, he half-heartedly attempted to retake an advantageous position held by the enemy while being heavily outnumbered (2,300–2,800 against 3,850), with only two guns in support against eight; at the decisive moment at Krutbrånet, he still had five battalions in reserve. Once having pulled his forces across the river, Wachtmeister held an advantageous position from where his artillery could finally dominate the field. His final position was, even as the enemy demonstrated against both his flanks, most likely too strong to be taken had he made an effort to defend it. The dissatisfaction after the battle among soldiers and officers was evident—for the army did not feel beaten—only the general. Wachtmeister motivated his decision to retreat with the high amount of losses sustained (perhaps influenced by the king&#x27;s earlier request for him not to waste the last Swedish reserve). The Russians, on the other hand, had suffered greater losses, but they were led by a general determined to win; despite having the clock against him, Kamensky led an exhausted and hungry army to victory, against all odds.
===Expedition outcome===
Wachtmeister initially planned to make a stand at Djäkneboda, which was an utmost advantageous position, but he determined that the risk of being outflanked was too great and instead marched on towards Ratan; this enabled the Russians to use the main road to retreat. To cover the Russian retreat north and force the Swedes to embark their ships, Kamensky attacked the following day at 15:00, with about 3,000 men. Wachtmeister, despite having almost 6,000 men at his dispositional (excluding the naval personnel), made no serious attempt to counterattack. After five hours of fighting and fruitless negotiations, Kamensky withdrew with his army to Djäkneboda from where he observed Wachtmeister; apart from some minor skirmishing near Djäkneboda, the Swedish army remained idle until the 22nd, when it embarked the fleet. Wrede and Sandels had received word of the Swedish landing at Ratan on the afternoon of the 19th—as the battle of Sävar was already decided—and they set march north towards Umeå the next day; the march went slow since the retreating Russians had destroyed all bridges behind them.

The Swedes reached the Ume River the following day, on the 21st, just as the last Russian battalion was in the process of crossing. A small skirmish occurred, which was followed by an artillery duel across the river. The fighting had cost both sides a little more than ten dead and some wounded. A small Swedish force crossed the river to Umeå and attacked the Russian field hospital, taking some prisoners. On the 22nd, as Wrede made preparations to storm the city, Kamensky ordered a general retreat as he feared being cutoff once again, had Puke landed further north. The last Russian battalion left Umeå on the 23rd and Djäkneboda the following day, after which the retreat continued towards Piteå, where Kamensky arrived on the 29th. Wrede marched into Umeå on the 24th. Instead of immediately sailing north to cut off the Russian retreat, Puke was contented with securing Umeå; Wachtmeister once again disembarked at Ratan on the 28th and marched towards the city, where the fleet likewise sailed the next day. The two forces were thus finally united at the given destination, albeit a little too late.

Even though Kamensky had been temporarily forced out of Västerbotten all the way to Piteå, the expedition had failed to reach its mail goal to have the Russian army destroyed; the excessive cautiousness and inadequate coordination displayed between the two Swedish forces was a deciding factor. The expedition had cost the Swedes a total of 1,077 men in dead, wounded or captured, while the Russian casualties reached between 1,539 and 1,610 men. On 25 August, Kamensky fended off a Swedish attack on his fortifications at the Pite River, aimed to cut off his supply lines north. The Swedes lost 23–25 men to 33–50 Russians—it would be the last action of the war. On 2 September, the two sides agreed to an armistice which would be in effect until the Treaty of Fredrikshamn was signed: Sweden ceded its eastern territorium (Finland) all the way from the Torne River, including the Åland Islands; Kamensky&#x27;s retreat from Västerbotten, which was initially met with disappointment from many of his countrymen, had most likely contributed to Alexander I&#x27;s softer demands. The peace was followed up by the Treaty of Jönköping, which ended the Dano–Swedish War, and the Treaty of Paris in which Sweden agreed to enter the Continental System against the United Kingdom (while retaining Swedish Pomerania), leading to an inactive war between the two former allies.

<text>Princess Michael of Kent (born Baroness Marie-Christine Anna Agnes Hedwig Ida von Reibnitz, 15 January 1945) is a member of the British royal family who is of German, Austrian, Czech and Hungarian descent. She is married to Prince Michael of Kent, who is a grandson of King George V. Princess Michael of Kent was an interior designer before becoming an author; she has written several books on European royalty.

==Early life and ancestry==
Princess Michael was born &quot;Freiin&quot; (Baroness) Marie-Christine Anna Agnes Hedwig Ida von Reibnitz, on 15 January 1945, in Karlovy Vary in German-occupied Czechoslovakia, then officially &quot;Karlsbad&quot; in the German-populated Sudetenland, now in the Czech Republic. She was born at the family estates of her Austrian maternal grandmother, Princess Hedwig von Windisch-Graetz (1878–1918), shortly before the defeat of Nazi Germany and end of the Second World War in Europe. The expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia followed later that year.

By birth she is a member of the , &quot;uradel&quot; Silesian nobility who can trace their noble ancestry from 1288. The ancestral seat of the family was Rybnica in present-day Poland. On her father&#x27;s side, Princess Michael is a descendant of the Burggrafen of Dohna, Herrand III von Trauttmansdorff and Nostitz family, who are also ancestors of Queen Elizabeth II.

She is the younger daughter of &quot;Freiherr&quot; Günther Hubertus von Reibnitz (1894–1983) by his second wife, Countess Maria Anna Carolina Franziska Walburga Bernadette Szapáry von Muraszombath, Széchysziget und Szapár (1911–1988), who was the daughter of Count Friedrich Szapáry von Muraszombath, Széchysziget und Szapár, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Saint Petersburg at the outbreak of the First World War.

Princess Michael&#x27;s father was a Nazi Party member and served as a cavalry officer in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; during the Second World War. In response to the advances of the Red Army near the end of the war, the family abandoned their estates and moved to Bavaria, which was part of the American-occupied zone of Germany. Her parents divorced in 1946 and, along with her mother and elder brother Baron Friedrich von Reibnitz (born 1942), Princess Michael moved to Australia, where she was educated at Convent of the Sacred Heart, Rose Bay (now Kincoppal-Rose Bay). In the early 1960s, she lived with her father on his farm in Portuguese-ruled Mozambique. She then went from Vienna to London to study History of Fine and Decorative Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==Marriages==
Her first husband was the English banker Thomas Troubridge (1939–2015), younger brother of Sir Peter Troubridge, 6th Baronet. They met at a boar hunt in Germany and were married on 14 September 1971 at Chelsea Old Church, London. The couple separated in 1973 and were civilly divorced in 1977. The marriage was ecclesiastically annulled by Pope Paul VI in May 1978.

One month after the annulment, on 30 June 1978, at a civil ceremony in Vienna, Austria, she married Prince Michael of Kent, the son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. Prince Michael is a grandson of King George V. Marie-Christine has named Lord Mountbatten as their matchmaker.

Michael presented Marie-Christine with a two-stone sapphire-and-diamond ring made from stones that belonged to his mother, Princess Marina. For the ball held after the wedding, she wore the City of London diamond fringe tiara and a cream dress from Bellville Sassoon. Upon their marriage, she was accorded the style and title of &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Michael of Kent, the female equivalent to her husband&#x27;s title. After receiving Pope John Paul II&#x27;s permission, the couple later received a blessing of their marriage in a Roman Catholic ceremony on 29 June 1983 at Archbishop&#x27;s House, London.

Since the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited anyone who married a Roman Catholic from succeeding to the throne, Prince Michael of Kent (at that time, 15th in the line of succession) lost his succession rights upon marrying Marie-Christine. Prince Michael was reinstated to the line of succession to the British throne on 26 March 2015 with the passing of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. Their children are members of the Church of England and have retained their rights of succession since birth.

Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have two children:
*Lord Frederick Windsor, born 6 April 1979 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. He married Sophie Winkleman on 12 September 2009 and they have two daughters: Maud (born 15 August 2013) and Isabella (born 16 January 2016).
*Lady Gabriella Kingston, born 23 April 1981 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. She married Thomas Kingston on 18 May 2019. Her husband shot himself on 25 February 2024 in the Cotswolds, Gloucestershire, leaving her widowed at 42 years old.

Marie-Christine was linked romantically by the press to John Warner and tycoons Ward Hunt and Mikhail Kravchenko. She also had a friendship with John W. Galbreath and Peter de Savary, the latter of whom gifted her a £150,000 parcel of land on Antigua.

==Career==

Before her marriage to Prince Michael, she worked as an interior designer. According to a report in &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s Pendennis column in September 2007, the Princess resumed decorating under her original company, &quot;Szapar Designs&quot;. In 1986, her first book &quot;Crowned in a Far Country: Portraits of Eight Royal Brides&quot; was published, after which she faced allegations of plagiarism and reached an out-of-court settlement with another author. Her second book &quot;Cupid and the King: Five Royal Paramours&quot; faced the same issues, which the Princess attributed to the researcher, who had allegedly submitted notes without due attribution. The book was to be published by Michael Joseph, but after the draft was submitted several months late, it was rejected and published by HarperCollins. From 2007 to 2011, the Princess served as president of Partridge Fine Art, a gallery in London&#x27;s New Bond Street until it went into administration having suffered substantial multi-year losses. In 2008, the Princess was engaged as a consultant by Galerie Gmurzynska in Switzerland, and later became their international ambassador. She also served on the board of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and goes on lecture tours around the world where she talks about historical subjects at universities, museums and galleries to promote her books and endorse her charities. Marie-Christine, whose husband has a strong interest in Russia, was reportedly taking Russian lessons as of May 2012.

==Royal and charitable activities==

Prince and Princess Michael represented the Queen at the Belize independence celebrations and at the coronation of King Mswati III of Eswatini. Prince Michael also supports a large number of charities and organisations, and Princess Michael supports him in his work.

Since she was a teenager, Princess Michael has held a long and enduring passion for the conservation of cheetahs and she is international royal patron for the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia. She is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, a learned society dedicated to natural history and taxonomy.

==Finances==
Prince Michael has never received a parliamentary annuity or an allowance from the Privy Purse. The couple have had the use of a five-bedroom, five-reception grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace. Queen Elizabeth II had paid the rent for the apartment at a market rate of £120,000 annually from her own private funds with the couple paying the nominal amount of £70 per week. The rent goes to the Grant-in-aid, provided by the Government for the maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces. The rent is based on the current rate for commercially rented properties at Kensington Palace, and is recorded in the overall figures for commercial rents in the Grant-in-aid annual report. This rent payment by the Queen is &quot;in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding&quot;, according to a statement released by the British Monarchy Media Centre.

In 2008, it was announced that it had been agreed that Prince and Princess Michael would pay rent of £120,000 a year from their own funds from 2010. Members of Parliament on the public accounts committee had demanded the change after the Kents&#x27; rent had come to light. The Kents have lived in the apartment since 1979, paying only their utility bills prior to 2002.

==Catholicism==
Princess Michael of Kent is a Roman Catholic, and attended several events during Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the United Kingdom in September 2010. 

She attended Mass in Westminster Cathedral on Saturday, 18 September, where she was seated in the first row among other dignitaries, including Lord and Lady Nicholas Windsor, the Duke of Norfolk and former Prime Minister Tony Blair; the Pope gave them an audience after Mass. 

On the last day of the Pope&#x27;s visit, 19 September, she attended the open-air Mass of beatification for Cardinal John Henry Newman at Cofton Park, Birmingham. Princess Michael was personally involved in the beatification process and attended several other celebrations relating to his beatification before and after the Cofton Park Mass, including a commemorative concert of the &quot;Dream of Gerontius&quot; at Birmingham Town Hall on 18 September. 

She also attended a civic dinner with invited dignitaries and bishops in Birmingham, before attending the Mass and meeting the Pope. Previously, in November 2008, the Princess attended the translation of remains of Cardinal Newman at Birmingham Oratory along with other guests of honour, including Francis Campbell, HM Ambassador to the Holy See; the Lord Mayor of Birmingham and Lady Mayoress; Sir Ivor Roberts, President of Trinity College, Oxford, and formerly British Ambassador to Italy; and Sir Derek Morris, Provost of Oriel College, Oxford. After the Translation Mass, Princess Michael was shown round Cardinal Newman&#x27;s Room and Chapel and visited Newman&#x27;s library.

Princess Michael of Kent represented the Duke of Edinburgh at the launching ceremony of the Green Pilgrimage Network in Assisi, Italy, on 1 November 2011. It was organised by the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC), founded by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1995, in association with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), of which Prince Philip was formerly President. The Princess spoke on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh and led the opening procession.

On 2 July 2024, &quot;The Times&quot; published a letter to the editor, co-signed by Princess Michael of Kent and other Catholic and non-Catholic public figures, calling upon the Holy See to preserve what they describe as the &quot;magnificent&quot; cultural artifact of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Traditional Latin Mass.

==Views and controversies==

The Princess has a controversial history of statements and actions that have been accused of being racist.

The media claim she once declared to an American fashion magazine that she had &quot;more royal blood in her veins than any person to marry into the royal family since Prince Philip&quot;. After being told about Princess Michael&#x27;s lineage by Lord Mountbatten, Queen Elizabeth II reportedly joked that she was &quot;a bit too grand for us&quot;.

In 2004, she was accused of racially insulting black diners at a restaurant in New York. A spokesperson acknowledged that the Princess had been angry at the group, who were seated at a table near her, but denied that she had told them to &quot;go back to the colonies&quot;. In an interview with a newspaper she reflected on her encounter with &quot;a group of rappers&quot;, which in fact included the TV reporter A. J. Calloway as well as a banker, a lawyer, and a music mogul.

In February 2005, she gave a series of interviews to promote her book, in one of which she said that Britons should be more concerned about the bloodlines of their children, and claimed that the British media were &quot;excited&quot; by Prince Harry&#x27;s decision to wear a swastika for a fancy dress party because of the British press&#x27; &quot;ownership structure&quot;. She claimed that &quot;nobody would have got excited&quot; had he worn the hammer and sickle.

In September 2005, she talked to Mazher Mahmood, a &quot;News of the World&quot; journalist posing as a fake sheikh and potential buyer for Nether Lypiatt Manor, Princess Michael and her husband&#x27;s country home at the time. The Princess shared her opinions on Diana, Princess of Wales, describing her as a &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;nasty&quot; woman. She went on to say that Charles, Prince of Wales, was &quot;jealous&quot; of his former wife&#x27;s popularity, and that he had effectively married a &quot;womb&quot;. She also added that the Prince&#x27;s Duchy Originals jams were not homemade: &quot;He&#x27;s got factories. It&#x27;s just got his name on it.&quot;

On hearing that research by Dorothy Cheney and Robert Seyfarth seemed to indicate that rank among female baboons is hereditary, the Princess is reported to have said: &quot;I always knew that when people who aren&#x27;t like us claim that hereditary rank is not part of human nature, they must be wrong. Now you&#x27;ve given me evolutionary proof!&quot;

In January 2014, the Princess was interviewed by Conrad Black. She described the older generation of the royal family as &quot;boring for most people&quot;. Princess Michael also said that she was &quot;very fond of&quot; Diana, Princess of Wales, but also stated that she had &quot;little education&quot;, and both she and Sarah, Duchess of York, were abandoned by their mothers at a young age, which made it hard for them to deal with their status as royal figures.

In September 2015, the Princess was in the news for stating publicly that animals do not have rights because they do not pay taxes, have bank accounts or vote.

In December 2017, the Princess was criticised for wearing a blackamoor brooch with a stylised figure of an African man to a Christmas banquet at Buckingham Palace. Meghan Markle, later the Duchess of Sussex, a mixed-race American woman of African and European descent, and at the time the fiancée of Prince Harry, was present at the dinner. A spokesperson for the Princess later said that she &quot;is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence&quot;.

In April 2018, her daughter&#x27;s former partner, Aatish Taseer, alleged that the Princess had owned a pair of black sheep that she named after Venus and Serena Williams.

==Health==
In 1985, Marie-Christine was hospitalised for one week to undergo treatments for &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot;. In 2002, she was treated for skin cancer. In May 2021, it was reported that Princess Michael was suffering from blood clots after being diagnosed with COVID-19 six months earlier. She is known to have suffered from lung issues in her childhood. In late 2024, she fell down stairs at her Kensington Palace apartment and broke both wrists ahead of a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace hosted by Charles III.

<doc id="282905" wikidata="Q241243" url="?curid=282905" title="Provençal dialect">
<text>Provençal (, , , ; or ) is a variety of Occitan, spoken by people in Provence and parts of Drôme and Gard. The term Provençal used to refer to the entire Occitan language, but more recently it has referred only to the variety of Occitan spoken in Provence. However, it can still be found being used to refer to Occitan as a whole, &quot;e.g.&quot; Merriam-Webster states that it can be used to refer to general Occitan, though this is going out of use.

Provençal is also the customary name given to the older version of the Occitan language used by the troubadours of medieval literature, when Old French or the &quot;&quot; was limited to the northern areas of France. Thus, the ISO 639-3 code for Old Occitan is [pro].

In 2007, all the ISO 639-3 codes for Occitan dialects, including [prv] for Provençal, were retired and merged into [oci] Occitan. The old codes ([prv], [auv], [gsc], [lms], [lnc]) are no longer in active use, but still have the meaning assigned to them when they were established in the Standard.

Some groups have called for Provençal&#x27;s recognition as a full language, distinct from Occitan. The Regional Council of Provence has variously labelled Provençal as a dialect of Occitan or as a distinct language, depending on different lobbies and political majorities.

==Subdialects==
The main subdialects of Provençal are:
* &quot;Rodanenc&quot; (in French &quot;Rhodanien&quot;) around the lower Rhone river, Arles, Avignon, Nîmes.
** A Rodanenc subvariety, the &quot;Shuadit&quot; (or Judeo-Provençal), has been considered extinct since 1977. It was spoken by the Jewish community around Avignon. When Jews were granted freedom of residence in France the dialect declined.
* &quot;Maritim&quot; or &quot;Centrau&quot; or &quot;Mediterranèu&quot; (Maritime or Central or Mediterranean) around Aix-en-Provence, Marseille, Toulon, Cannes, Antibes, Grasse, Forcalquier, Castellane, Draguignan.
* &quot;Niçard&quot; in the lower County of Nice.

&quot;Gavòt&quot; (in French &quot;Gavot&quot;), spoken in the Western Occitan Alps, around Digne, Sisteron, Gap, Barcelonnette and the upper County of Nice, but also in a part of the Ardèche, is not exactly a subdialect of Provençal, but rather a closely related Occitan dialect, also known as Vivaro-Alpine. So is the dialect spoken in the upper valleys of Piedmont, Italy (Val Maira, Val Varaita, Val Stura di Demonte, Entracque, Limone Piemonte, Vinadio, Sestriere). Some people view Gavòt as a variety of Provençal since a part of the Gavot area (near Digne and Sisteron) belongs to historical Provence.

==Orthography==
When written in the Mistralian norm (&quot;&quot;), definite articles are in the masculine singular, in the feminine singular and in the masculine and feminine plural ( before vowels). Nouns and adjectives usually drop the Latin masculine endings, but &quot;-e&quot; remains; the feminine ending is &quot;-o&quot; (this is the opposite of the neighbouring Italian masculine gender). Nouns do not inflect for number, but all adjectives ending in vowels (&quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot;) become &quot;-i&quot;, and all plural adjectives take &quot;-s&quot; before vowels.

When written in the classical norm (&quot;&quot;), definite articles are masculine [lu], feminine [la], and plural [lej/lejz = li/liz]. Nouns and adjectives usually drop the Latin masculine endings, but &quot;-e&quot; [e] remains; the feminine ending is &quot;-a&quot; [ɔ]. Nouns inflect for number, all adjectives ending in vowels (&quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-a&quot;) become &quot;-ei/-eis&quot; [ej/ejz = i/iz] in some syntactic positions, and most plural adjectives take &quot;-s&quot;.

Pronunciation remains the same in both norms (Mistralian and classical), which are only two different ways to write the same language.

The IETF language tags register for the Mistralian orthography and for the classical one.

==Literature==
Modern Provençal literature was given impetus by Nobel laureate Frédéric Mistral and the association, Félibrige, which he founded with other writers, such as Théodore Aubanel. The beginning of the 20th century saw other authors like Joseph d&#x27;Arbaud, Batisto Bonnet and Valère Bernard. It has been enhanced and modernized since the second half of the 20th century by writers such as Robèrt Lafont, Pierre Pessemesse, Claude Barsotti, , , , , , , Bernat Giély, and many others.

<doc id="282915" wikidata="Q492095" url="?curid=282915" title="Connexion by Boeing">
<text>Connexion by Boeing (CBB) was an in-flight online internet connectivity service from Boeing. This service allowed travellers to access a high-speed internet connection while on board a plane in flight through a wired Ethernet or a wireless 802.11 Wi-Fi connection. Connexion by Boeing was formed as a separate business unit of The Boeing Company. Major development on the service commenced with a partnership agreement between United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines on June 13, 2001. Lufthansa joined the partnership as the International launch customer on June 17, 2001. United, Delta, and American subsequently withdrew from the partnership after the 9/11 terrorist attacks due to the severe drop in airline travel that occurred after the attacks.

==Infrastructure==
The infrastructure initially used a phased array Ku band antenna manufactured by Boeing and later a reflector antenna developed and manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation on the aircraft, leased satellite transponders, and ground stations. The service provided downlink speeds of up to 20 Mbit/s and uplink speeds up to 2 Mbit/s. Speed varied due to many factors including resource availability, aircraft location, and regulatory restrictions. A license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was first received on December 27, 2001. The United Kingdom subsequently on July 24, 2002 granted Boeing a license for operating over its territory. Other nations followed in granting operating licenses for the service. The service coverage included North America, North Atlantic, Europe, the Middle East, Northern Pacific, Australia, and Asia. While other providers have provided in-flight internet, Connexion by Boeing accomplished it first for flights over water.

Ground stations were located in Vancouver Island Canada, Ibaraki Japan, Moscow Russia, Littleton, Colorado US, and Leuk Switzerland. Two supporting data centers were also used to control the service. These were located in Kent, Washington and Irvine, California.

==First run==
The service was first commercially demonstrated onboard two Boeing 747-400 aircraft that were operated by Lufthansa and British Airways in 2003. Service was provided between Frankfurt Airport - Washington Dulles and London Heathrow - New York JFK.
Connexion by Boeing was first launched as a commercial service May 17, 2004 with Lufthansa. Later in 2004, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines signed on to the service. Other airlines which launched Connexion by Boeing service in 2005 include China Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Asiana Airlines and Korean Air. In the later months of 2005, El-Al Israel Airlines and Etihad Airways offered the service. In 2005 Connexion by Boeing launched the first in-flight live streaming TV service on an international route on Singapore Airlines, to be expanded to all current airlines in the first quarter of 2006. The service provided four channels of live TV to each aircraft, and available TV programming varied depending on geographical location. Flying out of Germany, the service provided access to live streaming TV for CNBC (Europe), EurosportNews, BBC World and EuroNews. MSNBC was available for flights over North America. Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Media technology was used to generate the multicast TV streams, and users had to have Windows Media Player installed to watch them.

==Cost==
Original prices varied from airline to airline, but were typically $9.95 for one hour of access, $14.95 for less than three hours of access, $19.95 for 3 to 6 hours of access, and $29.95 for unlimited access, however, these prices were determined by the length of the flight rather than actual or desired access time. In comparison, the typical cost at that time of unlimited dial-up internet access for an entire month was $20. Various payment options were allowed: major credit cards, mobile phone, hotspot accounts and even frequent flyer miles. In an effort to get more passengers to use the service, new pricing was announced in January 2006.

Boeing offered free service starting on October 2, 2006 as part of its plan to discontinue the service on December 31, 2006.

==Features==
The service had a live helpdesk chat feature available for customers who have troubles with their connections. Connexion sponsors the business travel blog, InFlightHQ.

Connexion by Boeing also extended its internet service to include the maritime market in 2005. The first maritime vessels equipped with Connexion by Boeing service were provisioned in 2006.

The business unit also developed a small business jet version of its service in a partnership with Rockwell Collins.

==Expansion and dissolution==
On January 16, 2006 Boeing also certified other companies such as Korean Air based in South Korea to carry out the Connexion by Boeing modification.

On June 26, 2006 it became public that Boeing was exploring selling or shutting down Connexion By Boeing, having failed to attract sufficient customers. The lack of sufficient customers was speculated to be a direct result of the U.S. domestic carriers pulling from agreements with Connexion after 9/11. While the European market thrived on the service, no U.S. domestic carriers were able to justify the approximate $500,000 USD per plane investment and the weight cost of the additional hardware.

On August 17, 2006, Boeing announced that it would discontinue its Connexion service, stating that, &quot;the market for this service has not materialized as had been expected.&quot;

While the consumer service offered by CBB officially ended December 31, 2006 at midnight, Connexion&#x27;s government contracts for the same service to U.S. Government planes continue under the new name of Boeing Broadband Satcom Network (BBSN) and likely will for the next several years.

<doc id="282925" wikidata="Q686449" url="?curid=282925" title="Thomas Truxtun">
<text>Commodore Thomas Truxtun (February 17, 1755 – May 5, 1822) was a United States Navy officer and politician. During the American Revolutionary War, he served as a privateer. Truxtun eventually rose to the rank of Commodore in the late eighteenth century and later served in the Quasi-War with France. He was one of the first six commanders appointed to the new U.S. Navy by President George Washington. During his naval career he commanded a number of famous U.S. naval ships, including and . Later in civilian life he became involved with politics and was also elected as a sheriff. Six U.S. Navy warships have been named for Truxtun since 1842.

==Early life and education==
Truxtun was born near Hempstead, Province of New York on Long Island, the only son of an English-born lawyer. He lost his father at a young age and was taken to Jamaica on Long Island with relatives and placed under the care of a close friend, John Troup. Having little chance for a formal education, he joined the crew of the British merchant ship &quot;Pitt&quot; at the age of 12, against his father&#x27;s previous wishes for him to pursue a career in politics.

==Naval service==

Because of his skills, by the time he was twenty, Truxtun had garnered command of his own vessel, &quot;Andrew Caldwell&quot;. Before the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War he was impressed into a Royal Navy ship and was offered a midshipman&#x27;s commission, which he turned down.

After being wounded in action against an American privateer, he decided never to fight against his countrymen again. He then operated as a U.S. privateer during the American Revolutionary War, commanding several ships: &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Independence&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;, and &quot;St. James&quot;. Truxtun captured several British ships during the conflict, and was never once defeated himself.

After the war he returned to the merchant marine, with a high reputation as a seaman. He was the author of a treatise on longitude and latitude, of a &quot;System of masting a 44-gun frigate,&quot; and was an advocate for the foundation of a national navy. He remained in the marine for 12 years. In 1786 he commanded &quot;Canton&quot;, operating from Philadelphia, one of the first American ships to engage in trade with China. When the United States Navy was reconstituted in 1798 he was one of the original corps of six captains.

==Quasi-War==
In 1794 and the war with France looming, Truxtun was one of the first six captains appointed by President Washington in the newly formed US Navy. During the Quasi-War with France, Truxtun commanded . For his first assignment he had previously overseen her construction in Baltimore, Maryland, with Silas Talbot. After a rank dispute with captains Dale and Talbot, Truxtun was placed in charge of the ship by President Washington. He commanded her with considerable success.

===&quot;Constellation&quot; engages &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;===

In the early years of the new nation, American commerce suffered much interference from other seafaring nations, and it was during this period that Truxtun gave celebrated service to the navy. First,
because of constant French privateering attacks against American vessels, an American squadron commanded by Truxtun was sent to the West Indies to patrol the waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. Also on board was the young and later famous John Rodgers, acting 1st Lieutenant. On 9 February 1799, while sailing independently of his squadron in his flagship &quot;Constellation&quot;, Truxtun encountered and engaged the French frigate &quot;L″Insurgente&quot;, a larger and more heavily armed vessel commanded by Captaine Barreau. After chasing the French ship through a storm, &quot;Constellation&quot; was able to force &quot;L″Insurgente&quot; into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes. Barreau did not strike his colors until his ship was almost a complete wreck. French losses were 29 killed and 44 wounded, while Truxtun&#x27;s crew only suffered one killed and two wounded. It was the first battle engagement since the Revolutionary War that an American ship had encountered an enemy ship.

===&quot;Constellation&quot; engages &quot;La Vengeance&quot;===

On 31 January 1800, &quot;Constellation&quot; engaged &quot;La Vengeance&quot;, a larger vessel with a broadside of compared to &quot;Constellation&quot;″s . &quot;Constellation&quot; had sailed under Truxtun from Saint Kitts on 30 January, and encountered &quot;La Vengeance&quot; the following day. &quot;La Vengeance&quot; was bound for France under Capitaine de Vaisseau François Pitot carrying passengers and specie, and initially attempted to outrun &quot;Constellation&quot;. During the battle &quot;Constellation&quot; was partially dismasted and was forced to make her way to Jamaica. Thirty six hours after the engagement with &quot;La Vengeance&quot;, while passing the eastern end of Puerto Rico, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Shaw, arrived and fell in with Truxtun. After a short fall in Truxtun sent &quot;Enterprise&quot; to Philadelphia with important dispatches.

Truxtun&#x27;s victory against La Vengeance made him a hero of the time; when he arrived home he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal on 29 March 1800, becoming the eighth recipient of that body&#x27;s &quot;highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions.&quot;

==Command of USS &quot;President&quot;==
 was launched on 10 April 1800 and, at the time, was considered America&#x27;s fastest sailing ship. She was the last of the original six frigates launched. After the vessel was fitted out for sea duty, she set sail for Guadeloupe on 5 August with Captain Truxtun in command, relieving Stephen Decatur. She conducted routine patrols during the latter part of the Quasi-War and recaptured several American merchant ships; however, her overall service in this period was uneventful. She returned to the United States in March after a peace treaty with France was ratified on 3 February 1801.

During this period, Truxtun was involved in a dispute over rank with Richard Dale. Truxtun took command of &quot;President&quot; for a few months in 1800. On 15 April, 1801 he wrote the Acting Secretary of the Navy proposing increased work assignments for Marines stationed on ships, and more control by ship&#x27;s Captains over assignment of Marine Officers to their ships, or the abolishment of the United States Marine Corps if greater authority couldn&#x27;t be granted. The proposal was rejected in a 28 June, 1801 letter sent to Capt. Silas Talbot. He retired from the Navy and located first in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and later in Philadelphia. He was ordered to take command of USS Chesapeake on 12 January, 1802 by the Secretary of the Navy. He proposed that he should be squadron commander of the new squadron leaving for the Mediterranean, or he should leave the service, in a letter to Secretary of the Navy dated 3 March, 1802. Secretary of the Navy ordered Capt. Richard V. Morris to take command of Chesapeake in a letter dated 11 March, 1802. He was relieved of command by the Navy Secretary in a letter dated 13 March with Lt. William Smith taking temporary command of USS Chesapeake.

==Writer==
Truxtun had a thorough understanding of the art of celestial navigation and was one among few men of his day who possessed such intimate knowledge of this navigational art. He also designed the original Navy signal manual and wrote the predecessor to the &quot;Navy Regulations&quot; in use today.

==Later civilian life==
Truxtun ran an unsuccessful campaign for the United States House of Representatives in 1810. In 1816 he was elected sheriff of Philadelphia County, serving until 1819. He also published several books, well known at the time, covering navigation, and naval tactics.

Truxtun died in Philadelphia on 5 May 1822 and is buried at Christ Church Burial Ground. He was the grandfather of American historian Mary Henderson Eastman. as well as naval officer Edward Fitzgerald &quot;Ned&quot; Beale, who became a national figure in the 19th century as an explorer, frontiersman, Indian affairs superintendent, California rancher, and close friend of Kit Carson and President Ulysses S. Grant.

<doc id="282937" wikidata="Q3547868" url="?curid=282937" title="Ukawsaw Gronniosaw">
<text>Ukawsaw Gronniosaw (c. 1705 – 28 September 1775), also known as James Albert, was an enslaved African man who is considered the first published African in Britain. Gronniosaw is known for his 1772 narrative autobiography &quot;A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African Prince, as Related by Himself&quot;, which was the first slave narrative published in England. His autobiography recounted his early life in present-day Nigeria, his enslavement, and his eventual emancipation.

== Life ==
Gronniosaw was born in Bornu (now north-eastern Nigeria) in 1705. He said he was doted on as the grandson of the king of Zaara. At 15, he was kidnapped by a Gold Coast ivory merchant and sold to a Dutch captain for two yards of check cloth. An American bought him in Barbados, took him to New York, and resold him for £50 to &quot;Mr. Freelandhouse, a very gracious, good Minister.&quot; Freelandhouse is presumed to be the Dutch Reformed Church minister, Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen, who lived in New Jersey and pastored churches in Middlesex and Somerset counties in the Raritan Valley.

In New Jersey, Gronniosaw was taught to read and brought up as a Christian. Gronniosaw wrote in his autobiography that he wanted to return to his family in Africa, but Frelinghuysen denied this request and told him to focus on the Christian faith. During his time with Frelinghuysen, Gronniosaw attempted suicide, distressed by his perceived failings as a Christian. When the minister died, he freed Gronniosaw in his will. Gronniosaw worked for the minister&#x27;s widow and, subsequently, their orphans, but all died within four years.

Planning to go to England, where he expected to meet other pious people like the Frelinghuysens, Gronniosaw travelled to the Caribbean, where he enlisted as a cook with a privateer, and later as a soldier in the 28th Regiment of Foot to earn money for the journey. He served in Martinique and Cuba, before obtaining his discharge and sailing to England.

At first, he settled in Portsmouth, but when his landlady swindled him out of most of his savings, he was forced to seek his fortune in London. There, he married a young English widow, Betty, a weaver. She already had a child and bore him at least two more. She lost her job because of the financial depression and industrial unrest and moved to Colchester. There, they were saved from starvation by Osgood Hanbury (a Quaker lawyer and grandfather of the abolitionist Fowell Buxton), who employed Gronniosaw in building work. Moving to Norwich, Gronniosaw and his family again fell on hard times, as the building trades were largely seasonal. Once again, they were saved by the kindness of a Quaker, Henry Gurney (coincidentally, the grandfather of Fowell Buxton&#x27;s wife, Hannah Gurney), who paid their rent arrears. A daughter died and was refused burial by the local clergy because she was not baptised. One minister at last offered to allow her to be buried in the churchyard, but he would not read the burial service.

After pawning all their possessions, the family moved to Kidderminster, where Betty supported them by working again as a weaver. On Christmas Day 1771, Gronniosaw had their remaining children, Mary Albert (aged six), Edward Albert (aged four), and newborn Samuel Albert, baptised in the Old Independent Meeting House in Kidderminster by Benjamin Fawcett, a Dissenting minister and associate of Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon and a significant figure in Calvinistic Methodism. At around the same time, Gronniosaw received a letter and a charitable donation from Hastings herself. On 3 January 1772, he responded by thanking her for her &#x27;favour&#x27;, which arrived &#x27;at a time of great necessity&#x27;, and explained that he had just returned from &#x27;Mrs Marlowe&#x27;s&#x27; in nearby Leominster, &#x27;were I was shewed kindness to from my Christian friends&#x27;. On 25 June 1774, Gronniosaw&#x27;s fifth child, James Albert junior, was baptised again by Fawcett.

Shortly after he arrived in Kidderminster, Gronniosaw began work on his life story with the help of an amanuensis from Leominster, possibly the &#x27;Mrs Marlowe&#x27; he had mentioned in his letter to Hastings. Gronniosaw&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; has been studied by scholars as a groundbreaking work by an African in English. It is the first known slave narrative published in England and received wide attention, with multiple printings and editions.

Gronniosaw&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; concludes with its author still living in Kidderminster, having &quot;appear[ed] to be turn&#x27;d sixty&quot;; for a long time, nothing was known of his later life. However, at some point during the late twentieth century, an obituary for Gronniosaw was discovered in the &quot;Chester Chronicle&quot;. The article, from 2 October 1775, reads:On Thursday [28 September] died, in this city, aged 70, James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African Prince, of Zaara. He left his country in the early part of his life, with a view to acquire proper notions of the Divine Being, and of the worship due to Him. He met with many trials and embarrassments, was much afflicted and persecuted. His last moments exhibited that chearful [&quot;sic&quot;] serenity which, at such a time, is the certain effect of a thorough conviction of the great truths of Christianity. He published a narrative of his life.

The burial register for the Church of England parish church of St Oswald, Chester - a church which occupied the south transept of Chester Cathedral from 1448 to 1881 - includes an entry from 28 September 1775 for &quot;James Albert (a Blackm[an])&quot;, giving his age as 70. Gronniosaw&#x27;s grave has not been identified.

==The autobiography==

Gronniosaw&#x27;s autobiography was produced in Kidderminster in 1772. It is entitled &quot;A Narrative of the Most remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African Prince, As related by himself.&quot; The title page explains that it was &quot;committed to paper by the elegant pen of a young LADY of the town of LEOMINSTER.&quot; It is one of the first narratives by an enslaved African in the English language, a genre related to the literature of enslaved persons who later gained freedom. Published in Bath, Somerset, in December 1772, it gives a vivid account of Gronniosaw&#x27;s life, from his leaving home to his enslavement in Africa by a native king, through a period of being enslaved, to his struggles with poverty as a free man in Colchester and Kidderminster. He was attracted to this last town because it was at one time the home of Richard Baxter, a 17th-century Nonconformist minister whom Gronniosaw had learned to admire.

The preface was written by the Reverend Walter Shirley, cousin to Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who was a patron of the Calvinist wing of Methodism. He interprets Gronniosaw&#x27;s experience of enslavement and his being transported from Bornu to New York as an example of Calvinist predestination and election.

Scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. noted that Gronniosaw&#x27;s narrative differed from later slave narratives, which generally criticised slavery as an institution. In his account, Gronniosaw referred to his &quot;white-skinned sister,&quot; said that he had been willing to leave Africa because his family believed in many deities instead of one almighty God (which he learned more about under Christianity), and suggested that he became happier as he assimilated to white English society, through clothing but mostly via language. In addition, he stated a black servant at his enslaver&#x27;s house named Old Ned was the first person to inform him of the Devil, who lives in Hell and punishes the wicked. This was done to discourage the teenage Gronniosaw from using profanity. Gates has concluded that the narrative does not have an anti-slavery view, as was ubiquitous in subsequent slave narratives.

Until the discovery of the 1775 obituary and a manuscript letter written by Gronniosaw to Hastings, the &quot;Narrative&quot; was the only significant source of information for his life.

<text>The Commodore 1540 (also known as the VIC-1540) is the companion floppy disk drive for the VIC-20 home computer. It was introduced in 1982. It uses single-sided 5¼&quot; floppy disks, on which it stores roughly of data utilizing Commodore&#x27;s GCR data encoding scheme.

Because of the low price of both the VIC-20 and the 1540, this combination was the first computer with a disk drive to be offered on the US market for less than although the combination of the Commodore 64 and 1541 would prove more enduring. The 1540 is an &quot;intelligent peripheral&quot; in that it has its own MOS Technology 6502 CPU (just like its VIC-20 host) and the resident Commodore DOS on board in ROM – contrary to almost all other home computer systems of the time, where the DOS was loaded from a boot floppy and was executed on the computer&#x27;s CPU.

Due to a timing conflict with the C64&#x27;s video chip, the C64 doesn&#x27;t work properly with the 1540. The better-known 1541 is mechanically and nearly electronically identical to the 1540 but has a revised ROM that permits it to work with the C64 by slowing the drive down slightly. However, it is possible to revert the 1541 into 1540 mode with a Commodore BASIC software command (codice_1) to permit better speed when used with a VIC-20.

The 1540 is relatively rare. While cheaper than most other drives of the day, it was more expensive than the VIC-20 computer itself, and the disk media was also still relatively pricey. Also, the relatively small memory of the VIC meant that the faster program loading times of the drive did not gain more than a few seconds compared to tape media. Thirdly, almost all commercial software for the VIC-20 was sold on cartridge or cassette tape media, giving low incentive to buy a floppy drive. The C64 followed close on the heels of the VIC-20, quickly discontinuing the 1540. Most 1540s still in existence were modified with a 1541 ROM so it would work with a C64. Unmodified 1540s are now considered collector&#x27;s items.

<text>Scunthorpe () is an industrial town in Lincolnshire, England, and the county&#x27;s third most populous settlement after Lincoln and Grimsby, with a population of 81,286 in 2021. It is the administrative centre and largest settlement of the North Lincolnshire district. Scunthorpe lies north of Lincoln and is between Grimsby to the east and Doncaster to the west, while Hull is to the north-east via the Humber Bridge.

==History==
Scunthorpe as a town came into existence due to the exploitation of the local ironstone which began in 1859; iron production commenced in 1864, steel smelting in 1891.

Scunthorpe&#x27;s population grew from 1,245 in 1851 to 11,167 in 1901 and 45,840 in 1941. The boundaries of Scunthorpe expanded to include the former villages of Bottesford, Frodingham, Crosby, Brumby and Ashby. Scunthorpe became an urban district in 1891, merged as &#x27;Scunthorpe, Brumby and Frodingham Urban District&#x27; in 1919, and became a municipal borough in 1936. Scunthorpe was originally dominated, socially, politically and culturally, by Rowland Winn, the most significant landowner in the district. By the First World War local working class culture, drawing on trade unions and the Labour Party had emerged to challenge the Conservative Party&#x27;s hegemony.

===Etymology===
The town appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as , which is from the Old Norse meaning &quot;Skuma&#x27;s homestead&quot;, a site which is believed to be in the town centre, close to Market Hill.

==Geology==
Scunthorpe is located close to an outcrop of high-lime-content ironstone (~25% iron average) from a seam of the Lias Group strata which dates from the Early Jurassic period and runs north–south through Lincolnshire. Ironstone was mined by open cast methods from the 1850s onwards, and by underground mining from the late 1930s. In the 1970s the steel industry in Scunthorpe began to use of ores imported from outside the UK with higher iron content. Underground mining in the area ceased in 1981.

Scunthorpe was close to the epicentre (at Middle Rasen) of the 2008 Market Rasen earthquake, the second largest earthquake experienced in the British Isles, which had a magnitude of 5.2. Significant shocks were felt in Scunthorpe and the North Lincolnshire vicinity. The main 10-second quake, which struck at 00:56 GMT on 27 February 2008, at a depth of , was second only to a 1984 quake, with a magnitude of 5.4, in North Wales.

==Governance==
Scunthorpe forms an unparished area located within the borough and unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. The town forms six of the borough&#x27;s seventeen wards, namely Ashby, Brumby, Crosby &amp; Park, Frodingham, Kingsway with Lincoln Gardens and Town. The Scunthorpe wards elect 16 of the borough&#x27;s 43 councillors. As of 2018, 26 are members of the Conservative party, and 13 are members of the Labour party. The councillors form the charter trustees of the Town of Scunthorpe and they continue to elect a town mayor.

North Lincolnshire Council was based in Scunthorpe Civic Centre off Ashby Road (former A159) next to Festival Gardens. It was designed by Charles B. Pearson, Son and Partners and was completed in 1962. It was the home of Scunthorpe Borough Council until 1996. It was named Pittwood House after Edwin Pittwood, a local Labour politician, who worked in the opencast ironstone workings near Normanby Park.

===Civic history===

In 1889 the area was included in the Lincolnshire, Parts of Lindsey administrative county. Separate local government began in 1890 when the Scunthorpe local board of health was formed. In 1894 the local board was replaced with an urban district council. At the same time the neighbouring townships of Brumby and Frodingham were also constituted an urban district. The two urban districts were amalgamated, along with the parishes of Crosby and Ashby in 1919 to form an enlarged Scunthorpe urban district. Scunthorpe received a charter incorporating the town as a municipal borough in 1936.

Local authority boundary changes brought the town into the new county of Humberside in 1974, and a new non-metropolitan district, the Borough of Scunthorpe was formed with the same boundaries as the old municipal borough. The opening of the Humber Bridge on 24 June 1981 provided a permanent link between North and South Humberside but did not secure Humberside&#x27;s future. To the relief of its many detractors, the county of Humberside (and Humberside County Council) was abolished on 1 April 1996 and succeeded by four unitary authorities.

The previous Humberside districts of Glanford and Scunthorpe, and that part of Boothferry district south of the northern boundaries of the parishes of Crowle, Eastoft, Luddington, Haldenby and Amcotts, now compose the unitary authority of North Lincolnshire. On amalgamation charter trustees were formed for Scunthorpe, and they continue to elect a town mayor.
===Coat of arms===
When Scunthorpe was incorporated as a borough in 1936, it also received a grant of a coat of arms from the College of Arms. These arms were transferred to the new borough council formed in 1974, and are now used by the town&#x27;s charter trustees.

The green shield and golden wheatsheaf recall that the area was until recently agricultural in nature. Across the centre of the shield is a length of chain. This refers to the five villages of Crosby, Scunthorpe, Frodingham, Brumby &amp; Ashby linking together as one. At the top of the shield are two fossils of the species &quot;Gryphaea incurva&quot;. These remains of oysters, known as the &quot;devil&#x27;s toenails&quot;, were found in the rock strata from which ironstone was quarried.
The crest, on top of the helm, shows a blast furnace. This is also referred to in the Latin motto: &quot;Refulget labores nostros coelum&quot; or &quot;The heavens reflect our labours&quot; popularly attributed to the glow observed in the night sky from the steelmaking activities.
==Geography==

Scunthorpe lies on an escarpment of ridged land (the Lincoln Cliff) which slopes down towards the Trent. The surrounding environs are largely low-lying hills and plains. Although the town itself is heavily industrial it is surrounded by fertile farmland and wooded areas. In terms of general location it lies a mile east of the River Trent, south of the Humber Estuary, west of the Lincolnshire Wolds and north of Lincoln. The town is situated at the terminus of the M181, from Sheffield.
Nearby towns and cities are Hull (18 miles northeast), Doncaster (20 miles west), Grimsby (22 miles east) and York (46 miles northwest).
Scunthorpe is approximately east of South Yorkshire and south by south west to the East Riding of Yorkshire.

===Climate===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Scunthorpe has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb).

Average temperatures are around in the summer, and can be as low as in the winter.

==Economy==

===Steel industry===


The Iron industry in Scunthorpe was established in the mid 19th century, following the discovery and exploitation of middle Lias ironstone east of Scunthorpe. Initially iron ore was exported to iron producers in South Yorkshire. Later, after the construction of the Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway (1860s) gave rail access to the area iron production in the area rapidly expanded using local ironstone and imported coal or coke. Rapid industrial expansion in the area led directly to the development of the town of Scunthorpe, eventually incorporating several other former hamlets and villages, in a formerly sparsely populated entirely agricultural area.

From the early 1910s to the 1930s the industry consolidated, with three main ownership concerns formed – the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company, part of the United Steel Companies; the Redbourn Iron Works, part of Richard Thomas and Company of South Wales (later Richard Thomas and Baldwins); and John Lysaght&#x27;s Normanby Iron Works, part of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds.

In 1967 all three works became part of the nationalised British Steel Corporation (BSC), leading to a period of further consolidation – from the 1970s the use of local or regional ironstone diminished, being replaced by imported ore via the Immingham Bulk Terminal. Conversion to the Linz-Donawitz process (or &quot;basic oxygen&quot; process) of steel making from the open hearth process took place from the late 1960s onwards and was complete by the 1990s. Both the Normanby Park and the Redbourn works closed in the early 1980s.

Following privatisation in 1988 the company, together with the rest of BSC, became part of Corus (1999), later Tata Steel Europe (2007). In 2016 the long products division of Tata Steel Europe was sold to Greybull Capital with Scunthorpe as the primary steel production site.

In May 2019, after a drop in future orders, and a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and the company&#x27;s owner, Greybull, British Steel Limited entered insolvency.

Industries associated with the steelworks include metal engineering as well as a BOC plant.

===Other industries===

Although the historical predominance of the steel industry made Scunthorpe a virtual monotown, there are other industries in the town. These include food production, distribution and retailing. North of the town next a waste management firm, Bell Waste Control, which services the majority of industry in Scunthorpe and the surrounding areas. On the Foxhills Industrial Park, north of the A1077 northern bypass, are many distribution companies, notably a large building owned by the Nisa co-operative type mutual organisation which has its UK headquarters there. Also on the Foxhills Industrial Park is a 500,000 square foot factory occupied by Wren Kitchens, employing 350 full-time workers.

2 Sisters Food Group have a large chicken processing plant in the town. Key Country Foods produces meat products on an industrial scale. The Sauce Company produces sauces, soups and other foodstuffs for the catering and supermarket sectors. Ericsson Mobile Platforms produces printed circuit boards for the telecommunications industry. There are a number of other firms, mostly involved in manufacturing and light engineering.

In the 2001 census 19.3% of the working age population were economically inactive.
===Retail===

Scunthorpe has two major shopping centres, effectively a single site: the Foundry Shopping Centre and the Parishes Centre. The former was constructed in the late 1960s/early 1970s during a wholesale reconstruction of the old town; the latter was constructed in the early part of the 2000s decade on the site of the town&#x27;s old bus station. There are also many well known retailers on High Street. On 6 January 2011 Marks and Spencer closed their High Street store after 80 years of trading, but a new Marks and Spencer store opened near the football ground in 2014.

However the size of the remaining retail units reflects the size of the area&#x27;s population and with larger shopping facilities within reasonable travelling distance in Grimsby, Hull, Doncaster, Lincoln, Leeds and at Meadowhall, Sheffield.

The once-thriving market, mostly under cover in market halls just to the north of the Central Library, at the eastern end of the High Street, had shrunk noticeably in the last ten years, and has now moved to the new St John&#x27;s Market, close to the Bus Station. The opening date was 22 March 2019.

All of the big food retailers are represented in the area. There is a Tesco Extra, and an Aldi (in the former Toys R Us unit) opposite the football ground, while Sainsbury&#x27;s (formerly a Safeway) have their store on the site of the old Scunthorpe United stadium, The Old Show Ground. Morrisons have a store at the bottom of Mortal Ash Hill (known locally as &quot;Motlash&quot;) (A18 road) at the Lakeside Retail Park, on the eastern entrance to the town, while Asda have a store on Burringham Road. In 2011 Asda opened another store in the former Netto, on Carlton Street.

On 24 October 2014 Marks and Spencer&#x27;s returned to the town after almost a 4-year absence. The store is housed in a purpose-built location at the North Lincolnshire Shopping Park, beside Glanford Park. The shopping park also includes Boots, B&amp;M Bargains, Costa Coffee and Subway.

==Transport==

Scunthorpe railway station is on the South TransPennine Line which has trains from Liverpool Lime Street to Cleethorpes. Scunthorpe station (SCU), has two platforms and is serviced by two train companies, TransPennine Express and Northern Trains. TransPennine Express eastbound trains to Cleethorpes call at platform 1, whilst TransPennine Express westbound services to Liverpool Lime Street and the Northern westbound stopping service to Doncaster use platform 2.

The M180 passes south of Scunthorpe and connects to the town via the M181 and the A1077M. Before the M180 was opened in 1979, all east–west traffic took the A18 over Keadby Bridge. Humberside Airport is a short drive to the east along the M180. The town&#x27;s bus station is off Fenton Street. The bus station is predominantly used by Stagecoach in Lincolnshire that operate services within and out of the town along with Hornsby Travel. East Yorkshire operate services to Hull and Goole.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 Census, Scunthorpe had a population of 81,286, while the urban area, extends to the nearby village of Messingham to the south of the town, had a population of 84,665.

At the 2021 Census, the local population was recorded as being 90.4% White British, with 6% British Asian, 1.4% Mixed-race British, 1.2% Other ethnic minorities and 0.8% Black British, making the town roughly 90% White and 10% BAME. According to the census, the town&#x27;s religious composition was 51% Christian, followed by 42.1% who were non-religious and 5% following Islam. Other religions and not stated respondents were recorded at 2.9%.

Scunthorpe is also home to the largest British Asian community in the county of Lincolnshire, followed by both Lincoln and Grimsby.

==Culture==

The North Lincolnshire Museum is on Oswald Road, near the railway station. The former church of St John the Evangelist is now the 20–21 Visual Arts Centre. The Plowright Theatre, named after Joan Plowright, is on Laneham Street (off the west end of High Street and also near the railway station). It was built in 1958 as Scunthorpe Civic Theatre. The Baths Hall, reopened in 2011, a 1,700 capacity venue also hosts visiting musical and theatrical events.

The Scunthorpe Co-operative Junior Choir from Scunthorpe won the title of BBC Radio 3 &quot;Choir of the Year&quot; 2008 at the Grand Finals on 7 December 2008 at the Royal Festival Hall, London. The main choir is made up of 90 members aged between 9 and 19 years whilst also having two training choirs taking children as young as 3 years old. They have made several CDs, performed numerous concerts in the area and further afield, have been subject of documentaries and are internationally renowned as having travelled the world.

Scunthorpe was the setting of a 2012 Cultural Olympiad community opera called &quot;Cycle Song&quot;, about past steel-worker and Olympic cyclist Lal White. It was composed by Tim Sutton and the librettist was Ian McMillan. The Scunthorpe Co-operative Junior Choir, Proper Job Theatre Company and over a thousand locals participated.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Scunthorpe Telegraph&quot; (formerly the &quot;Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph&quot;) with an online version at &quot;www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk&quot;.

===Venues===

Scunthorpe has a leisure centre (The Pods) next to Pittwood House, museum, galleries, craft centres, several clubs, pubs and bars, a Vue multiplex cinema adjacent to the bus station. The Baths Hall in Doncaster Road was a popular music venue, before it was closed because of the costs of bringing the building up to scratch, and dealing with industrial contamination on site. The Labour Council prevented the Baths from being demolished in 2007 and commenced a major rebuild of the venue, which has involved demolishing all but the facade of the building. The building re-opened in November 2011.

==Sport==

===Football===

The town has a former Football League club, Scunthorpe United (nicknamed &quot;The Iron&quot;) who play at Glanford Park. For most of its existence in the professional game (since only 1950) it has been in the lower leagues of the English Football League. At the end of the 2006–07 season they won promotion to the Football League Championship as champions of League One, with 3 games to spare, when they defeated Huddersfield Town at home. They amassed a total of 91 points, and never trailed from January on, despite being outsiders earlier in the season. The last time they had played in the second division was for 44 years previously. The club were relegated on 12 April 2008, with three games to spare, away to Crystal Palace. However, they returned to the Championship after one season, winning the League One playoffs in May 2009. At the end of the 2021–22 season, Scunthorpe for the first time got relegated from the Football League. A further relegation in the 2022–23 season consigned Scunthorpe United to the National League North.

England stars Kevin Keegan and Ray Clemence both played for Scunthorpe United in the early 1970s before signing for Liverpool, where they made their names. Former England cricket captain Ian Botham played a number of games for the club, being a resident of nearby Epworth at that time and in an attempt to keep fit during the winter months. The team mascot is called the &quot;Scunny Bunny&quot;.

Semi-professional sides within the Town or greater town boundaries include Appleby Frodingham and Bottesford Town. Local teams play in the Scunthorpe &amp; District Football League.

===Rugby===
Scunthorpe Rugby Club play in the National League 2 North, the fourth tier of the English rugby union system. Their home ground is at Heslam Park, close to Brumby on Ashby Road. Scunthorpe Barbarians play rugby league also at Heslam Park.

===Motorsports===
Scunthorpe also has a speedway team known as the Scunthorpe Scorpions who compete in the British Premier League, the sport&#x27;s second tier in Britain.

The speedway team has been running since 2005 and won a grand slam of the Conference League trophies in both 2006 and 2007 before claiming the Premier League title in 2012, alongside this Speedway world champion Tai Woffinden was born in Scunthorpe, riding for the Scunthorpe Scorpions in his youth. It runs at the Eddie Wright Raceway, which is a mile north of the town on Normanby Road (B1430).

The Eddie Wright Raceway is also host to the sport of stock car racing, the town has featured stock car racing at two other venues in its past, 2009 saw a return to the town of the oval racing sport
* Scunthorpe Scorpions – Premier League team
* Scunthorpe Saints – National League (formerly Conference League) team

===Athletics===
The Appleby-Frodingham Athletic Club uses the site near the Civic Centre for many types of sport. They have a clubhouse and also use Brumby Hall next-door. The site includes a 3G football pitch and an artificial Astro hockey pitch, along with several grass football pitches and an area for cricket. There is also the Scunthorpe and District Athletics Club. They train at Quibell Park Stadium, Scunthorpe&#x27;s athletic track on Brumby Wood Lane named after David Quibell, the town&#x27;s former Labour MP. Around the running track is a cycle track used by Polytechnic Cycle Club.

The leisure centre was on Carlton Street opposite the bus station via a footbridge. After The Pods opened this was demolished. The Scunthorpe Anchor swimming club are based at the Riddings Pool on Enderby Road next to South Leys School.

The Pods, a leisure centre near Central Park, opened in 2011 costing an estimated £21 million. Facilities include an 8 lane 25m pool and a separate shallow pool, a state of the art gym, a dance studio, a large sports hall with climbing wall, a creche and a cafe.

As part of the project, Central Park is being improved. These expensive improvements are also in their final stage. North Lincolnshire Council&#x27;s website regularly show photographs and videos of how the work is progressing.

Scunthorpe has two parkruns. One in Central Park and another at Normanby Hall

===American football===
The Scunthorpe Alphas who were formed in 2018 play their home games at Quibell Park Stadium and for 2021 will complete in the BAFA National Leagues Division One. The town&#x27;s previous American football side was the Scunthorpe Steelers who folded in 1990.

==Internet obscenity filters==

In 1996 there was controversy when AOL&#x27;s obscenity filter (among others) refused to accept the name of the town due to its embedded word &#x27;cunt&#x27;. Some online forums such as Ultimate Guitar forums displayed the name as Scumthorpe, while Fark would display it as Scoonthorpe. This form of censorship over-reach is known in the computing world as the Scunthorpe problem.

<text>Warren Hamilton Lewis (16 June 1895 – 9 April 1973) was an Irish historian and officer in the British Army, best known as the elder brother of writer and professor C. S. Lewis. Warren Lewis was a supply officer with the Royal Army Service Corps of the British Army during and after the First World War. After retiring in 1932 to live with his brother in Oxford, he was one of the founding members of the Inklings, an informal Oxford literary society. He wrote on French history, and served as his brother&#x27;s secretary for the later years of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s life.

==Early life==
C. S. Lewis referred to his older brother Warren (&quot;Warnie&quot;) as &quot;my dearest and closest friend&quot;. Their lifelong friendship was formed as the boys played together in their home on the outskirts of Belfast, Little Lea, writing and illustrating stories for their fantasy world of Boxen (a combination of India and a previous invention called Animal-Land). In 1908, their mother died from cancer and as their father mourned her, C. S. (&quot;Jack&quot;) and Warren Lewis had only each other for comfort and support. Soon after their mother&#x27;s death, Jack was sent across the North Channel to join Warren at an English boarding school named Wynyard in Watford, Hertfordshire, just northwest of London, where they suffered under a harsh, mentally ill headmaster named Robert Capron. Warren had been taken there by his mother Flora on 10 May 1905. In 1909, Warren transferred to Malvern College in Worcestershire, where his brother was also sent a few years later. Warren completed his education at Malvern in 1913.

==Military service==
On 10 September 1913, Warren Lewis began studying privately with William T. Kirkpatrick for four months in preparation for the entrance examination of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He finished 22nd of 201 candidates, winning him a prize cadetship, with which he entered the college on 4 February 1914. This gave him a reduction in the fees payable for his attendance. He passed out of the Royal Military College, after only nine months of training due to wartime need; the normal course of study was 18 months to two years. On 1 October 1914, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps. 

He was sent to France on 4 November 1914 to serve with the 4th Company 7th Divisional Train in the British Expeditionary Force. He was made a temporary captain on 24 September 1916. 

After the end of the First World War, Warren served in such postings as Belgium (1919), Aldershot (November 1919), Sierra Leone (9 March 1921 to 23 March 1922), Colchester (4 October 1922 to December 1925), Woolwich (January 1925 until April 1927), and China (two tours of duty, the first beginning on 11 April 1927 in Kowloon, in the British territory of Hong Kong, then later in Shanghai, and ending in April 1930; the second beginning on 9 October 1931 and ending on 14 December 1932). He retired on 21 December 1932 with the rank of captain, after 18 years of active service. He was granted the temporary rank of major when recalled to active service on 4 September 1939.

After World War II, he took up residence with his brother at a house named The Kilns at Headington, near Oxford, where he lived until the death of C. S. Lewis in November 1963.

==Writings==
Soon after his first retirement in 1932, Warren Lewis edited the Lewis family papers. During his final retirement, he began researching a topic of his lifelong interest: the history of 17th-century France. He published seven books on France during the reign of Louis XIV under the name W. H. Lewis, including &quot;The Splendid Century: Some Aspects of French Life in the Reign of Louis XIV&quot; and &quot;Levantine Adventurer: The travels and missions of the Chevalier d&#x27;Arvieux, 1653–1697&quot;. An excerpt from &quot;The Splendid Century&quot; appeared first in &quot;Essays Presented to Charles Williams&quot;, a volume edited by his brother as an informal Festschrift to benefit Williams&#x27;s widow.

After C. S. Lewis died in 1963, Warren edited the first published edition of his brother&#x27;s letters (1966), adding a memoir of his brother as a preface to the letters. Later editions of these letters were edited by Walter Hooper.

Before his death, Warren deposited many of the Lewis family papers in the Marion E. Wade Collection of Wheaton College, including surviving papers of C. S. Lewis and himself. In 1982, selections from Warren Lewis&#x27;s diary were published under the title &quot;Brothers and Friends&quot;.

==Personal life==
Warren Lewis renewed his Christian faith beginning in May 1931. He was a frequent participant in weekly meetings of the Inklings and recorded comments about them in many of his diary entries. During the 1930s, the Lewis brothers undertook eight annual walking tours of as many as 50 miles (80 km), which Warren years later recalled with fondness, saying, &quot;And jolly good fun they were too.&quot;

According to Douglas Gresham, his step-nephew, and his brother&#x27;s letters to Arthur Greeves, Warren Lewis was an alcoholic.

Warren Lewis was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Headington, Oxford, where he is interred in his brother&#x27;s grave.

<text>Spoleto (, , , ; ) is an ancient city in the Italian province of Perugia in east-central Umbria on a foothill of the Apennines. It is south of Trevi, north of Terni, southeast of Perugia; southeast of Florence; and north of Rome.

==History==

Spoleto was situated on the eastern branch of the Via Flaminia, which forked into two roads at Narni and rejoined at , near Foligno. An ancient road also ran hence to Nursia. The of the 1st century BC still exists. The forum lies under today&#x27;s marketplace.

Located at the head of a large, broad valley, surrounded by mountains, Spoleto has long occupied a strategic geographical position. It appears to have been an important town to the original Umbri tribes, who built walls around their settlement in the 5th century BC, some of which are visible today.

The first historical mention of is the notice of the foundation of a colony there in 241 BC; and it was still, according to Cicero &quot;&quot;: a Latin colony in 95 BC. After the Battle of Lake Trasimene (217 BC), Spoletium was attacked by Hannibal, who was repulsed by the inhabitants. During the Second Punic War the city was a useful ally to Rome. It suffered greatly during the civil wars of Gaius Marius and Sulla. The latter, after his victory over Marius, confiscated the territory of Spoletium (82 BC). From this time forth it was a .

Under the empire it seems to have flourished once again, but is not often mentioned in history. Martial speaks of its wine. Aemilianus, who had been proclaimed emperor by his soldiers in Moesia, was slain by them here on his way from Rome (AD 253), after a reign of three or four months. Rescripts of Constantine (326) and Julian (362) are dated from Spoleto. The foundation of the episcopal see dates from the 4th century: early martyrs of Spoleto are legends, but a letter to the bishop Caecilianus, from Pope Liberius in 354 constitutes its first historical mention. Owing to its elevated position, Spoleto was an important stronghold during the Vandal and Gothic wars; its walls were dismantled by Totila.

Under the Lombards, Spoleto became the capital of an independent duchy, the Duchy of Spoleto (from 570), and its dukes ruled a considerable part of central Italy. On 29 April 801, it was struck by a severe earthquake. Several of its dukes, mainly during the late 9th century, rose to wear the crown of that empire. Together with other fiefs, it was bequeathed to Pope Gregory VII by the powerful countess Matilda of Tuscany, but for some time struggled to maintain its independence. In 1155 it was destroyed by Frederick Barbarossa. In 1213 it was definitively occupied by Pope Gregory IX. During the absence of the papal court in Avignon, it was prey to the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines, until in 1354 Cardinal Albornoz brought it once more under the authority of the Papal States. 
In 1809, following Napoleon&#x27;s conquest of Italy, Spoleto became capital of the short-lived French department of Trasimène. It returned to Papal States control within five years of Napoleon&#x27;s subsequent defeat. In 1860, after an unsuccessful defence, Spoleto was taken by the troops fighting for the unification of Italy.

Giovanni Pontano, founder of the Accademia Pontaniana of Naples, was born in the town; as was Francis Possenti, who was educated in the Jesuit school and whose father was the Papal assessor. Francis later entered the Passionists and became Saint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows.
==Main sights==

===Ancient and lay buildings===

*The Roman theatre, largely rebuilt. The stage is occupied by the former church of St. Agatha, currently housing the National Archaeological Museum.
* , a 1st century BC Roman bridge. The name is traditionally attributed to the persecutions of Christians in the nearby amphitheatre.
*A restored Roman house with mosaic floors, indicating it was built in the 1st century, and overlooked the forum square. An inscription by Polla to Emperor Caligula suggests the house was that of Vespasia Polla, the mother of Emperor Vespasian.
*Roman amphitheater from the 2nd century AD. It was turned into a fortress by Totila in 545 and in the Middle Ages was used for stores and shops, while the church of San Gregorio Minore was built. The stones were later used to build the Rocca Albornoziana.
* (13th century).
*, a 13th-century aqueduct, possibly on Roman foundations: scholarly opinion is divided on whether it was first built by the Romans.
*, a fortress built in 1359–1370 by the architect of Gubbio for Cardinal Albornoz. It has six sturdy towers which form two distinct inner spaces: the , for the troops, and the for the use of the city&#x27;s governor. The latter courtyard is surrounded by a two-floor porch. The rooms include the () with 15th‑century frescoes. After having resisted many sieges, the Rocca was turned into a jail in 1800 and used as such until the late 20th century. After extensive renovation it was reopened as a museum in 2007.
* (16th century) has a worn graffito decoration attributed to Giulio Romano. The inner courtyard has a fountain.
* (14th century), housing the city&#x27;s museum.
* (15th–16th centuries) includes the (13th century), the sole remaining medieval city tower in Spoleto.
*Temple of Clitumnus lies between Spoleto and Trevi.

===Churches===

;Duomo (Cathedral) of S. Maria Assunta: construction of the building began around 1175 and completed in 1227. The Romanesque edifice contains the tomb of Filippo Lippi, who died in Spoleto in 1469, designed by his son Filippino Lippi. The church also houses a manuscript letter by Saint Francis of Assisi.
;San Pietro extra Moenia: a church founded in 419 to house the chains that supposedly once bound St. Peter. It was built over an ancient necropolis. It was reconstructed from the 12th to the 15th century, when a Romanesque façade was added with three doors with rose-windows, with relief decoration by local artists, portraying stories of the life of St. Peter. The church is fronted by a large staircase. In the 17th century the interior was refurbished in Baroque style, with a basilica plan with a nave, two aisles, and an elliptical dome. 
;Basilica of San Salvatore: a 4th–5th century church incorporating the cella of a Roman temple and example of Early Christian architecture. It was rebuilt by the Lombards in the 8th century. In 2011, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as &quot;Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568–774 A.D.)&quot;.
;San Ponziano: a monastery and 12th–century Romanesque church standing outside the city&#x27;s walls, dedicated to the patron saint of Spoleto. The church was modified in later centuries by Giuseppe Valadier. The crypt, however, has remained untouched, with its five small naves and small apses with cross-vault, ancient Roman spolia columns and frescoes of the 14th–15th centuries.
;Santa Maria della Manna d&#x27;Oro: a former sanctuary built in octagonal plan facing the . Putatively erected by the town&#x27;s merchants to thank the Madonna for sparing the city from plundering by the Imperial army in 1527, it is currently an exhibition hall.
;: a 13th century Gothic construction in white and pink stone. The interior has paintings by Giovanni Lanfranco. The crypt is a former church dedicated to St. Peter, with frescoed walls.
;San Gregorio Maggiore: an 11th–12th century church recently restored to its original Romanesque elements. The façade has a 16th-century portico that includes the Chapel of the Innocents (14th century) with a font. The main external feature is the high belfry, finished in the 15th century. The interior has three naves with spolia columns and pillars.
;Santi Giovanni e Paolo: a deconsecrated Romanesque church featuring, on the exterior, a 13th-century fresco portraying &quot;Madonna with Saints&quot;. The interior frescoes, from the 13th–15th centuries, include some of the most ancient representations of the martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket (painted by Alberto Sotio), and of St. Francis.
;Basilica of Sant&#x27;Eufemia: an example of 12th-century Romanesque architecture influenced by Lombardy and Veneto. The interior has three naves with spolia columns. 
;San Paolo inter vineas: a 10th century Romanesque church with rose-window of the façade.
;Former church and Augustinian convent of San Nicolò (1304): an example of Gothic style in Spoleto. The small church has a single nave with a polygonal apse with mullioned windows. Under the apse is the church of Santa Maria della Misericordia. There are two cloisters, the more recent one pertaining to the 15th century.
;San Filippo Neri: Baroque construction of mid-17th century, designed by .
;Sant&#x27;Ansano: an 18th-century church built atop more ancient buildings, including a 1st-century Roman temple and the mediaeval Crypt of St. Isaac. It has a cloister from the 16th century.
;Santi Simone e Giuda: a 13th-century church completed in 1280 that has undergone many restorations and losses.

==Culture==

The () was founded in 1958. Because Spoleto was a small town, where real estate and other goods and services were at the time relatively inexpensive, and also because there are two indoor theatres, a Roman theatre and many other spaces, it was chosen by Gian Carlo Menotti as the venue for an arts festival. It is also fairly close to Rome, with good rail connections. It is an important cultural event, held annually in late June-early July.

The festival has developed into one of the most important cultural manifestations in Italy, with a three-week schedule of music, theater and dance performances. For some time it became a reference point for modern sculpture exhibits, and works of art left to the city by Alexander Calder and others are a testimony to this.

In the United States, a parallel festival — Spoleto Festival USA — held in Charleston, South Carolina was founded in 1977 with Menotti&#x27;s involvement. The twinning only lasted some 15 years and, after growing disputes between the Menotti family and the Spoleto Festival USA board, in the early 1990s a separation was consummated. However, following Menotti&#x27;s death in February 2007, the city administrations of Spoleto and Charleston started talks to re-unite the two festivals which would climax in Spoleto mayor Massimo Brunini&#x27;s attending the opening ceremony of Spoleto Festival USA in May 2008. For a short period of time, a third parallel festival was also held in Melbourne, Australia. 
In 1992, the Spoleto Arts Symposium was initiated with the purpose of bringing talented people from all around the world to study in Spoleto. The program apparently ceased in 2009, to be replaced by a similar program, started by the College-Conservatory of Music (CCM) of the University of Cincinnati in 2010.

==Sport==

Spoleto gained its main results in sport with the local volleyball team, Olio Venturi Spoleto, who classified in the quarter finals of the Italian championship in sport.

The town&#x27;s football team, A.D. Voluntas Calcio Spoleto, play in Serie D.

ASD Spoleto Rugby, is the Rugby Union club of the town. They affiliated with FIR in 2014 and they play at Serie C2.

The hosted an international Rugby League match, in 2018. The Italy national team (of the Lega Italiana Rugby Football League) played against the British-Asian Rugby League Association (BARA). BARA won the match.

<doc id="282956" wikidata="Q2509719" url="?curid=282956" title="Ironstone">
<text>Ironstone is a sedimentary rock, either deposited directly as a ferruginous sediment or created by chemical replacement, that contains a substantial proportion of an iron ore compound from which iron (Fe) can be smelted commercially.

Not to be confused with native or telluric iron, which is very rare and found in metallic form, the term &quot;ironstone&quot; is customarily restricted to hard, coarsely banded, non-banded, and non-cherty sedimentary rocks of post-Precambrian age. The Precambrian deposits, which have a different origin, are generally known as banded iron formations. The iron minerals comprising ironstones can consist either of oxides, i.e. limonite, hematite, and magnetite; carbonates, i.e. siderite; silicates, i.e. chamosite; or some combination of these minerals.

==Description==
Freshly cleaved ironstone is usually grey. The brown external appearance is due to oxidation of its surface.
Ironstone, being a sedimentary rock is not always homogeneous, and can be found in a red-and-black banded form called tiger iron, sometimes used for jewelry purposes.

Sometimes ironstone hosts concretions or opal gems.

==Occurrence==
Ironstone occurs in a variety of forms. The various forms of ironstone include siderite nodules; deeply weathered saprolite, i.e. (laterite); and ooidal ironstone.

==Uses==
===Ironstone as a source of iron===
Ironstone, although widespread, is a limited source of iron. Historically, most British iron originated from ironstone, but it is now rarely used for this purpose because it is far too limited in quantity to be an economic source of iron ore.

===Ceramics===
Ironstone&#x27;s oxide impurities render it useless as a component in ceramics: the &quot;ironstone china&quot; of Staffordshire and American manufacture, a fine, white, high-fired vitreous semi-porcelain, commonly used for heavy-duty dinner services in the 19th century, includes no ironstone in its production. Its &quot;iron&quot; quality is in its resistance to chipping.

===In construction===

The stone can be used as a building material. Examples include the parish churches at Kirby Bellars and South Croxton in Leicestershire, and Eydon Hall in Northamptonshire.

===In art===
Sculptures carved out of ironstone are rare. One example is Henry Moore&#x27;s &quot;Head&quot; created in 1930.

<doc id="282960" wikidata="Q1700475" url="?curid=282960" title="Patolli">
<text>Patolli () or patole () is one of the oldest known games in America. It was a game of strategy and luck played by commoners and nobles alike. It was reported by the conquistadors that Moctezuma Xocoyotzin often enjoyed watching his nobles play the game at court.

==History==
Patolli and its variants were played by a wide range of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures and were known all over Mesoamerica: it was played by the Teotihuacanos (the builders of Teotihuacan, ca. 200 BC - 650 AD), the Toltecs (ca. 750 - 1000), the inhabitants of Chichen Itza (founded by refugee Toltec nobles, ca. 1100 - 1300), the Aztecs (who claimed Toltec descent, 1168 - 1521) and all of the people they conquered (practically all of Mesoamerica, including the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs). The ancient Mayans also played a version of patolli. Anthropologists Edward Burnett Tylor (1879, 1896) and E. Adamson Hoebel (1966) remarked on the game&#x27;s apparent similarities to the South Asian game of pachisi, and a common origin for the games was once considered possible. C. J. Erasmus (1950) criticized the case for common origin as defining &quot;similarity&quot; so broadly as to obscure the differences, while noting that America had a variety of games in which patolli could have arisen independently. He suggested, and R. B. Lewis (1988) further argued, that the similarities reflect the constraints of the board game format.

==Players==
Patolli is a race game with a heavy focus on gambling. Players would meet and inspect the items each other had available to gamble. They would bet blankets, maguey plants, precious stones, gold adornments, food or, in extreme cases, their homes, family or freedom. Agreeing to play against someone was not done casually, as the winner of the game would ultimately win all of the opponent&#x27;s store of offerings.

Each player must have the same number of items to bet at the beginning of the game. The typical number of items to bet is six, because each player has six markers (each time a marker successfully completes a circuit around the board, the opponent is required to hand over one of their items); although any number would be acceptable as long as each player agreed.

Once an agreement is made to play, the players prepare themselves by invoking the god of games, Xōchipilli.

==Game pieces==

Five (or sometimes six) black beans are used as dice. Each bean has one side marked with a hole; thus, tossing the black beans will result in some showing this white mark and others showing a blank side. Dice could also be used; the rules in this article pertain to using five beans.

The game pieces are six red and six blue pebbles; each player controlled one color as their set of game markers. Beans, kernels of maize or even pieces of jade could also be used.

The game board has 52 squares arranged in an &quot;X&quot; shape. The game board was traditionally painted with liquid rubber on a sheet of leather or a straw mat and decorated with colored dye, or carved into the floor or a tabletop.

==Gameplay==
The object of patolli is to move six game pieces to the end of a board composed of specially-marked squares. In order to complete a round, a player must get all six of their game markers from their starting queue to the ending square on the game board before the other player. The ultimate goal of the game is for a player to win all of the opponent&#x27;s treasure; to do this, the players may need to play more than one round of the game.

===Movement===
The players take turns tossing the beans onto the game area. In order for a player to get one of their markers on the game board, one bean would have to land with its hole face up and all the others face down (getting a score of one). Once a player has done so, the player places one of their game markers from their starting queue onto the starting square of the game board.

If a player already has a marker on the game board, they can move it forward (clockwise around the &quot;X&quot; shape) the same number of spaces as there are holes showing from the toss. A toss showing five holes, however, allows the player to move their marker ten spaces forward. A player cannot move a marker onto a space that already has a marker (belonging to either player) on it. If the player cannot move any of their markers because they would overshoot the ending square or land on a spot occupied by another marker, they lose their turn.

===Special areas===
There are several specially-marked areas on the game board:
*The four squares in the middle of the &quot;X&quot;: Landing on an opponent&#x27;s marker in this area is allowed, and if a player does so, the opponent&#x27;s marker is removed from the game board and put back into the opponent&#x27;s starting queue. The opponent is then required to give up one of their treasures to the landing player.
*The two dark triangular spaces near the end of each arm of the &quot;X&quot;: A player who lands on one of these triangular spaces must give up one of their treasures to the opponent.
*The two squares at the end of each arm of the &quot;X&quot;: A player who lands on one of these squares takes another turn.

===Ending the round===
If a player&#x27;s marker reaches the ending square by exact count, the marker is removed from the board and the opponent must give up one of their treasures to the player. The round is over once one player gets all six of their markers off the board this way.

As soon as a player has won all of their opponent&#x27;s treasures, the game is over and that player is the winner. If no player has won the game by the end of a round of play, the players must play another round.

In addition, if a player&#x27;s toss results in all the beans standing on their sides, the game is over and the player automatically wins all the goods bet by both parties.

===Macuilxochitl&#x27;s role in the game===
According to the Magliabechiano codex, the god of games, Macuilxochitl, was considered to be participating in the game. To represent this, there is a special area near the game board reserved for offerings to Macuilxochitl. A player must place one of their treasures into this space each time their toss results in a score of zero (no holes showing). After each round of play, the winner of the round receives all the treasure from this space as a gift from Macuilxochitl.
