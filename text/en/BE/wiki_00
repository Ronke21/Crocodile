<text>The Peerage Act 1963 (c. 48) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that permits female hereditary peers and all Scottish hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords and allows newly inherited hereditary peerages to be disclaimed.

A disclaimed peerage remains without a holder until the death of the disclaimer, and his heir succeeds to the peerage.

==Background==

The Act resulted largely from the protests of Labour politician Tony Benn, then the 2nd Viscount Stansgate. Under British law at the time, peers of England, peers of Great Britain and peers of the United Kingdom who met certain qualifications, such as age (21), were automatically members of the House of Lords and could not sit in or vote in elections for the other chamber, the House of Commons.

At the time of the Act, thirty one peers in the Peerage of Scotland also had held titles in the respective peerages of England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom and were thus members of the House of Lords.

When William Wedgwood Benn, Tony Benn&#x27;s father, agreed to accept the Viscountcy, he ascertained that the heir-apparent, his eldest son Michael, did not plan to enter the House of Commons. However, within a few years of the peerage being accepted, Michael Benn was killed in action in the Second World War. Tony Benn, his younger brother, became heir apparent to the peerage and was elected to the House of Commons in 1950. Not wishing to leave it for the other House, he campaigned through the 1950s for a change in the law. In 1960, the 1st Viscount died and Tony Benn inherited the title, automatically losing his seat in the House of Commons as a member for the constituency of Bristol South East. In the ensuing by-election, however, Benn was re-elected to the Commons, despite being disqualified. An election court ruled that he could not take his seat, instead awarding it to the runner-up, the Conservative Malcolm St Clair.

In 1963, the Conservative Government agreed to introduce a Peerage Bill, allowing individuals to disclaim peerages; it received royal assent on 31 July 1963. Tony Benn was the first peer to make use of the Act. St Clair, fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of taking his seat, accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead the previous day, thereby disqualifying himself from the House (outright resignation is prohibited), and Benn was then re-elected in Bristol South East at the ensuing by-election.

==Disclaiming peerages==

To disclaim a hereditary peerage, the peer must deliver an instrument of disclaimer to the Lord Chancellor within one year of succeeding to the peerage, or within one year after the passage of the Act, or, if under the age of 21 at the time of succession, before the peer&#x27;s 22nd birthday. If, at the time of succession, the peer is a member of the House of Commons, then the instrument must be delivered within one month of succession, and until such an instrument is delivered, the peer may neither sit nor vote in the lower House. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, a hereditary peer could not disclaim a peerage after having applied for a writ of summons to Parliament; now, however, hereditary peers do not have the automatic right to a writ of summons to the House. A peer who disclaims the peerage loses all titles, rights and privileges associated with the peerage; if they are married, so does their spouse. No further hereditary peerage may be conferred upon the person, but a life peerage may be. The peerage remains without a holder until the death of the peer who had made the disclaimer, whereupon it descends to his or her heir in the usual manner.

The one-year window after the passage of the Act soon proved to be of importance at the highest levels of British politics, after the resignation of Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister in October 1963. Two hereditary peers wished to be considered to replace him, but by this time it was considered requisite that a prime minister sit in the Commons. The 2nd Viscount Hailsham and the 14th Earl of Home took advantage of the Act to disclaim their peerages, despite having inherited them in 1950 and 1951 respectively. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as Lord Home now became, was chosen as prime minister; both men later returned to the House of Lords as life peers.

Since the abolition in 1999 of the general right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, and the consequent removal of the general disability of such peers to sit in or vote for the House of Commons, it is no longer necessary for hereditary peers to disclaim their peerages for this purpose. In 2001, the 3rd Viscount Thurso became the first British hereditary peer to be elected to the Commons and take his seat. Later that year, Douglas Hogg inherited the Hailsham peerage his father (Quintin Hogg) had disclaimed, but did not have to disclaim it himself to continue sitting in the House of Commons. In 2004, Michael Ancram inherited the marquessate of Lothian on the death of his father, and was also able to continue sitting as an MP. On their retirements from the House of Commons, Lord Lothian and Lord Hailsham entered the House of Lords as life peers, while Lord Thurso was elected as an excepted hereditary peer after losing reelection as an MP. Since the chief purpose for the Act ended in 1999, there has only been one further disclaimer: Christopher Silkin, 3rd Baron Silkin, disclaimed his title in 2002. As of 2024, the barony of Silkin is the only title currently disclaimed under the terms of the Peerage Act 1963.

The Peerage Act 1963 only applies to titles held in the Peerage of England, the Peerage of Scotland, the Peerage of Great Britain, and the Peerage of the United Kingdom. No provision was made by the Act for titles in the Peerage of Ireland to be disclaimed, as the entitlement of new Irish representative peers to be elected to sit in the House of Lords was considered to have lapsed after most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State in December 1922 (and the last surviving Irish representative peer had died in 1961).

;Notes
==Other provisions==

The Act granted peers of Scotland the same right to sit in the House of Lords as peers of England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom, thereby ending the election of Scottish representative peers and increasing the number of peers of Scotland in the Lords (who did not already sit as holder of another British peerage) from 16 to about 46.
An amendment that would have allowed Irish peers to sit in the House as well was defeated by ninety votes to eight.

The Act removed the disqualification of peers of Ireland, by virtue of an Irish peerage, to vote in elections for members of the House of Commons; and to sit in the British House of Commons without losing the privilege of peerage.

The Act also granted &quot;suo jure&quot; hereditary women peers (other than those in the Peerage of Ireland) the right to sit in the House of Lords, which introduced twelve new women to the House. This was not the first time that women were members of the House of Lords; the Life Peerages Act 1958 allowed all life peers (men and women) to sit in the House. The 2nd Baroness Ravensdale had already entered the Lords in 1958 through the receipt of a life peerage. The women who took their seats in the House after the Peerage Act 1963 and before the House of Lords Act 1999 were:

<text>Nonograms, also known as Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, and Pic-a-Pix, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the edges of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of &quot;4 8 3&quot; would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets. 

These puzzles are often black and white—describing a binary image—but they can also be colored. If colored, the number clues are also colored to indicate the color of the squares. Two differently colored numbers may or may not have a space in between them. For example, a black four followed by a red two could mean four black boxes, some empty spaces, and two red boxes, or it could simply mean four black boxes followed immediately by two red ones. Nonograms have no theoretical limits on size, and are not restricted to square layouts.

Nonograms were named after Non Ishida, one of the two inventors of the puzzle.

==Names==
Nonograms are also known by many other names, including Hanjie puzzle, Paint by Numbers, Crosspix, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Picross, Picma, PrismaPixels, Pixel Puzzles, Crucipixel, Edel, FigurePic, Hanjie, HeroGlyphix, Illust-Logic, Japanese Crosswords, Japanese Puzzles, Kare Karala!, Logic Art, Logic Square, Logicolor, Logik-Puzzles, Logimage, Oekaki Logic, Paint Logic, Picture Logic, Tsunamii, Paint by Sudoku, Picture-forming logic puzzles, and Binary Coloring Books.

==History==
In 1987, Non Ishida, a Japanese graphics editor, won a competition in Tokyo by designing grid pictures using skyscraper lights that were turned on or off. This led her to the idea of a puzzle based around filling in certain squares in a grid. Coincidentally, a professional Japanese puzzler named Tetsuya Nishio invented the same puzzles independently, and published them in another magazine. At this time, nonograms were also called picture-forming logic puzzles.

===Print publishing===
In 1988, Non Ishida published three picture grid puzzles in Japan under the name of &quot;Window Art Puzzles&quot;. In 1990, James Dalgety in the UK invented the name Nonograms after Non Ishida, and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; started publishing them on a weekly basis. By 1993, the first book of nonograms was published by Non Ishida in Japan. The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; published a dedicated puzzle book titled the &quot;Book of Nonograms&quot;. Nonograms were also published in Sweden, the United States (originally by &quot;Games&quot; magazine), South Africa and other countries. The &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; ran a competition in 1998 to choose a new name for their puzzles. Griddlers was the winning name that readers chose. 1993, Ishida published the &quot;Book of Nonograms&quot;.

===Electronic puzzles===
Paint by numbers puzzles were implemented by 1995 on hand held electronic toys such as Game Boy and on other plastic puzzle toys. Nintendo picked up on this puzzle fad and released two &quot;Picross&quot; (picture crossword) titles for the Game Boy and nine for the Super Famicom (eight of which were released in two-month intervals for the Nintendo Power Super Famicom Cartridge Writer as the &quot;NP&quot; series) in Japan. Only one of these, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; for the Game Boy, was released outside Japan. Since then, one of the most prolific Picross game developers has been Jupiter Corporation, who released &quot;Picross DS&quot; on the Nintendo DS in 2007, 8 titles in the &quot;Picross e&quot; series for the Nintendo 3DS eShop (along with 5 character-specific titles, including ones featuring Pokémon, Zelda and Sanrio characters), and 9 titles in the &quot;Picross S&quot; series for the Nintendo Switch (along with two character-specific ones featuring Kemono Friends and Overlord respectively, and another featuring intellectual properties from Sega&#x27;s Master System and Genesis).

Increased popularity in Japan launched new publishers and by now there were several monthly magazines, some of which contained up to 100 puzzles. The Japanese arcade game &quot;Logic Pro&quot; was released by Deniam Corp in 1996, with a sequel released the following year. UK games developer Jagex released a nonogram puzzle in 2011 as part of their annual Halloween event for their role-playing game, &quot;Runescape&quot;. In 2013, Casual Labs released a mobile version of these puzzles called &quot;Paint it Back&quot; with the theme of restoring an art gallery. Released early in 2017, &quot;Pictopix&quot; has been presented as a worthy heir to Picross on PC by Rock, Paper, Shotgun. In particular, the game enables players to share their creations.

===Today===
Paint by numbers have been published by Sanoma Uitgevers in the Netherlands, Puzzler Media (formerly British European Associated Publishers) in the UK and Nikui Rosh Puzzles in Israel. Magazines with nonogram puzzles are published in the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine, and many other countries.

==Solution techniques==


To solve a puzzle, one needs to determine which cells will be boxes and which will be empty. Solvers often use a dot or a cross to mark cells they are certain are spaces. Cells that can be determined by logic should be filled. If guessing is used, a single error can spread over the entire field and completely ruin the solution. An error sometimes comes to the surface only after a while, when it is very difficult to correct the puzzle. The hidden picture may help locate and eliminate an error, but otherwise it plays little part in the solving process, as it may mislead.

Many puzzles can be solved by reasoning on a single row or column at a time only, then trying another row or column, and repeating until the puzzle is complete. More difficult puzzles may also require several types of &quot;what if?&quot; reasoning that include more than one row (or column). This works on searching for contradictions, e.g., when a cell cannot be a box because some other cell would produce an error, it must be a space.

===Simple boxes===
At the beginning of the solution, a simple method can be used to determine as many boxes as possible. This method uses conjunctions of possible places for each block of boxes. For example, in a row of ten cells with only one clue of &quot;8&quot;, the bound block consisting of 8 boxes could spread from

* the right border, leaving two spaces to the left;
* the left border, leaving two spaces to the right;
* or somewhere in between.
As a result, the block must spread through the six centermost cells in the row.

The same applies when there are more clues in the row. For example, in a row of ten cells with clues of &quot;4&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, the bound blocks of boxes could be

* crowded to the left, one next to the other, leaving two spaces to the right;
* crowded to the right, one just next to the other, leaving two spaces to the left;
* or somewhere between.
Consequently, the first block of four boxes definitely includes the third and fourth cells, while the second block of three boxes definitely includes the eighth cell. Boxes can therefore be placed in the third, fourth and eighth cells. When determining boxes in this way, boxes can be placed in cells only when the &quot;same block&quot; overlaps; in this example, there is overlap in the sixth cell, but it is from different blocks, and so it cannot yet be said whether or not the sixth cell will contain a box.

===Simple spaces===
This method consists of determining spaces by searching for cells that are out of range of any possible blocks of boxes. For example, considering a row of ten cells with boxes in the fourth and ninth cell and with clues of &quot;3&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, the block bound to the clue &quot;3&quot; will spread through the fourth cell and clue &quot;1&quot; will be at the ninth cell.

First, the clue &quot;1&quot; is complete and there will be a space at each side of the bound block.

Second, the clue &quot;3&quot; can only spread somewhere between the second cell and the sixth cell, because it always has to include the fourth cell; however, this may leave cells that may not be boxes in any case, i.e. the first and the seventh.

Note: In this example all blocks are accounted for; this is not always the case. The player must be careful for there may be clues or blocks that are not bound to each other yet.

===Forcing===
In this method, the significance of the spaces will be shown. A space placed somewhere in the middle of an uncompleted row may force a large block to one side or the other. Also, a gap that is too small for any possible block may be filled with spaces.

For example, considering a row of ten cells with spaces in the fifth and seventh cells and with clues of &quot;3&quot; and &quot;2&quot;:
* the clue of &quot;3&quot; would be forced to the left, because it could not fit anywhere else.
* the empty gap on the sixth cell is too small to accommodate clues like &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; and may be filled with a space.
* finally, the clue of &quot;2&quot; will spread through the ninth cell according to method &quot;Simple Boxes&quot; above.

===Glue===
Sometimes, there is a box near the border that is not farther from the border than the length of the first clue. In this case, the first clue will spread through that box and will be forced outward from the border. In the simplest case, whenever a box is present in the first or last cells of a row or column, the first or last clue must be aligned to the edge of that row or column.
Considering a row of ten cells with a box in the third cell and with a clue of &quot;5&quot;, the clue of &quot;5&quot; will always span from the third to the fifth cell (but not necessarily to the second or the sixth). It is therefore possible to mark the third, fourth and fifth cell as belonging to the &quot;5&quot;.

Note: This method may also work in the middle of a row, farther away from the borders.

* A space may act as a border, if the first clue is forced to the right of that space.
* The &quot;first&quot; clue may also be preceded by some other clues, if all the clues are already bound to the left of the forcing space.

===Joining and splitting===
Boxes closer to each other may be sometimes joined together into one block or split by a space into several blocks. When there are two blocks with an empty cell between, this cell will be:
* A space if joining the two blocks by a box would produce a too large block
* A box if splitting the two blocks by a space would produce a too small block that does not have enough free cells remaining

For example, considering a row of fifteen cells with boxes in the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eleventh and thirteenth cell and with clues of &quot;5&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;2&quot;:

* The clue of &quot;5&quot; will join the first two blocks by a box into one large block, because a space would produce a block of only 4 boxes that is not enough there.
* The clues of &quot;2&quot; will split the last two blocks by a space, because a box would produce a block of 3 continuous boxes, which is not allowed there.
&quot;Note:&quot; The illustration picture also shows how the clues of &quot;2&quot; are further completed. This is, however, not part of the &quot;Joining and splitting&quot; technique, but the &quot;Glue&quot; technique described above.

===Punctuating===
To solve the puzzle, it is usually also very important to enclose each bound or completed block of boxes immediately by separating spaces as described in &quot;Simple spaces&quot; method. Precise punctuating usually leads to more &quot;Forcing&quot; and may be vital for finishing the puzzle. &quot;Note: The examples above did not do that only to remain simple.&quot;

===Mercury===
&quot;Mercury&quot; is a special case of &quot;Simple spaces&quot; technique. Its name comes from the way mercury pulls back from the sides of a container.

If there is a box in a row that is in the same distance from the border as the length of the first clue, the first cell will be a space. This is because the first clue would not fit to the left of the box. It will have to spread through that box, leaving the first cell behind. Furthermore, when the box is actually a block of more boxes to the right, there will be more spaces at the beginning of the row, determined by using this method several times.

===Contradictions===
Some more difficult puzzles may also require advanced reasoning. When all simple methods above are exhausted, searching for contradictions may help. It is wise to use a pencil (or other color) for that to facilitate corrections. The procedure includes:
# Trying an empty cell to be a box (or then a space).
# Using all available methods to solve as much as possible.
# If an error is found, the tried cell will not be a box for sure. It will be a space (or a box, if space was tried).

In this example a box is tried in the first row, which leads to a space at the beginning of that row. The space then &quot;forces&quot; a box in the first column, which &quot;glues&quot; to a block of three boxes in the fourth row. However, that is wrong because the third column does not allow any boxes there, which leads to a conclusion that the tried cell must not be a box, so it must be a space.

The problem of this method is that there is no quick way to tell which empty cell to try first. Usually only a few cells lead to any progress, and the other cells lead to dead ends. Most worthy cells to start with may be:
* cells that have many non-empty neighbors;
* cells that are close to the borders or close to the blocks of spaces;
* cells that are within rows that consist of more non-empty cells.

===Mathematical approach===
It is possible to get a start to a puzzle using a mathematical technique to fill in blocks for rows/columns independent of other rows/columns. This is a good &quot;first step&quot; and is a mathematical shortcut to techniques described above. The process is as follows:

# Add the clues together, plus 1 for each &quot;space&quot; in between. For example, if the clue is 6 2 3, this step produces the sum 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 13.
# Subtract this number from the total available in the row (usually the width or height of the puzzle). For example, if the clue in step 1 is in a row 15 cells wide, the difference is 15 - 13 = 2. Note: If spaces can be used on the left or right (top or bottom) borders, this &quot;shrinks&quot; the available area. If it is known that the rightmost cell is a space, the difference is 14 - 13 = 1.
# Any clues that are greater than the number in step 2 will have some blocks filled in. In the example, this applies to the clues 6 and 3, but not 2.
# For each clue in step 3, subtract the number in step 2 to determine the number of blocks that can be filled in. For example, the 6 clue will have (6 - 2 =) 4 blocks filled in and the 3 clue will have (3 - 2 =) 1. Note: Applying the same procedure to a clue that &quot;failed&quot; step 3 will produce a non-positive number, indicating that no blocks will be filled in for this clue. The clue 2 produces the number (2 - 2 =) 0; if there were a 1 clue, it would produce the number (1 - 2 =) -1.
# To fill in the blocks, assume the blocks are all pushed to one side, count from that side &quot;through&quot; the blocks, and backfill the appropriate number of blocks. This can be done from either direction. For example, the 6 clue can be done either of two ways as follows:
## From the left: Since the 6 is the first number, count 6 blocks from the left edge, ending in the 6th block. Now &quot;backfill&quot; 4 blocks (the number obtained in step 4), so that cells 3 through 6 are filled.
## From the right: Starting from the right, the clues that are to the right of the 6 clue must be accounted for. Starting from cell 15, count 3 cells for the 3 clue (to cell 13), then a space (12), then the 2 clue (10), then a space (9), then the 6 clue (3). From the 3rd cell, &quot;backfill&quot; 4 blocks, filling cells 3 through 6. The results are the same as doing it from the left in the step above.
# Repeat step 5 for all clues identified in step 3.

In the illustration, row 1 shows the cells that are filled under this procedure, rows 2 and 4 show how the blocks are pushed to one side in step 5, and rows 3 and 5 show the cells backfilled in step 5.

Using this technique for all rows and columns at the start of the puzzle produces a good head start into completing it. Note: Some rows/columns won&#x27;t yield any results initially. For example, a row of 20 cells with a clue of 1 4 2 5 will yield 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 15. 20 - 15 = 5. None of the clues are greater than 5. Also, this technique can be used on a smaller scale. If there are available spaces in the center or either side, even if certain clues are already discovered, this method can be used with the remaining clues and available spaces.

===Deeper recursion===
Some puzzles may require to go deeper with searching for the contradictions. This is, however, not possible simply by a pen and pencil, because of the many possibilities that must be searched. This method is practical for a computer to use.

===Multiple rows===
In some cases, reasoning over a set of rows may also lead to the next step of the solution even without contradictions and deeper recursion. However, finding such sets is usually as difficult as finding contradictions.

==Nonograms in computing==
Solving nonogram puzzles is an NP-complete problem. This means that there is no polynomial time algorithm that solves all nonogram puzzles unless P = NP.

However, certain classes of puzzles, such as those in which each row or column has only one block of cells and all cells are connected, may be solved in polynomial time by transforming the problem into an instance of 2-satisfiability.

==Software solvers==

An extensive comparison and discussion of nonogram solving algorithms is found at the WebPBN site (Web Paint-By-Number). A nonogram solver written in C++ and published in the journal &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; solves lines in quadratic time at most.

==Video games==
Nintendo has published several nonogram video games using the name . The Game Boy game &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; was initially released in Japan on March 14, 1995 to decent success. However, the game failed to become a hit in the U.S. market, despite a heavy advertising campaign by Nintendo. The game is of an escalating difficulty, with successive puzzle levels containing larger puzzles. Each puzzle has a limited amount of time to be cleared. Hints (line clears) may be requested at a time penalty, and mistakes made earn time penalties as well (the amount increasing for each mistake). &quot;Picross 2&quot; was released later for Game Boy and &quot;Mario&#x27;s Super Picross&quot; for the Super Famicom, neither of which were translated for the U.S. market (&quot;Mario&#x27;s Super Picross&quot; was, however, later released on the Wii Virtual Console&#x27;s PAL service on September 14, 2007, as part of its Hanabi Festival, as well as on the Nintendo Switch Online service worldwide on September 23rd, 2020). Both games introduced &quot;Wario&#x27;s Picross&quot; as well, featuring Mario&#x27;s nemesis in the role. These rounds vary by removing the hint function, and mistakes are not penalized—at the price that mistakes are not even revealed. These rounds can only be cleared when all correct boxes are marked, with no mistakes. The time limit was also removed. Nintendo also released eight &quot;Picross&quot; volumes on the Japanese Nintendo Power peripheral in Japan, called &quot;NP Picross&quot;, each with a new set of puzzles, including puzzles based around various Nintendo characters, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon.

Nintendo has released &quot;Picross DS&quot; for the Nintendo DS portable system in 2007. It contains several stages of varying difficulty, from 5x5 grids to 25x20 grids. Normal mode tells players if they made an error (with a time penalty) and free mode does not. A hint is available before starting the puzzle in all modes; the game reveals a complete row and column at random. Additional puzzles were available through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; some of the original Mario Picross puzzles were available. However, the service was shut down on 20 May 2014. Nintendo made new releases available bi-weekly. &quot;Picross DS&quot; was released in Europe and Australia on 11 May 2007 and in the United States on July 30, 2007 and has been received well by critics, including Craig Harris, Jessica Wadleigh and Dave McCarthy labelling the game &quot;Addictive&quot;. A 3D version of the game, titled &quot;Picross 3D&quot;, was also released for the DS in Japan in 2009 and internationally in 2010. A sequel, &quot;Picross 3D: Round 2&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015. Another downloadable version of the game was released for Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Nintendo eShop, called &quot;Picross e&quot;, &quot;Picross e2&quot;, and &quot;Picross e3&quot; released in 2013, with &quot;Picross e4&quot; released in 2014. Nintendo has also released a Pokémon spinoff on December 7, 2015 in the form of the freemium game of &quot;Pokémon Picross&quot; for Nintendo 3DS. &quot;My Nintendo Picross The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot; was released for Nintendo 3DS on March 31, 2016, exclusively as a premium reward for My Nintendo.

Other companies have also released nonogram video games, such as Falcross on iOS, Across-Stitch by Knitwit Studios on Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, and the Color Cross series of games by Little Worlds Studio on the Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, and iOS. In addition, nonogram puzzles have appeared in non-picross puzzle games, such as in Deadly Rooms of Death&#x27;s fifth installment, &quot;The Second Sky&quot;. In it, nonogram puzzles (again called &quot;Picross&quot; puzzles) representing in-game objects are optional, unlockable puzzles late into the game that can be played in the level &quot;The Central Station&quot;, and solving them unlocks bonus levels in the game. In 2018, Konami released a game titled &quot;Pixel Puzzle Collection&quot;, or &quot;Picross Puzzle&quot; (ピクロジパズル), featuring classic Konami characters and sprites.

==Other picture logic puzzles==
Pentomino paint-by-numbers is a variant in which the twelve pentomino shapes must be placed in the grid, without touching each other (even diagonally).

Triddlers are an offshoot that uses triangle shapes instead of squares.

Paint by pairs or Link-a-Pix consists of a grid, with numbers filling some squares; pairs of numbers must be located correctly and connected with a line filling a total of squares equal to that number. There is only one unique way to link all the squares in a properly-constructed puzzle. When completed, the squares that have lines are filled; the contrast with the blank squares reveals the picture. (As above, colored versions exist that involving matching numbers of the same color.)

Fill-a-Pix also uses a grid with numbers within. In this format, each number indicates how many of the squares immediately surrounding it, and itself, will be filled. A square marked &quot;9,&quot; for example, will have all eight surrounding squares and itself filled. If it is marked &quot;0&quot; those squares are all blank.

Maze-a-Pix uses a maze in a standard grid. When the single correct route from beginning to end is located, each &#x27;square&#x27; of the solution is filled in (alternatively, all non-solution squares are filled in) to create the picture.

Tile Paint is another type of picture logic puzzle by Nikoli. It works like regular nonograms except that it only specifies the &quot;total&quot; number of squares in each row or column that will be filled in and irregular sections within the grid have borders around them that indicate that, if one of the squares within it is filled in, all of them must be filled in.

<doc id="271812" wikidata="Q327922" url="?curid=271812" title="National unity government">
<text>A national unity government, government of national unity (GNU), or national union government is a broad coalition government consisting of all parties (or all major parties) in the legislature, usually formed during a time of war or other national emergency. A unity government according to the principles of consensus democracy lacks opposition, or opposition parties are too small and negligible.

==By country==
===Afghanistan===
Following the disputed 2014 presidential elections, a National Unity Government (NUG) between both run-off candidates was formed with Ashraf Ghani as President of Afghanistan and Abdullah Abdullah in the new office of Chief Executive of Afghanistan. This power-sharing agreement broke apart after the 2019 Afghan presidential election, after which Ghani abolished the office of Chief Executive while Abdullah again refused to recognize Ghani&#x27;s presidency and demanded the formation of a new government in northern Afghanistan. Both politicians lost power after the Taliban overthrew the Afghan government in 2021.

=== Canada ===
During World War I, the Conservative government of Sir Robert Borden invited the Liberal opposition to join the government as a means of dealing with the Conscription crisis of 1917. The Liberals, led by Sir Wilfrid Laurier refused; however, Borden was able to convince many individual Liberals to join what was called a &quot;Union Government&quot;, which defeated the Laurier Liberals in the fall 1917 election.

During World War II, the opposition Conservative Party ran under the name National Government in the 1940 election as a means of promoting their platform of creating a wartime national government coalition (evocative of the previous war&#x27;s &quot;Union government&quot;). The party was not successful in the election, which re-elected the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, whose party continued to rule alone for the duration of World War II.

====Newfoundland====
The Dominion of Newfoundland (not to be part of Canada for another three decades) had a National Government during World War I led by Edward Patrick Morris.

=== China ===
In modern Chinese history, the Republic of China twice saw United Fronts forms to provide national unity in a time of civil conflict. The First United Front (1923–1927) saw the Nationalists (KMT) and Communists (CCP) unite to end warlordism within the country, however since neither party was the centrally recognised Government of China at the time the First United Front cannot be viewed as a true example of a national unity government.

Following the advent of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the KMT, the now solely recognised central party of the country, once again opted to form the Second United Front with the CCP – the two parties at this point had been engaged in an open civil war since the collapse of the First United Front. This new front acted as a national unity government for the extent of the war and represented the solely recognised government for China at the time, though the overall level of cooperation between the two parties – past the cessation of hostility – was mostly nominal.

=== Croatia ===
Croatia formed a national unity government in 1991 under prime minister Franjo Gregurić in response to the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence. Even though the cabinet included ministers from minority parties, all heads of ministries were either from the majority Croatian Democratic Union or soon defected to it.

=== Estonia ===
Estonia had national unity governments during the Estonian War of Independence (Päts I–III Provisional cabinets) and after the 1924 coup d&#x27;état attempt by the Communist Party of Estonia (Jaakson cabinet).

=== Greece ===

A national unity government in Greece is often called ecumenical government:
* 1926 under Alexandros Zaimis
* 1944 under Georgios Papandreou
* 1974 under Konstantinos Karamanlis
* 1989 under Xenophon Zolotas
* 2011 under Lucas Papademos

=== Hungary ===
There are five periods in Hungary when national unity governments emerged:
* 1917–1918, during World War I (Móric Esterházy and Sándor Wekerle cabinets)
* 1919–1920, cabinet of Károly Huszár, restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary
* 1944–1945, during World War II, Government of National Unity (Ferenc Szálasi cabinet)
* 1944–1947, opposition government during World War II (Béla Miklós) and after following Zoltán Tildy and Ferenc Nagy cabinets) 
* 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (third cabinet of Imre Nagy)

===Ireland===

A national unity government, following the failure of government formation after the 2020 general election, was suggested to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, a Fianna Fáil–Fine Gael–Green coalition was formed, creating the 32nd government of Ireland.

=== Israel ===
Israel has had several national unity governments, in which major rival parties formed a ruling coalition. Such coalitions were formed in the days leading up to the Six-Day War in 1967, in the late 1980s and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The 36th government, formed in 2021, was a national unity government that has been frequently described as the most diverse governments in Israeli history, consisting of right-wing, centrist, left-wing and one Arab Islamist political party. Following the Hamas attacks of October 2023, the
National Unity party became part of an Israeli war cabinet.

=== Italy ===

In the republican era, the first two cabinets, led by Alcide De Gasperi, were supported by all three of the following parties, the pro-American Christian Democrats and the pro-Soviet Italian Communist Party and Italian Socialist Party.

Afterwards, the first government generally recognised as a national unity government was the third Andreotti Cabinet, also known as &quot;non-no confidence vote&quot; government, as the Italian Communist Party decided to not take part at the confidence vote. The communists voted in favour of the motion of confidence for the following cabinet, still led by Giulio Andreotti.

During the Eurozone crisis, the two main parties, The People of Freedom and the Democratic Party, along with other minor political forces, supported the Monti cabinet, and eventually, after the 2013 general election, formed a grand coalition in support of the Letta Cabinet, which, however, was opposed by a new major political force in parliament, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.

The Draghi Cabinet, formed during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis, has been described as a national unity government. It comprises a mixture of independent experts as well as politicians from most of Italy&#x27;s political parties: the Five Star Movement, Democratic Party, League, Forza Italia, Italia Viva, and Free and Equal.

The following is a list of national unity or grand coalition governments:
*De Gasperi II Cabinet (14 July 1946 – 2 February 1947)
*De Gasperi III Cabinet (2 February 1947 – 1 June 1947)
*Andreotti III Cabinet (29 July 1976 – 11 March 1978)
*Andreotti IV Cabinet (11 March 1978 – 20 March 1979)
*Ciampi Cabinet (28 April 1993 – 10 May 1994) – 
*Monti Cabinet (16 November 2011 – 28 April 2013)
*Letta Cabinet (28 April 2013 – 22 February 2014) – 
*Draghi Cabinet (13 February 2021 – 22 October 2022)

===Kenya===
From 2008 to 2013, Kenya was governed by Government of National Unity between the rival Party of National Unity of Mwai Kibaki and the Orange Democratic Movement of Raila Odinga following the 2007 presidential election and subsequent violence. This was due to the ODM winning the majority of seats in the National Assembly, but controversially losing the presidential election by a margin that has since been called into question for its validity.

===Lebanon===
Since Lebanon is a multireligious state and consensus democracy, having a national unity government is more favorable in this country. Unlike other democracies, no group in Lebanon can govern alone.

===Libya===
Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, selected as Prime Minister of Libya by the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) on 5 February 2021, is required under the agreements made by the LPDF to nominate a cabinet of ministers to the House of Representatives (HoR) by 26 February 2021, establishing the Government of National Unity (Libya).

=== Luxembourg ===
Luxembourg has had two &quot;National Union Governments&quot;. The first was formed in 1916, during World War I (in which Luxembourg was neutral, but occupied by Germany nonetheless). It was led by Victor Thorn and included all of the major factions in the Chamber of Deputies, but lasted for only sixteen months.

The second National Union Government was formed in November 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, which had devastated Luxembourg. It was led by Pierre Dupong, who had been prime minister in the government in exile in the war, and included all four parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies. The government lasted until 1947, by which time, a normal coalition between two of the three largest parties had been arranged, thus maintaining the confidence of the legislature.

In addition, Luxembourg had a &quot;Liberation Government&quot; between November 1944 and November 1945, also under Dupong. It served a similar emergency role to a national government, but included only the two largest parties, the CSV and the LSAP.

=== Malaysia ===
For the first time in Malaysian history, a hung parliament occurred when no political party managed to command a simple majority in the Dewan Rakyat from the 15th general election (GE15). Upon the Yang di-Pertuan Agong&#x27;s call to form a unity government, both Pakatan Harapan and Barisan Nasional agreed to join forces, with Anwar Ibrahim elected as the Prime Minister while Perikatan Nasional decided to be the opposition party.

=== Myanmar ===
After the 2021 Myanmar coup, on 16 April 2021, the exiled Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) announced the formation of a National Unity Government (), pursuant to the Federal Democracy Charter released on 31 March 2021. The National Unity Government re-introduced the position of Prime Minister, and consists of CRPH members and other ethnic leaders.

=== Namibia ===
=== Nepal ===
Following the devastating April 2015 Nepal earthquake, top political parties in Nepal have decided to form a national unity government in order to handle the crisis and draft a constitution that&#x27;s been long overdue. The major political parties and unified political fronts have agreed to settle the disputed issues of the constitution drafting process by 3 June and to form a national unity government.

=== Palestine ===

The Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014 was a national unity government of the Palestinian National Authority under Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas formed on 2 June 2014 following the Fatah-Hamas Reconciliation Agreement that had been signed on 23 April 2014. The ministers were nominally independent, but overwhelmingly seen as loyal to President Abbas and his Fatah movement or to smaller leftist factions, none of whom were believed to have close ties to Hamas. However, the Unity Government was not approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council, leading to its legitimacy being questioned. The Unity Government dissolved on 17 June 2015 after President Abbas said it was unable to operate in the Gaza Strip.

=== Poland ===
In the 1989 Polish parliamentary election, Poland&#x27;s first semi-free election since World War II, candidates backed by the Solidarity movement won all 161 seats up for free election. The ruling Communist-dominated Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth—comprising the Communist Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), the United People&#x27;s Party (ZSL), and the Democratic Party (SD)—broke down soon after, as the ZSL and SD formed an alliance with Solidarity. This forced President Wojciech Jaruzelski to appoint the Cabinet of Tadeusz Mazowiecki on 12 September 1989, Poland&#x27;s first government since World War II with a non-Communist majority. It was a national unity government of Solidarity-endorsed ministers alongside the PZPR, ZSL, and SD, with the Communists still controlling the Defense and Interior ministries. The PZPR was dissolved on 29 January 1990 and its former ministers resigned on 6 July.

=== Portugal ===
A national unity government (known as the Sacred Union Government; Port.: &quot;Governo da União Sagrada&quot;) was in place during the first year of Portuguese participation in World War I, led by the Evolutionist Party president António José de Almeida from 15 March 1916 to 25 April 1917, and with the participation of the Democratic Party of Afonso Costa.

=== Rwanda ===
After Rwandan genocide in 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), has ruled Rwanda using tactics which have been characterized as authoritarian. Elections are manipulated in various ways including banning opposition parties, arresting or assassinating critics, and electoral fraud.

===South Africa===
The interim constitution negotiated by the multi-party negotiations to end apartheid that started in 1990 allowed all parties that gained more than 5% of the vote to participate in a Government of National Unity. The new government that was elected in the 1994 general election therefore had members from many political parties in the cabinet. This government of national unity lasted until the 1999 general election, although it was dominated by the African National Congress (ANC) and a reported lack of shared decision-making prompted the second-largest party, the National Party, to withdraw from the GNU in 1996.

In the 2024 South African general election, support for the ruling ANC party significantly declined. The ANC remained the largest party but lost the parliamentary majority that it had held since the inaugural post-apartheid election in 1994, which required negotiations between parties on the formation of a government. On 14 June 2024, the ANC, the Democratic Alliance (DA), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA), agreed to form a coalition which they referred to as a &#x27;Government of National Unity&#x27; (GNU), led by the ANC&#x27;s Cyril Ramaphosa who was re-elected President of South Africa with the support of the parties who then formed part of the GNU. A further six parties subsequently joined the GNU to form a grand coalition of ten parties, with jointly 287 seats in the 400 seat parliament (72%).

===Sri Lanka===
Following the fall of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, the United National Party who won the 2015 elections formed a National Unity Government with the main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party Under Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickramasinghe.

===Sweden===

Sweden has only had one national unity government; The Hansson III Cabinet during World War II. The government was made up of all parties in the parliament except the Communist party which was considered to be pro-Soviet and hence unreliable. The government consisted of six ministers from the Social Democratic party (including prime minister Per Albin Hansson), three from the Right Wing party, three from the Liberal People&#x27;s party, three from the Farmer&#x27;s League and two nonpartisan politicians. The ultimate goal of this government&#x27;s policy was to keep Sweden out of the war, which they also succeeded with. The Hansson government introduced censorship of press, literature and culture, which was applied to both pro-nazi and pro-communist propaganda. The government also approved departures from the neutrality policy to keep Sweden out of the war.

=== United Kingdom ===

First-past-the-post voting, the British electoral system, has long increased the likelihood of a single party gaining a majority of Members of Parliament, who have run most departments and the government legislation of the country since the early 20th century.

After the formation of clear political parties in the Lords and Commons, the first national unity government came in response to the Napoleonic Wars. William Pitt the Younger offered to replace Prime Minister Henry Addington&#x27;s government with a cabinet including all of the major parliamentary leaders such as himself, Charles James Fox, and Lord Grenville. This proved impossible because of irreconcilable policy differences between the factions (including Fox&#x27;s opposition to the war in general), Fox&#x27;s intense animosity towards Pitt the Younger, and King George III&#x27;s refusal to appoint a government including Fox. After the death of Pitt the Younger in 1806, King George finally acquiesced and allowed Grenville and Fox to form a new &quot;Ministry of All the Talents.&quot; This ministry had cross-party support, ranging from very socially conservative Tories, and the broad range of Whigs (among them Charles James Fox and the Foxites as well as Grenvillites), selected for their combined broad political support in both Houses of Parliament and known capabilities in a time of crisis. However, the ministry was frustrated in its attempts to make peace with the First French Empire, and despite one major legislative success (the Slave Trade Act 1807 banning the Atlantic slave trade in the British Empire), it fell apart in 1807 over the question of Catholic Emancipation and was replaced following a general election by a Tory ministry led by the Duke of Portland.

The world wars and the long recovery to the Great Depression would be the only further instances of National Governments. The next major government representing all parties came during World War II after the Norway Debate, in which Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his cabinet were condemned for their handling of the war and faced a vote of no confidence in which members of his own party voted with the Opposition against him. The debate also revealed that Winston Churchill, an early opponent of Nazi Germany and appeasement, would be the only Conservative minister under which both Labour and Conservative MPs would join a government. Churchill agreed to form a new government after Chamberlain resigned. The subsequent Churchill war ministry included Churchill as prime minister, Labour Party Leader Clement Attlee as deputy prime minister, Conservative Party Leader Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, and Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair as Secretary of State for Air.

====Quasi-national governments====
After 10 years of rule by the Liberal Party, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith agreed to form a new coalition ministry with the Conservative Party in response to World War I in 1915. However, the government remained dominated by the Liberals with few Conservatives in important Cabinet posts. Asquith resigned as Conservatives refused to serve in his government in 1916, and David Lloyd George and Conservative Party Leader Bonar Law formed a new coalition government from Conservatives and a minority of Liberals opposed to Asquith&#x27;s handling of the war, which was opposed by Asquith&#x27;s Liberals. In the 1918 general election held after the end of the war, Coalition-endorsed candidates won a large majority. Thereafter a coalition that faced few opposition MPs under David Lloyd George lasted until 1922 when, at the Carlton Club meeting, Conservative backbenchers declared that the party would fight the forthcoming election with its own leader and programme.

During the Great Depression the first of four consecutive &quot;National Governments&quot; was formed in 1931 by Ramsay MacDonald (Labour/National Labour) succeeded by Stanley Baldwin (Conservative) with their largest opponent and the Liberals. Most members of the Labour and Liberal Parties rejected the government, however, and moved to the opposition benches leaving MacDonald&#x27;s supporters to rival mainstream party candidates in many cases as National Labour/National Labour Organisation or in the Liberal National Party. Notably candidates styled in this way contested the 1935 election; this long period of quasi-national government took in broader support and widened its selections of ministers in the war years, and its fourth transmutation persisted until the general election of 1945.

In 2019, the idea of a government of National Unity was proposed by politicians including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson to stop a no-deal Brexit spearheaded by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

====Northern Ireland====

The Belfast Agreement, which sets out the workings of the Northern Ireland Assembly, effectively enforces all-party governments in Northern Ireland. All governments formed since the foundation of the Northern Ireland Executive in 1999 have contained ministers from the five main parties (Sinn Féin, Democratic Unionist Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Social Democratic and Labour Party and Alliance), with seats allocated using the d&#x27;Hondt method.

=== United States ===
In hopes of bridging partisan politics during the American Civil War, Republican Abraham Lincoln ran for his second term under the new National Union Party with Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate. The National Union Party allowed members to retain affiliations with other political parties.

Since the Civil War, there has never been a &quot;national unity&quot; government in the United States in the traditional sense. There have been several instances, however, during national disasters or wars, that the two parties have briefly &quot;rallied around the President&quot;. Such instances include the attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the September 11 attacks, all of which not only had a worldwide effect, but preceded a massive spike in the approval rating of the sitting president.

=== Zimbabwe ===

The 2008–2009 Zimbabwean political negotiations between the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (led by Morgan Tsvangirai), its small splinter group, the Movement for Democratic Change – Mutambara (led by Arthur Mutambara), and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (led by Robert Mugabe) created a framework for a power-sharing executive government between the two parties. These negotiations followed the 2008 presidential election, in which Mugabe was controversially re-elected, as well as the 2008 parliamentary election, in which the MDC won a majority in the House of Assembly. The new national unity government, including Tsvangirai, was sworn in on 11 February 2009.

<text>Situation puzzles, often referred to as minute mysteries, [[lateral thinking]] puzzles or &quot;yes/no&quot; puzzles, are puzzles in which participants are to construct a story that the host has in mind, basing on a puzzling situation that is given at the start.

Usually, situation puzzles are played in a group, with one person hosting the puzzle and the others asking questions which can only be answered with a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer. Depending upon the settings and level of difficulty, other answers, hints or simple explanations of why the answer is yes or no, may be considered acceptable. The puzzle is solved when one of the players is able to recite the narrative the host had in mind, in particular explaining whatever aspect of the initial scenario was puzzling.

These puzzles are inexact and many puzzle statements have more than one possible fitting answer. The goal however is to find out the story as the host has it in mind, not just any plausible answer. Critical thinking and reading, logical thinking, as well as lateral thinking may all be required to solve a situation puzzle.

The term &quot;lateral thinking&quot; was coined by Edward de Bono to denote a creative problem-solving style that involves looking at the given situation from unexpected angles, and is typically necessary to the solution of situation puzzles.

The term &quot;lateral-thinking puzzle&quot; was popularised by Paul Sloane in his 1992 book &quot;Lateral Thinking Puzzlers&quot;.

==Example==

One situation puzzle would be:

The question-and-answer segment might go something like this.
#Question: Could the bartender hear him? Answer: Yes
#Question: Was the bartender angry for some reason? A: No
#Question: Was the gun a water pistol? A: No
#Question: Did they know each other from before? A: Irrelevant (or: &quot;no&quot; since either way it does not affect the story)
#Question: Was the man&#x27;s &quot;thank you&quot; sarcastic? A: No (or with a small hint: &quot;No, he was genuinely grateful&quot;)
#Question: Did the man ask for water in an offensive way? A: No
#Question: Did the man ask for water in some strange way? A: Yes

Eventually the questions lead up to the conclusion that the man had the hiccups, and that his reason for requesting a drink of water was not to quench his thirst but to cure his hiccups. The bartender realized this and chose instead to cure the hiccups by frightening the man with the gun. Once the man realized that his hiccups were gone, he no longer needed a drink of water, gratefully thanked the bartender, and left.

== Terminology ==
* Yope is a word devised to answer a question with yes and no simultaneously, in a sense saying &quot;Yes, but ...&quot; and &quot;No, but ...&quot; at the same time. This would be used when it would be misleading to give a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer to the player&#x27;s question. It can be compared to the Japanese and Korean term &quot;mu&quot;, which is often translated as meaning that the question must be &quot;unasked&quot;, as it cannot be answered.
* N/a (or stating &quot;irrelevant&quot;) is used when a question is not applicable to the current situation or when a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer would not provide any usable information to solving the puzzle.
* Irrelevant, but assume yes (or no) is used when the situation is the same regardless of what the correct answer to the question is, but assuming one direction will make further questioning easier or the situation more likely. An example question that might have this answer from the puzzle above is: “Was the gun loaded?”

<doc id="271821" wikidata="Q2114480" url="?curid=271821" title="Dervla Murphy">
<text>Dervla Murphy (28 November 1931 – 22 May 2022) was an Irish touring cyclist and author of adventure travel books, writing for more than 50 years.

Murphy is best known for her 1965 book &quot;Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle&quot;, about an overland cycling trip through Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. She followed this with volunteer work helping Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal and trekking with a mule through Ethiopia. Murphy took a break from travel writing following the birth of her daughter, and then wrote about her travels with Rachel in India, Pakistan, South America, Madagascar and Cameroon. She later wrote about her solo trips through Romania, Africa, Laos, the states of the former Yugoslavia and Siberia. In 2005, she visited Cuba with her daughter and three granddaughters.

Murphy normally travelled alone without luxuries and depending on the hospitality of local people. She was in some dangerous situations; for example, she was attacked by wolves in the former Yugoslavia, threatened by soldiers in Ethiopia, and robbed in Siberia. However, she described her worst incident as tripping over cats at home and shattering her left arm.

==Early life==

Dervla Murphy was born and brought up in Lismore, County Waterford. Her parents were from Dublin and had moved to Lismore when her father was appointed county librarian. When Murphy was one year old, her mother developed rheumatoid arthritis, from which she suffered for the rest of her life. They were advised not to have any more children and Dervla grew up as an only child. From a young age, Murphy planned to travel:

For my tenth birthday my parents gave me a second-hand bicycle and Pappa [her grandfather] sent me a second-hand atlas. Already I was an enthusiastic cyclist, though I had never before owned a bicycle, and soon after my birthday I resolved to cycle to India one day. I have never forgotten the exact spot, on a steep hill near Lismore, where this decision was made. Half-way up I rather proudly looked at my legs, slowly pushing the pedals around, and the thought came &quot;If I went on doing this for long enough I could get to India.&quot;

Murphy attended secondary school at the Ursuline Convent in Waterford but left at age 14 to take care of her disabled mother. During young adulthood she took a number of short trips (between three and six weeks): to Wales and southern England in 1951; to Belgium, Germany and France in 1952; and two trips to Spain in 1954 and 1956. She published a number of travel articles in the &quot;Hibernia&quot; journal and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper, but her Spanish travel book was rejected by publishers.

Murphy&#x27;s first lover, Godfrey, died abroad in 1958 and her father became ill with nephritis, a complication of influenza, and died in February 1961. Her mother&#x27;s health had been deteriorating for many years, and she died in August 1962. Her mother&#x27;s death freed Murphy from her domestic duties and allowed her to make the extended trip for which she had long planned:
The hardships and poverty of my youth had been a good apprenticeship for this form of travel. I had been brought up to understand that material possessions and physical comfort should never be confused with success, achievement and security.

Murphy published an autobiography &quot;Wheels Within Wheels&quot; in 1979, describing her life before the journey described in &quot;Full Tilt&quot;.

==Travels and writing==
===&quot;Full Tilt&quot; and other early writings===

In 1963 Murphy set off on her first long-distance bicycle tour, a self-supported trip from Ireland to India. Taking a pistol along with other equipment aboard her Armstrong Cadet men&#x27;s bicycle (named &quot;Rozinante&quot; in allusion to Don Quixote&#x27;s steed, and always known as &quot;Roz&quot;), she passed through Europe during one of the worst winters in years. In Yugoslavia, Murphy began to write a journal instead of mailing letters. In Iran she used her gun to frighten off a group of thieves, and &quot;used unprintable tactics&quot; to escape from an attempted rapist at a police station. She received her worst injury of the journey on a bus in Afghanistan, when a rifle butt hit her and fractured three ribs; however, this only delayed her for a short while. She wrote appreciatively about the landscape and people of Afghanistan, calling herself &quot;Afghanatical&quot; and claiming that the Afghan &quot;is a man after my own heart&quot;. In Pakistan, she visited Swat (where she was a guest of the last wali, Miangul Aurangzeb) and the mountain area of Gilgit. The final leg of her trip took her through the Punjab region and over the border to India towards Delhi. Her journal was later published by John Murray as her first book &quot;Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle&quot;. She had sent it to John Murray at the suggestion of Penelope Betjeman whom she had met in Delhi during her journey, although initially too modest to contact such an illustrious publisher of travel books; she had a happy publishing relationship with Jock Murray (John Murray VI) until his death in 1993.

After arriving in Delhi, Murphy worked as a volunteer helping Tibetan refugees under the auspices of Save the Children. She spent five months in a refugee camp in Dharamsala run by Tsering Dolma, sister of the 14th Dalai Lama. She then cycled through the Kullu Valley, spending Christmas in Malana. Her journals from this period were published in her second book, &quot;Tibetan Foothold&quot;. 

On returning to Europe, Murphy took part in a fundraising campaign for Save the Children, and in 1965 she worked with another group of Tibetan refugees in Pokhara, Nepal (described in &quot;The Waiting Land&quot;). 

In 1966 Murphy made her first trip to Africa. She travelled to Ethiopia and walked with a pack mule from Asmara to Addis Ababa, confronted by Kalashnikov-carrying soldiers on the way. This journey was described in her fourth book, &quot;In Ethiopia with a Mule&quot;.

===Travels with Rachel===
Murphy&#x27;s daughter Rachel accompanied her on a trip to India at the age of five; they flew into Bombay and travelled to Goa and Coorg (described in &quot;On a Shoestring to Coorg&quot;). The pair later journeyed to Baltistan (&quot;Where the Indus is Young&quot;), Peru (&quot;Eight Feet in the Andes&quot;) and Madagascar (&quot;Muddling through in Madagascar&quot;). Their last trip was through Cameroon on a horse, where Dervla was frequently mistaken for Rachel&#x27;s husband (&quot;Cameroon with Egbert&quot;). She surmised that this misgendering occurred not only because of her physique but also because the idea of women travelling so far without a man was inconceivable. She tried different ways to correct the understanding, the most successful being unbuttoning her shirt. &quot;It was, like her literary voice, frank and persuasive,&quot; wrote Jori Finkel in her &quot;Washington Post&quot; obituary.

On travelling with a child, Murphy wrote:

A child&#x27;s presence emphasises your trust in the community&#x27;s goodwill. And because children pay little attention to racial or cultural differences, junior companions rapidly demolish barriers of shyness or apprehension often raised when foreigners unexpectedly approach a remote village.
===Politicisation===
In 1978, Murphy wrote &quot;A Place Apart&quot; about her travels in Northern Ireland and encounters with members of the Protestant and Catholic religious communities. It won the 1979 Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. She credits her 1982 book &quot;Race to the Finish? The Nuclear Stakes&quot; as a turning point that led her to write more about political issues. In 1985 she lived for several months in Bradford and Birmingham, talking to members of the Asian, Afro-Caribbean and White communities and witnessing first-hand one of the Handsworth riots (described in &quot;Tales From Two Cities&quot;). In 1992 she cycled from Kenya to Zimbabwe, where she witnessed the impact of AIDS; when describing this journey in &quot;The Ukimwi Road&quot;, she criticised the role of non-governmental organisations in sub-Saharan Africa. Her other writings include discussions about the aftermath of apartheid (&quot;South from the Limpopo&quot;) and the Rwandan genocide (&quot;Visiting Rwanda&quot;), the displacement of tribal peoples (&quot;One Foot in Laos&quot;), and post-war reconstruction of the Balkans (&quot;Through the Embers of Chaos&quot;). 

She was anti-globalization and critical of NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. She spoke out against nuclear power and climate change.

Murphy stated that some readers disapproved of the &quot;political stuff&quot;, but another group &quot;tells me they haven&#x27;t thought about these things in this way before and are glad that I&#x27;ve written and thought more about the political side. My view is that I have these things I want to say and I don&#x27;t really care if it spoils a pure travel book.&quot;

===Irish babushka===
In 2002, aged 71, Murphy planned to cycle in the Ussuriland region of eastern Russia. She broke her knee while on the Baikal Amur Mainline railway, then tore a calf muscle while recuperating at Lake Baikal, and her plans changed to a journey around Siberia by train, boat and bus, documented in &quot;Through Siberia by Accident&quot;. She revisited Siberia and wrote a companion book, &quot;Silverland&quot;. 

In 2005, she visited Cuba with her daughter and three granddaughters, and made two return trips in 2006 and 2007 (described in &quot;The Island that Dared&quot;). Her Havana experiences are also featured in a collection of traveller&#x27;s tales.

Over the summer of 2011, Murphy spent a month in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, where she met liberals and Islamists, Hamas and Fatah supporters. She described her stay in a book published in 2013: &quot;A Month by the Sea&quot;. She wrote about further encounters with Israelis and Palestinians in her 2015 book, &quot;Between River and Sea&quot;.

==Personal life and interests==
Murphy never married. In 1968 she gave birth to her only child, Rachel, fathered by &quot;Irish Times&quot; journalist Terence de Vere White. Her decision to bring up her daughter alone was described as &quot;a brave choice in 1960s Ireland&quot; by &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot;, although she said she felt safe from criticism because she was in her thirties and was financially and professionally secure. Following Rachel&#x27;s birth, she spent five years as a book reviewer before returning to travel writing.

Murphy lived in Lismore with five dogs and three cats. She was a patron of Sustrans, a British charity for sustainable travel, and of the Lismore Immrama Festival of Travel Writing.

In 2009 Murphy appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Great Lives&quot;, nominating Freya Stark as a Great Life, supported by expert John Murray VII of the publishing family.

In April 2022, she spoke at her home to an interviewer from the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, who was &quot;instructed by her publisher to bring along some &#x27;really good cheddar&#x27;. And beer.&quot; During the conversation Murphy &quot;claim[ed] to have no time to dwell on the past because she finds so much in current events to worry about, following the news on the BBC World Service radio and Al Jazeera on her computer because she has no desire for — indeed, has never owned — a television.&quot; and said that &quot;There are so many books to be read. The problem is, at 90, there isn’t enough time to read them all&quot;.

=== Death ===
Murphy died at her home in Lismore on 22 May 2022, aged 90. She was survived by her daughter Rachel and her three grand-daughters. The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, said &quot;Her contribution to writing, and to travel writing in particular, had a unique commitment to the value of human experience in all its diversity.&quot;

== Recognition ==

In 2019 she was presented with the inaugural &quot;Inspiring Cyclist of the Year&quot; award by Dublin-based advocacy group I BIKE Dublin. The same year, she received the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Ness Award &quot;for the popularisation of geography through travel literature&quot;.

==Publications==

Murphy&#x27;s books from 1965 to 1979 have all been republished in new editions by Eland, as travel classics.

<doc id="271829" wikidata="Q2964710" url="?curid=271829" title="Chris Evans (presenter)">
<text>Christopher James Evans (born 1 April 1966) is an English television presenter, radio DJ and producer for radio and television. He started his broadcasting career working for Piccadilly Radio, Manchester, as a teenager, before moving to London as a presenter for the BBC&#x27;s BBC Radio London and then Channel 4 television, where &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; made him a star. Soon he was able to dictate highly favourable terms, allowing him to broadcast on competing radio and TV stations. Slots like &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot; and &quot;TFI Friday&quot; provided a mix of celebrity interviews, music and comic games, delivered in an irreverent style that attracted high ratings, though often also generated significant numbers of complaints. By 2000, he was the UK&#x27;s highest paid entertainer, according to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List. In the tax year to April 2017, he was the BBC&#x27;s highest-paid presenter, earning between £2.2m and £2.25m annually.

In 2005, he started a new career on BBC Radio 2, hosting his long-running &quot;Drivetime&quot; programme in April 2006, before moving in 2010 to host &quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot; every weekday morning. He presented &quot;The One Show&quot; on Fridays between 2010 and 2015. Between 2011 and 2018, he co-hosted Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park.

In 2015, Evans signed a three-year deal to lead a new &quot;Top Gear&quot; line-up and presented a revival series of &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. On 4 July 2016, he announced that he would be stepping down as presenter of &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

On 3 September 2018, he announced that he would be leaving &quot;The Radio 2 Breakfast Show&quot; on Christmas Eve, and would be going to Virgin Radio UK to present its breakfast show. He moved from BBC Radio 2 with most of his regular team.

==Early life==
Evans was born in Warrington, England, the youngest child of bookmaker and health authority wages clerk Martin Joseph Evans (12 November 1921 – 25 April 1979), and Minnie Beardsall (1926–2018), who managed a corner shop. His siblings are brother David (born 1953) and sister Diane (born 1963). He started his schooling at St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England Infants and Junior School, and later the Junior School in Orford, Warrington. Evans&#x27;s father died of colorectal cancer, and his mother was a breast cancer survivor.

He passed the Eleven-Plus exam and started at Boteler Grammar School, Warrington. After the death of his father on Wednesday, 24 April 1979, the 13-year-old Evans took part-time work at an outlet of T. J. &amp; B. McLoughlin&#x27;s newsagent–tobacconist in Woolston, and ran an alternative tuck-shop at Padgate High School, which was a comprehensive school he attended for the final three years of his secondary education. Evans left secondary school aged 16 after moving into the sixth form, and then had a number of dead-end jobs in and around Warrington, including at a private detective agency and, notoriously, as a &quot;Tarzan-ogram&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
Evans began his professional career at Piccadilly Radio, Manchester, in 1983, where he had previously had unpaid schoolboy work. Until 1984 Evans had three jobs: as an assistant to Timmy Mallett, and playing a character on his show called &#x27;Nobby Nolevel&#x27; (&#x27;No &#x27;O&#x27; Level&#x27;); acting as a disc jockey in the evenings at local pubs when he was not at Piccadilly Radio; and still working at the newsagents, opening up daily at 5 a.m. to sort out the newspaper deliveries.

Evans switched to a full-time position at the station in 1984, his new role including being driven around the Manchester area in the radio car to turn up at listeners&#x27; houses. In addition he was producer to presenter James H. Reeve. Following this he presented a weekday graveyard slot with competitions and segments where listeners had opportunities to sell their belongings on air.

After working as a producer on Richard Branson&#x27;s service &quot;The Superstation&quot;, where he produced material for Jonathan Ross, Evans went on to work at the newly launched BBC Greater London Radio, first as a producer on Emma Freud&#x27;s mid-morning show, then on &quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot; with Danny Baker.

Owing to his success working on both shows, Evans was offered a producer role at BBC Radio 1, but was persuaded to stay at GLR after station controller Matthew Bannister gave him the chance to present his own show, taking over Saturday afternoons in early 1990. Three months later, he started presenting &quot;The Greenhouse&quot;, a Monday-to-Thursday evening show; he remained in this slot until the end of 1990.

In early 1991, as a result of his first regular TV hosting work presenting the &quot;Power Up&quot; breakfast show on The Power Station for British Satellite Broadcasting, Evans moved to presenting &quot;Round at Chris&#x27;s&quot;, every Saturday morning from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which he continued to present until April 1993.

===Career success===
In addition to his Saturday morning show on GLR, in March 1992 Evans began presenting a Sunday afternoon show on BBC Radio 1, replacing Phillip Schofield. His show, &quot;Too Much Gravy&quot;, was broadcast from 14:30 to 16:00 and ended in September 1992. His move to Radio 1 was short-lived but seen as a huge success, with controller Johnny Beerling later admitting he wished he&#x27;d offered Evans a full-time show there and then. At the time, however, Evans objected that Radio 1 had attempted to constrain his style, preventing him from using the &quot;zoo&quot; format, allegedly because Steve Wright was already doing that on the station.

In April 1993, Evans left GLR and joined the new Virgin Radio, to host a Saturday morning show.

===&quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;===

Evans&#x27;s departure from radio was in part so he could devote his time to the new Channel 4 breakfast television show, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, from 28 September 1992. He co-hosted the show with Gaby Roslin.

Evans left &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; on 29 September 1994 and formed his own television production company, Ginger Productions. Its first major programme, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Your Toothbrush&quot;, was broadcast between 1994 and 1995. The original concepts proved to be lucrative for Evans as its format was sold to numerous foreign broadcasters.

===&quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot;===
In April 1995, Evans returned to radio to host the flagship &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot;. Evans negotiated into his contract with Radio 1 a clause allowing him to still make television programmes, and specifically an option to make a Friday night programme for Channel 4. A further clause required the &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; to be produced independently by Evans&#x27;s Ginger company, rather than in-house by BBC Radio.

Allowed to create the &quot;zoo&quot; format he had previously been disallowed from performing on Radio 1, Evans was given a free rein by his friend, the station&#x27;s controller Matthew Bannister. Critics hated innuendo-laden features like Honk Your Horn and in Bed with Your Girlfriend, but Evans put on 600,000 new listeners over Steve Wright – one for every £5 spent on salary and advertising. The effect also flowed through into the listening figures for later programmes. The audience grew as the breakfast format became more outrageous: humiliating assistant Holly Samos by repeatedly asking her about her sex life (Evans and Samos were reportedly in a relationship at periods through their time working together), and encouraging two female guests to perform a strip show on live radio. The show&#x27;s highest listening figure reached 7.5 million.

Evans began making editions of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;TFI Friday&quot; from 1996. The show – devised, produced and hosted by Evans through his Ginger Media company – combined celebrity interviews, musical guests and daft games and competitions. Largely based on the successful formula of his radio show, it was initially a big success. However, as the success of both shows peaked, combined with a string of celebrity relationships and highly publicised nights drinking with friends Danny Baker and Paul Gascoigne, the strain began to show, and a model emerged described as a &quot;template for his approach to all his subsequent projects – an abundance of enthusiasm at the beginning which eventually falls prey to boredom and shiftlessness.&quot;

Beginning to think he was indispensable at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day&#x27;s pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, and Evans never apologised. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.

However, following the summer break things got decidedly worse. Criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for a tasteless joke about Holocaust victim Anne Frank, Evans countered with an item about haemorrhoids. Asked by Bannister to watch the rules, Evans the next day branded Bannister &quot;The Fat Controller&quot;. In November, Evans announced on air that he was medically unfit to be on the radio – Bannister re-negotiated his contract to double his holiday to twice that of other Radio 1 DJs. After more publicised public drinking and self-confessed illness, Evans&#x27;s spell at the station ended in January 1997 when he quit after his demand not to host the show on Friday (to have a full day getting ready for his TV show) was not accepted.

&quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; was taken over by Mark and Lard (Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley). Ratings fell significantly and they were replaced after eight months with the relatively unknown Kevin Greening and the well-known children&#x27;s TV presenter Zoe Ball. Their tenure started on 13 October 1997.

===Virgin Radio===
During a holiday in Killarney, Evans listened to the Irish broadcaster Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan&#x27;s show made him want to return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8 million to 2.6 million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00 am, Evans&#x27;s crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans on a Friday.

As Richard Branson had decided to reduce his media holding, he began talks to sell the station to Capital Radio in a deal that would have given him 10% of holding company Capital Group. As this became public knowledge, Evans, who did not want to work for Capital, publicly dismissed them as &quot;a bleating, blowing asthmatic dog.&quot; On 9 December, with the assistance of investors, Evans&#x27;s vehicle Ginger Media Group bought Virgin Radio from Branson for £85m, to control the interests both of Ginger Productions and Virgin Radio. Both Apax Partners and Branson each owned 20% of Ginger Media Group, while Evans and his investors owned the remaining 60%. The group later engaged in the prospect of buying the &quot;Daily Star&quot; newspaper, but decided against from commercial angles.

Virgin Radio&#x27;s new programme controller Paul Jackson, in light of audience figures which had dropped from a peak of 2.7 million to 1.7 million, had pruned Evans&#x27;s &quot;zoo&quot; team and installed a music policy which replaced more eclectic choices with a strict diet of chart pop. As a result, on 20 June Evans was followed throughout the day by tabloid newspaper photographers, and undertook an &quot;18-hour bender&quot; which started after his show at 9.30 in the morning, and ended – after numerous pints of Kronenbourg and Guinness, plus five bottles of Dom Pérignon – with Evans asleep in front of a lap-dancer at Stringfellows. Later photographed by the tabloids that week with new wife Billie Piper in the nearest pub to their home in Hascombe, Surrey, while claiming he was too ill to present his show, he was dismissed on 28 June 2001 for repeatedly failing to arrive at work. Evans was replaced by the older Steve Penk, whom Evans criticised for his age – 39 versus Evans&#x27;s then 35. Evans attempted to sue Virgin Radio, claiming that he was unfairly dismissed and denied share options worth £8.6 million. On 26 June 2003, in the judgement of &quot;Evans v SMG Television Ltd. &amp; Ors&quot; 2003 EWHC 1423 (Ch), Justice Lightman found that he had been fairly dismissed and was not entitled to the share options. Giving his ruling at the High Court, Evans was publicly criticised for his attitude by the judge, who said of Evans: &quot;He has the temperament of a prima donna.&quot; Virgin Radio/SMG later countersued, with Evans ordered to pay £1m towards their legal costs.

===UMTV===
In August 2002 Chris Evans set up a radio and television production company, UMTV, with the aim of specialising in live, cutting-edge, entertainment programming. Over the next 3 years UMTV produced more than 375 hours of television, with mixed success. TV shows included &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; hosted by Vernon Kay for Channel 4, &quot;Johnny Vegas: 18 Stone of Idiot&quot; for Channel 4 / E4; &quot;OFI Sunday&quot; for ITV; &quot;Live with Christian O&#x27;Connell&quot; and &quot;Live with Chris Moyles&quot; for Five; and the BAFTA award-winning &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; for 4 Learning.

Following two high-profile shows which failed to perform in the ratings, UMTV hired Terry Wogan and Evans&#x27;s former &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; co-host Gaby Roslin to host a weekday morning magazine show, &quot;The Terry and Gaby Show.&quot; Evans said publicly that if this show failed he would set up a market stall. Despite critical acclaim the audience numbers never took off and Channel 5 axed the show after its year-long run, citing its high cost as a reason. True to his word, Evans was pictured at the end of the final show with a market stall and later he opened it for real at Stables Market, Camden.

===Radio 2===

Evans re-entered public life in early 2005, presenting the breakfast slot of UK Radio Aid&#x27;s day of programming for the victims of the Asian tsunami, which was aired on most of the UK&#x27;s commercial radio stations, and also The BRIT Awards in 2005 and 2006. From April 2005, Evans presented a number of one-off Bank holiday shows for BBC Radio 2, including coverage of the Live 8 concert in London.

====Saturday afternoon show====
Evans then joined Radio 2 on a permanent basis in September 2005, presenting a weekly Saturday afternoon show from 14:00 to 17:00. His first show featured singer Robbie Williams, and accompanied by a posse including friend &quot;Big&quot; Pete Winterbottom and newsreader Andrew Peach. Evans told listeners to his first show: &quot;We&#x27;ve had a couple of test drives over the summer and we&#x27;ve decided to take it. Yes, we like this vehicle.&quot;

====Move to &quot;Drivetime&quot;====
The show was well received by listeners and critics, and Evans was announced as the successor to Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Drive time&quot; show on 2 March 2006, succeeding long-time host Johnnie Walker, beginning on 18 April. RAJAR audience figures published in August 2006 showed Evans had 150,000 fewer listeners than his predecessor&#x27;s last show but was on par with previous years. The second set of RAJAR&#x27;s published in October 2006 showed his audience was up by 109,000-year-on-year, and up by 33,000 compared with the previous quarter. Figures showed he was drawing an average audience of 4.9 million a day on his drivetime show. By the end of 2007, the show was averaging over five million listeners. On 7 September 2009 it was announced that Evans would take over breakfast show from Sir Terry Wogan after Wogan announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the year. Evans hosted his final drivetime show on Christmas Eve 2009.

====&quot;The Chris Evans Breakfast Show&quot;====

===== BBC Radio 2 (2010–2018)=====
Evans took over the Radio 2 breakfast show on 11 January 2010, succeeding Sir Terry Wogan. The show was originally 30 minutes longer than the Wogan incarnation and began at 07:00, but following the departure of Sarah Kennedy from early breakfast, the show was extended by another 30 minutes and began at 06:30. The show always ended with a handover to Ken Bruce at 09:30. While Evans replaced Wogan owing to his long-planned retirement, supporters of Kennedy alleged there was a deliberate intention to force her out so that Evans&#x27;s show could be lengthened. His first three songs were The Beatles&#x27; &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; and &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;; and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. His co-presenters included ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders (who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander), and travel reporter Lynn Bowles. Features included The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back-to-back).

===== Virgin Radio (2018–present)=====
On 3 September 2018, Evans announced live on air that he would be leaving the show and the station in December for Virgin Radio. On 11 September the BBC Director General Lord Hall of Birkenhead told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that, as well as wanting a new challenge, releasing the salaries of those at the BBC earning more than £150,000 had been a contributing factor in Evans&#x27;s leaving. A month later, Evans confirmed live on air that Zoe Ball would replace him on the show from January 2019. The show officially ended on 24 December 2018. Evans moved to Virgin with most of his Radio 2 team including sports reporter Vassos Alexander and Rachel Horne who provides regular news bulletins expanded her role as the show&#x27;s travel expert. Ellie Davis leads the show as Executive Producer and producer Meera Depala is also part of the team. Supporting Davis are David Brain (Producer) and Jayne Cheeseman (Assistant Producer) who produced the previous breakfast show on Virgin Radio.

===Sony Music Radio Personality of the Year===
In May 2006, Evans was named Music Radio Personality of the Year at the annual Sony Radio Academy Awards, defeating rivals Jamie Theakston, Lauren Laverne, Marc Riley and Tim Lovejoy to win. When accepting the award, Evans thanked the BBC for giving him &quot;a second chance.&quot; Evans won &#x27;music radio personality&#x27; the following year, while his show won the Entertainment award. &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect this,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if I didn&#x27;t win, but I really love the fact I have won.&quot; Evans was voted the 82nd most influential media personality in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s 2007 poll.

===Return to television===
Following his success in the 1990s, Evans&#x27;s attempts at a TV comeback in the 21st century have been mixed with a record of poor ratings and cancellations, including falling viewing figures for his recent role as co-host of Friday editions of &quot;The One Show&quot;. In November and December 2005 Evans presented &quot;OFI Sunday&quot; on ITV. In a move described by &quot;Private Eye&quot; as &quot;Partridgean&quot;, ex-wife Billie Piper was the first guest on the programme. &quot;OFI Sunday&quot; was cancelled after just five shows following poor reviews and low viewing figures. Its cancellation led Evans to complain on air during his Saturday BBC Radio 2 slot that he no longer knew how to be successful on television. In 2009 Evans narrated the CBeebies Christmas pantomime.

===&quot;The One Show&quot; (2010–15)===

In 2010, it was announced that Evans would be replacing Adrian Chiles as the Friday co-presenter of &quot;The One Show&quot; on BBC One. Chiles and then co-host Christine Bleakley left the show to join ITV. Evans presented the show on Fridays with Alex Jones, and occasionally covered other weekdays. Matt Baker presented the show on a regular Monday to Thursday basis.

In 2015, Evans announced he was quitting &quot;The One Show&quot; to focus on &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

===Return to Channel 4===
In January 2011 Evans returned to Channel 4 to present a new reality show &quot;Famous and Fearless&quot;, in which eight celebrities were arranged into two teams, &#x27;Boys&#x27; and &#x27;Girls&#x27;. The celebrities taking part on the boys&#x27; team were: Rufus Hound, Charley Boorman, Sam Branson (son of Richard Branson) and Jonah Lomu. On the girls&#x27; team were Jenny Frost, Kacey Ainsworth, Sarah Jayne Dunn and Dame Kelly Holmes. Holmes won the girls&#x27;; Boorman won the boys&#x27; and the show outright. In February 2011, it was reported that the show had been axed after one series due to poor ratings.

===&quot;Top Gear&quot;===

On 16 June 2015, the BBC announced that Evans had signed a three-year deal to be the main presenter on the BBC Two motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May.

On his radio show the next morning he confirmed his acceptance and explained the offer came after James May and Richard Hammond had confirmed to the BBC they would not be returning to the show. Evans stated that before the announcement, he sent texts to May, Hammond and Clarkson and received supportive replies from all three.

In February 2016, it was confirmed that Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan would also be joining Evans for the twenty third series of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. It was also revealed that the new series would begin airing in May 2016.

==Controversies==
===Sale of GMG – dismissal and legal cases===
On 14 March 2000, Evans agreed to the sale of Ginger Media Group to Scottish Media Group for £225 million. The sale made Evans the highest-paid entertainer in the UK in 2000, estimated by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List to have been paid around £35.5 million. Following poor reviews of &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, and Evans himself handing over presentation of the last series of the show to a series of &quot;friends&quot;, the show was cancelled in December 2000.

Evans continued to host the station&#x27;s breakfast show, but echoes of his earlier dismissal from Radio 1 began to emerge. In May 2000, the station was fined £75,000 (then the largest penalty imposed by the Radio Authority) for his repeated on-air endorsement of Ken Livingstone in the London mayoral elections.

===Allegations and termination from &quot;Top Gear&quot;===
The first episode of the new six-episode series of &quot;Top Gear&quot; was broadcast 29 May 2016. In June 2016 it was reported that fellow presenter Matt LeBlanc had threatened to quit the show unless Evans was fired, because of inappropriate behaviour on set. The source alleged that Evans had become jealous of the attention the other presenters were getting and had become distanced from the group.

On 4 July 2016 Evans announced that he had stepped down as presenter of the show and cut his contract with &quot;Top Gear&quot; short by two years. 
Throughout the duration of the new series, Evans had received strong criticism due to his presenting style.

In the tax year to April 2017, he was the BBC&#x27;s highest paid presenter, earning between £2.2 million and £2.25 million.

==Personal life==
Evans has a daughter, Jade (born 1986), by former fiancée Alison Ward. In 1998, after a long-running dispute, the couple reached an out-of-court arrangement whereby Evans provided a home for his daughter and an allowance to Ward. On 9 January 2015, Evans became a grandfather when Jade gave birth to her son.

Evans married Carol McGiffin in 1991. Their 1993 break up was not amicable and the two divorced in 1998. McGiffin was scathing about Evans in newspaper articles as late as 2003.

During his time at BBC Radio 1 and Virgin, Evans had well publicised relationships with Kim Wilde, model Rachel Tatton-Brown (whose sister was a researcher on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;), assistant producer Suzi Aplin, Anthea Turner, Geri Halliwell and Melanie Sykes.

In May 2000, Evans met teenage pop star Billie Piper, whom he dated for a while. As a present to him, she proposed on his 35th birthday, and the couple married in a £200 ceremony at the Little Church of the West in Las Vegas on 6 May 2001, in a ceremony attended by six guests including best man Danny Baker. Piper was 18 at the time. In September 2004, news stories circulated regarding a trial separation; Evans at the time had a stall at Camden Market where he sold furniture and paintings from his London and Los Angeles homes, commenting: &quot;I just want to get rid of it all, it&#x27;s just a headache.&quot; In 2005, it was confirmed that Evans and Piper would divorce, with Piper publicly stating that she would take no money from Evans. Almost three years after they had separated, Evans and Piper divorced in May 2007.

A keen golfer who plays with a handicap of 15, Evans met professional golfer, part-time model and columnist for &quot;Golf Punk&quot; magazine Natasha Shishmanian when they became golf partners in the All*Star Cup celebrity tournament in Newport; Evans gave his 17-year-old caddy at the 2005 event, Natalie Harrison, a £10,000 Russian Kristall Smolensk diamond he won for the quality of his play. Evans and Shishmanian married in August 2007, and held a reception in Faro, Portugal, the following weekend that was attended by Evans&#x27;s former wife Piper. The couple have four children and live in Ascot, Berkshire. Their two eldest sons have appeared a number of times on their father&#x27;s Breakfast Radio show.

In March 2008, Evans said in his Radio 2 blog that he had taken &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; two days before attending a Meat Loaf concert at the Royal Albert Hall. He said: &quot;I thought I was chronicling the Albert Hall moving sideways on the back of a giant rock and roll crab, something I didn&#x27;t think the world should miss.&quot; A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said the force would investigate any reports of class A drug-taking.

A fan of fast cars, and particularly Ferraris, Evans was banned from driving for 56 days in 2001 and fined £600 after admitting to a speeding charge at Staines Magistrates&#x27; Court after being stopped by Surrey Police when driving at on the A3 road in Esher in January 2001. In 2005 Evans crashed his silver Ferrari 575M Maranello into a verge near his then Surrey home. On 18 May 2008, Evans attended RM Auctions/Sotheby&#x27;s Ferrari auction in Maranello, Italy, and bought a 1961 250 GT Spyder California SWB formerly owned by US actor James Coburn for the then world record price of 6.4 million euros. In May 2010 he bought a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO, one of only thirty-six built, for £12 million. Reportedly he sold three Ferraris from his collection to pay for it. He sold it three years later for $25 million to a Swiss collector.

In August 2002, Evans was one of seven onboard the sailing yacht &quot;Nausicaa&quot;, in the Solent, when one of the crew members, James Ward — landlord of Evans&#x27;s local pub, the White Horse in Hascombe, Surrey — was struck by a sailing boom, knocked overboard and drowned. Evans was said to be &quot;deeply shocked and saddened&quot; by the incident. 

In September 2007, Evans and Shishmanian started taking helicopter lessons at Shoreham Airport.

Evans is a first cousin of the father of former Scottish Rugby internationals Max Evans and Thom Evans.

Evans is also an ambassador for The Scout Association.

On 15 November 2016, Evans was awarded an honorary degree from York St John University; he was presented this by university&#x27;s chancellor Archbishop Dr John Sentamu at York Minster. On 3 May 2018, Evans&#x27;s mother Minnie died at the age of 92.

On 21 August 2023, Evans revealed he was being treated for melanoma; on 20 September, he revealed he was now cancer-free.

In August 2023 Evans flipped over an auto rickshaw at his own festival in Hampshire and two passengers sustained minor injuries.

<text>ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming, originally &quot;Allgemeiner Berichts-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor&quot;, German for &quot;general report preparation processor&quot;) is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE. It is currently positioned, alongside Java, as the language for programming the SAP NetWeaver Application Server, which is part of the SAP NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

==Introduction==
ABAP is one of the many application-specific fourth-generation languages (4GLs) first developed in the 1980s. It was originally the report language for SAP R/2, a platform that enabled large corporations to build mainframe business applications for materials management and financial and management accounting.

ABAP used to be an abbreviation of Allgemeiner Berichts-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor&quot;, German for &quot;generic report preparation processor&quot;, but was later renamed to the English Advanced Business Application Programming&quot;. ABAP was one of the first languages to include the concept of &quot;Logical Databases&quot; (LDBs), which provides a high level of abstraction from the basic database level(s), which supports every platform, language and units.

The ABAP language was originally used by developers to develop the SAP R/3 platform. It was also intended to be used by SAP customers to enhance SAP applications – customers can develop custom reports and interfaces with ABAP programming. The language was geared towards more technical customers with programming experience.

ABAP remains as the language for creating programs for the client–server R/3 system, which SAP first released in 1992. As computer hardware evolved through the 1990s, more and more of SAP&#x27;s applications and systems were written in ABAP. By 2001, all but the most basic functions were written in ABAP. In 1999, SAP released an object-oriented extension to ABAP called ABAP Objects, along with R/3 release 4.6.

SAP&#x27;s current development platform NetWeaver supports both ABAP and Java.

ABAP has an abstraction between the business applications, the operating system and database. This ensures that applications do not depend directly upon a specific server or database platform and can easily be ported from one platform to another.

SAP Netweaver currently runs on UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux), Microsoft Windows, i5/OS on IBM System i (formerly iSeries, AS/400), and z/OS on IBM System z (formerly zSeries, S/390). Supported databases are HANA, SAP ASE (formerly Sybase), IBM Db2, Informix, MaxDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server (support for Informix was discontinued in SAP Basis release 7.00).
==ABAP Runtime Environment==
All ABAP programs reside inside the SAP database. They are not stored in separate external files like Java or C++ programs. In the database all ABAP code exists in two forms: source code, which can be viewed and edited with the ABAP Workbench tools; and generated code, a binary representation somewhat comparable with Java bytecode. ABAP programs execute under the control of the runtime system, which is part of the SAP kernel. The runtime system is responsible for processing ABAP statements, controlling the flow logic of screens and responding to events (such as a user clicking on a screen button); in this respect it can be seen as a Virtual Machine comparable with the Java VM. A key component of the ABAP runtime system is the Database Interface, which turns database-independent ABAP statements (&quot;Open SQL&quot;) into statements understood by the underlying DBMS (&quot;Native SQL&quot;). The database interface handles all the communication with the relational database on behalf of ABAP programs; It also contains extra features such as buffering of tables and frequently accessed data in the local memory of the application server.

===SAP Systems and Landscapes===
All SAP data exists and all SAP software runs in the context of a &quot;SAP system&quot;. A system consists of a central relational database and one or more application servers (&quot;instances&quot;) accessing the data and programs in this database. A SAP system contains at least one instance but may contain more, mostly for reasons of sizing and performance. In a system with multiple instances, load balancing mechanisms ensure that the load is spread evenly over the available application servers.

Installations of the Web Application Server (&quot;landscapes&quot;) typically consist of three systems: one for development; one for testing and quality assurance; and one for production. The landscape may contain more systems (e.g., separate systems for unit testing and pre-production testing) or it may contain fewer (e.g., only development and production, without separate QA); nevertheless three is the most common configuration. ABAP programs are created and undergo first testing in the development system. Afterwards they are distributed to the other systems in the landscape. These actions take place under control of the Change and Transport System (CTS), which is responsible for concurrency control (e.g., preventing two developers from changing the same code at the same time), version management, and deployment of programs on the QA and production systems.

The Web Application Server consists of three layers: the database layer; the application layer; and the presentation layer. These layers may run on the same or on different physical machines. The &quot;database layer&quot; contains the relational database and the database software. The &#x27;application layer&#x27; knowledge contains the instance or instances of the system. All application processes, including the business transactions and the ABAP development, run on the application layer. The &quot;presentation layer&quot; handles the interaction with users of the system. Online access to ABAP application servers can go via a proprietary graphical interface, which is called &quot;SAP GUI&quot;, or via a Web browser.

===Software Layers===
ABAP software is deployed in software components.
Examples for these are:
* SAP_BASIS is the technical base layer which is required in every ABAP system.
* SAP_ABA contains functionalities which is required for all kinds of business applications, like business partner and address management.
* SAP_UI provides the functionality to create SAP UI5 applications.
* BBPCRM is an example for a business application, in this case the CRM application

==Transactions==
A transaction in SAP terminology is the execution of a program. The normal way of executing ABAP code in the SAP system is by entering a transaction code (for instance, VA01 is the transaction code for &quot;Create Sales Order&quot;). The common transaction codes (T-codes) used by ABAP developer are SE38, SE09, SE10, SE24, SE11, SE16N, SE80, SE37, ST22 etc. Transactions can be called via system-defined or user-specific, role-based menus. They can also be started by entering the transaction code directly into a command field, which is present in every SAP screen. Transactions can also be invoked programmatically by means of the ABAP statements CALL TRANSACTION and LEAVE TO TRANSACTION.
The general notion of a transaction is called a Logical Unit of Work (LUW) in SAP terminology.

==Types of ABAP programs==
As in other programming languages, an ABAP program is either an executable unit or a library, which provides reusable code to other programs and is not independently executable.

ABAP distinguishes two types of executable programs:

* Reports
* Module pools

Reports follow a relatively simple programming model whereby a user optionally enters a set of parameters (e.g., a selection over a subSET of data) and the program then uses the input parameters to produce a report in the form of an interactive list. The term &quot;report&quot; can be somewhat misleading in that reports can also be designed to &quot;modify&quot; data; the reason why these programs are called reports is the &quot;list-oriented&quot; nature of the output they produce.

Module pools define more complex patterns of user interaction using a collection of screens. The term “screen” refers to the actual, physical image that the user sees. Each screen also has a &quot;flow logic&quot;, which refers to the ABAP code implicitly invoked by the screens, which is divided into a &quot;PBO&quot; (Process Before Output) and &quot;PAI&quot; (Process After Input) section. In SAP documentation the term “dynpro” (dynamic program) refers to the combination of the screen and its flow logic.

The non-executable program types are:

* INCLUDE modules – These get included at generation time into the calling unit; it is often used to subdivide large programs.
* Subroutine pools – These contain ABAP subroutines (blocks of code enclosed by FORM/ENDFORM statements and invoked with PERFORM).
* Function groups – These are libraries of self-contained function modules (enclosed by FUNCTION/ENDFUNCTION and invoked with CALL FUNCTION).
* Object classes – These are similar to Java classes and interfaces; the first define a set of methods and attributes, the second contain &quot;empty&quot; method definitions, for which any class implementing the interface must provide explicit code.
* Interfaces – Same as object classes
* Type pools – These define collections of data types and constants.

ABAP programs are composed of individual sentences (statements). The first word in a statement is called an ABAP keyword. Each statement ends with a period. Words must always be separated by at least one space. Statements can be indented as you wish. With keywords, additions and operands, the ABAP runtime system does not differentiate between upper and lowercase.

Statements can extend beyond one line. You can have several statements in a single line (though this is not recommended). Lines that begin with asterisk * in the first column are recognized as comment lines by the ABAP runtime system and are ignored. Double quotations marks (&quot;) indicate that the remainder of a line is a comment.

==Development environment==
There are two possible ways to develop in ABAP. The availability depends on the release of the ABAP system.

===ABAP Workbench===
The ABAP Workbench is part of the ABAP system and is accessed via SAP GUI. It contains different tools for editing programs. The most important of these are (transaction codes are shown in parentheses):

* &quot;ABAP Editor&quot; for writing and editing reports, module pools, includes and subroutine pools (SE38)
* &quot;ABAP Dictionary&quot; for processing database table definitions and retrieving global types (SE11)
* &quot;Menu Painter&quot; for designing the user interface (menu bar, standard toolbar, application toolbar, function key assignment) (SE41)
* &quot;Screen Painter&quot;, a screen generator for designing screens and flow logic (SE51)
* &quot;Function Builder&quot; for function modules (SE37)
* &quot;Class Builder&quot; for ABAP Objects classes and interfaces (SE24)

The &quot;Object Navigator&quot; (transaction SE80) provides a single integrated interface into these various tools.

===ABAP Development Tools===
The ABAP Development Tools (ADT), formally known as &quot;ABAP in Eclipse&quot;, is a set of plugins for the Eclipse IDE to develop ABAP objects.

In this scenario, the ABAP developer installs the required tools on his computer and works locally, whereas a continuous synchronization with the backend is performed.

==ABAP Dictionary==
The ABAP Dictionary contains all metadata about the data in the SAP system. It is closely linked with the ABAP Workbench in that any reference to data (e.g., a table, a view, or a data type) will be obtained from the dictionary. Developers use the ABAP Dictionary transactions (directly or through the SE80 Object Navigator inside the ABAP Workbench) to display and maintain this metadata.

When a dictionary object is changed, a program that references the changed object will automatically reference the new version the next time the program runs. Because ABAP is interpreted, it is not necessary to recompile programs that reference changed dictionary objects.

A brief description of the most important types of dictionary objects follows:
* &quot;Tables&quot; are data containers that exist in the underlying relational database. In the majority of cases there is a 1-to-1 relationship between the definition of a table in the ABAP Dictionary and the definition of that same table in the database (same name, same columns). These tables are known as &quot;transparent&quot;. There are two types of non-transparent tables: &quot;pooled&quot; tables exist as independent entities in the ABAP Dictionary but they are grouped together in large physical tables (&quot;pools&quot;) at the database level. Pooled tables are often small tables holding for example configuration data. &quot;Clustered&quot; tables are physically grouped in &quot;clusters&quot; based on their primary keys; for instance, assume that a clustered table &quot;H&quot; contains &quot;header&quot; data about sales invoices, whereas another clustered table &quot;D&quot; holds the invoice line items. Each row of H would then be physically grouped with the related rows from D inside a &quot;cluster table&quot; in the database. This type of clustering, which is designed to improve performance, also exists as native functionality in some, though not all, relational database systems.
* &quot;Indexes&quot; provide accelerated access to table data for often used selection conditions. Every SAP table has a &quot;primary index&quot;, which is created implicitly along with the table and is used to enforce primary key uniqueness. Additional indexes (unique or non-unique) may be defined; these are called &quot;secondary indexes&quot;.
* &quot;Views&quot; have the same purpose as in the underlying database: they define subsets of columns (and/or rows) from one or – using a join condition – several tables. Since views are virtual tables (they refer to data in other tables) they do not take a substantial amount of space.
* &quot;Structures&quot; are complex data types consisting of multiple fields (comparable to &quot;struct&quot; in C/C++).
* &quot;Data elements&quot; provide the semantic content for a table or structure field. For example, dozens of tables and structures might contain a field giving the price (of a finished product, raw material, resource, ...). All these fields could have the same data element &quot;PRICE&quot;.
* &quot;Domains&quot; define the structural characteristics of a data element. For example, the data element PRICE could have an assigned domain that defines the price as a numeric field with two decimals. Domains can also carry semantic content in providing a list of possible values. For example, a domain &quot;BOOLEAN&quot; could define a field of type &quot;character&quot; with length 1 and case-insensitive, but would also restrict the possible values to &quot;T&quot; (true) or &quot;F&quot; (false).
* &quot;Search helps&quot; (successors to the now obsolete &quot;matchcodes&quot;) provide advanced search strategies when a user wants to see the possible values for a data field. The ABAP runtime provides implicit assistance (by listing all values for the field, e.g. all existing customer numbers) but search helps can be used to refine this functionality, e.g. by providing customer searches by geographical location, credit rating, etc.
* &quot;Lock objects&quot; implement application-level locking when changing data.

==ABAP syntax==
This brief description of the ABAP syntax begins with the ubiquitous &quot;Hello&quot;.

===Hello world===

REPORT TEST.
WRITE &#x27;Hello, World!&#x27;.

This example contains two statements: codice_1 and codice_2. The program displays a list on the screen. In this case, the list consists of the single line &quot;Hello, World!&quot;. The codice_1 statement indicates that this program is a report. This program could be a module pool after replacing the codice_1 statement with codice_5.

===Chained statements===
Consecutive statements with an identical first (leftmost) part can be combined into a &quot;chained&quot; statement using the chain operator codice_6. The common part of the statements is written to the left of the colon, the differing parts are written to the right of the colon and separated by commas. The colon operator is attached directly to the preceding token, without a space (the same applies to the commas in the token list on, as can be seen in the examples below).

Chaining is often used in codice_2 statements. codice_2 accepts just one argument, so if for instance you wanted to display three fields from a structure called FLIGHTINFO, you would have to code:

WRITE FLIGHTINFO-CITYFROM.
WRITE FLIGHTINFO-CITYTO.
WRITE FLIGHTINFO-AIRPTO.

Chaining the statements results in a more readable and more intuitive form:

WRITE: FLIGHTINFO-CITYFROM, FLIGHTINFO-CITYTO, FLIGHTINFO-AIRPTO.

In a chain statement, the first part (before the colon) is not limited to the statement name alone. The entire common part of the consecutive statements can be placed before the colon. Example:

REPLACE &#x27;A&#x27; WITH &#x27;B&#x27; INTO LASTNAME.
REPLACE &#x27;A&#x27; WITH &#x27;B&#x27; INTO FIRSTNAME.
REPLACE &#x27;A&#x27; WITH &#x27;B&#x27; INTO CITYNAME.

could be rewritten in chained form as:

REPLACE &#x27;A&#x27; WITH &#x27;B&#x27; INTO: LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, CITYNAME.
===Comments===
ABAP has 2 ways of defining text as a comment:
* An asterisk (*) in the leftmost column of a line makes the entire line a comment
* A double quotation mark (&quot;) anywhere on a line makes the rest of that line a comment

Example:
** Program: BOOKINGS **
** Author: Joe Byte, 07-Jul-2007 **

REPORT BOOKINGS.

* Read flight bookings from the database
SELECT * FROM FLIGHTINFO
 WHERE CLASS = &#x27;Y&#x27; &quot;Y = economy
 OR CLASS = &#x27;C&#x27;. &quot;C = business


===Spaces===
Code in ABAP is whitespace-sensitive.

x = a+b(c).

assigns to variable x the substring of the variable a, starting from b with the length defined by the variable c.

x = a + b( c ).

assigns to variable x the sum of the variable a and the result of the call to method b with the parameter c.

===ABAP statements===
In contrast with languages like C/C++ or Java, which define a limited set of language-specific statements and provide most functionality via libraries, ABAP contains an extensive amount of built-in statements. These statements traditionally used sentence-like structures and avoided symbols, making ABAP programs relatively verbose. However, in more recent versions of the ABAP language, a terser style is possible.

An example of statement based syntax (whose syntax originates in COBOL) versus expression-based syntax (as in C/Java):

ADD TAX TO PRICE.
* is equivalent to
PRICE = PRICE + TAX .
==Data types and variables==
ABAP provides a set of built-in data types. In addition, every structure, table, view or data element defined in the ABAP Dictionary can be used to type a variable. Also, object classes and interfaces can be used as types.
The built-in data types are:

Date variables or constants (type D) contain the number of days since January 1, 1 AD. Time variables or constants (type T) contain the number of seconds since midnight. A special characteristic of both types is that they can be accessed both as integers and as character strings (with internal format &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot; for dates and &quot;hhmmss&quot; for times), which can be used for date and time handling. For example, the code snippet below calculates the last day of the previous month (note: SY-DATUM is a system-defined variable containing the current date):

DATA LAST_EOM TYPE D. &quot;last end-of-month date

* Start from today&#x27;s date
 LAST_EOM = SY-DATUM.
* Set characters 6 and 7 (0-relative) of the YYYYMMDD string to &quot;01&quot;,
* giving the first day of the current month
 LAST_EOM+6(2) = &#x27;01&#x27;.
* Subtract one day
 LAST_EOM = LAST_EOM - 1.

 WRITE: &#x27;Last day of previous month was&#x27;, LAST_EOM.

All ABAP variables have to be explicitly declared in order to be used. They can be declared either with individual statements and explicit typing or, since ABAP 7.40, inline with inferred typing.

=== Explicitly typed declaration ===
Normally all declarations are placed at the top of the code module (program, subroutine, function) before the first executable statement; this placement is a convention and not an enforced syntax rule. The declaration consists of the name, type, length (where applicable), additional modifiers (e.g. the number of implied decimals for a packed decimal field) and optionally an initial value:

* Primitive types:
DATA: COUNTER TYPE I,
 VALIDITY TYPE I VALUE 60,
 TAXRATE(3) TYPE P DECIMALS 1,
 LASTNAME(20) TYPE C,
 DESCRIPTION TYPE STRING.

* Dictionary types:
DATA: ORIGIN TYPE COUNTRY.

* Internal table:
DATA: T_FLIGHTS TYPE TABLE OF FLIGHTINFO,
 T_LOOKUP TYPE HASHED TABLE OF FLT_LOOKUP.

* Objects:
DATA: BOOKING TYPE REF TO CL_FLT_BOOKING.

Notice the use of the colon to chain together consecutive DATA statements.

=== Inline declaration ===
Since ABAP 7.40, variables can be declared inline with the following syntax:

DATA(variable_name) = &#x27;VALUE&#x27;.
For this type of declaration it must be possible to infer the type statically, e.g. by method signature or database table structure.

This syntax is also possible in OpenSQL statements:

SELECT * FROM ekko into @DATA(lt_ekko) WHERE ebeln EQ @lv_ebeln.
==ABAP Objects==
The ABAP language supports object-oriented programming, through a feature known as &quot;ABAP Objects&quot;. This helps to simplify applications and make them more controllable.

ABAP Objects is fully compatible with the existing language, so one can use existing statements and modularization units in programs that use ABAP Objects, and can also use ABAP Objects in existing ABAP programs. Syntax checking is stronger in ABAP Objects programs, and some syntactical forms (usually older ones) of certain statements are not permitted.

Objects form a capsule which combines the character to the respective behavior. Objects should enable programmers to map a real problem and its proposed software solution on a one-to-one basis. Typical objects in a business environment are, for example, ‘Customer’, ‘Order’, or ‘Invoice’. From Release 3.1 onwards, the Business Object Repository (BOR) of SAP Web Application Server ABAP has contained examples of such objects. The BOR object model will be integrated into ABAP Objects in the next Release by migrating the BOR object types to the ABAP class library.
A comprehensive introduction to object orientation as a whole would go far beyond the limits of this introduction to ABAP Objects. This documentation introduces a selection of terms that are used universally in object orientation and also occur in ABAP Objects. In subsequent sections, it goes on to discuss in more detail how these terms are used in ABAP Objects. The end of this section contains a list of further reading, with a selection of titles about object orientation.

* &quot;Objects&quot; are instances of classes. They contain data and provide services. The data forms the attributes of the object. The services are known as methods (also known as operations or functions). Typically, methods operate on private data (the attributes, or state of the object), which is only visible to the methods of the object. Thus the attributes of an object cannot be changed directly by the user, but only by the methods of the object. This guarantees the internal consistency of the object.
* &quot;Classes&quot; describe objects. From a technical point of view, objects are runtime instances of a class. In theory, any number of objects based on a single class may be created. Each instance (object) of a class has a unique identity and its own set of values for its attributes.
* &quot;Object References&quot; are unique addresses that may be used to identify and point to objects in a program. Object references allow access to the attributes and methods of an object.

In object-oriented programming, objects usually have the following properties:

* Encapsulation – Objects restrict the visibility of their resources (attributes and methods) to other users. Every object has an interface, which determines how other objects can interact with it. The implementation of the object is encapsulated, that is, invisible outside the object itself.
* Inheritance – An existing class may be used to derive a new class. Derived classes inherit the data and methods of the superclass. However, they can overwrite existing methods, and also add new ones.
* Polymorphism – Identical (identically named) methods behave differently in different classes. In ABAP Objects, polymorphism is implemented by redefining methods during inheritance and by using constructs called interfaces.

==CDS Views==
The ABAP Core Data Services (ABAP CDS) are the implementation of the general CDS concept for AS ABAP. ABAP CDS makes it possible to define semantic data models on the central database of the application server. On AS ABAP, these models can be defined independently of the database system. The entities of these models provide enhanced access functions when compared with existing database tables and views defined in ABAP Dictionary, making it possible to optimize Open SQL-based applications. This is particularly clear when an AS ABAP uses a SAP HANA database, since its in-memory characteristics can be implemented in an optimum manner.

The data models are defined using the data definition language (DDL) and data control language (DCL) provided in the ABAP CDS in the ABAP CDS syntax. The objects defined using these languages are integrated into ABAP Dictionary and managed here too.

CDS source code can only be programmed in the Eclipse-based ABAP Development Tools (ADT). The Data Definition Language (DDL) and the Data Control Language (DCL) use different editors.

===Features===





==Internal tables in ABAP==
Internal tables are an important feature of the ABAP language. An internal table is defined similarly to a vector of &quot;struct&quot;s in C++ or a vector of objects in Java. The main difference with these languages is that ABAP provides a collection of statements to easily access and manipulate the contents of internal tables. Note that ABAP does not support arrays; the only way to define a multi-element data object is to use an internal table.

Internal tables are a way to store variable data sets of a fixed structure in the working memory of ABAP, and provides the functionality of dynamic arrays. The data is stored on a row-by-row basis, where each row has the same structure.

Internal tables are preferably used to store and format the content of database tables from within a program. Furthermore, internal tables in connection with structures are an important means of defining complex data structures in an ABAP program.

The following example defines an internal table with two fields with the format of database table VBRK.
* First define structured type
TYPES: BEGIN OF t_vbrk,
 VBELN TYPE VBRK-VBELN,
 ZUONR TYPE VBRK-ZUONR,
 END OF t_vbrk.

* Now define internal table of our defined type t_vbrk
DATA : gt_vbrk TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF t_vbrk,
 gt_vbrk_2 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF t_vbrk. &quot;easy to define more tables

* If needed, define structure (line of internal table)
* Definition with type or with reference to internal table:
DATA : gs_vbrk TYPE t_vbrk,
 gs_vbrk_2 LIKE LINE OF gt_vbrk_2.

* You can also define table type if needed
TYPES tt_vbrk TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF t_vbrk.

<doc id="271834" wikidata="Q9688" url="?curid=271834" title="Berlin Tegel Airport">
<text>Berlin Tegel &quot;Otto Lilienthal&quot; Airport () was the primary international airport of Berlin, the capital of Germany. The airport was named after aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal and was the fourth busiest airport in Germany, with over 24 million passengers in 2019. In 2016, Tegel handled over 60% of all airline passenger traffic in Berlin. The airport served as a base for Eurowings, Ryanair and easyJet. It featured flights to several European metropolitan and leisure destinations as well as some intercontinental routes. It was situated in Tegel, a section of the northern borough of Reinickendorf, northwest of the city centre of Berlin. Tegel Airport was notable for its hexagonal main terminal building around an open square, which made walking distances as short as from the aircraft to the terminal exit.

TXL saw its last flight on 8 November 2020 after all traffic had been transferred gradually to the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport until that date. It was legally decommissioned as an airfield after a mandatory transitional period on 4 May 2021. All government flights were also relocated to the new airport with the exception of helicopter operations which will stay at a separate area on the northern side of Tegel Airport until 2029.

The airport&#x27;s grounds are due to be redeveloped into a new city quarter dedicated to scientific and industrial research named &quot;Urban Tech Republic&quot; which is to retain the airport&#x27;s main building and tower as a repurposed landmark.

==History==
===The beginnings===
The area of today&#x27;s airport originally was part of the Jungfernheide forest, which served as a hunting ground for the Prussian nobility. During the 19th century, it was used as an artillery firing range. Aviation history dates back to the early 20th century, when the Royal Prussian Airship battalion was based there and the area became known as &quot;Luftschiffhafen Reinickendorf&quot;. In 1906, a hangar was built for testing of Groß-Basenach and Parseval type airships.

Soon after the outbreak of World War I, on 20 August 1914, the area was dedicated to military training of aerial reconnaissance crews. Following the war, all aviation industry was removed as a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited Germany from having any armed aircraft. On 27 September 1930, Rudolf Nebel launched an experimental rocket testing and research facility on the site. It became known as &quot;Raketenschießplatz Tegel&quot; and attracted a small group of eminent aerospace engineers, which included German rocket pioneer Wernher von Braun. In 1937, the rocket pioneers left Tegel in favour of the secret Peenemünde army research centre.

During World War II, the area served once again as a military training area, mostly for Flak troops. It was destroyed in Allied air raids.

===Cold War era (1948–1990)===

====Berlin Airlift====
Plans for converting the area into allotment gardens were shelved due to the Berlin Blockade, which began on 24 June 1948. In the ensuing Berlin Airlift, it quickly turned out that Berlin&#x27;s existing main airport at Tempelhof was not big enough to accommodate all relief aircraft. As a consequence, the French military authorities in charge of Tegel at that time ordered the construction of a long runway, the longest in Europe at the time, as well as provisional airport buildings and basic infrastructure. Groundbreaking took place on 5 August 1948, and only 90 days later, on 5 November, a United States Air Force (USAF) Douglas C-54 Skymaster became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) commander-in-chief, General Cannon, and the chief-of-staff of the Anglo-American airlift, General Tunner, arrived at Tegel on this aircraft.

British Dakota and Hastings aircraft carrying essential goods and raw materials began using Tegel on a regular basis from 17 November 1948. Generally, the former carried food and fuel while the latter were loaded with coal. Regular cargo flights with American C-54s followed from 14 December 1948. December 1948 also saw three &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; Junkers Ju 52/3m transport planes participating in the airlift for the first time. However, the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; contributed to the overall airlift effort in a very small and symbolic way only. As a result of committing the French transport fleet to the growing war effort in Indochina, as well as the joint Anglo-American decision to employ only four-engined planes for the remainder of the airlift to increase the number of flights and the amount of cargo carried on each flight by taking advantage of those aircraft&#x27;s higher speeds and greater capacities, the French participation ceased.

====Base aérienne 165 Berlin Tegel====
Following the end of the Berlin Airlift in May 1949, Tegel became the Berlin base of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, eventually leading to the establishment of Base aérienne 165 at Berlin Tegel on 1 August 1964. (The end of the Cold War and German reunification resulted in the deactivation of the Western Allies&#x27; armed forces in Berlin in July 1994. This in turn led to the decommissioning of Base aérienne 165 the same year.).
Tegel was home to a small detachment of the French Army Light Aviation, which used single engined Cessna O-1 Bird Dog from 1968 to 1993, and Sud-Ouest Alouette III Helicopters from May 1987 until June 1994. The Armée de l&#x27;Air had a single Max Holste MH1521 Broussard until 1988, which was replaced by a DeHavilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter for liaison and surveillance flights.

====Commercial operations====
In the late 1950s, the runways at West Berlin&#x27;s city centre Tempelhof Airport had become too short to accommodate the new-generation jet aircraft such as the Aérospatiale Caravelle, Boeing 707, de Havilland Comet, and Douglas DC-8, without imposing payload or range restrictions that made commercial operations unviable.

West Berlin&#x27;s special legal status during the Cold War era (1945–1990) meant that all air traffic through the Allied air corridors linking the exclave with West Germany was restricted to airlines headquartered in the United States, the United Kingdom, or France – three of the four victorious powers of World War II. In addition, all flightdeck crew flying aircraft into and out of West Berlin were required to hold American, British, or French passports. During that period, the majority of Tegel&#x27;s regular commercial flights served West German domestic routes, hub airports in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Amsterdam, points in the United States, and popular holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and Canary Islands.

Initially, all commercial flights used the original terminal building (a pre-fabricated shed), which was situated to the North of the runway, at what is today the military part of the airport.

In 1988, Berlin Tegel was named after German aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal.

====Air France====
Air France was the first airline to commence regular commercial operations at Tegel on 2 January 1960.

On that day, Air France, which had served Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg, and its main base at Paris Le Bourget/Orly during the previous decade from Tempelhof with Douglas DC-4, Sud-Est Languedoc, and Lockheed Constellation/Super Constellation piston equipment, shifted its entire Berlin operation to Tegel because Tempelhof&#x27;s runways were too short to permit the introduction of the Sud-Aviation Caravelle, the French flag carrier&#x27;s new short-haul jet, with a viable payload. (Air France&#x27;s Caravelle IIIs lacked thrust reversers that would have permitted them to land safely on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways with a full commercial payload.)

Following the move to Tegel, Air France initially used Lockheed Super Constellation piston equipment on all Berlin flights. On 24 February 1960, Air France became the first airline to introduce jet aircraft on its Berlin routes when the new Caravelles began replacing the Super Constellations. It also became the first and at the time the only one to offer two classes on short-haul flights serving West Berlin.

Following the mid- to late 1960s&#x27; introduction by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) and British European Airways (BEA) of jet aircraft with short-field capabilities that were not payload-restricted on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways, Air France experienced a traffic decline on those routes where it competed with Pan Am and BEA, mainly as a result of Tegel&#x27;s greater distance and poorer accessibility from West Berlin&#x27;s city centre. Over this period, the French airline&#x27;s market share halved from 9% to less than 5%, despite having withdrawn from Tegel–Düsseldorf in summer 1964 and concentrating its limited resources on Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–Munich to maximise the competitive impact on the latter two routes (Air France had already discontinued Berlin–Nuremberg services prior to its move to Tegel). To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes resulting from load factors as low as 30%, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely. This reduced its presence at Tegel to direct scheduled services from/to Paris Orly only. (Initially, Air France continued serving Tegel twice daily from Orly, with one service routing via Frankfurt and the other operating non-stop. The one-stop service was subsequently dropped. This further reduced the airline&#x27;s presence at Tegel to a single daily, non-stop return flight to/from Paris Orly.) In spring 1969, Air France entered into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed BEA taking over Air France&#x27;s two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. The Air France-BEA joint venture terminated in autumn 1972.

From 1 November 1972, the daily Air France service between Orly and Tegel routed via Cologne in both directions to maintain the airline&#x27;s internal German traffic rights from/to Berlin.

On 1 April 1973, Air France re-introduced a daily non-stop Orly–Tegel rotation to complement the daily service via Cologne. The additional daily service consisted of an evening inbound and early morning outbound flight, which included a night stop for both aircraft and crew in Berlin. To improve capacity utilisation on its Berlin services and cut down on aircraft parking as well as crew accommodation costs, from 1 April 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, with aircraft and crew returning to their base at Paris Orly the same day. From 1 November that year, Air France&#x27;s Berlin flights switched to the French capital&#x27;s then new Charles de Gaulle (CDG) Airport.

The arrival at Berlin Tegel of an Air France Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde on 17 January 1976 marked the Berlin debut of the Anglo-French supersonic airliner. Two-and-a-half months later, at the start of the 1976 summer timetable, Air France introduced a third daily CDG–Tegel frequency. The new night-stopping service routed via Düsseldorf and utilised the Boeing 727-200, a bigger aircraft than the Caravelles used on the company&#x27;s other services from/to Berlin.

Air France subsequently routed all of its CDG–Tegel flights via Düsseldorf and standardised the aircraft equipment on the 727-200/200 Adv. The 727-200/200 Adv continued to operate most of Air France&#x27;s Berlin services until the end of the 1980s, when they were gradually replaced with state-of-the-art Airbus A320s and more modern Boeing 737s. Indeed, the first ever A320 commercial service was a flight between Paris and Berlin Tegel via Düsseldorf, on 8 April 1988.

====Pan American World Airways====
Pan Am followed Air France into Tegel in May 1964, with a year-round, thrice-weekly direct service to New York JFK, which was operated with Boeing 707s or Douglas DC-8s. These aircraft could not operate from Tempelhof – the airline&#x27;s West Berlin base at the time – with a viable payload. Launched with DC-8 equipment routing through Glasgow Prestwick in Scotland, frequency subsequently increased to four flights a week, while the intermediate stop was cut out. Following the introduction in April 1971 of a daily Berlin Tempelhof–Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel–London–Heathrow 727 feeder flight that connected with the airline&#x27;s transatlantic services at the latter airport, Pan Am withdrew its non-stop Tegel–JFK service at the end of the summer timetable, in October of that year.

Following the cessation of direct Tegel–New York City scheduled services, Pan Am continued to operate affinity group/Advance Booking Charter (ABC) flights from Tegel to the US on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis.

From the start of the 1974–75 winter season, Pan Am began operating a series of short- and medium-haul week-end charter flights from Tegel under contract to a leading West German tour operator. These flights served popular resorts in the Alpine region and the Mediterranean. Following a major reduction in the airline&#x27;s scheduled activities at Tempelhof as a result of co-ordinating its flight times with British Airways (rather than operating competitive schedules), this helped increase utilisation of the 727s based at that airport, especially on weekends.

In addition to operating a limited number of commercial flights from Tegel prior to its move from Tempelhof on 1 September 1975, Pan Am used it as a diversion airfield. The move from Tempelhof to Tegel resulted in all of Pan Am&#x27;s Berlin operations being concentrated at the latter.

1976 was the first year since 1972 the steady decline in scheduled domestic air traffic from and to West Berlin was arrested and reversed. The first expansion in Pan Am&#x27;s Berlin operation since the move to Tegel occurred during that year&#x27;s Easter festival period, when the airline temporarily stationed a Boeing 707-320B at the airport to cope with the seasonal rush on the prime Berlin–Frankfurt route.

From late 1979, Pan Am began updating its Berlin fleet. This entailed phasing out all 727-100s by 1983. The first stage involved replacing two of the 13 German-based aircraft with a pair of stretched Boeing 727-200s originally destined for Ozark Air Lines to add more capacity to Berlin–Frankfurt. This was followed by an order for eight additional 727-200s, with deliveries slated to begin in October 1981. After initially cancelling the order due to the airline&#x27;s deteriorating finances and economic environment, it was subsequently reinstated, with deliveries due to commence in December 1981.

In the interim, a number of Boeing 737-200/200 Adv were leased from 1982.

The largest-ever expansion of Pan Am&#x27;s scheduled internal German services occurred during summer 1984, when the airline&#x27;s aircraft movements at Tegel increased by 20%. This coincided with the relocation of the US carrier&#x27;s German and Central European headquarters from Frankfurt to Berlin on 1 May 1984.

Pan Am began introducing wide-body aircraft on its Berlin routes in the mid-1980s. Up to four Airbus A300s replaced 727-200s on Berlin–Frankfurt. The A300s were subsequently replaced with Airbus A310s. The longer-range A310-300s that joined Pan Am&#x27;s fleet from 1987 enabled reintroduction of non-stop, daily Tegel–JFK scheduled services.

Pan Am Express, the regional commuter arm of Pan Am, began operating from Berlin Tegel in November 1987 with two ATR 42 commuter turboprops. It operated year-round scheduled services to secondary and tertiary destinations that could not be viably served with Pan Am&#x27;s Tegel-based &quot;mainline&quot; fleet of Boeing 727-200s and Airbus A310s. These included Basel, Bremen, Dortmund, Hanover, Innsbruck, Kassel, Kiel, Milan, Salzburg, Stockholm and Vienna. In addition, Pan Am Express also helped Pan Am increase the number of flights on some of the other scheduled routes it used to serve from Berlin such as Tegel–Zürich by operating additional off-peak frequencies.

====British Airways====
British Airways was the last of West Berlin&#x27;s three main scheduled carriers to commence regular operations from Tegel following the move from Tempelhof on 1 September 1975. However, like Pan Am, it and its predecessor BEA had used the airport as a diversion airfield before. Initially, all British Airways services from Tegel—with the exception of the daily non-stop service to London Heathrow—continued to be operated by BAC One-Eleven 500s. The daily London–Heathrow non-stop was operated with Hawker Siddeley Trident 2E/3B equipment based at that airport until the end of the 1975 summer season. (It subsequently reverted to a One-Eleven 500 operation.)

From 1983, British Airways began updating its Berlin fleet. This entailed phasing out the ageing One-Elevens, which were replaced with new Boeing 737-200 Adv. During the second half of the 1980s, British Airways augmented its Berlin 737s with regional airliners. These initially comprised British Aerospace (BAe) 748s (from 1986) and subsequently BAe ATPs (from 1989). The introduction of these turboprops enabled the airline to serve shorter and thinner regional domestic routes from Berlin more economically. It also permitted a frequency increase, thereby enhancing competitiveness.

====Other operators====

From 1966 until 1968, UK independent Lloyd International was contracted by Neckermann und Reisen, the tour operator of West German mail-order concern Neckermann, to launch a series of inclusive tour (IT) flights from Tegel. These flights were operated with Bristol Britannia turboprops. They served principal European holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.

From April 1968, all non-scheduled services, i.e. primarily the rapidly growing number of IT holiday flights that several UK independent airlines as well as a number of US supplemental carriers had mainly operated from Tempelhof since the early 1960s under contract to West Berlin&#x27;s leading package tour operators, were concentrated at Tegel. This traffic redistribution between West Berlin&#x27;s two commercial airports was intended to alleviate Tempelhof&#x27;s increasing congestion and to make better use of Tegel, which was underutilised at the time.

During that period, the Allied charter carriers had begun replacing their obsolete propliners with contemporary turboprop and jet aircraft types, which suffered payload and range restrictions on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways. The absence of such restrictions at Tegel gave airlines greater operational flexibility regarding aircraft types and destinations. This was the reason charter carriers favoured Tegel despite being less popular than Tempelhof because of its greater distance from West Berlin&#x27;s city centre and poor public transport links.

A new passenger handling facility exclusively dedicated to charter airline passengers was opened to accommodate the additional traffic. Both this facility (a wooden shed) and the original terminal used by Air France&#x27;s and Pan Am&#x27;s scheduled passengers were located on the airport&#x27;s north side.

Following the transfer of all charter traffic to Tegel, British Eagle, Dan-Air Services, Invicta International Airlines, Laker Airways and Modern Air Transport began stationing several of their jets at the airport.

While British Eagle&#x27;s and Invicta&#x27;s presence at Tegel lasted only for the 1968 summer season, Dan-Air, Laker Airways, and Modern Air were present at the airport for a number of years.

In March 1971, Channel Airways began stationing aircraft at Tegel as well; however, its presence at the airport lasted only until the end of that year&#x27;s summer season.

Channel Airways&#x27;s collapse in early 1972 provided the impetus for Dan-Air to take over the failed carrier&#x27;s charter contracts and to expand its own operations at Tegel.

Dan-Air, one of Britain&#x27;s foremost wholly private, independent airlines during the 1970s and 80s, eventually became the third-biggest operator at Tegel Airport, ahead of Air France. In addition to firmly establishing itself as the airport&#x27;s and West Berlin&#x27;s leading charter airline, it also operated scheduled services linking Tegel with Amsterdam Schiphol, Saarbrücken and London–Gatwick, its main operating base. By the time that airline was taken over by British Airways at the end of October 1992, it had served Tegel Airport for a quarter of a century.

Modern Air&#x27;s departure in October 1974 coincided with Aeroamerica&#x27;s arrival. That carrier&#x27;s departure following the end of the 1979 summer season was followed by Air Berlin USA&#x27;s arrival.

Laker Airways&#x27;s decision to replace its Tegel-based BAC One-Eleven fleet with one of its newly acquired Airbus A300 B4 widebodies from the 1981 summer season resulted in Monarch Airlines taking over that airline&#x27;s long-standing charter contract with Flug-Union Berlin, one of West Berlin&#x27;s leading contemporary tour operators.

In the late 1980s, Monarch Airlines provided the aircraft as well as the flightdeck crew and maintenance support for Euroberlin France, a Tegel-based scheduled airline headquartered in Paris, France. Euroberlin was jointly owned by Air France and Lufthansa, with the former holding a 51% majority stake, thereby making it a French legal entity and enabling it to conduct commercial airline operations in West Berlin.

The following airlines operated regular services to/from Tegel Airport during the Cold War era as well:

* Court Line Aviation was a major British independent airline of the early 1970s that served Berlin Tegel with a series of regular charter flights from its base at London–Luton and Paris Le Bourget Airport between 1970 and 1974 under contract to the students travel company of Berlin&#x27;s Technical University.
* Touraine Air Transport was a French regional airline serving Berlin Tegel from Saarbrücken several times a day on a year-round basis from late 1978 until early 1984.
* Berlin European UK was a Berlin-based UK regional airline founded in 1986 as Berlin Regional UK by a former British Airways general manager for that airline&#x27;s Berlin operation to begin domestic and international regional scheduled services to destinations not served by any of West Berlin&#x27;s contemporary scheduled operators from April 1987, utilising BAe Jetstream commuter turboprop planes.
* Trans World Airlines (TWA), the other major US flag carrier of that era, used to operate affinity group/ABC flights from Tegel to the USA on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis during the early 1970s. When it entered the West Berlin scheduled market in the late 1980s, it initially served Brussels twice daily from Berlin Tegel (from 2 August 1987). Daily flights to Frankfurt Airport followed (from 1989). Eventually, Berlin Tegel became an important spoke for TWA in Europe, following the launch of additional services to Zürich (via Stuttgart) and Amsterdam (via Hamburg). The Berlin Boeing 727-100s connected with transatlantic 747s and L-1011s at Brussels, Frankfurt, Zürich and Amsterdam.

In addition to the aforementioned airlines, a host of others – mainly British independents and US supplementals – were frequent visitors to Berlin Tegel, especially during the early 1970s. These included Britannia Airways, British Airtours, British United, Caledonian, Caledonian/BUA / British Caledonian, Capitol International Airways, Overseas National Airways, Saturn Airways, Trans International Airlines, Transamerica Airlines and World Airways. During that period, the airport scene at Berlin Tegel could be very colourful, with Air France Caravelles, the UK independents&#x27; BAC One-Elevens, de Havilland Comets, and Hawker Siddeley Tridents as well as the US supplementals&#x27; Boeing 707s, Convair Coronados and Douglas DC-8s congregating on its ramp. During 1974 alone, 22 airlines were operating at Tegel Airport.

====Tegel&#x27;s new terminal takes shape====

Construction of a new, hexagonally shaped terminal complex on the airport&#x27;s south side began during the 1960s. This coincided with the lengthening of the runways to permit fully laden widebodied aircraft to take off and land without restricting their range and construction of a motorway and access road linking the new terminal to the city centre. It became operational on 1 November 1974.

A British Airways L-1011 Tristar 1, a Laker Airways McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-10, a Pan Am Boeing 747-100 and an Air France Airbus A300 B2 were among the widebodied aircraft specially flown in for a pre-inauguration of the new terminal on 23 October 1974. Dan-Air operated the first commercial flight to arrive at the airport&#x27;s new terminal at 06.00 am local time with a BAC One-Eleven that was inbound from Tenerife.

====Tegel becomes West Berlin&#x27;s main airport====
Following Pan Am&#x27;s and British Airways&#x27;s move from Tempelhof to Tegel on 1 September 1975, the latter replaced Tempelhof as the main airport of West Berlin.

===Early post-reunification era (1990–1995)===
Following Germany&#x27;s reunification on 3 October 1990, all access restrictions to the former West Berlin airports were lifted.

Lufthansa resumed flights to Berlin on 28 October 1990, initially operating twelve daily pairs of flights on a limited number of routes, including Tegel–Cologne, Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–London Gatwick. To facilitate the German flag carrier&#x27;s resumption of services from/to Berlin, it purchased Pan Am&#x27;s Internal German Services (IGS) division for US$150 million. This included Pan Am&#x27;s internal German traffic rights as well as its gates and slots at Tegel. This agreement, under which Lufthansa contracted up to seven of Pan Am&#x27;s Tegel-based Boeing 727-200s operated by that airline&#x27;s flightdeck and cabin crews to ply its scheduled routes to Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart until mid-1991, also facilitated Pan Am&#x27;s orderly exit from the internal German air transport market after 40 years&#x27; uninterrupted service as European Union (EU) legislation prevented it from participating in the internal air transport market of the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) as a non-EU/EEA headquartered carrier. However, Pan Am continued operating its non-stop Tegel–JFK service until Delta Air Lines assumed most of Pan Am&#x27;s transatlantic scheduled services in November 1991. Pan Am Express, which was not included in Pan Am&#x27;s IGS sale to Lufthansa, continued operating all of its domestic and international regional scheduled routes from Tegel as an independent legal entity until its acquisition by TWA in 1991. Following TWA&#x27;s takeover of Pan Am Express, the former Pan Am Express Berlin operations were closed. Until December 1994, Lufthansa also contracted Euroberlin to operate some of its internal German flights from its new Tegel base, making use of that airline&#x27;s gates and slots at Tegel as well.

As a US-registered airline, Air Berlin found itself in the same situation as Pan Am following German reunification. It chose to reconstitute itself as a German company.

These were the days when liberalisation of the EU/EEA internal air transport market was still in progress and when domestic traffic rights were reserved for each member country&#x27;s own airlines. The German government therefore insisted that all non-German EU/EEA carriers either withdraw their internal German scheduled services from Berlin or transfer them to majority German-owned subsidiaries by the end of 1992. It also wanted the bulk of all charter flights from Berlin to be operated by German airlines. These measures were squarely aimed at UK carriers with a major presence in the internal German air transport market from Berlin as well as the city&#x27;s charter market, specifically British Airways and Dan-Air. Lufthansa and other German airlines reportedly lobbied their government to curtail British Airways&#x27;s and Dan-Air&#x27;s activities in Berlin, arguing that German airlines enjoyed no equivalent rights in the UK. This resulted in British Airways taking a 49% stake in Friedrichshafen-based German regional airline Delta Air, renaming it Deutsche BA (DBA) and transferring its internal German traffic rights to the new airline. BA also replaced the commuter aircraft DBA had inherited from Delta Air with new Boeing 737-300s. These in turn replaced the Boeing 737-200 Adv and BAe ATP airliners British Airways had used on its internal German scheduled services from Berlin.

At the time of German reunification, Dan-Air&#x27;s Berlin fleet numbered five aircraft, comprising three Boeing 737s (one −400, one −300 and one 200 Adv) and two HS 748s. The former were used to fly locally based holidaymakers from Tegel to overseas resorts on IT flights under contract to German package tour operators. The latter operated the airline&#x27;s scheduled routes linking Tegel with Amsterdam and Saarbrücken. Dan-Air discontinued its charter operations from Berlin on behalf of German tour operators at the end of the 1990–91 winter season and replaced the ageing 748 turboprop it had used on its Amsterdam schedule since the mid-1980s with larger, more advanced BAe 146 100 series jets. It also introduced new direct scheduled air links from Berlin to Manchester and Newcastle via Amsterdam. The Saarbrücken route was withdrawn at the end of the 1991 summer season, while the Amsterdam route was gradually taken over by NLM Cityhopper, the contemporary regional arm of Dutch flag carrier KLM. This reduced Dan-Air&#x27;s presence in Berlin to a single daily scheduled service as well as up to four weekly charter flights linking the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base with its former overseas base at Tegel. Flights were operated by Gatwick aircraft and crews until the firm&#x27;s takeover by British Airways at the end of October 1992. The restructuring of Dan-Air&#x27;s long-established Berlin operation was not only the result of political changes. It was also driven by its own corporate restructuring, which aimed to refocus the airline as a Gatwick-based short-haul &quot;mainline&quot; scheduled operator and involved phasing out its smaller aircraft and thinner routes.

Other airlines that commenced/resumed scheduled operations from Berlin Tegel at the beginning of the post-reunification era included Aero Lloyd, Alitalia, American Airlines, Austrian Airlines, SAS &quot;Eurolink&quot;, Swissair, TWA and United Airlines.

Aero Lloyd, Germania and Condor Berlin began operating charter flights from Berlin Tegel during that period.

===1995 onwards===


The events of the early post-reunification years (1990–1995) were followed by further, high-profile international route launches and growing consolidation among German airlines with a major presence at Tegel.

Amongst the former were the December 2005 launch of Tegel Airport&#x27;s first-ever scheduled service to the Qatari capital Doha by Qatar Airways, operated non-stop at an initial frequency of four flights a week, and Air Berlin&#x27;s November 2010 launch of non-stop, thrice-weekly Tegel–Dubai flights (another first). This was followed by the latter&#x27;s May 2011 launch of a non-stop, four-times-a-week Tegel–JFK service.

The latter began with British Airways mid-2003 sale for a symbolic €1 (72p) of its German subsidiary DBA to Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft, a Nuremberg-based consultancy and investment company headed by German entrepreneur Hans Rudolf Wöhrl who founded German charter airline Eurowings and also was a former DBA board member. Further consolidation among Tegel&#x27;s German airlines took place when Air Berlin entered into an agreement to assume Germania&#x27;s management shortly before the death of that airline&#x27;s founder, took over DBA and gained control of LTU. These events occurred in November 2005, August 2006 and March 2007, respectively.

On 9 October 2017, Air Berlin announced termination of all of its own operations, excluding wet leases, by the end of the month, leading to the loss of the airport&#x27;s largest customer. On 28 October 2017, easyJet announced it would take over some of bankrupt Air Berlin&#x27;s former assets at Tegel Airport to gradually start its own base operations there on 7 January 2018. Previously, it only served Berlin Schönefeld Airport, which is already an easyJet base.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, passenger numbers at Tegel declined significantly. On 29 April 2020, airport management announced plans to close Tegel temporarily from 1 June 2020. However, shortly after this plan was cancelled with the airport remaining operational until early November 2020.

====Closure and legacy of Tegel Airport====
On 1 October 2020, the new airport received final approval for opening on 31 October 2020, meaning a closure of Tegel shortly after. In the days leading up to Tegel&#x27;s closure, many airlines and their aircraft received water salutes before entering the runway for the last time. At this point, the tower and the main terminal were lit up in red with the #DankeTXL hashtag projected on them at night. The final scheduled flight to leave the airport was operated by Air France to Paris–Charles de Gaulle on 8 November 2020. Lufthansa concluded their Tegel operations on 7 November 2020 with the last scheduled flight to Munich, specially operated by an Airbus A350-900 to mark the occasion. Sundair also operated a special commemorative flight from Tegel to the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport using an Airbus A320 that still had the base colours of Air Berlin. Many former Air Berlin employees also came to the airport in their old Air Berlin uniforms.

Due to legal and safety reasons, Tegel had been held operational for air traffic for another six months without handling any scheduled services before being decommissioned as an aviation facility. The separate minor military area on the northern side of Tegel (&quot;Tegel Nord&quot;) will still be used for governmental helicopter flights until 2029.

The airport was decommissioned on 4 May 2021. At the same time, the first facilities, including interim terminal C2 and baggage halls have been already torn down while the main terminal, which will be kept, had been emptied of most facilities.

The airport terminal building was used as a COVID-19 vaccination centre during the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2022, the former airport was converted into temporary shelters for refugees fleeing Ukraine.

In June 2024 some 5,000 refugees and migrants were housed in the Tegel Airport facility. 4,000 from Ukraine, the rest from nations like Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia and Vietnam. This housing at Tegel, run by non-governmental organizations like the German Red Cross, costs the state of Berlin 200 Euros per day per single individual, mounting to 30 million per month.

==Future development==
The airport was scheduled to close in June 2012 after Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened. Due to the delays with BER, the future of Tegel had long remained uncertain.

A campaign was launched to keep Tegel Airport open, which gathered signatures for a referendum for voters to decide on the future of the airport. In September 2017, a public quorum was held parallel to the German federal election to decide whether Tegel Airport should remain open once Berlin Brandenburg Airport starts its operations. The majority of voters voted in favour of Tegel remaining open; however, the federal authorities and the state of Brandenburg, which together hold a majority against Berlin over the airport&#x27;s ownership, overrode the vote shortly afterwards, leading to the shutdown of Tegel.

==Terminals==

Tegel consisted of five terminals. As the airport was small compared to other major airports handling the same number of passengers, these terminals might be regarded as &quot;halls&quot; or &quot;boarding areas&quot;; nevertheless, they are officially referred to as &quot;terminals&quot;, even if most of them shared the same building.

Tegel Airport was originally planned to have a second hexagonal terminal like the main building right next to it. The second terminal ring was never built because of Berlin municipal budgetary constraints and the post-reunification decision to replace the former West Berlin airports with the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

===Terminals A and B===
The main building was the original part of the airport. It consisted of two parts:
* Terminal A was a hexagon-shaped ring concourse with a parking area, taxi stands and bus stops in its middle. It featured 14 jet bridges which correspond to 16 respective check-in counters (A00–A15), with jetways 1 and 14 each serving two check-in counters. There was no transit zone, which means that each gate has its own security clearance checkpoint and exit for arriving passengers. Therefore, direct flight connections without leaving the airside area were not possible. Most major airlines arrived and departed here, especially &quot;prestigious&quot; flights like intercontinental services or flights to the busy European hub airports; for example United Airlines flights to Newark and Lufthansa services to Munich and Frankfurt were handled here. The whole rooftop worked as a visitor platform. Terminal A was capable of handling wide-bodied aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 767-400ER or Airbus A330-300 on two positions but with only one jet bridge attached to each. The short distance from street to aircraft also put the airport at a disadvantage regarding its extra income as shops and restaurants were restricted to few and small spaces. The last flight from the airport, Air France flight AF1235, operated by an Airbus A320 (F-GKXP), departed from Terminal A, and its parking location is marked by a short gate centreline with a plaque-like sign beneath it: &quot;08.11.2020 letzter Flug AF1235 TXL-CDG AIR FRANCE&quot;.
* Terminal B (also called &quot;Nebel-Hall&quot; after German spaceflight pioneer Rudolf Nebel) was a converted former waiting area in a side wing of the main building and featured check-in counters B20–B39. There was only one walk-boarding aircraft stand directly serving it. This single stand, however, could have handled widebody aircraft up to the size of the Boeing 777-300ER – operated into Tegel by Qatar Airways – and Boeing 747-400, which were not regular visitors.

===Terminal C===
Terminal C was opened in May 2007 as a temporary solution because all other terminals were operating at their maximum capacity. It was largely used by Air Berlin until its demise. It featured 26 check-in counters and gates numbered C38-C51, C60–C67 (Section C2), and C80-C89 (in the newest addition Section C3). From 2008 until August 2009, 5 additional aircraft stands were constructed and the building was expanded by approximately 50% of its original size, in order to handle another 1.5 million passengers per year. The extended terminal housed a transit zone for connecting passengers which did not exist at any other terminal at Tegel Airport. Due to noise protection treaties, the overall number of aircraft stands at the airport was restricted, thus aircraft stands on the apron (serving Terminals A and D) had to be removed for compensation. Terminal C was able to handle widebody-aircraft like Air Berlin&#x27;s former Airbus A330-200s up to the size of a Boeing 747-400 but featured no jet bridges.

===Terminal D===
Terminal D was opened in 2001 and is a converted car park. It featured 22 check-in counters (D70–D91), with one bus-boarding gate and two walk-boarding gates. Most passengers of airlines operating smaller aircraft (like Embraer 190s for example) were brought to the remote aircraft stands by bus from here. Terminal D was the only part of the airport that remained open all night long. The lower level arrival area was called Terminal E (Gates E16-E18).

==Former airlines and destinations==
Tegel was the primary airport of Berlin and therefore saw flights by most major European airlines including British Airways and Air France to many large European cities as well as frequent services to leisure routes mainly around the Mediterranean. After the demise of Air Berlin, which maintained a hub here, Tegel served as a base for easyJet and Ryanair — which both also operated out of Berlin Schönefeld Airport — alongside Eurowings. German flag carrier Lufthansa however only maintained two routes to connect their hubs in Frankfurt and Munich with several flights per day. Despite the size and importance of Berlin as one of Europe&#x27;s largest capital cities, Tegel handled only eight long-haul routes prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, several of them seasonal — most notably by Qatar Airways to Doha, United Airlines to Newark and Scoot to Singapore.

==Ground transportation==
Tegel Airport did not have a direct rail connection, but was served by several bus routes and motorways. An underground station directly serving Tegel Airport had been planned since the 1960s, but was never built. Note that the Alt-Tegel U-Bahn station and Tegel S-Bahn station do not serve Tegel Airport, but rather the Tegel-quarter of Berlin. Extensions of the tram system from Hauptbahnhof and the U6 branch from Kurt-Schumacher Platz to the airport were discussed, but not implemented before its closure.

===Car===
The airport has a direct connection to motorway A111 (Exit &quot;Flughafen Tegel&quot;) which further links it to motorways A10, A110 and A115 (via A110) reaching out in all directions. Taxis and car hire were available at the airport.

===Bus===
The airport was linked by several BVG bus lines, which offered connection to the U-Bahn and S-Bahn, as well as to Regional Express trains and long-distance trains:

* The &quot;TXL&quot; express bus ran to Beusselstraße S-Bahn station, Berlin Central station and initially further to Alexanderplatz (within 20 minutes), with frequent departures between 7 am and 10 pm.
* The &quot;X9&quot; express bus ran to Jakob-Kaiser Platz U-Bahn station (within 5 minutes), Jungfernheide S-Bahn and Regional Express station, and Zoologischer Garten U-Bahn/S-Bahn/Regional Express station (within 20 minutes).
* The &quot;109&quot; bus ran to Jakob-Kaiser Platz U-Bahn station, Charlottenburg S-Bahn and Regional Express station (within 20 minutes), and Zoologischer Garten U-Bahn/S-Bahn/Regional Express station (within 30 minutes) (runs via Kurfürstendamm).
* The &quot;128&quot; bus ran to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz U-Bahn station (within 10 minutes) and Osloer Straße U-Bahn station (within 25 minutes).

Tegel Airport was in the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg&#x27;s Berlin B fare zone, with no additional fare for BVG services to and from the airport.

==Incidents and accidents==
There are no recorded fatal accidents involving commercial airline operations at Berlin Tegel itself. However, two commercial flights, one of which was due to arrive at Tegel Airport and the other of which had departed the airport, were involved in fatal accidents. These accidents are listed below:

* On 15 November 1966, &quot;Clipper München&quot;, a Pan Am Boeing 727-21 (registration N317PA) operating the return leg of the airline&#x27;s daily cargo flight to Berlin from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport (flight number PA 708) was due to land that night at Tegel Airport, rather than Tempelhof, due to runway resurfacing work taking place at that time at the latter. Berlin Control had cleared flight 708 for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to Tegel Airport&#x27;s runway 08, soon after the crew had begun its descent from Flight Level (FL) 090 to FL 030 before entering the southwest air corridor over East Germany on the last stretch of its journey to Berlin. The aircraft impacted the ground near Dallgow, East Germany, almost immediately after the crew had acknowledged further instructions received from Berlin Control, just from Tegel Airport. All three crew members died in this accident. Visibility was poor, and it was snowing at the time of the accident. Following the accident, the Soviet military authorities in East Germany returned only half of the aircraft&#x27;s wreckage to their US counterparts in West Berlin. This excluded vital parts, such as the flight data recorder (FDR), the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) as well as the plane&#x27;s flight control systems, its navigation and communication equipment. The subsequent National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation report concluded that the aircraft&#x27;s descent below its altitude clearance limit was the accident&#x27;s probable cause. However, the NTSB was unable to establish the factors that had caused the crew to descend below its cleared minimum altitude.

The following notable, non-fatal incidents involving airline operations occurred at Tegel. These include commercial flights that were about to depart or had actually departed/arrived as well as unscheduled stopovers:

* Between 1969 and 1982, Berlin Tegel was the destination of several aircraft hijackings involving LOT Polish Airlines domestic flights within Poland. The hijackings were a means of forcing the authorities in communist Poland to let the hijackers emigrate from the Eastern Bloc. Once the aircraft had landed at Tegel, the French military authorities in charge of the airport during the Cold War era let the hijackers and anyone else who did not wish to return to Poland disembark and claim political asylum in West Berlin. The aircraft, its crew and those passengers who did not want to disembark were subsequently returned to Poland.
* Upon completing the repair and run-up of the faulty engine that had caused a rejected takeoff due to an engine oil warning at Berlin Tegel during the late 1980s, a Dan-Air Boeing 727-200 Adv collided with a jetway at the airport&#x27;s terminal building while maintenance engineers taxied the aircraft back to its stand. This badly injured the ground crew member manning the jetway and ruptured the fully refuelled aircraft&#x27;s centre wing tank at the left wing root. As a result, a large quantity of jet fuel spilled onto the tarmac. The maintenance engineers&#x27; failure to pressurise the aircraft&#x27;s hydraulics had resulted in a complete loss of hydraulic pressure just before reaching the stand, making it impossible to steer the aircraft and rendering the brakes ineffective.
*On 7 January 1997, Austrian Airlines flight 104, a McDonnell Douglas MD-87 en route to Vienna International Airport, was hijacked shortly after takeoff from Tegel Airport by a Bosnian male carrying a knife (which was small enough to be allowed on board under then valid safety regulations). The pilots were forced to return to Berlin, where the perpetrator was overpowered by German police forces.
* On 6 November 1997, an Air France Boeing 737-500 skidded off the runway while landing at Berlin Tegel due to a suspected brake defect. There were no injuries.

There were also two Cold war era incidents relating to an American and a British airliner that had departed Tegel on international non-scheduled passenger services. Both of these occurred in Bulgarian airspace. The former was a charter flight carrying German holidaymakers to the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, the latter a migrant charter en route to Turkey:

* On 28 May 1971, a Modern Air CV-990A with 45 passengers on board en route from Berlin Tegel to Bulgaria was unexpectedly denied permission to enter Bulgarian airspace, as a result of a new policy adopted by that country&#x27;s then-communist government to deny any aircraft whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport the right to take off and land at any of its airports. This resulted in the aircraft having to turn back to Berlin, where it landed safely at the city&#x27;s Tegel Airport.
* The same year, a Dan-Air Comet carrying Turkish migrant workers from Berlin Tegel to Istanbul was &quot;escorted&quot; by Bulgarian fighter planes into Sofia. The crew flying the aircraft was attempting to take the shortest route to Istanbul when leaving Yugoslav airspace by entering Bulgarian airspace, instead of taking the longer route through Greek airspace. They were not aware of the then communist government of Bulgaria&#x27;s decision not to let any aircraft enter its airspace whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport, without stopping en route at another airport outside West Berlin. The aircraft landed safely at Sofia. It was released along with its crew and passengers when the flight&#x27;s commander paid with the company&#x27;s credit card the fine the Bulgarian authorities had imposed for violating their country&#x27;s airspace.

<text>Peter Frankenfeld (born &quot;Willi Julius August Frankenfeldt&quot; on 31 May 1913 in Berlin – 4 January 1979 in Hamburg) was a German comedian, radio and television personality.

After World War II he became an interpreter with the U.S. military government. In 1948 he went into broadcasting. He pioneered quiz programs on West German radio and television, becoming the country&#x27;s best-known programme host and entertainer. He is remembered for some classic sketches such as &quot;Der Überzieher&quot; (about a man getting in trouble in a restaurant because he has to constantly guard his overcoat), &quot;Die Bürgschaft&quot; (his bumbling attempt to recite Schiller&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;), or &quot;Die Wetterkarte&quot; (&quot;The Weather Chart&quot;, where he speaks in a wide variety of German dialects).

In 1962, he and director Heinz Dunkhase discovered the comedy sketch Dinner for One in Blackpool which was staged in Frankenfeld&#x27;s live show shortly thereafter, and recorded on 8 July 1963. The show was re-run occasionally on German television until it got its fixed spot on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1972.

He was married to the singer Lonny Kellner.

<text>The Volga Germans (, ; ) are ethnic Germans who settled and historically lived along the Volga River in the region of southeastern European Russia around Saratov and close to Ukraine nearer to the south.

Recruited as immigrants to Russia in the 18th century, they were allowed to maintain their German culture, language, traditions and churches (Lutheran, Reformed, Catholics, Moravians and Mennonites). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Volga Germans emigrated to the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina.

After the October Revolution, the Volga German ASSR was established as an autonomous republic of the Russian SFSR. During World War II, the republic was abolished by the Soviet government and the Volga Germans were forcibly expelled to a number of areas in the hinterlands of the Soviet Union. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, many Volga Germans emigrated to Germany.

==History==
=== Invitation to settle in Russia ===

In 1762, Catherine II, born a German princess and a native of Stettin, Pomerania, deposed her husband Peter III, born a German prince in Kiel, and took the Russian imperial throne. Following the lead of Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria and Hungary, inviting Germans to settle on the Danube in the Balkans, Catherine the Great published manifestos in 1762 and 1763 inviting non-Jewish Europeans to immigrate and become Russian subjects and farm Russian lands while maintaining their language and culture. Although the first received little response, the second improved the benefits offered and was more successful in attracting colonists. People in other countries such as France and Ireland were more inclined to migrate to the colonies in the Americas. Other countries, such as Austria, forbade emigration.

Those who went to Russia had special rights under the terms of the manifesto. Some, such as being exempt from military service, were revoked in the latter part of the 19th century when the government needed more conscripts for the Russian army. The Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonite communities were opposed to military service because of their pacifist beliefs, so many Mennonites emigrated to the Americas instead.

In the late 18th century the nomadic Kazakhs took advantage of Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion, which was centred on the Volga area, to raid Volga German settlements.

=== 19th century ===
At the end of the 19th century, the Russian empire began to apply an aggressive policy of Russification. Although they had been promised a degree of relative autonomy (including being exempt from conscription) when they settled in the Russian empire, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded their specific rights as time went on. The Germans began to suffer a considerable loss of autonomy. Conscription was eventually reinstated. That was not wanted and was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. This caused some Germans to organize themselves and send emissaries to some countries in the Americas in order to assess potential settlement destinations. The chosen destinations were Canada, United States, Brazil and Argentina. Most Volga Germans who settled in Latin America were Catholic. Many Catholic Volga Germans chose South America as their new homeland because the nations shared their religion.

==== North America ====


Germans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals to North America. In the United States, many settled primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas, and Nebraska by 1900. The south-central part of North Dakota was known as &quot;the German-Russian triangle&quot; (that includes descendants of Black Sea Germans). A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys. They also settled in Ohio, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon (especially in Portland), Washington, Wisconsin, and Fresno County in California&#x27;s Central Valley. They often succeeded in dryland farming, which they had practiced in Russia. Many of the immigrants who arrived between 1870 and 1912 spent a period doing farm labor, especially in northeastern Colorado and in Montana along the lower Yellowstone River in sugar beet fields. Colonies kept in touch with each other through newspapers, especially &quot;Der Staats Anzeiger&quot;, based in North Dakota. By author Richard Sallet&#x27;s count, there were 118,493 descendants of Volga Germans of the first and second generation living in the United States according to the 1920 United States census.

In Canada, the largest groups settled mainly in the area of the Great Plains: Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. In Saskatchewan, many settled in the predominantly German settlement of St. Joseph&#x27;s Colony, including the town of Luseland.
==== South America ====
Germans from Russia also settled in Argentina (see German Argentines) and Brazil (see German Brazilians). Additionally, many of the Volga Germans who had previously settled in Brazil later also went to settle in Argentina due to the difficulties of planting wheat in Brazil, among other reasons.

In Argentina, Volga Germans have founded many colonies or villages. For example, around the city of Coronel Suárez in the South of Buenos Aires Province, around the city of Crespo in Entre Ríos Province, along the East of La Pampa Province, etc. Every year, the community of Volga German descendants holds different celebrations in the country in which they keep their traditions alive. For example, the &quot;Kerb&quot; (festival to honour the patron saint of a colony), the &quot;Kreppelfest&quot;, the &quot;Strudelfest&quot;, the &quot;Füllselfest&quot;, the &quot;Schlachtfest&quot; (also promoted by its Spanish name &quot;Fiesta de la Carneada&quot;), the &quot;Fiesta del Pirok&quot; (Bierock festival), etc.

Today, 8% of the Argentine population or 3.5 million Argentines claim German ancestry. Of those, more than 2.5 million claim Volga German descent, making them the majority of those having German ancestry in the country, and accounting for 5.7% of the total Argentine population. Descendants of Volga Germans outnumber descendants of Germans from Germany itself, who number one million in Argentina (2.3% of the population).

=== 20th century ===

Following the Russian Revolution, the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (; ) was established in 1924, and it lasted until 1941. Its capital was Engels, known as &quot;Pokrovsk&quot; ( in German) before 1931.

==== Soviet deportation ====
The deportation of the Volga Germans was the Soviet government&#x27;s forcible transfer of the whole of the Volga German population from the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to Gulag camps which were located in Siberia and Kazakhstan. The Soviets, bearing in mind the collaboration of the Sudeten Germans of Czechoslovakia with Nazi Germany, decided as a precautionary measure to transfer the Volga German population. 

These deportations, which also included the deportation of the rest of the ethnic Germans from Russia, had been implemented for several years before World War II and they became particularly exhaustive on September 3, 1941, during the war.

Of all of the ethnic German communities which lived in the Soviet Union, the Volga Germans represented the largest group of ethnic Germans which was expelled from its historical homeland. All of their possessions were confiscated and they were mainly deported because of their ethnicity. Shortly after the German invasion, on June 22, 1941, Stalin sent Beria and Molotov to the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to determine a course of action for its German inhabitants, as a way of carrying out collective revenge on the civilian population. On return, they recommended the deportation of the entire German population. Consequently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a resolution on August 12, calling for the expulsion of the entire ethnic German population. With this authority, Beria on August 27 issued an order entitled &quot;On Measures for Conducting the Operation of Resettling the Germans from the Volga German Republic, Saratov, and Stalingrad Oblasts&quot;, assigning the deputy head of the NKVD, (secret police) Ivan Serov, to command this operation. He also allocated NKVD and Red Army troops to carry out the transfer.

On August 28, 1941, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved and published a decree, which was the only official decree ever published by the Soviet Union concerning the deportation and exile of the German Russian community. The Germans were to be sent to various oblasts (provinces) in Siberia, Kazakhstan and others, beginning on September 3, and ending on September 20. On September 7, the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was officially abolished, clearly showing that the Soviets considered the expulsion of the Germans final.

The Soviet regime stated that the evacuation was a preventive measure, so that the German population would not be misled into collaborating with the German Army rather than a punitive measure, and they did not reveal the sentence to the forced labor camps. Stalin allegedly gave the following &quot;secret&quot; order to the NKVD, produced in German controlled Latvia on September 20, 1941:
&quot;After the house search, tell everyone who is scheduled to be deported that, according to the government&#x27;s decision, they are being sent to other regions of the USSR. Transport the entire family in one car until the train station, but at the station, heads of families must be loaded into a separate train car prepared especially for them. Their families are deported for special settlements in the far away regions of the Union. [Family members] must not know about the forthcoming separation from the head of the family.&quot;

The document above may be a fabrication, as Latvia was under German occupation at that time. Nevertheless, the instructions were followed by the NKVD troops who directed the deportation. The reason for separating the men is that they were all destined to be sent to forced labor camps, known as &quot;Trudarmee&quot; (NKVD labor army). The deported and enslaved Germans coined this phrase, whereas Soviet documents only referred to &quot;labor obligations&quot; or &quot;labor regulations.&quot; Men between the ages of 15 and 55 and, later, women between the ages of 16 and 45 were forced to do labor in the forests and mines of Siberia and Central Asia under conditions similar to that prevalent in the Gulag forced labor camps, while other Germans were directly deported to Gulag forced labor camps. After the Nazi invasion began, the NKVD (via Prikaz No. 35105) banned ethnic Germans from serving in the Soviet military. They sent tens of thousands of these soldiers to the &quot;Trudarmee&quot;.

The expulsion of the Volga Germans was finished on schedule at the end of September 1941. According to the Soviet Union, the total number sent to forced internal exile was about 950,000. However, the actual estimated number of victims is much higher. It took 151 train convoys to accomplish the first transfers of the Volga German population, an astounding figure when one considers that the Soviet Union was heavily engaged in fighting the advancing German army, and all railway stock was required to bring soldiers to the front. This operation also involved 1,550 NKVD and 3,250 police agents, assisted by 12,150 soldiers of the Red Army.

In 1942, nearly all the able-bodied German population was conscripted to the NKVD labor columns or had been sent to the Gulag forced labor camps. According to anti-communist Stanford historian Robert Conquest, during the first stage, about one-third (estimated at 1.5 million) did not survive the camps. The conditions imposed on ethnic Germans by the regime continued to be inhumane. The deportation and subsequent deaths to ethnic minorities during Stalin&#x27;s rule is referred to as an ethnic cleansing. Some historians refer to these acts as a genocide, though there is debate whether or not the destruction of non-Russians was intentional. Ethnically German minorities received little empathy for mass expulsions due to their German ethnicity and assumed relation to the Nazi regime. There is debate among sociologists and historians whether ethnic cleansing is genocide.

=== Recent years ===

The Volga Germans never returned to the Volga region in their old numbers. They were not allowed to settle in the area for decades. After World War II, many survivors remained in the Ural Mountains, Siberia, Kazakhstan (1.4% of today&#x27;s Kazakh population are recognized as Germans - around 200,000), Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan (about 16,000 or 0.064%). Decades after the war, some talked about resettling where the German Autonomous Republic used to be. But all their properties had been occupied by Russian communists. They met opposition from the new population there and did not persevere. 

A proposal in June 1979 called for a new German Autonomous Republic within Kazakhstan, with a capital in Ermentau. The proposal was aimed at addressing the living conditions of the displaced Volga Germans. At the time, around 936,000 ethnic Germans were living in Kazakhstan, as the republic&#x27;s third-largest ethnic group. On June 16, 1979, demonstrators in Tselinograd (Astana) protested this proposal. Fearing a negative reaction among the majority Kazakhs and calls for autonomy among local Uyghurs, the ruling Communist Party scrapped the proposal for ethnic German autonomy within Kazakhstan.

Since the late 1980s and the fall of the Soviet Union, some ethnic Germans have returned in small numbers to Engels, but many more emigrated permanently to Germany. They took advantage of the German law of return, a policy that grants citizenship to all those who can prove to be a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the spouse or descendant of such a person.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the independence of the Baltic states, some Russian ethnic Germans began to return to the area of the Kaliningrad Oblast (formerly part of East Prussia), especially Volga Germans from other parts of Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as to the Volga Germans&#x27; old territory in southern Russia near Volgograd. This tempo increased after Germany stopped granting the free right of return to ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union.

== Language ==
The greatest number of Volga Germans emigrated from Hesse and the Palatinate, and spoke Hessian and Palatine Rhine Franconian dialects to which the colonists from other regions, and even from other countries like Sweden, assimilated. Some Volga German dialects are very similar to Pennsylvania Dutch, another Palatine Rhine Franconian language; in either dialect, one could say:
* (spelled according to standard German pronunciation rules:) 
* (in German:) 
* (in English:) We would like to go into the beautiful yellow church.

Some other common words:
The above list only attempts to reproduce the pronunciation and does not represent how the Volga Germans wrote. The dialects of the Germans of Russia mainly presented differences in pronunciation, as occurs in the diversity of the English language. However, Volga Germans wrote and kept their records in Standard German.

Volga Germans only borrowed a few but anecdotal Russian words, like (&quot;watermelon&quot; from Russian &quot;watermelon&quot;), which they carried with them on their subsequent moves to North America and Argentina.

The Standard German-related variety influenced by dialects and spoken by Volgan Germans who moved to Argentina is called &quot;&quot;. It is also spoken in the Brazilian state of Paraná in addition to the Argentine province of Entre Ríos.

<doc id="271849" wikidata="Q970287" url="?curid=271849" title="Alexei Sayle">
<text>Alexei David Sayle (born 7 August 1952) is an English actor, author, stand-up comedian, television presenter and former recording artist. He was a leading figure in the British alternative comedy movement in the 1980s. He was voted the 18th greatest stand-up comic of all time on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups&quot; in 2007. In an updated 2010 poll he came 72nd.

Much of Sayle&#x27;s humour is in the tradition of Spike Milligan and Monty Python, with riffs based on often absurd and surreal premises. His act is known for its cynicism and political awareness as well as physical comedy.

==Early life==
Sayle is Jewish. He was born and brought up in the Anfield suburb of Liverpool, the son of Molly (Malka) Sayle (née Mendelson), a pools clerk, and Joseph Henry Sayle, a railway guard, both of whom were members of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Sayle&#x27;s mother was of Lithuanian Jewish descent, and some members of his family were devout Jews. Sayle was named after Maxim Gorky, whose real name was Alexei Maximovich Peshkov.

From 1964 to 1969, he attended Alsop High School in Walton, and he was expelled halfway through sixth form. After that, Sayle took a foundation course in art at Southport before attending Chelsea College of Art and Design in London. He attended Garnett College in Roehampton, a training college for teachers in further education.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy and theatre===
When The Comedy Store opened in London in 1979, Sayle responded to an advert in &quot;Private Eye&quot; for would-be comedians and became its first master of ceremonies. In 1980, comedy producer Martin Lewis saw Sayle perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and became his manager.

Sayle became the leading performer at The Comic Strip. He appeared on &quot;The Comic Strip Album&quot; (1981) and recorded &quot;Cak!&quot; (1982). He also appeared in the stage show, film and comedy album of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; (1981–1982). An example of Sayle&#x27;s humour was his attack on American phrases: &quot;If you travel to the States ... they have a lot of different words than like what we use. For instance: they say &#x27;elevator&#x27;, we say &#x27;lift&#x27;; they say &#x27;drapes&#x27;, we say &#x27;curtains&#x27;; they say &#x27;president&#x27;, we say &#x27;seriously deranged git!&#x27;&quot;

In 1988 Sayle played the role of Trinculo the King&#x27;s jester in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, directed by Jonathan Miller at the Old Vic theatre in London.
Sixteen years on from his last stand-up comedy tour, Sayle returned in 2011 as an MC, compering the middle section of &quot;At Last! The 1981 Show&quot;, produced by Stewart Lee at the Royal Festival Hall. Although this was mainly a nostalgia night with comedians such as Nigel Planer and Norman Lovett revisiting their material from the 1980s, Sayle premiered some new material that was more anecdotal than his previous work. Sayle says of his old style, &quot;What I was doing, which I hadn&#x27;t realised, was a comic persona. The guy in the tight suit was actually a creation. I thought it was me in a sense but it wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

With artists such as Isy Suttie and Jim Bob, Sayle appeared at the fourth &quot;Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People&quot; event at the Bloomsbury Theatre in December 2011. In January and February 2012, he compered four nights of stand-up comedy at the Soho Theatre. He completed a full UK stand-up tour in October and November 2012 and a sixteen-night residency at the Soho Theatre in January and February 2013, where he performed new material. He played a further ten nights at the Soho Theatre in April 2013. He also performed at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

===Radio===
Sayle&#x27;s early work included several performances for Capital London. In 1979, he wrote and performed the radio series, &quot;Alexei Sayle and the Fish People&quot;, for which he won a Pye Radio Award (later known as the Sony Radio Awards). An album based on the show, &quot;The Fish People Tapes&quot;, again featuring Sayle, was released. This was followed by &quot;Alexei Sayle and the Dutch Lieutenant&#x27;s Trousers&quot; in 1980, the name being a reference to John Fowles&#x27; &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. He also starred in two series of &quot;Lenin of the Rovers&quot;, a 1988 comedy about Britain&#x27;s first communist football team. He has since contributed to many other radio shows, including writing the five-part sitcom series, &quot;Sorry About Last Night&quot; (1999), in which he also played the leading role. On 3 November 2006 he presented &quot;Chopwell Soviet&quot;, a 30-minute programme on BBC Radio 4 that reviewed the Chopwell miners 80 years after the village of Chopwell became known as Little Moscow. Sayle returned to Radio 4 in 2016 with &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Imaginary Sandwich Bar&quot;, which has run for four critically acclaimed series so far. In 2019, he narrated the dramatisation of four of his short stories in the series &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s The Absence of Normal&quot;, again on Radio 4. A second series was broadcast in 2021.

Since February 2022 Sayle has presented BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Strangers on a Train&quot;. 

===Television===
Sayle&#x27;s first high-profile television appearances were on Central Independent Television&#x27;s late-night alternative cabaret show &quot;O.T.T.&quot; (1982). He left nine weeks into the show&#x27;s run to tour Australia with the Comic Strip. He played various roles in the situation comedy &quot;The Young Ones&quot; (1982–1984), along with Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan. In the programme Sayle portrayed several members of an Eastern European family; the Balowskis. In 1985, he appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Revelation of the Daleks&quot;. In a column for a British tabloid newspaper around the same time, he indicated that he wanted to become the &quot;first Socialist Doctor.&quot; He also appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; between 1985 and 1993, playing the two leading roles in &quot;Didn&#x27;t You Kill My Brother?&quot; which he co-wrote with David Stafford and Pauline Melville. Sayle has co-written and starred in many other programmes, including three series of &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff&quot; (1988–1991), two series of &quot;The All New Alexei Sayle Show&quot; (1994–1995) and one series of &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1998).

In 1989, Sayle was awarded an International Emmy for &quot;Stuff&quot;. In conversation with Mark Thomas on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s informal chat-show &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, Sayle revealed that the first he knew of the award was when he watched &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; and saw, to his amazement, Benny Hill collecting the award on his behalf. In 1990, Sayle had a fatwa proclaimed against him by a Muslim cleric from Syria after a joke on his BBC comedy show &quot;Stuff&quot;, which has never been withdrawn.

Sayle was signed in 1992 to a seven-year contract to play an Eastern European chef as a regular character on the American sitcom &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, but was fired and replaced by Cheech Marin before the pilot was filmed. The series was cancelled after one season.

In 1994, he presented the miniseries &quot;Drive&quot;, which gave advice for safe driving through Sayle&#x27;s signature form of humour interspersed with serious pieces. In 2008, he wrote and presented &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Liverpool&quot;, a three-part television series in which he reconnected with his home town. He stated in the programmes that on first hearing that Liverpool was to be awarded the European Capital of Culture, he received much criticism for describing the city as &quot;philistine&quot;. He now feels that he does not know whether or not his original statement was true but as a result of making the series he does now consider Liverpool to be his home, and he has vowed to go back there more often in the future.

Sayle also narrated the Public information film (PIF) &quot;Moon Lighters&quot; about two moon creatures, Biblock and Hoblock and the dangers of lighters. Sayle replaced Rolf Harris as the narrator for the Nick Jr. and Milkshake! series &quot;Olive The Ostrich&quot;. Episodes featuring Sayle&#x27;s narration commenced broadcasting on 22 July 2013.

===Film===
Sayle alternates his comedy work with performances as a character actor ranging from serious (&quot;Gorky Park&quot;, 1983) to humorous (&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, 1989). He appeared in the 1992 &quot;Carry On&quot; film, &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; along with other modern comedians, including Comic Strip founder Peter Richardson, as well as surviving members of the original &quot;Carry On&quot; team. He narrated the 2023 political documentary film &quot;Oh, Jeremy Corbyn: The Big Lie&quot; and the 2024 sequel, &quot;The Big Lie II: Starmer and the Genocide&quot;.

===Music===

Sayle has released five comedy singles with full musical backing, and one live recording from the Comedy Store in London 1981. This was &quot;Dedication&quot;, released as a double A side with Alex Arundel, the London-based Scottish songwriter and founding member of Alternative Cabaret, with the song &quot;When The Gold Runs Dry&quot; being the other A side. Sayle&#x27;s most successful single was &quot;&#x27;Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?&quot;, which achieved Top 20 chart success in the UK upon re-release in 1984. Produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley (who also produced for Madness and Elvis Costello), the record (in its 12-inch version) achieved notoriety owing to its extensive use of profane language. The two follow-up singles, &quot;Didn&#x27;t You Kill My Brother?&quot;, and &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, were taken from the album &quot;Panic&quot;, the cover of which parodies the cover of the Michael Jackson album &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.

===Writing===
Sayle has written two short story collections, five novels, including a graphic novel and a radio series spin-off book, as well as columns for various publications. His book &quot;Great Bus Journeys of the World&quot;, co-written with David Stafford, is mostly a collection of his columns for &quot;Time Out&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;. He was one of eight contributory authors to the BBC Three competition &quot;End of Story&quot;, in which members of the public completed the second half of stories written by established authors. The winning entry to Sayle&#x27;s story, &quot;Imitating Katherine Walker&quot;, was written by freelance writer Arthur Allan. Sayle&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Stalin Ate My Homework&quot;, which deals with his early life, and which he describes as a &#x27;satirical memoir&#x27;, was published in 2010. In 2012 he joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as a motoring columnist. In early 2015 he toured giving readings from the second volume of his autobiography &quot;Thatcher Stole My Trousers&quot;, published in 2016.

===Internet===
In November 2020, Sayle began hosting a monthly podcast, &quot;The Alexei Sayle Podcast&quot;. Produced/co-hosted by Talal Karkouti; guests have included Josie Long, Stewart Lee, Omid Djalili, Lise Mayer, Diane Morgan and Jeremy Corbyn.

He also launched a YouTube channel, showcasing videos of various bike rides.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Sayle married Linda Rawsthorn. He lives in Bloomsbury in central London and is a keen cyclist. He also owns a house near Granada, in southern Spain. He was diagnosed with sarcoidosis in 1990. A recurrence of this condition in 2015 led to him being rushed to hospital and then transferred to a neurological unit for a week.

==Political views==
Around the age of 15, Sayle decided to join the Young Communist League, but only went to a few meetings. In 1968, he joined a Maoist organisation, the Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist). In 2009, he said that, while no longer active in left politics, &quot;I still would adhere to those philosophical and economic ideas of Marxism that I got when I was sixteen. ... it&#x27;s seemed to me as true now as it did then&quot;.

Sayle is a critic of fox hunting and was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron&#x27;s plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004.

=== Labour Party ===
In February 2016, Sayle said of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: &quot;He&#x27;s ascetic and morally incorruptible. The propaganda that&#x27;s thrown against him is disgraceful. Until he appeared, you had to vote for one kind of Oxbridge twat or another, people who all go to the same dinner parties, people like the Ed Ballses and George Osbornes. Jeremy has shown that, within a democratic tradition, other things are possible.&quot; In 2016, he wrote a comment piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; saying that he was happy to mock New Labour in his act, but now that Corbyn was about to &quot;reform the party in his own image – ascetic, socialist, kindly and ethical&quot;, he would stop making jokes about Labour.

In May 2018, regarding the expulsion of Marc Wadsworth from the Labour Party, Sayle commented: &quot;The Party should walk over broken glass to beg people of Marc&#x27;s calibre to work with them – they are very few and Marc is one of the best. There is a battle going on to destroy and reverse the unexpected and amazing gains the left has made in the last three years. Marc is a casualty in that battle and I am joining the fight to see him re-instated to the front line.&quot;

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Sayle signed a letter supporting Corbyn, describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

==== Involvement with accusations of party antisemitism ====
In January 2020, he was condemned by some Jewish groups after being one of thousands to sign an open letter criticising Rebecca Long-Bailey and other Labour leadership candidates for saying they would sign a 10-point pledge by the Board of Deputies of British Jews intended to combat anti-semitism, should they be elected. The letter was organised by Momentum activist Jackie Walker and former Labour MP Chris Williamson.

In May 2021, Conservative MP Matthew Offord wrote to the BBC&#x27;s Director-General urging, unsuccessfully, that the planned broadcast of &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; featuring Sayle, on 23 May, be halted on the basis that every broadcaster &quot;should be wary of giving a platform to anyone who is seen to be &#x27;excusing&#x27; antisemitism&quot;. There was an outcry on social media in response, rejecting the claim that Sayle was doing this, with support for Sayle (whose mother came from an orthodox Jewish background) from across the board, and the resulting hashtag #IStandWithAlexeiSayle trending on UK Twitter.

<doc id="271851" wikidata="Q9686" url="?curid=271851" title="Berlin Tempelhof Airport">
<text>Berlin Tempelhof Airport () was one of the first airports in Berlin, Germany. Situated in the south-central Berlin borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, the airport ceased operating in 2008 amid controversy, leaving Tegel and Schönefeld as the two main airports serving the city for another twelve years until both were replaced by Berlin Brandenburg Airport in 2020.

Tempelhof was designated as an airport by the Reich Ministry of Transport on 8 October 1923. The old terminal was originally constructed in 1927. In anticipation of increasing air traffic, the Nazi government began an enormous reconstruction in the mid-1930s. While it was occasionally cited as the world&#x27;s oldest operating commercial airport, the title was disputed by several other airports, and is no longer an issue since its closure.

Tempelhof was one of Europe&#x27;s three iconic pre-World War II airports, the others being London&#x27;s now defunct Croydon Airport and the old Paris–Le Bourget Airport. It acquired a further iconic status as the centre of the Berlin Airlift of 1948–49. One of the airport&#x27;s most distinctive features is its huge, canopy-style roof extending over the apron, able to accommodate most contemporary airliners in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, protecting passengers from the elements. Tempelhof Airport&#x27;s main building was once among the twenty largest buildings on earth, but it also formerly contained the world&#x27;s smallest duty-free shop.

Tempelhof Airport closed all operations on 30 October 2008, despite the efforts of some protesters to prevent the closure. A non-binding referendum was held on 27 April 2008 against the impending closure but failed due to low voter turnout. The former airfield has subsequently been used as a recreational space known as &quot;Tempelhofer Feld&quot;. In September 2015, it was announced that Tempelhof would also become an emergency refugee camp.

==Function==
Tempelhof was often called the &quot;City Airport&quot;. In its later years, it mostly had commuter flights to other parts of Germany and neighbouring countries; but it had in the past received long-haul, wide-bodied airliners, such as the Boeing 747, the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy. The first of these three first appeared at Tempelhof on 18 September 1976, when Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flew in Boeing 747SP &quot;Clipper Great Republic&quot; to participate in the static exhibition of contemporary military, non-combat and civil aircraft at the annual &quot;Day of Open House&quot; of the United States Air Force (USAF) at the airport.

The Galaxy had its first appearance at Tempelhof on 17 September 1971, when an aircraft of the USAF&#x27;s 436th Military Airlift Wing flew in from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, United States, to participate in that year&#x27;s &quot;Day of Open House&quot; static exhibition. These events respectively marked the debut at Tempelhof of the largest aircraft in commercial airline service at the time and the then-largest aircraft overall.

Tempelhof, compared to Brandenburg Airport and Tegel Airport, wasn&#x27;t a particularly large airport. The layout of the airport was relatively simple - two parallel runways oriented east–west (09/27 L/R), with a single oval taxiway around the airport, with the main terminal on the north-western segment of the airport. The runways are not comparatively long, either - versus Brandenburg&#x27;s 3600m and 4000m runways which can easily handle intercontinental airliners like the Boeing 747, Tempelhof has two runways at 2094m (09R/27L) and 1840m (09L/27R), which can, at most, handle Boeing 757 and Airbus A320-size aircraft.

Other possible uses for Tempelhof have been discussed, and many people are trying to keep the airport buildings preserved. 

In September 2015, in the midst of the 2015 European migrant crisis, it was announced by the Berlin state government that Tempelhof would become an &#x27;emergency refugee shelter&#x27;, holding at least 1,200 people in two former hangars. 

As the airport has been listed as a historic monument since 1995, preservation work has been routinely carried out, even after its closure; this includes the development of a preservation plan between 2012 and 2015, which outlined methods for maintaining the site whilst allowing for future development in the area.
==History==

The site of the airport was originally Knights Templar land in medieval Berlin, and from this beginning came the name &quot;Tempelhof&quot;. Later, the site was used as a parade field by the Prussian army from 1720 to the start of World War I. In 1909, French aviator Armand Zipfel made the first flight demonstration in Tempelhof, followed by Orville Wright later that same year. Tempelhof was first officially designated as an airport on 8 October 1923. Deutsche Luft Hansa was founded in Tempelhof on 6 January 1926.

The old terminal, originally constructed in 1927, became the world&#x27;s first with an underground railway. The station has since been renamed &quot;Paradestraße&quot;, because the rebuilding of the airport in the 1930s required the airport access to be moved to a major intersection with a station now called Platz der Luftbrücke after the Berlin Airlift.

As part of Albert Speer&#x27;s plan for the reconstruction of Berlin during the Nazi era, Prof. Ernst Sagebiel was ordered to replace the old terminal with a new terminal building in 1934. The airport halls and the adjoining buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe and a symbol of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;world capital&quot; Germania, are still known as one of the largest built entities worldwide, and have been described by British architect Sir Norman Foster as &quot;the mother of all airports&quot;.
With its façades of shell limestone, the terminal building, built between 1936 and 1941, forms a quadrant. Arriving passengers walked through customs controls to the reception hall. Tempelhof was served by the U6 U-Bahn line along Mehringdamm and up Friedrichstraße (Platz der Luftbrücke station).

Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin had the advantage of a central location just minutes from the Berlin city centre and quickly became one of the world&#x27;s busiest airports. Tempelhof saw its greatest pre-war days during 1938–1939, when up to 52 foreign and 40 domestic flights arrived and departed daily from the old terminal while the new one was still under construction.

The new air terminal was designed as headquarters for Deutsche Luft Hansa (moved in 1938), the German national airline at that time. As a forerunner of today&#x27;s modern airports, the building was designed with many unique features, including giant arc-shaped aircraft hangars. Although under construction for more than ten years, it was never finished because of World War II. For passengers and freight, the 1927-built terminal stayed in use until 24 April 1945.

The building complex was designed to resemble an eagle in flight with semicircular hangars forming the bird&#x27;s spread wings. A hangar roof was to have been laid in tiers to form a stadium for spectators at air and ground demonstrations. Norman Foster called Tempelhof &quot;one of the really great buildings of the modern age&quot;.

===World War II===
Fearing Allied bombing of airports, all German civil aviation was halted on 2 September 1939, but gradually restarted from 1 November. However, the 1927-built terminal remained closed to all civil aviation, and all civilian aircraft movements to and from Berlin were transferred to an airfield in Rangsdorf until 7 March 1940, when the 1927 terminal was reopened and civil aviation continued until 24 April 1945.

From January 1940 until early 1944, Weser Flugzeugbau assembled Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers; thereafter, it assembled Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter planes in the still unfurnished main hall and hangars 3 to 7 of the new terminal, which were supplied by a railway and trucks via a connecting tunnel. Hangars 1 and 2 were not used to assemble aircraft as these were already used by Luft Hansa for its own planes. Aircraft parts were brought in from all over the city while complete aircraft engines were trucked to Tempelhof. Once the airframes were complete and the engines had been installed, the finished aircraft were flown out. The Luftwaffe did not use Tempelhof as a military airfield during World War II, except for occasional emergency landings by fighter aircraft.

On 21 April 1945, Deutsche Luft Hansa operated its last scheduled flights, and over the coming days laid on additional non-scheduled flights from Johannisthal Air Field which stopped over at Tempelhof to take on freight en route to Travemünde and Munich, where Luft Hansa had relocated its headquarters. Two days later, on 23 April, the airline&#x27;s last-ever flight to depart Tempelhof left for Madrid, but was later shot down over Southern Germany.

Tempelhof&#x27;s German commander, &quot;Oberst&quot; Rudolf Böttger, refused to carry out orders to blow up the base, choosing instead to kill himself. Soviet forces took Tempelhof in the Battle of Berlin on 28 and 29 April 1945 in the closing days of the war in Europe. Soviet forces combed through the old and the new terminal searching for treasures, hidden places and documents, opening all rooms.

During their search, they blew up the fortified entrance to a three-level bomb shelter for celluloid films of the Hansa Luftbild GmbH, a Luft Hansa subsidiary specialising in aerial photography. The explosion immediately ignited the celluloid, turning the film shelter under the northern office wing of the new terminal into a furnace and making it impossible to enter for several weeks. The raging inferno led the Soviet commander to order the lower levels to be flooded with water. With no functioning water supply in war-torn Berlin, this was only possible because the new terminal, which had suffered only slight war damage, had its own electricity and groundwater utility with underground reservoirs under the northerly forecourt of the new terminal close to the film shelter.

On 8 May 1945, Western Allied and German signatories of the German Surrender in Berlin and their entourage landed at Tempelhof airport. At the beginning of May, Weser Flugzeugbau opened a workshop in hangar 7 to repair streetcars. In the following weeks, Berliners raided all unguarded parts of the opened buildings searching for food or anything else useful in bartering in the black market. In accordance with the Yalta agreements, Zentralflughafen Berlin-Tempelhof was turned over to the United States Army 2nd Armored Division on 2 July 1945 by the Soviet Union as part of the American occupation sector of Berlin. This agreement was later formalised by the August 1945 Potsdam Agreement, which formally divided Berlin into four occupation sectors.

The 852nd Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived at Tempelhof (Code Number R-95) on 10 July 1945 and conducted the original repairs in the new terminal. After the Allied Control Council had agreed upon West Berlin Air Corridors under control of the Berlin Air Safety Centre, these opened in February 1946, enabling civil aviation at Tempelhof to restart.

===Berlin Airlift===

On 20 June 1948, Soviet authorities, claiming technical difficulties, halted all traffic by land and by water into or out of the western-controlled sectors of Berlin. The only remaining access routes into the city were three -wide air corridors across the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Faced with the choice of abandoning the city or attempting to supply its inhabitants with the necessities of life by air, the Western Powers chose the latter course.

&quot;Operation Vittles&quot;, as the airlift was unofficially named, began on 26 June when USAF Douglas C-47 Skytrains carried 80 tons of food into Tempelhof, far less than the estimated 4,500 tons of food, coal and other essential supplies needed daily to maintain a minimum level of existence. But this force was soon augmented by United States Navy and Royal Air Force cargo aircraft, as well as British European Airways (BEA) and many of Britain&#x27;s fledgling wholly privately owned, independent airlines.

The last included Freddie Laker&#x27;s Air Charter, Eagle Aviation and Skyways. On 15 October 1948, to promote increased safety and cooperation between the separate US and British airlift efforts, the Allies created a unified command – the Combined Airlift Task Force under Maj. Gen. William H. Tunner, USAF – at Tempelhof. To facilitate the command and control, as well as the unloading of aircraft, the USAF 53d Troop Carrier Squadron was temporarily assigned to Tempelhof.

The grass runways usual in Germany until then could not cope with the great demand, and a subsequently built runway containing perforated steel matting began to crumble under the weight of the USAF&#x27;s C-54 Skymasters. Hence, American engineers built a new runway at Tempelhof between July and September 1948 and another between September and October 1948 to accommodate the expanding requirements of the airlift. The old airport terminal of 1927 was demolished in 1948 in order to create additional space for unloading more planes. The last airlift transport touched down at Tempelhof on 30 September 1949.

Tempelhof also became famous as the location of Operation Little Vittles: the dropping of candy to children living near the airport. The original &quot;Candy Bomber&quot;, Gail Halvorsen noticed children lingering near the fence line of the airport and wanted to share something with them. He eventually started dropping candy by parachute just before landing. His efforts were expanded by other pilots and eventually became a part of legend in the city of Berlin.

===Cold War===
As the Cold War intensified in the late 1950s and 1960s, access problems to West Berlin, both by land and air, continued to cause tension. Throughout the Cold War years, Tempelhof was the main terminal for American military transport aircraft accessing West Berlin. In 1969 one of the pilots during the Berlin Airlift, and the original &quot;Candy Bomber&quot;, Gail Halvorsen, returned to Berlin as the commander of Tempelhof airbase.

With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the presence of American forces in Berlin ended. The USAF 7350th Air Base Group at Tempelhof was inactivated in June 1993. In July 1994, with President Clinton in attendance, the British, French, and American air and land forces in Berlin were deactivated in a ceremony on the Four Ring Parade field at McNair Barracks. The Western Allies returned a united city of Berlin to the unified German government. The U.S. Army closed its Berlin Army Aviation Detachment at TCA in August 1994, ending a 49-year American military presence in Berlin.

=== U.S. Army Aviation ===
In 1951 the US Army stationed an aviation element of the 6. Infantry Brigade-(6th Infantry Regiment?) with three Hiller OH-23A Raven helicopters at Tempelhof. Over the years it became known as the Berlin Brigade Aviation Detachment (BBDE Avn.Det.). The Hiller OH-23A was soon replaced by Bell OH-13 Sioux. Further helicopters stationed over the years where Sikorsky H-19 Chikasaw (1958–1964), Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw (1962–1964), Bell UH-1B (1964–1971)and finally Bell UH-1H (May 1971– August 1994).

Fixed wing aircraft stationed at Tempelhof were Cessna O-1 Bird Dog (1965–1975), De Havilland Canada U-6 Beaver (1968 – January 1980), Cessna O-2A (1975–1979), Pilatus UV-20A Chiricahua (1979–1991), Beechcraft U-8D Seminole(1960s), Beechcraft U-21 (1970s–1986 and 1991–1994), as well as Beechcraft C-12C (1986–1991).

===Postwar commercial use===



==== Early Operations and the Berlin Blockade ====
American Overseas Airlines (AOA), at the time the overseas division of American Airlines, inaugurated the first commercial air link serving Tempelhof after the war with a flight from New York via Shannon, Amsterdam and Frankfurt on 18 May 1946. This was followed by AOA&#x27;s inauguration of West Berlin&#x27;s first dedicated domestic air link between Tempelhof and Frankfurt&#x27;s Rhein-Main Airport on 1 March 1948.

AOA was the only commercial operator at Tempelhof to maintain its full flying programme for the entire duration of the Berlin Blockade (26 June 1948 – 12 May 1949).

==== Expansion in the 1950s ====
Following the end of the Berlin Blockade, AOA launched additional dedicated scheduled services linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel and Düsseldorf Lohausen from 6 March and 1 June 1950 respectively.

On 25 September 1950, Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines. This merger resulted in Pan Am establishing a growing presence at Tempelhof. (In addition to continuing AOA&#x27;s original, multistop Berlin – New York route and dedicated internal German services connecting Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf, between 1955 and 1959, Pan Am commenced regular, year-round scheduled services to Cologne, Stuttgart, Hanover, Munich and Nuremberg from Tempelhof.) Pan Am&#x27;s initial equipment for its new Berlin operation were unpressurised, 60-seat Douglas DC-4s, widely available at the time due to the large number of war-surplus C-54 Skymasters.

1950 was also the year Air France joined Pan Am at Tempelhof. Air France resumed operations to Tempelhof following their cessation during the war years.

This was furthermore the time Allied restrictions on the carriage of local civilians on commercial airline services from/to West Berlin were lifted. It entailed transferring responsibility for processing all commercial flights to West Berlin&#x27;s city government, including the operation and maintenance of associated passenger, cargo and mail handling facilities. These changes gave a major boost to West Berlin&#x27;s fledgeling post-war scheduled air services.

On 8 July 1951, BEA transferred its operations from Gatow to Tempelhof, thus concentrating all West Berlin air services at Berlin&#x27;s iconic city centre airport. BEA&#x27;s move to Tempelhof resulted in a significant increase in passenger numbers, as well as an increase in its Berlin-based fleet to six Douglas DC-3s.

From then on, several of the new, wholly privately owned UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers started regular air services to Tempelhof from the UK, the US and West Germany. These airlines initially carried members of the UK and US armed forces stationed in Berlin and their dependants as well as essential raw materials, finished goods manufactured in West Berlin and refugees from East Germany and Eastern Europe, who were still able to freely enter the city prior to the construction of the infamous Berlin Wall. This operation was also known as the &quot;Little Berlin Airlift&quot;. One of these airlines, UK independent Dan-Air Services would subsequently play an important role in developing commercial air services from Tegel for a quarter century.

During the early-to-mid-1950s, BEA leased in aircraft that were bigger than its Tempelhof-based fleet of DC-3/Pionair, Viking and Elizabethan piston-engined airliners from other operators to boost capacity, following a steady increase in the airline&#x27;s passenger loads. (This included an ex-Transair Vickers Viscount 700 belonging to its newly formed independent rival British United Airways, which was damaged beyond repair on 30 October 1961 at Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport at the end of a passenger flight that had originated at Tempelhof.)

By 1954, a year that saw 671,555 passengers pass through the airport, Tempelhof had established itself as the third-busiest airport in Europe. From 6 June of that year, Pan Am. began re-equipping its Tempelhof-based fleet with larger, pressurised Douglas DC-6B propliners. Compared with the DC-4, the new type had 16 additional seats.

In 1958, BEA began replacing its piston airliners with Vickers Viscount 701 turboprop aircraft, in a high-density 63-seat single class seating arrangement. Up to ten new, state-of-the-art Vickers Viscount 802s, which featured a more spacious 66-seat single-class seating arrangement, soon replaced the older series 701 aircraft. The greater range and higher cruising speed of the 802 series enabled BEA to inaugurate a non-stop London Heathrow – Berlin Tempelhof service on 1 November 1965. this was the only non-stop international scheduled air service from Tempelhof

On 19 November 1959, a Pan Am DC-4 became the first aircraft to operate a scheduled all-cargo service from West Berlin. This service linked Tempelhof with Rhein-Main Airport once-nightly, all year round.

==== The Jet Age and Berlin Wall: 1960s ====
On 2 January 1960, Air France, which had served Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and its main base at Paris Le Bourget/Orly during the previous decade with DC-4, Sud-Est Languedoc and Lockheed Constellation/Super Constellation piston-engined equipment, shifted its entire Berlin operation to Tegel because Tempelhof&#x27;s runways were too short to permit the introduction of the Sud-Aviation Caravelle, their new short-haul jet, with a viable payload. (Air France&#x27;s Caravelle IIIs lacked thrust reversers that would have permitted them to land safely on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways with a full commercial payload.)

On 1 March 1960, Pan Am launched its second dedicated scheduled all-cargo flight from Berlin, linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel.

1960 was also the year Pan Am withdrew its last DC-4 from Tempelhof. As a result, all of the airline&#x27;s Berlin routes were exclusively served with DC-6Bs as of 27 June of that year. Although the DC-6B was a less advanced aircraft than either the Viscount or the Caravelle, it was more economical. By the early 1960s, Pan Am had a fleet of 15 DC-6Bs stationed at its Tempelhof base, which were configured in a higher-density seating arrangement than competing airlines&#x27; aircraft. (Pan Am&#x27;s DC-6Bs were originally configured in a 76-seat, all-economy layout. The subsequent introduction of subsidies for all scheduled internal German services from/to West Berlin resulted in steady network growth as well as service frequency and passenger load increases. To cope with the sharply higher traffic volumes, aircraft seat densities were increased twice – initially to 84 and subsequently 87 seats.) This fleet eventually grew to 17 aircraft, which gave Pan Am the biggest aircraft fleet among the three main scheduled operators flying from West Berlin. It furthermore enabled it to compensate for the DC-6&#x27;s lack of sophistication with higher frequencies than its competitors, thereby attaining a higher market share (60%) and capturing a greater share of the lucrative business travel market than its rivals. During that period, Pan Am moreover achieved an ultra short-haul load factor of 70% on its eight scheduled internal routes from Berlin, making the airline&#x27;s Berlin routes the most profitable in its worldwide scheduled network.

Following the completion of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the West German government introduced a route-specific subsidy of up to 20% for all internal German scheduled air services from and to West Berlin to help the airlines cope with the resulting falloff in traffic and maintain an economically viable operation on these routes. These came into effect on 1 March 1962 for all tickets sold in Germany, including Berlin. (To qualify for the subsidised rate under this system, the passenger was required to purchase a round-trip ticket for a scheduled internal German flight from/to West Berlin in Germany. Once he/she had checked-in at the airport, the airline collected a coupon attached to his/her ticket, which was subsequently handed in to the relevant German authorities for reimbursement.)

By the early 1960s, a number of UK independents and US supplementals began operating regular charter flights from Tempelhof. These carried both inbound tourists from the US, the UK and other countries as well as local outbound tourists to the emerging holiday resorts in the Mediterranean. London Gatwick-based UK independent Overseas Aviation (CI) was among the first airlines the Allied Air Attachés in Bonn licensed to operate a series of regular charter flights from West Berlin. It used Vikings and Argonauts on these services, which operated from Tempelhof under contract to the Berlin Senate and the city&#x27;s Technical University as well as Berliner Flugring, a local package tour operator that began as a consortium of 70 West Berlin travel agents arranging IT flights to holiday resorts in Europe.

By 1964, BEA operated up to 20,000 flights each year from and to Berlin. These represented approximately half of the airline&#x27;s total yearly flights to/from Germany and generated profits of £1 million per year. 1964 was also the year US supplemental Saturn Airways began operating a comprehensive inclusive tour (IT) charter flight programme from Tempelhof under contract to local package holiday consolidator Flug-Union Berlin, using Douglas DC-6A/Cs and DC-7Cs. On 2 December of that year, a Boeing 727-100 became the first jet aircraft to land at Tempelhof. Boeing had leased the aircraft to Pan Am for a special flight from Frankfurt to Berlin to demonstrate to the airline the 727&#x27;s ability to operate from Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways. Pan Am indicated its intention to place an order for six 727s for its Berlin operation, as a result of the aircraft using only half the runway during landing.

26 October 1965 marked British Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s new One-Eleven jet&#x27;s first arrival at Tempelhof when a British United 200 series operating a trooping flight under contract to the UK Ministry of Defence diverted from Gatow.

22 January 1966 marked the first appearance of a British trijet at Tempelhof when Hawker Siddeley flew in its HS 121 Trident 1E demonstrator aircraft for evaluation by BEA. A week later, on 29 January, BEA began evaluating the BAC One-Eleven&#x27;s suitability for its Berlin operations, with the start of a series of test flights conducted on its behalf by BAC&#x27;s 475 series demonstrator. This included a number of takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof to test the aircraft&#x27;s short-field performance.

On 18 March 1966, Pan Am became the first airline to commence regular, year-round jet operations from Tempelhof with the first examples of a brand-new fleet of an initial eight Boeing 727-100 series, one of the first jet aircraft with a short-field capability. These aircraft were configured in a single class featuring 128 economy seats.

Pan Am&#x27;s move put BEA at a considerable competitive disadvantage, especially on the busy Berlin–Frankfurt route where the former out-competed the latter with both modern jet planes as well as a higher flight frequency. BEA responded to Pan Am&#x27;s competitive threat by increasing the Berlin-based fleet to 13 Viscounts by winter 1966/7 to enable it to offer higher frequencies. This entailed re-configuring aircraft cabins in a lower-density seating arrangement, as a result of which the refurbished cabins featured only 53, Comet-type first-class seats in a four-abreast layout instead of 66, five-abreast economy seats. In addition, BEA sought to differentiate itself from its main competitor by providing a superior in-flight catering standard. (BEA&#x27;s &quot;Silver Star&quot; service included complimentary hot meals on all flights whereas Pan Am merely offered free on-board snacks. Sections of the local press dubbed the contrasting strategies of the two main protagonists plying the internal German routes from Berlin – estimated to be worth £15–20 million in annual revenues – the &quot;Dinner oder Düsen?&quot; (Dinner or Jet?) battle.) Henceforth, the airline marketed these services as &quot;Super Silver Star&quot;.

The introduction of Pan Am&#x27;s 727s to the Berlin market represented a major step change because of the aircraft&#x27;s ability to carry more passengers than any other contemporary aircraft type used by scheduled carriers in the short-haul Berlin market, and its ability to take off from and land on Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways with a full commercial payload as only light fuel loads were required on the short internal German services. Compared with BEA, Pan Am&#x27;s 727s carried 20% more passengers than the British carrier&#x27;s Comet 4Bs and up to times as many passengers as the latter&#x27;s Viscounts.

Within two years of Pan Am&#x27;s introduction of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68%. Despite the huge increase in capacity over the DC-6B (128 vs. 87 seats), load factors dropped during the first year of operations only. (Pan Am&#x27;s second year of jet operations from Tempelhof saw load factors steadying while the third saw a slight increase.) The lower seat density in BEA&#x27;s re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am&#x27;s new jets, which were laid out in a comparatively tight, pitch seating configuration. This resulted in BEA&#x27;s market share declining from 38% at the beginning of this period to 27% at its end. On the other hand, BEA&#x27;s reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors.

From August 1968, BEA supplemented its Tempelhof-based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners. Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof&#x27;s short runways with a restricted payload, they were not suited to the airline&#x27;s ultra short-haul operation from Berlin (average stage length: ) given the high fuel consumption of the Comet, especially when operating at the mandatory altitude inside the Allied air corridors. This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA&#x27;s Berlin fleet was equipped with 97-seat, single-class BAC One-Eleven 500s. BEA&#x27;s re-equipment of its Berlin fleet with brand-new One-Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline&#x27;s competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am&#x27;s 727s. The new One-Eleven 500, which BEA called the &quot;Super One-Eleven&quot;, operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968. It began replacing the airline&#x27;s Berlin-based Viscounts from 17 November 1968.

1968 was also the year all non-scheduled services, i.e. primarily the rapidly growing number of inclusive tour charter flights, were concentrated at Tegel to alleviate increasing congestion at Tempelhof and to make better use of Tegel, which was underutilised at the time.

Air France, West Berlin&#x27;s third scheduled carrier, which had suffered a continuous traffic decline ever since the transfer of Berlin operations to more distant Tegel at the beginning of 1960 due to Tempelhof&#x27;s operational limitations that made it unsuitable for its Caravelles, was worst affected by the equipment changes at the latter airport during the mid-to-late 1960s. Over this period, the French airline&#x27;s market share halved from 9% to less than 5% despite having withdrawn from Tegel–Düsseldorf in summer 1964 and concentrated its limited resources on Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–Munich to maximise the competitive impact on the latter two routes. To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes resulting from load factors as low as 30%, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely and instead enter into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed the latter taking over the former&#x27;s two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. It also entailed repainting the fins of the BEA One-Eleven 500s in a neutral, dark-blue scheme featuring &quot;Super One-Eleven&quot; titles instead of BEA&#x27;s &quot;Speedjack&quot; motif. The Air France-BEA joint venture became operational in spring 1969 and terminated in autumn 1972.

==== Decline and Relocation ====
Commercial air traffic from/to Berlin Tempelhof peaked in 1971 at just above million passengers (out of a total of 6.12 million passengers for all West Berlin airports during that year). This represented more than 90% of West Berlin&#x27;s commercial air traffic and made its iconic city centre airport Germany&#x27;s second-largest. With million passengers, Pan Am accounted for the bulk of this traffic while almost all of the remaining 2 million accrued to BEA. 1971 was also the year the latter&#x27;s last Berlin-based Viscount departed the city.


East Germany&#x27;s relaxation of border controls affecting all surface transport modes between West Berlin and West Germany across its territory from 1972 onwards resulted in a decline of scheduled internal German air traffic from/to West Berlin. This was further compounded by the economic downturn in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The resulting fare increases that were intended to recover the airlines&#x27; higher operating costs caused by steeply rising jet fuel prices led to a further drop in demand. This in turn resulted in a major contraction of Pan Am&#x27;s and BEA&#x27;s/British Airways&#x27;s internal German operations, necessitating a reduction in both airlines&#x27; Berlin-based fleets and workforces in an attempt to contain growing losses these once profitable routes generated by the mid-1970s.

On 1 September 1975, Pan Am and British Airways moved their entire Berlin operation to the newly built terminal at Tegel Airport. Following Pan Am&#x27;s and British Airways&#x27;s move to Tegel, commercial operations at Tempelhof ceased, resulting in exclusive use by the US military.

From 1978, Pan Am relocated its 727 flightdeck crew training from Miami International Airport to Berlin Tempelhof. This involved [re-]training all pilots and flight engineers who crewed the flight decks of the airline&#x27;s 727 fleet, which at the time operated out of Miami to the Caribbean and Central America, as well as on the IGS routes from Berlin and intra-European feeder routes serving Frankfurt and Heathrow. Another airline that used Tempelhof to train its flightdeck crews was US supplemental Modern Air Transport. While all Modern Air commercial flights from and to Berlin principally used Tegel to take advantage of that airport&#x27;s longer runways and the fact that it was not in a built-up area making for easier approaches, the airline conducted its training for Berlin-based flight deck crews at Tempelhof between 1968 and 1974. The latter was also the US supplemental&#x27;s (and other Tegel-based operators&#x27;) designated diversion airport in bad weather in the Tegel area.

==== Revival and Final Years ====
Commercial operations restarted in 1981, when US-incorporated regional airline start-up Tempelhof Airways began a corporate shuttle between Tempelhof and Paderborn under contract to former German computer manufacturer Nixdorf whose main factories and offices were located in Paderborn and West Berlin respectively. Tempelhof Airways&#x27;s initial equipment comprised Cessna Conquest and Piper Navajo executive aircraft. In 1985, the airline converted the Tempelhof–Paderborn corporate shuttle into a full-fledged scheduled service using a Nord 262 commuter turboprop.

The end of the Cold War and German reunification opened Tempelhof for non-allied air traffic on 3 October 1990. US President Bill Clinton christened a new Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport plane (serial number 96-0006) the &quot;Spirit of Berlin&quot; at Tempelhof on 12 May 1998, to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949.

Towards the end, commercial use was mostly in the form of small commuter aircraft flying regionally. Plans had been in place to shut down Tempelhof and Tegel, and make the new Brandenburg Airport the sole commercial airport for Berlin.

===Closing down air traffic===

In 1996, the mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen, Brandenburg minister-president Manfred Stolpe and the federal transport minister Wissmann established the so-called &quot;Consensus resolution&quot;. The entire planning aimed at concentrating domestic and international air traffic in Berlin and Brandenburg at one airport: Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport.

To ensure investment protection as well as to fend off opposition to Schönefeld International&#x27;s expansion, it was mandated that first Tempelhof and then Tegel must be closed. On 4 December 2007, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (&quot;Bundesverwaltungsgericht&quot;) made the final decision as court of last instance to close Tempelhof Airport.

===Referendum against closure===
An initiative for a nonbinding referendum against the closure was held and failed, after the initial number of signatures required were collected. According to the constitution of the state of Berlin, the number of supportive signatures that were required to be collected within four months in order to compel a referendum amounts to 7% of the population of Berlin entitled to vote – 169,784. After the four-month period for the collection of signatures 203,408 signatures had been lodged.

The referendum was held on 27 April 2008. All eligible voters received an information brochure along with their notification. A majority of the votes was necessary to support the referendum, but this had to be at least one quarter of all eligible Berlin voters.

The initiative for keeping Tempelhof open was supported by the &quot;Interessengemeinschaft City-Airport Tempelhof&quot; (ICAT) along with a couple of opposition parties in the Berlin city parliament: the Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party citing primarily the need for an inner-city airport for business and private flyers as well as nostalgic reasons. Representatives from the ICAT suggested keeping the airport open up until Schönefeld Airport was to be completed in about 2012. The Berlin government insisted on the closure of the airport for legal, long-term economic, and environmental reasons, in particular to ensure the expansion of Schönefeld International. Environmental groups and the Green party supported them in this.

Plans for the future would include for example a Berlin airlift museum in the old terminal building, commercial space for innovative businesses, new housing and industrial areas, sports facilities, and parks. Legally the decision in favour of closure at the end of October 2008 was irrevocable and the referendum was nonbinding. A subsequent reopening would have faced high legal barriers; but some legal experts claimed there may be means to circumvent this.

The referendum of 27 April 2008 failed. Although 60.2% of the votes cast were for keeping the airport open, this was by only 21.7% of the eligible voters; short of the 25% required. Support had been highest in western districts of Berlin (up to 80%), but opposition (only 30% approval) and disinterest was prevalent in the eastern districts. Voter turnout of 36% was low. Air traffic at Tempelhof Airport ceased for good on 30 October and the official licence expired in mid-December.

A &quot;Goodbye Tempelhof&quot; gala was held at Tempelhof airport for eight hundred invited guests in the last hours of 30 October. Meanwhile, protesters against the closing held a candle vigil in front on the Platz der Lufbrücke. The last commercial flight was a Cirrus Airlines Dornier 328 that departed at 22:17 towards Mannheim. &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot; was sung to the spectators on the apron at the conclusion. At precisely four and a half minutes before midnight, the last two airplanes – a historical Junkers Ju 52 and an airlift &quot;raisin bomber&quot; Douglas DC-3 – took off in parallel, waved their wings, and flew off south-east to Schönefeld airport. The runway and air field lights were switched off at midnight.

Three Antonov An-2 airplanes flying under VFR were left stranded at the airport, as weather conditions prevented them from taking off on 30 October. They were allowed to take off on 24 November 2008, making them the last aircraft to take off from the airport.

===Post-airport usage===
==== ABB Formula E Berlin ePrix ====
The ABB Formula E used variations of the Tempelhof Airport Street Circuit for the Berlin ePrix in 2015 and from 2017 to 2023. There are plans hold it again . In 2020 due to COVID-19, there were held 6 rounds on the circuit with rounds 1 and 2 going on the reverse layout and rounds 5 and 6 having the extended layout for the first time.

==== Public park ====

In August 2009, Berlin city officials announced that the Tempelhof outfields would be opened in May 2010 as a city park. The city planned to spend an estimated €60 million on developing the park from 2010 to 2017. On the weekend of 8/9 May 2010, the outfield was festively opened as Berlin&#x27;s largest public park named &quot;Tempelhofer Feld&quot;. More than 200,000 Berliners visited the park to enjoy its wide open spaces for recreation ranging from biking and skating to baseball and flying kites.
The opening ceremonies were slightly marred by some protesters unhappy about the fence that closed off the park during the night.

Entrance is free with park hours being from 6/7/7.30 a.m., depending on the season, until sunset. The grounds are maintained by &quot;Grün Berlin&quot;, a company that also looks after several other gated parks in Berlin. About 80% of the former airfield is an important habitat for several redlisted birds, plants and insects. Usage of the park is seasonally restricted to limit disturbance of Eurasian skylark breeding grounds.

In 2013, the Senate of Berlin introduced a plan to open the outer zones of the Tempelhof fields for construction of apartment and commercial buildings, and a new Berlin Central and Regional Library. An area of was to remain a park, but was planned to be landscaped with a rain water reservoir, a 60-meter artificial boulder, groves and other new features. Landscaping was supposed to begin in 2013 and be completed in time for Germany&#x27;s world horticultural exhibition IGA that was to be hosted in the park in 2017.

In a 2014 Referendum, Berlin&#x27;s citizens decided to preserve the entire space of the park and prohibit any kind of development by law, thus putting an end to both construction and landscaping plans.

==== Event location ====
Tempelhof has been used since its closing to host numerous fairs and events. The first major events included a fashion tradeshow in July and the Berlin Festival 2009 concert in August. Fairs were held in the hangar. In September 2010, Tempelhof hosted the Popkomm, the international world&#x27;s music and entertainment business meeting place and was one of the most important locations of the first Berlin Music Week.

The place also hosted sports events. The Berlin Marathon fair, the main event preparation to runners, was held at Tempelhof every September. The FIA Formula E Championship raced on the airport runways in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 - with the 2020 edition hosting 6 races in a nine-day period to complete the 2019/20 season. The Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters executives were also discussing with government officials about hosting a round at Tempelhof.

When Eurovision came to Germany in 2011, the airport would have been the site of the contest if Berlin was chosen as the host city. Later, Düsseldorf was chosen.
In 2022, Tempelhof was used as the site for the festival Tempelhof Sounds, a three-day music event consisting of mainly alternative, indie and rock music. There were over 30,000 visitors on each day of the festival. Shortly after the festival concluded, it was confirmed that the event would return in 2023.

==== Emergency refugee shelter ====
For some two years from September 2015, in the midst of the 2015 European migrant crisis, Tempelhof was used as an &#x27;emergency refugee shelter&#x27;, briefly holding some 2,500 people in two former hangars, before the numbers eased and the facility could gradually be wound down.

==== Creative district ====
The defunct airport is intended to be known as &quot;Berlin Creative District&quot;, similar to Meatpacking District, Manhattan or Brompton Design District in Brompton, London. For instance, the former US Army officers&#x27; hotel will be altered to be a digital innovation center for startups and creative businesses, while a new visitor center was due to open in 2019.

==Former airlines and destinations==

Most airlines moved to Tegel and Schönefeld in the years before Tempelhof closed down. When it officially closed down in 2008 there were only scheduled flights from Brussels Airlines and Cirrus Airlines still operating from there.

Berlin Tempelhof also was an important base for air taxi services with the following operators flying from/to there: AAF Aviona Air, Air Service Berlin (scheduled sightseeing flights using a historic &quot;raisin bomber&quot; Douglas DC-3), AIRSHIP Air Service, Bizair Fluggesellschaft, Business Air Charter, Heli Unionair, Jet Club Deutschland Chartermanagement, Private Wings, Rotorflug, TAG Aviation and Windrose Air.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==
On 12 June 1897, in one of the earliest recorded aircraft accidents, Friedrich Hermann Wölfert and his mechanic Robert Knabe were killed when Wölfert&#x27;s lighter than air craft &quot;Deutschland&quot; caught fire at 200 m (670 ft) and crashed at Tempelhof Field.

On 29 April 1952, an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) operating a scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG-15 fighters while passing through one of the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the plane, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport.

A subsequent inspection of the aircraft&#x27;s damage at Tempelhof revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs during the preceding air attack. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, 11 passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the air corridor at the time of attack.

On 19 January 1953, a Silver City Airways Bristol 170 Freighter Mark 21 (registration: G-AICM) operating a non-scheduled cargo flight from West Berlin crash-landed near Tempelhof Airport as a result of fuel starvation when bad weather at the destination forced it to return to Berlin. Although the accident damaged the aircraft beyond repair, both pilots survived.

In 1978, LOT Polish Airlines flight 165 was hijacked and forced to land at Tempelhof. The US military authorities who were in charge of Tempelhof during the Cold War era arrested the East German hijacker on arrival. Following the hijacker&#x27;s arrest, the US authorities returned the aircraft, its crew and those passengers who wished to resume their journey to Poland.

In 1981, a LOT Polish Airlines Antonov AN-24 operating an internal scheduled service from Katowice to Gdańsk was hijacked en route and forced to land at Tempelhof. Jerzy Dygas, the hijacker, was on military service while taking over the aircraft. He was armed with a grenade and a single-shot pistol. The US military authorities arrested the hijacker on arrival and handed him over to the local police. At that time, he was expected to be sentenced to a -year prison term under West German law. Following the hijacker&#x27;s arrest, the US authorities released the aircraft, its crew and all 50 passengers to resume their flight to Gdańsk.

On 26 June 2010, a private Socata TB 10 Tobago had to perform an emergency landing on the now closed Tempelhof Airport due to engine failure. It was on a sightseeing flight and the pilot was looking for a free space to land safely. The aircraft was occupied by the pilot and three passengers and had taken off from Tegel Airport. Upon consultation with air traffic control in Schönefeld, it was agreed to land on a Tempelhof runway. No one was injured during the emergency landing as the visitors of the now Tempelhofer Park scurried aside to make room for the TB 10, which came to a halt after a very short distance. Four days later, the Socata TB 10 Tobago was transported – with wings removed – by lorry back to Tegel airport. The Senate of Berlin now intends to prohibit sightseeing flights over Berlin by single-engine planes for safety reasons. It has been reported that the pilot had forgotten to switch over to the second fuel tank.

<text>Bedgrove is one of the housing estates of the town of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, though it takes its name from a farm and hamlet that stood in the area until the area was cleared for building in the late 1950s. At the time it was built it was the largest housing estate of its kind in the country. The housing estate is on the south side of the town. The farm (and associated cottages) was where Pevensey Close now stands.

In the 2001 census the population of Bedgrove was 9,171 people.

Also the ancient village of Caldicot was thought to be situated approximately where Caldicot Close is today, hence the name of the new road.

== Facilities ==
In the middle of Bedgrove, there are two churches, one Church of England called &quot;Church of the Holy Spirit&quot;, and one Roman Catholic Church, called &quot;Our Lady of Lourdes&quot;. There is also a Baptist church in Limes Avenue.

Bedgrove is served by Bedgrove Infant School, for children aged from three to seven, and Bedgrove Junior School, for children aged from seven to eleven. Both are foundation schools, which each take approximately 480 pupils.

On the southside of Bedgrove is Bedgrove Park, a large field with many football pitches, a community centre, a playground designed for 2-12 year olds and an all-weather pitch designed for youths to play football and netball.

In the heart of Bedgrove is Jansel Square, which consists of several take away restaurants and many shops.

There is also a Pub named &#x27;The Buckinghamshire Yeoman&#x27; in Jansel Square. 

The Arriva Shires &amp; Essex &#x27;Pink Route&#x27; service 8 to Aylesbury serves Bedgrove Monday-Saturday, at a frequency of up to every 20 minutes, which runs via Broughton. Stops on this route serve Welbeck Avenue, Cambourne Avenue, Cam Mead and Long Meadow. For a Sunday bus service, Red Rose Travel operates the 501 service from Aylesbury to Watford which serves two stops in Bedgrove, on Cam Mead and Long Meadow.

<text>Timothy John Schafer (born July 26, 1967) is an American video game designer. He founded Double Fine Productions in July 2000, after having spent over a decade at LucasArts. Schafer is best known as the designer of critically acclaimed games &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, &quot;Psychonauts&quot;, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; and &quot;Broken Age&quot;, co-designer of &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;, and assistant designer on &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. He is well known in the video game industry for his storytelling and comedic writing style, and has been given both a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Game Developers Choice Awards, and a BAFTA Fellowship for his contributions to the industry.

==Career==

===College and LucasArts (1989–2000)===
Tim Schafer was born on July 26, 1967, in Sonoma, California, the youngest of five children. His father was a doctor and his mother was a nurse. While studying computer science at UC Berkeley, Schafer became interested in writing, and took inspiration from Kurt Vonnegut, who while a publicist at General Electric wrote short stories in the evenings. Schafer opted for a similar course, interning to help develop databases for small companies while trying to position himself for an opening in a larger corporation such as Atari and Hewlett-Packard, but he was rejected by these. He saw an offering at Lucasfilm Games, looking for programmers who could also write game dialog, which piqued his interest. 

During his application process for the job, he had a somewhat disastrous phone interview with David Fox in which he mentioned being a fan of &quot;Ballblaster&quot;. Fox informed him that the Lucasfilm Games title was &quot;Ballblazer&quot;, and that only the pirated version was known as &quot;Ballblaster&quot;, but despite the misstep, Fox asked Schafer to submit his resume for further consideration. To make up for the phone interview, Schafer sent in a comic of himself applying for and getting the job at Lucasfilm Games, drawn as a text adventure.

Schafer was hired by LucasArts in 1989, and his first position was as a &quot;scummlet&quot;, a programmer who helped to implement features and ideas proposed by the lead game developers within the LucasArts SCUMM engine. He, alongside Dave Grossman, helped to playtest &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game&quot; and implement the NES version of &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. Schafer and Grossman, along with two others, were taught by Ron Gilbert as part of a &quot;SCUMM University&quot; on how to use the engine to set up rooms and puzzles. 

Later, Gilbert approached Schafer and Grossman, offering them the chance to work on his new project, which would ultimately become the pirate-themed adventure game &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;.

According to series creator Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman were responsible for about two thirds of the game&#x27;s dialogue. &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; became one of the most acclaimed games of its kind. The same team created the sequel, &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

In his first lead role on a game project, Schafer co-designed (with Dave Grossman) &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;, a time-travel comedy adventure and the sequel to Ron Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;. Schafer&#x27;s first solo project, the biker adventure &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, was released in 1995. He went on to design the highly acclaimed &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, a noir adventure game set in the Aztec afterlife featuring characters similar to the papier-mâché skeleton decorations from the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos. &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; won many awards, including GameSpot&#x27;s Game of the Year award of 1998, and Computer Adventure Game of the Year at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

===Double Fine Productions (2000–present)===

Schafer worked on an unannounced PlayStation 2 action-adventure game at LucasArts, but it never entered production. Prior to his departure, a number of other developers were leaving LucasArts as the studio shifted away from adventure games. Schafer was approached by his colleagues with the idea of leaving the company to develop PlayStation 2 games on their own; Schafer was initially wary of this believing he felt secure in his position at LucasArts. He left the company in January 2000, to found Double Fine Productions, where he created the platform game &quot;Psychonauts&quot;. The game was first released on Xbox in North America on April 19, 2005. While the game was met with critical acclaim, including a Game of the Year award from Eurogamer, it sold poorly at its initial release and led to financial troubles for its publisher Majesco Entertainment. Double Fine reacquired full rights to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; by 2012, allowing them to release the game with improvements for modern systems, and in that year, Schafer stated that &quot;We made more on &quot;Psychonauts&quot; [in 2012] than we ever have before.&quot;

On March 7, 2007, he hosted the annual Game Developers Choice Awards. He later hosted it again in 2009. To coincide, Double Fine released a free Flash minigame entitled &quot;Host Master and the Conquest of Humor&quot;, a pastiche of Schafer&#x27;s LucasArts games in which the player takes on the role of Schafer backstage at the GDC Awards.

Schafer led the development of Double Fine&#x27;s next game, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, released on October 13, 2009, after a tortuous development route due to having its original publisher Vivendi Games drop the title following its merge with Activision in 2008 to be picked up later by Electronic Arts. The game was Schafer&#x27;s tribute to the music and art of heavy metal and featured voice acting from actor/musician Jack Black and cameos from rock musicians including Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford. Schafer said &quot;For &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, I&#x27;ve always seen this overlap between medieval warfare and heavy metal. You see heavy metal singers and they&#x27;ll have like a brace around their arm and they&#x27;ll be singing about Orcs. So let&#x27;s just make a world where that all happens. That all gets put together, the heavy metal, and the rock, and the battling, actually does happen. Let&#x27;s not flirt around with this; let&#x27;s just do it.&quot;

During &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; development, Schafer had Double Fine&#x27;s staff take two weeks away from the game&#x27;s development to participate in Amnesia Fortnights once a year starting in 2007. This was an internal game jam where the company was split into four teams to make a pitchable game prototype, an idea he compared to what film director Wong Kar-Wai had used previously. After &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; release, the game had generally positive reviews but did not perform as well as expected, and Electronic Arts cancelled the preliminary work Double Fine had started on the sequel. To keep Double Fine above water financially, Schafer went back to the past Amnesia Fortnight projects and selected games they could reasonably expand into full releases. From these, four smaller games were picked up by publishers, and were the first games in Double Fine&#x27;s history to have project leaders other than Schafer: &quot;Costume Quest&quot;, &quot;Stacking&quot;, &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; and &quot;Once upon a Monster&quot;. The titles helped to keep Double Fine financially stable, and Schafer has continued to implement the Amnesia Fortnight as a yearly process; most of the games that result from these are led by someone other than Schafer.

On February 1, 2012, Schafer returned to the role of director in the Kinect-based &quot;Double Fine Happy Action Theater&quot;, a game concept he devised based on &quot;Once Upon a Monster&quot; to be able to play a game with his two-year-old daughter that she would be able to enjoy as well.
In February 2012, Schafer launched a crowdfunded project for an unnamed adventure game via the crowd-sourced Kickstarter, using the placeholder title &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot;; Schafer stated that he had found publishers extremely wary of an adventure in the current video game industry, and decided to turn to crowdfunding to seek player interest. The game and accompanying documentary were projected to cost . Contributions exceeded that amount by more than three times in less than 24 hours, making it the first Kickstarter project to reach a $2 million figure, and the second most successful project on the website at the time. When the project ended on March 13, funding reached a level of $3,336,371 in Kickstarter with an additional $110,000 from premium pledges. Ultimately, the project culminated in &quot;Broken Age&quot;, released in two acts over 2014 and 2015.

Schafer and Double Fine had been able to negotiate with The Walt Disney Company, who acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, to obtain the rights to three of the titles that Schafer had directed there: &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;, &quot;Full Throttle&quot;, and &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, by 2014. Double Fine subsequently released remastered versions of all three games over the following years.
Schafer stood in support of Anita Sarkeesian and other game developers that were being harassed by supporters of Gamergate, a loosely organized misogynistic online harassment campaign and a right-wing backlash against feminism, that started in August 2014. 

Schafer hosted the 2015 Game Developer’s Choice Awards on March 5; during the event one of his jokes referenced the #NotYourShield tag connected to the harassment Campaign. Gamergate supporters claimed #NotYourShield was used to demonstrate women and minorities supported their cause, but Schafer&#x27;s remarks spoke to the wider assessment that the tag&#x27;s use was largely composed of sockpuppets, which was later proven to be true. Following the event, Gamergate supporters targeted Schafer for harassment by claiming he had been making a joke that mocked the minorities using this hashtag. 

Gamergate supporters also found other opportunities to target Schafer for harassment, including a decision to expand the scope of &quot;Broken Age&quot; after its Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign raised far more than the amount asked for, and a later decision to seek additional funding for the studio by offering the game&#x27;s first half for sale on early access. Since then he continues to be an occasional target of harassment from either GamerGate supporters or those who were swayed by the campaign&#x27;s claims.

Schafer joined with other industry leaders with crowdfunding experience to help create the crowdfunding platform Fig in August 2015, serving on its advisory board until March 2020. Through Fig, Schafer announced the sequel &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot; in December 2015.

In June 2019, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Double Fine as part of Xbox Game Studios. Schafer stated that while he had not been looking to be acquired, he found the opportunity in his talks with Microsoft to be promising; the acquisition would not affect Double Fine&#x27;s independence and would still allow the company to publish its pending titles on its own choice of platforms, and would provide the financial security needed for Double Fine to be able to concentrate on developing a quality product. Through this support, Double Fine was able to retain several gameplay elements within &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;, which was eventually released on August 25, 2021, to critical praise.

==Influences and philosophy==
In an interview at the Game Developers Conference in 2003, Schafer stated that he strives for integrating story into the gameplay, setting a creative goal of someday creating a video game without any cutscenes at all. Furthermore, he said he often sets a story in an established world:

&quot;[O]ften, the world is the initial inspiration for the game. One day I was listening to someone tell me their stories of spending the summer in Alaska. They had hung around this one biker bar, with these people with names like Smilin&#x27; Rick and Big Phil. And I thought, &#x27;Wow, what a crazy world that is.&#x27; It&#x27;s so apart from everybody&#x27;s life, and yet it&#x27;s right there, it&#x27;s so mundane in a way. And that&#x27;s where Full Throttle came from.&quot;

==Recognition==
The press first previewed &quot;Psychonauts&quot; at the E3 trade show in 2002, where it won the Game Critics Award for Best Original Game.
An hour-long episode of &quot;Icons&quot; on the G4 Network documented the last week of the production of &quot;Psychonauts&quot; and explored Schafer&#x27;s career. At the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards, Schafer and Erik Wolpaw won the award for Best Writing for &quot;Psychonauts&quot;. Schafer and Double Fine Executive Producer &amp; COO Caroline Esmurdoc also won the award for Best New Studio. In October 2006, Schafer received a BAFTA video game Best Screenplay award for &quot;Psychonauts&quot;. In 2012, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) organized the &quot;Game Masters&quot; exhibition, where Schafer was featured as the creator of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, among a few other visionary designers, credited for having &quot;pushed the boundaries of game design and storytelling, introducing new genres, creating our best-loved characters and revolutionising the way we understand and play games&quot; In 2015, he won the Vanguard Award at Bilbao&#x27;s Fun &amp; Serious Game Festival. Schafer received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Game Developers Choice Awards in March 2018. He received a BAFTA Fellowship as &quot;a true pioneer of game design, who has pushed the boundaries of the medium through his extraordinary talents&quot; at the British Academy Games Awards in April 2018. In February 2023, Schafer was recognized as &quot;a beacon of creativity and innovation in the games industry&quot; by being selected as a Hall of Fame Inductee at the 26th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

<doc id="271860" wikidata="Q457239" url="?curid=271860" title="Petroleum jelly">
<text>Petroleum jelly, petrolatum (), white petrolatum, soft paraffin, or multi-hydrocarbon, CAS number 8009-03-8, is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons (with carbon numbers mainly higher than 25), originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. Vaseline has been an American brand of petroleum jelly since 1870.

After petroleum jelly became a medicine-chest staple, consumers began to use it for cosmetic purposes and for many ailments including toenail fungus, genital rashes (non-STI), nosebleeds, diaper rash, and common colds. Its folkloric medicinal value as a &quot;cure-all&quot; has since been limited by a better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses. It is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an approved over-the-counter (OTC) skin protectant and remains widely used in cosmetic skin care, where it is often loosely referred to as mineral oil.

== History ==

Marco Polo in 1273 described the oil exportation of Baku oil by hundreds of camels and ships for burning and as an ointment for treating mange.

Native Americans discovered the use of petroleum jelly for protecting and healing skin. Sophisticated oil pits had been built as early as 1415–1450 in Western Pennsylvania. In 1859, workers operating the United States&#x27;s first oil rigs noticed a paraffin-like material forming on rigs in the course of investigating malfunctions. Believing the substance hastened healing, the workers used the jelly on cuts and burns. 

Robert Chesebrough, a young chemist whose previous work of distilling fuel from the oil of sperm whales had been rendered obsolete by petroleum, went to Titusville, Pennsylvania, to see what new materials had commercial potential. Chesebrough took the unrefined green-to-gold-colored &quot;rod wax&quot;, as the drillers called it, back to his laboratory to refine it and explore potential uses. He discovered that by distilling the lighter, thinner oil products from the rod wax, he could create a light-colored gel. Chesebrough patented the process of making petroleum jelly by in 1872. The process involved vacuum distillation of the crude material followed by filtration of the still residue through bone char. Chesebrough traveled around New York demonstrating the product to encourage sales by burning his skin with acid or an open flame, then spreading the ointment on his injuries and showing his past injuries healed, he said, by his miracle product. He opened his first factory in 1870 in Brooklyn using the name Vaseline.

== Physical properties ==
Petroleum jelly is a mixture of hydrocarbons, with a melting point that depends on the exact proportions. The melting point is typically between . It is flammable only when heated to liquid; then the fumes will light, not the liquid itself, so a wick material is needed to ignite petroleum jelly. It is colorless (or of a pale yellow color when not highly distilled), translucent, and devoid of taste and smell when pure. It does not oxidize on exposure to the air and is not readily acted on by chemical reagents. It is insoluble in water. It is soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide and turpentine. Petroleum jelly is slightly soluble in alcohol. It acts as a plasticizer on polypropylene (PP), but is compatible with a wide range of materials and chemicals. It is a semi-solid, in that it holds its shape indefinitely like a solid, but it can be forced to take the shape of its container without breaking apart, like a liquid, though it does not flow on its own. At room temperature, it has 20.9% solid fat content. Its partially crystalline stacks of lamellar sheets, which immobilize the liquid portion, make up its microstructure. In general, only 7–13% of it is made up of high molecular weight paraffins, 30–45% of smaller paraffins, and 48–60% of small paraffins.

Depending on the specific application of petroleum jelly, it may be USP, B.P., or Ph. Eur. grade. This pertains to the processing and handling of the petroleum jelly so it is suitable for medicinal and personal-care applications.

== Uses ==
Petroleum jelly has lubricating and coating properties, including use on dry lips and dry skin. Below are some examples of the uses of petroleum jelly.

=== Medical treatment ===
Vaseline brand First Aid Petroleum Jelly, or &quot;carbolated petroleum jelly&quot; containing phenol to give the jelly additional antibacterial effect, has been discontinued.

During World War II, a variety of petroleum jelly called &quot;red veterinary petrolatum&quot;, or Red Vet Pet for short, was often included in life raft survival kits. Acting as a sunscreen, it provides protection against ultraviolet rays.

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends keeping skin injuries moist with petroleum jelly to reduce scarring. A verified medicinal use is to protect and prevent moisture loss of the skin of a patient in the initial post-operative period following laser skin resurfacing.

Petroleum jelly is used extensively by otorhinolaryngologists—ear, nose, and throat doctors—for nasal moisture and epistaxis treatment, and to combat nasal crusting. Large studies have found petroleum jelly applied to the nose for short durations to have no significant side effects.

Historically, it was also consumed for internal use and even promoted as &quot;Vaseline confection&quot;.

=== Skin and hair care ===
Most petroleum jelly today is used as an ingredient in skin lotions and cosmetics, providing various types of skin care and protection by minimizing friction or reducing moisture loss, or by functioning as a grooming aid (e.g., pomade). It is also used for treating dry scalp and dandruff. Although long known as just an occlusive, recent studies show that it is actually able to penetrate into the stratum corneum and helps in better absorption of other cosmetic products. Applying a significant amount of petroleum jelly onto one&#x27;s face before bed is known as &quot;slugging&quot;. 

==== Preventing moisture loss ====
By reducing the loss of moisture via transepidermal water loss, petroleum jelly can prevent chapped hands and lips, and soften nail cuticles.

This property is exploited to provide heat insulation: petroleum jelly can be used to keep swimmers warm in water when training, or during channel crossings or long ocean swims. It can prevent chilling of the face due to evaporation of skin moisture during cold weather outdoor sports.

==== Hair grooming ====
In the first part of the twentieth century, petroleum jelly, either pure or as an ingredient, was also popular as a hair pomade. When used in a 50/50 mixture with pure beeswax, it makes an effective moustache wax.

==== Skin lubrication ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to reduce the friction between skin and clothing during various sport activities, for example to prevent chafing of the seat region of cyclists, or the nipples of long distance runners wearing loose T-shirts, and is commonly used in the groin area of wrestlers and footballers.

Petroleum jelly is commonly used as a personal lubricant, because it does not dry out like water-based lubricants, and has a distinctive &quot;feel&quot;, different from that of K-Y and related methylcellulose products. However, it is not recommended for use with latex condoms during sexual activity, as it increases the chance of rupture. In addition, petroleum jelly is difficult for the body to break down naturally, and may cause vaginal health problems when used for intercourse.

=== Product care and protection ===

==== Coating ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to coat corrosion-prone items such as metallic trinkets, non-stainless steel blades, and gun barrels prior to storage as it serves as an excellent and inexpensive water repellent. It is used as an environmentally friendly underwater antifouling coating for motor boats and sailing yachts. It was recommended in the Porsche owner&#x27;s manual as a preservative for light alloy (alleny) anodized Fuchs wheels to protect them against corrosion from road salts and brake dust.

==== Finishing ====
It can be used to finish and protect wood, much like a mineral oil finish. It is used to condition and protect smooth leather products like bicycle saddles, boots, motorcycle clothing, and used to put a shine on patent leather shoes (when applied in a thin coat and then gently buffed off).

==== Lubrication ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to lubricate zippers and slide rules. It was also recommended by Porsche in maintenance training documentation for lubrication (after cleaning) of &quot;Weatherstrips on Doors, Hood, Tailgate, Sun Roof&quot;. It is used in bullet lubricant compounds.

=== Industrial production processes ===
Petroleum jelly is a useful material when incorporated into candle wax formulas. It softens the overall blend, allows the candle to incorporate additional fragrance oil, and facilitates adhesion to the sidewall of the glass. Petroleum jelly is used to moisten nondrying modelling clay such as plasticine, as part of a mix of hydrocarbons including those with greater (paraffin wax) and lesser (mineral oil) molecular weights. It is used as a tack reducer additive to printing inks to reduce paper lint &quot;picking&quot; from uncalendered paper stocks. It can be used as a release agent for plaster molds and castings. It is used in the leather industry as a waterproofing cream.

===Other===
====Explosives====
Petroleum jelly can be mixed with a high proportion of strong inorganic chlorates due to it acting as a plasticizer and a fuel source. An example of this is Cheddite C which consists of a ratio of 9:1, KClO3 to petroleum jelly. This mixture is unable to detonate without the use of a blasting cap. It is also used as a stabiliser in the manufacture of the propellant Cordite.

==== Mechanical, barrier functions ====
Petroleum jelly can be used to fill copper or fibre-optic cables using plastic insulation to prevent the ingress of water, see icky-pick. 

Petroleum jelly can be used to coat the inner walls of terrariums to prevent animals from crawling out to escape.

A stripe of petroleum jelly can be used to prevent the spread of a liquid (retain or confine a liquid to a specific area). For example, it can be applied close to the hairline when using a home hair dye kit to prevent the hair dye from irritating or staining the skin. It is also used to prevent diaper rash.

Petroleum jelly is sometimes used to protect the terminals on batteries. However, automobiles batteries require a silicone-based battery grease because it is less likely to melt and thus offers better protection.

==== Surface cleansing ====
Petroleum jelly is used to gently clean a variety of surfaces, ranging from makeup removal from faces to tar stain removal from leather.

==== Pet care ====
Petroleum jelly is used to moisturize the paws of dogs. It is a common ingredient in hairball remedies for domestic cats.

==== Sports ====
Some goalkeepers in association football put petroleum jelly on their gloves to make them stickier.

== Health ==
Petroleum jelly contains mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH). Many MOAH, mainly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are considered carcinogenic. The content of both MOAH and PAH in petroleum jelly products varies. The EU limits PAH content in cosmetics to 0.005%. The risks of PAH exposure through cosmetics have not been comprehensively studied, but food products with low levels (&lt;3%) are not considered carcinogenic (by the EU).

A 2012 scientific opinion by the European Food Safety Authority stated that mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and polyaromatics were potentially carcinogenic and may present a health risk.

In 2015, German consumer watchdog Stiftung Warentest analyzed cosmetics containing mineral oils, finding significant concentrations of MOAH and polyaromatics in products containing mineral oils. Vaseline products contained the most MOAH of all tested cosmetics (up to 9%). Based on the 2015 results, Stiftung Warentest warned consumers not to use Vaseline or any product that is based on mineral oils for lip care.

A study published in 2017 found levels of MOAH levels to be up to 1% in petroleum jelly and likewise to be less than 1% in petroleum jelly-based beauty products.

<text>Stoke Mandeville is a village and civil parish in the Vale of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located three miles (5 km) from Aylesbury and 3.4 miles (5.5 km) from the market town of Wendover. Although a separate civil parish, the village falls within the Aylesbury Urban Area. According to the Census Report the area of this parish is .

Stoke Mandeville Hospital, although named after the village, is located in Aylesbury. The hospital has the largest spinal injuries ward in Europe, and is best known internationally as the birthplace of the Paralympic movement; the Stoke Mandeville Games, instituted at the hospital by Sir Ludwig Guttmann in 1948 evolved to become the first Paralympic Games in Rome in 1960, which were also the 9th Stoke Mandeville Games. Stoke Mandeville hospital and stadium were also joint host of the 1984 Summer Paralympics with New York, with the wheelchair elements of the Games being held at the hospital and stadium.

Stoke Mandeville Stadium, although in Aylesbury, gave its name to the Paralympic Games mascot, Mandeville, in 2012.

==History==

The village was originally recorded as &quot;Stoches&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, from the Old English word &quot;stoc&quot; meaning an outlying farm or hamlet. The suffix Mandeville was first recorded in 1284 when the manor was listed as being in the hands of the powerful Norman de Mandeville family.

The former medieval parish church, St Mary the Virgin, unusually stood alone on a damp site 1 km from the old village for no apparent reason. Therefore, it had been postulated that a Roman mausoleum was present on the site before the church was built. The church was condemned in the mid-20th century and was demolished in January 1966 by the Royal Engineers. In 2018 in preparation for the construction of the HS2 high-speed railway, archaeological excavations began on the site of the old church. As well as excavating the church, the process involved moving the remains of those buried in the churchyard, which dates back to 1080. In September 2021, archaeologists from LP-Archaeology, led by Rachel Wood, announced the discovery of remains on the site of the church. They unearthed a possible square foundation trench enclosed by a circular ditch containing burials and two remarkable Roman statues. In January 2022 the archaeological excavation of the site, and the discovery of significant Roman statuary and burial urns, was featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Digging for Britain&quot;.

The newer red brick parish church of St Mary, consecrated in July 1866 by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, remains as the only church in the village apart from the Methodist church in Eskdale Road.

On 13 May 2000, the new Stoke Mandeville Millennium village sign was unveiled. It stands on a small brick plinth on the green outside the primary school. The sign shows colourful images on both sides of aspects of village life over the centuries.

==Transport==
Stoke Mandeville railway station is on the London to Aylesbury Line between Aylesbury station and Wendover station, served by Chiltern Railways, which terminates at Aylesbury Vale Parkway northbound and London Marylebone southbound. Arriva Shires &amp; Essex number 50 bus also serves the area on Station Road, as do services 130 and X9/X90 – which stop in the centre of the village. High Speed 2 passes to the southwest of the village, but doesn&#x27;t stop.

<doc id="271870" wikidata="Q5211285" url="?curid=271870" title="Dallas Chaparrals">
<text>The Dallas Chaparrals were a charter member of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The team moved to San Antonio, Texas, for the 1973–74 season and were renamed the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs joined the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the 1976–77 NBA season as a result of being one of four chosen ABA teams to be absorbed by the elder league following the completion of the ABA–NBA merger.

==Origin==
The team&#x27;s founding owners, unable to agree on a name for the franchise during an early organizational meeting at the Sheraton Dallas Hotel, named it for the Chaparral Club in which they were meeting at. The primary owner, Robert Folsom, was later the mayor of the City of Dallas. Minority owner, William Cothrum, was later Deputy Mayor Pro Tem of the City of Dallas. The team drew poor attendance and general disinterest in Dallas. They were lucky to attract crowds in the hundreds. During the 1970–71 season, the team became the Texas Chaparrals and an attempt was made to make the team a regional one, playing games in Fort Worth, at the Tarrant County Coliseum, as well as Lubbock, at the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum, but this proved a failure and the team returned full-time to Dallas in time for the 1971–72 season, splitting their games at Moody Coliseum and Dallas Convention Center Arena.

==Decline and the move==
After missing the playoffs for the first time in their existence in the 1972–73 season, the team was put up for sale. After no credible offers surfaced, the team&#x27;s original owners leased it to a group of 35 San Antonio businessmen, led by Angelo Drossos and Red McCombs. The deal included a three-year option to buy the team outright, after which it would revert to the Dallas group. The Drossos-McCombs group moved the team to San Antonio for the 1973–74 season and renamed them the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio embraced its new team with open arms; the Spurs surpassed the Chaparrals&#x27; entire 1972–73 attendance in only 16 games. Realizing they had a runaway hit on their hands, Drossos and McCombs tore up the lease and completed the purchase after only one year, and the franchise has stayed in San Antonio to this day. However, Dallas would get its own NBA franchise in the form of the expansion Mavericks, who began play in the 1980-81 season.

<doc id="271871" wikidata="Q1091544" url="?curid=271871" title="Great and Little Kimble cum Marsh">
<text>Great and Little Kimble cum Marsh is a civil parish in central Buckinghamshire, England. It is located to the south of Aylesbury. The civil parish altogether holds the ancient ecclesiastical villages of Great Kimble, Little Kimble, Kimblewick and Marsh, and an area within Great Kimble called Smokey Row. The two separate parishes with the same name were amalgamated in 1885, but kept their separate churches, St Nicholas for Great Kimble on one part of the hillside and All Saints for Little Kimble on other side at the foot of the hill.

They fall within the Hundred of Stone, which was originally one of the Three Hundreds of Aylesbury, later amalgamated into the Aylesbury Hundred. The parishes lie between Monks Risborough and Ellesborough and, like other parishes on the north side of the Chilterns, their topography are that of long and narrow strip parishes, including a section of the scarp and extending into the vale below. In length the combined parish extends for about from near the Bishopstone Road beyond Marsh to the far end of Pulpit Wood near the road from Great Missenden to Chequers but it is only a mile wide at the widest point. The village of Great Kimble lies about south of Aylesbury and about north east from Princes Risborough on the A4010 road.

The parishes of Kimble have first and foremost been a farming community for nearly two thousand years and are something of a historical interest dating back chronologically to Celtic Ages. At the summit of Pulpit Hill in Great Kimble there is a prehistoric Hillfort. When Britain was taken over by Roman occupation a Roman villa was erected in Little Kimble and near St Nicholas&#x27;s church is a tumulus or a burial mound commonly known as &#x27;Dial Hill&#x27; from the same period. After the Norman Conquest of England the parishes were most likely considered too small for a stone fort, so they would have probably kept a motte and bailey castle that later developed into a moated site for a medieval dwellinghouse.

It was here that John Hampden refused to pay his ship-money in 1635, one of the incidents which led to the English Civil War.

The majority of the land surrounding the village and some local amenities such as the pub and the petrol station were once owned by the Russel family until they were lost many years ago to excessive gambling.

==Origin and Toponym of Kimble==
The exact origin of the name is unknown though there have been many competing theories.

The name &#x27;Kimble&#x27; is said to have been first established around Anglo-Saxon times when it appeared with the name &#x27;Cyne Belle&#x27;, which corresponds to two Anglo-Saxon words. &#x27;Cyne&#x27; (meaning royal) and &#x27;Belle&#x27; (meaning &#x27;bell&#x27;) though the exact reason for calling the place &#x27;Cyne Belle&#x27; is not certain. The original theory was that the name &#x27;Cyne Belle&#x27; originated from the Celtic leader Cunobeline though this has never been proved chronologically. The modern name Cymbeline originates from Shakespeare&#x27;s play, his proper-spelt name at the time Cunobeline (Cunobelinus in Latin by the Romans) was King of the Celtic &#x27;Cassivellauni&#x27; tribe from about 4 BC to about 41 AD. Cunobeline is most likely known to have owned the hillfort on Pulpit Hill. His tribe occupied part of southern Britain at that time, which was about 800 years before the Anglo-Saxon name &#x27;Cyne Belle&#x27; first appeared, with 400 years of Roman occupation and several invasions from Europe in the intervening period.

Mawer and Stenton, who published their book on the Place Names of Buckinghamshire in 1925, thought that &#x27;belle&#x27; could have meant a hill and suggested that the conspicuous hill at Kimble (now known as Cymbeline&#x27;s Castle or Cymbeline&#x27;s Hill) would have impressed itself on the minds of the first settlers and might have called it &#x27;royal&#x27; (or given it royal status) for being the largest visible hill in the locality, or that it earned the epithet by reason of some royal burial or other unknown event. However the possibility of a &#x27;royal burial&#x27; could have been that of Cunobeline&#x27;s son Togodumnus who was a short-lived leader before the Roman Campaign, which by local legends has it, died at a battle in Kimble and might&#x27;ve been buried here.

The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, first published in 1951, interpreted the name as &quot;Royal bell-shaped hill&quot; and the later Oxford Companion to Names (2002) also gives the same meaning. The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place Names (2004) gives the translation &quot;Royal Bell, the bell-shaped hill&quot; and says that it is derived from the Old English &quot;cyne&quot; + &quot;belle&quot;, probably used as a place-name, and that the reference is to the prominent Pulpit Hill crowned with its hillfort, suggesting that &#x27;royal&#x27; referred to Great Kimble for distinction from Little Kimble.

Not all these explanations are completely convincing and there may be more to be said. The precise nature of the Royal Bell in the minds of the inhabitants of Kimble in the 9th century or earlier remains something of a mystery. It must be remembered that Pulpit Hill (or part of it) might then have been unwooded open grassland, which would have made the shape of the hill more apparent from below and the hillfort on the summit (already a thousand years old) would in that case have been clearly visible and impressive and might well have been thought to be a royal castle.

==Prehistoric Hillfort on Pulpit Hill==
This hillfort is in Pulpit Wood on the summit of Pulpit Hill in Great Kimble, about 3/4 of a mile south-east of St Nicholas&#x27; church. It is above ordnance datum. It has never been excavated and its precise date is unknown, though almost certainly built during the 1st millennium B.C. Hillforts are usually attributed to the Iron Age, but there are a series of hillforts at intervals along the Chiltern ridge and that at Ivinghoe Beacon, which is not far away, has been excavated and found to have been built in the late Bronze Age.

The Pulpit Hill fort follows the contours at the top of the hill and has an area of . The boundary is roughly D-shaped (nearly square) with maximum internal dimensions of . There are still double ramparts and ditches on the North and South East sides, but on the North and South West sides, face very steep slopes down the hill. The outer rampart is hardly apparent and there is no sign of an outer ditch. The builders seem to have relied on the steep natural slopes on these sides, though the original ditches may have been eroded away. The entrance is on the South East side, where the ground is level. The ramparts remain imposing after (probably) about 2,500 years. Although now mere banks of earth, they would originally been revetted with timber and boxed in, so that the faces would have been vertical.

The fort, though in a commanding location, was probably not primarily intended as a fortress in time of war. With its deep embedded location in Pulpit Wood, it is likely to have been either a hunting lodge or a place for storing agricultural produce and used to store grain and to enclose animals from farms in the district (perhaps as protection from cattle raids), as well as being a defensible site if and when the need arose.

There is also evidence that hillforts were used for ritual activities, possibly for religious purposes connected with agriculture. In similar terrain further south of Kimble appears Whiteleaf Cross which has been referenced as a phallic symbol.

==Roman Villa and burial mound==
At Little Kimble on the east side of the church are indications of the site of a Roman villa. Foundations, wall plaster, tesselated floors, tiles, coins and pottery have been found there over the past two hundred years, but it has never been properly excavated in modern times.

It would have been the dwelling of a substantial landowner, farming a fair-sized estate, probably surrounded by the principal farm buildings. Villas are more common on the south side of the Chilterns, but there are 7 or 8 along the north side below the scarp of which this is one. The reason for this was because back in the Mediterranean climate having a dwelling within the shadow of a hillside could be comfortable in the hot summer weather. (There was another villa built on the north side at Saunderton). Surplus produce would have been sold at Verulamium (St Albans).

A barrow or funeral mound lies on the west side of Great Kimble church of St Nicholas, adjoining the churchyard and fronting on Church Lane. It is known as Dial Hill (from the sundial formerly erected above it) and is believed to date from the Roman period, but has not been properly excavated. Although there were limited amateur investigations in 1887 and 1950. It is scheduled as an ancient monument by English Heritage and their description suggests that it might have held the body of the occupant of the Roman villa.

==Medieval and later times==
===Norman Conquest and Domesday Book===
Before the Norman conquest of England in 1066 both Great Kimble and Little Kimble were owned by royal Thegns, Sired at Great Kimble and Brictric at Little Kimble. Both were dispossessed by the new king, William of Normandy.

Great Kimble (Chenebelle in Domesday Book) was given to Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville in Normandy, who received a total of 107 lordships of land in England, 48 of them in Buckinghamshire. He passed Great Kimble to one of his own followers, sub-granting it to Hugh of Bolbec (a town in Normandy near the mouth of the Seine). Little Kimble (Chenebelle parva) went to Thurston son of Rolf, who sub-granted it to one Albert.

Great Kimble was assessed for taxation at 20 hides, while Little Kimble answered for only 10 hides. The information given in Domesday Book is summarised below. (Numbers of people refer only to the heads of families).

===Motte and Bailey Castle===
Behind the church at Little Kimble to the east are mounds and banks in the grass which are all that remain of a motte and bailey castle, which would have been built at the order of the Normans soon after the conquest. These timber castles were built all over England and consisted of a high mound (the Motte), surmounted by a wooden tower, with subsidiary buildings surrounded by a rampart with palisades (the Bailey). At Little Kimble there was a motte, which is still 15 feet high, and two separate baileys, but the layout is not easy to recognise on the ground.

Unlike large stone castles, which were built later at strategic points, these wooden forts were built for the local purposes of the manor rather than for military reasons. The Norman landholder, who was surrounded by hostile Englishmen, wanted a safe residence for himself.

===Later Manorial history===
The later manorial history of Great Kimble is complicated because various sub-manors were created (known as Whitinghams Manor (or Fenels Grove), Uptons Manor and Marshals) and they each descended in different lines. By the 17th century they had come together again and the manor of Great Kimble was held by the Hampdens of Great Hampden and later sold, in 1730, to Sarah Dowager Duchess of Marlborough. Her successors sold it in 1803 to Scrope Bernard (later Sir Scrope Bernard-Morland, a Baronet), who had been lord of the manor of Little Kimble since 1792, He held both manors until his death in 1830 and they were then sold to Robert Greenhill Russell (created a Baronet in 1831). He lived at Chequers Court and already owned the neighbouring manor of Ellesborough in succession to Sir George Russell. The memory of Scrope Bernard and Sir George Russell was preserved in the names of two public houses, the §s at Great Kimble (now closed) and the Russell Arms at Butlers Cross in Ellesborough.

==Churches==
===St Nicholas Church, Great Kimble===
This church in the 12th century probably consisted only of a nave without aisles and a small chancel. In the middle of the 13th century the north and south aisles were added with the nave arcades and the nave may have been lengthened by one bay. In the first half of the 14th century the chancel arch was added and the chancel rebuilt. The west tower and clerestorey were added later in that century. The nave was re-roofed in the 16th century.

The font (late 12th century) is a finely carved example of the local &quot;Aylesbury&quot; type.

The church was completely restored by J.P. Seddon in 1876–81. All the flint and stone exterior is of that date and the chancel and its aisles were rebuilt. A modern roof was built over the 16th century nave roof.

===All Saints Church, Little Kimble===
A church with chancel and nave existed before the mid-13th century, when the chancel was widened and the chancel arch inserted. The larger window and lowside window in the north wall of the chancel are early 14th century. The north and south porches and the doors and windows of the nave date from the early to mid 14th century.

There is a simple font of the late12th or early 13th century and in the chancel are 13th century medieval tiles of Chertsey Abbey type (possibly obtained from the ruins of Chertsey Abbey).

The interior is decorated with the remains of early 14th century wall paintings, most of which appear to have represented saints (the church is dedicated to All Saints). They include St Francis preaching to the birds and a large figure of St George, but not all can be identified. There seems to have been a doom on the west wall, where a devil is pushing two women into the mouth of Hell.

===Free Church===
There is a small chapel in the Tudor style, built in 1922, to the west of the railway bridge at Little Kimble.

St Faiths in Marsh was a small chapel and reading room. It was deconsecrated and became a private house in the twentieth century

=== Public Houses ===
The Swan in Great Kimble is the only surviving public house. The Prince of Wales, a thatched 1880&#x27;s pub in Marsh, is in its original Grade II listed form, but currently closed. Mr Horace King was the last active landlord from 1964 to 2015.

Great Kimble previously had the Bernard Arms known for its connections to Chequers, the Prime Minister&#x27;s country house nearby. It was the oldest public house in the parish, originally called the &quot;Bear and Cross&quot;. It hosted Harold Wilson, John Major and Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President amongst other prominent visitors.

The Crown was on the Aylesbury Road, just beyond the railway bridge at Clanking. After a period as the Kimble Tandoori, it was demolished to make way for residential properties.

The Old Queens Head in Marsh suffered a similar fate.

==John Hampden and Ship-money==
Great Kimble has a special claim to fame as the parish where John Hampden refused to pay his ship-money in January 1635/6. King Charles I, attempting to govern the country without a parliament, needed money to improve the navy and tried to raise it by levying &quot;ship-money&quot; from all the counties of England. Although the writ requiring the payments was worded as imposing an obligation on each county to provide a ship, in fact the money raised went straight to the treasurer of the Navy and was seen as being a tax. It was a long established principle of the constitution that no tax could be raised by the king without the consent of parliament.

Each county had to raise a stated sum which was then divided between all the parishes in the county. Each parish appointed two Assessors to divide this liability between the individual landowners. John Hampden, who owned land in several parishes in Buckinghamshire, was assessed to £8.4s in his own parish of Great Hampden and he paid this and other assessments in full, showing that he was not objecting to the amount nor rejecting an obligation to defend his country. But in two parishes, where he owned less land, he refused payment on the point of principle and others followed his example. The two parishes where he refused payment were Great Kimble, where he was assessed to pay £1.11s.6d, and Stoke Mandeville, where his liability was £1.

The Assessors for Great Kimble were required to prepare a list of persons failing to pay and this was issued at Great Kimble on 25 January 1635/6. At the head of the list is &#x27;John Hampden 31s.6d.&#x27; followed by thirty other names assessed for smaller amounts including the two Assessors themselves and the two parish constables responsible to collect the money.

People throughout the country were refusing payment and the king decided to select one man to be sued in a test case before all the judges in the Court of Exchequer Chamber. He selected John Hampden as the defendant in respect of the round sum of one pound assessed upon him at Stoke Mandeville. (The case did not mention the Great Kimble assessment). Judgment was given for the King but only by a majority decision of seven judges to five, which was seen throughout the country as a moral defeat for the King and was followed by more refusals to pay.

Although the case referred only to Stoke Mandeville, Thomas Carlyle made Great Kimble famous with his description of what had happened, &quot;there, in the cold weather, at the foot of the Chiltern Hills.&quot;

== Education ==
Griffin House School, formerly Ladymede School, an independent co-educational school, is located in Little Kimble. It has a capacity of just over 100 day students from ages 3–11.

=== Notable pupils of Ladymede School ===
* Arabella Churchill
* India Hicks
* Kelly LeBrock

==Notable people==
*Jerome Horsey

== Transport ==
The main A4010 road runs through Great and Little Kimble cum Marsh, as does the Chiltern railway line between Aylesbury and Princes Risborough. Where the main road meets the railway is Little Kimble railway station, which has been in operation since 1872, although the station buildings are now a private dwelling. There is a level crossing at Marsh.

<text>The New York/New Jersey Hitmen were an American football team based in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Hitmen were the members of the Eastern Division of the XFL. The team played their home games in Giants Stadium of the Meadowlands Sports Complex.

== History ==

The team&#x27;s general manager was former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, and New Jersey native, Drew Pearson.

The Hitmen were part of the Eastern Division with the Birmingham Thunderbolts, Orlando Rage and Chicago Enforcers. They finished in 3rd place with a 4-6 record. The head coach was former NFL assistant Rusty Tillman, who was not a fan of the league&#x27;s gimmicks or personalities – specifically commentator Jesse Ventura, who called him &quot;Gutless Rusty&quot; on a regular basis, as he felt that Tillman&#x27;s coaching style was too timid. Tillman, ever the professional, brushed off the jabs by Ventura and refused to respond. In the end, Ventura&#x27;s attempts to goad him failed.

The Hitmen were one of the teams to play in the XFL&#x27;s inaugural game. Tens of millions of viewers watched the Hitmen, who displayed a stunning lack of competence against the Las Vegas Outlaws in the contest (including a particularly ugly missed field goal and numerous miscues from starting quarterback and New York native Charles Puleri), lose 19–0. The Hitmen&#x27;s poor performance in that game was a major factor in fan backlash against the league in the weeks that followed and a prime example of the league&#x27;s failure to live up to expectations; the team benched Puleri in favor of Wally Richardson by Week 3 in hopes of salvaging the season.

The Hitmen&#x27;s average attendance of roughly 28,000 fans per game was second-highest in the league, behind only the San Francisco Demons.

=== Revival ===

In December 2018, a revival of the XFL announced its intent to return to East Rutherford. The new team was named the New York Guardians.

<doc id="271874" wikidata="Q491264" url="?curid=271874" title="Nathan Lane">
<text>Nathan Lane (born Joseph Lane; February 3, 1956) is an American actor. Since 1975, he has been on stage and screen in both comedic and dramatic roles. His awards include three Tony Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards, a Laurence Olivier Award, three Emmy Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Lane received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006 and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2008. In 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed Lane as being &quot;the greatest stage entertainer of the decade&quot;.

Lane made his professional theatre debut in 1978 in an off-Broadway production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. During that time he also briefly appeared as one half of the comedy team of Stack and Lane, until he was cast in the 1982 Broadway revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot; directed by and starring George C. Scott. That led to an extensive career onstage, where he had a long friendship and fruitful collaboration with the playwright Terrence McNally which started in 1989 with the Manhattan Theater Club production of &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot;.

A six-time Tony Award nominee, he has won three times, for Best Actor in a Musical for Pseudolus in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1996) and Max Bialystock in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Producers&quot; (2001), and Best Featured Actor in a Play for Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2018). His other Tony-nominated roles were in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1992), &quot;The Nance&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Front Page&quot; (2016). Among his 25 Broadway credits are &quot;The Man Who Came To Dinner&quot; (2000), &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (2005), &quot;Butley&quot; (2006), &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (2009), &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2010), &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2019), and &quot;Pictures from Home&quot; (2023).

Lane has acted in films such as &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996), &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot; (1997), &quot;The Producers&quot; (2005), and &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; (2023). He received the Primetime Emmy Award for his role in the Hulu mystery comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; in 2022. He was Emmy-nominated for his guest roles in &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, and &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. He portrayed F. Lee Bailey in the FX miniseries &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; (2016) and Dominick Dunne in the Netflix anthology series &quot;&quot; (2024). He also starred in &quot;Penny Dreadful: City of Angels&quot; (2020) for Showtime and &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; (2022–) for HBO.

== Early life and education ==
Lane was born Joseph Lane in Jersey City, New Jersey on February 3, 1956. His father Daniel Joseph Lane was a truck driver and an aspiring tenor who died in 1967 from alcoholism when Nathan was eleven. His mother Nora Veronica (née Finnerty) was a housewife and secretary who suffered from bipolar disorder and died in 2000. Nathan has two older brothers, Daniel Jr. and Robert. Their parents were Catholics and all of their grandparents were Irish immigrants. He was named Joseph after his uncle, a Jesuit priest. Nathan attended Catholic schools in Jersey City, including Jesuit-run St. Peter&#x27;s Preparatory School, where he was voted Best Actor in 1974, and in 2011 received the Prep Hall of Fame Professional Achievement Award.

== Career ==
=== 1978–1993: Rise to prominence ===

Accepted to Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in Philadelphia on a drama scholarship, Joseph Lane was accompanied on what was supposed to be his first day there by his older brother Dan. Discovering that the scholarship would not cover enough of his expenses, he decided to leave, and work for a year to earn some money. His brother said, &quot;I remember him saying to me, &#x27;College is for people who don&#x27;t know what they want to do.&#x27;&quot;

Because there already was a Joseph Lane registered with Actors&#x27; Equity, he changed his name to Nathan after the character Nathan Detroit from the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. He moved to New York City where after a long struggle, his career began to take off, first with some brief success in the world of stand-up comedy with partner Patrick Stack and later with Off-Broadway productions at Second Stage Theatre, the Roundabout Theatre, and the Manhattan Theatre Club. He made his Broadway debut in a 1982 revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot; as Roland Maule (Drama Desk nomination) with George C. Scott, Kate Burton, Dana Ivey, Bette Henritze, Elizabeth Hubbard, Jim Piddock, and Christine Lahti.

His second Broadway appearance was in the 1983 musical &quot;Merlin&quot;, starring Chita Rivera and magician Doug Henning. This was followed by &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; as Mr. Toad, &quot;Some Americans Abroad&quot; at Lincoln Center, and the national tour of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Bound&quot;.

Off-Broadway productions in which he appeared, included &quot;Love&quot; (the musical version of Murray Schisgal&#x27;s &quot;Luv&quot;), &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; directed by Joseph Papp in Central Park, for which he received the St. Clair Bayfield Award, &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;, &quot;The Film Society&quot;, &quot;In a Pig&#x27;s Valise&quot;, &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He appeared at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and John Guare&#x27;s &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot;. His association with Stephen Sondheim began in 1989 with a workshop reading of &quot;Assassins&quot;, where he played Samuel Byck, the would-be murderer of Richard Nixon. Lane also appeared in the television shows &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot;.
In 1991, Lane appeared with George C. Scott again in a revival of Paul Osborne&#x27;s &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot; at the Circle in the Square Theatre on Broadway. In 1992, he starred in the hit revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, playing Nathan Detroit, the character who lent him his name, opposite Peter Gallagher and Faith Prince. For this performance, he received his first Tony nomination, as well as Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In 1992, he won an Obie Award for Sustained Excellence of Performance. His professional association with his close friend the playwright Terrence McNally, whom he met in 1987, includes roles in &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot; (Drama Desk and Lucille Lortel Awards, and Outer Critics Circle nomination), &quot;Bad Habits&quot;, &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot;, &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot; (Obie, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards), &quot;Dedication or the Stuff of Dreams&quot;, which opened in 2005 (Drama Desk nomination), &quot;The Last Mile&quot; on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot;, and the film version of &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;.

The early 1990s began a stretch of successful Broadway shows for Lane. In 1993, he portrayed Sid Caesar-like Max Prince in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot;, inspired by Simon&#x27;s early career writing sketches for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. In 1996, he starred in the hit revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. For his performance he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical as well as the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In 1998, he appeared Off-Broadway in Jon Robin Baitz&#x27;s revised 1984 comedy, &quot;Mizlansky/Zilinsky or &#x27;Schmucks&quot;&#x27;.

=== 1994–2009: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
In 1994, Lane voiced Timon, the meerkat, in Disney&#x27;s blockbuster animated film &quot;The Lion King&quot; and reprised the role in its sequel &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; and midquel &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;. In 1995, Lane was the voice of the meerkat in the early episodes of &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;. In 1995, he played the Cowardly Lion in &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert&quot; at Lincoln Center to benefit the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund.
The performance was originally broadcast on Turner Network Television (TNT).

In 1996 Lane appeared in the film &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, for which he received his first Golden Globe nomination. The film, an American remake of the classic French farce &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, was directed by Mike Nichols with a screenplay by Elaine May, and starred Robin Williams, Lane, and Gene Hackman, and went on to be a big success. The Stephen Sondheim song &quot;Little Dream&quot; in &quot;The Birdcage&quot; was supposedly written especially for him. In 1999, he appeared with Victor Garber in the workshop of the Sondheim musical &quot;Wise Guys&quot; (later retitled &quot;Road Show&quot;). His collaboration with Sondheim would continue when Lane revised the original book for and starred in the Broadway debut of the composer&#x27;s &quot;The Frogs&quot; at Lincoln Center in 2004.

Lane appeared in the 1997 dark comedy &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;, one of the first films to come out of the newly formed DreamWorks Studios, in which he co-starred with British comedian Lee Evans and Christopher Walken. In 1999, he appeared in the Encores! concert revival of &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; at City Center. That same year he also voiced the role of Snowbell in the family film &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, opposite his &quot;Life With Mikey&quot; co-star Michael J. Fox.

He is known for his voice work in two Disney animated series, &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; and &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;, as well as &quot;George and Martha&quot; on HBO. He received Daytime Emmy Awards for his voice performances in &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; and &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;, as well as a nomination for &quot;George and Martha&quot;.

From 1998 to 1999 he starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Encore! Encore!&quot; alongside Joan Plowright and Glenne Headly. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a very positive review to the show&#x27;s debut, writing it possessed the &quot;most accomplished, high-powered cast on television.&quot; Although the series got positive reviews it was canceled. He still won the &quot;People&#x27;s Choice Award&quot; that year for Favorite New Actor in a Comedy. Lane received Emmy Award nominations for his guest appearances on &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot; in 1995 and 1998, respectively.
Lane starred in the Roundabout revival of &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; as Sheridan Whiteside, with Jean Smart and Harriet Harris in 2000. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; liked his performance, &quot;Nathan Lane, an actor who makes virtually every role he plays seem like a role he was born to play, is the splendidly seething, delightfully acerbic center of Jerry Zaks&#x27; splashy production of the 1939 comedy&quot;. The production was taped and shown on PBS. That same year he starred in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (2000).

In 2001, he starred as Max Bialystock in the blockbuster musical version of Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Producers&quot;. He acted alongside Matthew Broderick. Chris Jones of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Lane&#x27;s greatest contribution, though, is this performer&#x27;s innate sense of pace. He&#x27;s constantly propelling the show forward and giving all this nonsense a necessary sense of urgency.&quot; Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Lane&#x27;s performance describing it as his &quot;most delicious performance&quot;. He complimented Lane&#x27;s and Broderick&#x27;s chemistry adding &quot;Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick, have the most dynamic stage chemistry since Natasha Richardson met Liam Neeson in &quot;Anna Christie&quot;. The role earned him his second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical as well as Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards.

The next year he reprised his role as Snowbell in &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; (2002). He then appeared as Vincent Crummles in a film adaptation of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002) and the cast received the Ensemble Acting award from the National Board of Review. In 2003 he starred Off-Broadway in &quot;Trumbo: Red, White, and Blacklisted&quot;. In 2004, Lane revised the libretto and portrayed Dionysus in the revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;The Frogs&quot; which opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center on Broadway. That same year he replaced Richard Dreyfuss in &quot;The Producers&quot; in the West End. Dreyfuss was let go just a week before the show&#x27;s first preview at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal Drury Lane. Lane went on to win the Olivier Award as Best Actor in a Musical. His performance in the film version, opposite Broadway co-star Matthew Broderick as Leo Bloom, earned him his second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

In 2005, Lane rejoined Broderick for a successful limited run of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. In 2006, he took on a primarily dramatic role in a revival of Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;Butley&quot;, having played the role to great success at The Huntington Theater Company in Boston in 2003.

In 2008, he played the President of the United States in the David Mamet political satire, &quot;November&quot;, directed by Joe Mantello. This was followed by the critically acclaimed 2009 revival of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (Outer Critics Circle nomination) in which he played Estragon opposite Bill Irwin&#x27;s Vladimir. He was a 2008 American Theatre Hall of Fame inductee. In the 2000s Lane also made guest appearances on &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, and &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

In the spring of 2013, Lane returned to Broadway in &quot;The Nance&quot;, a Lincoln Center production of a new play by Douglas Carter Beane that was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised his performance writing, &quot;Lane is masterful, finding new depths in a well-worn sad clown persona&quot; adding, &quot;[The production] at the very least it provides a tremendous vehicle for Lane&quot;. He went on to receive Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations and won the Outer Critics Circle Award and the 2013 Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. The play aired on PBS &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; in 2014.

In autumn 2014, he appeared in an all-star ensemble of Terrence McNally&#x27;s revised and updated &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;, with F.

In February 2015 he reprised the role of Hickey in the Robert Falls production of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; to great acclaim at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. &quot;New York Post&quot; film critic Elizabeth Vincentelli wrote of his performance, &quot;Lane, one of his generation&#x27;s most brilliant comic actors...[hits] the sweet spot between pretend perkiness and self-loathing&quot;. He later returned to the Broadway run of &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;. In 2015, he received the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center Monte Cristo Award for his body of work. In March 2016, he opened the play &quot;White Rabbit, Red Rabbit&quot; Off-Broadway.
Lane played F. Lee Bailey in &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;, the first season of &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, which premiered on the FX channel in February 2016. Daniel Feinberg of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described his performance as &quot;understatedly Machiavellian&quot;. Emily St. Jones of &quot;Vox&quot; declared Lane as &quot;hugely enjoyable&quot; in the series.
It received 22 Emmy nominations and went on to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. In fall of 2016, he returned to Broadway to rave reviews in an all-star revival of Hecht and MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;The Front Page&quot;, directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien and produced by Scott Rudin. He played the ruthless editor Walter Burns opposite John Slattery as Hildy Johnson and John Goodman as Sheriff Hartman, for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. He also received nominations for Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards. During this time he also guest starred on series such as &quot;Difficult People&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Blacklist&quot; (2018).

Next he played Roy Cohn with Andrew Garfield as Prior Walter in the revival of &quot;Angels in America&quot;, directed by Marianne Elliott at the Lyttlelton Theatre of the National Theatre of Great Britain. Lane reprised his acclaimed portrayal on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre, and won the Tony, Drama Desk, and Outer Critics Circle Awards for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

=== 2020–present ===
Lane played the role of Lewis Michener on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Penny Dreadful: City of Angels&quot; which premiered April 26, 2020, and ran for one season. He has a recurring role in the Hulu series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;, starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. That was Lane&#x27;s first Primetime Emmy Award after a record-breaking seven nominations in the guest actor categories, making him the most nominated Comedy Guest Actor in Emmy history, a record he still holds after receiving his eighth nomination in 2023 in the same category. He also plays the recurring role of Ward McAllister in the HBO period series, &quot;The Gilded Age&quot;, written by Julian Fellowes, which received a 2024 Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series and a 2024 Emmy nomination for Best Drama. In 2023, Lane returned to the Broadway stage, marking his 25th Broadway show, in &quot;Pictures from Home&quot;, a play adapted from the photo memoir by Larry Sultan. Lane portrayed the father and former razor blade salesman to his son a photographer, played by Danny Burstein, who&#x27;s remembering his visits with his family. Lane&#x27;s wife in the play was portrayed by Zoë Wanamaker. The production was directed by Bartlett Sher and was helmed at the Studio 54 theatre. The play received mixed reviews but praise for Lane&#x27;s performance with Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; writing, &quot;Lane and Burstein are consummate pros, and there are considerable sparks of familial communication between the father and son they play with such warmth and understanding.&quot;

Also in 2023, Lane co-starred in Ari Aster&#x27;s new A24 film, &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Ryan, and Patti LuPone. Max Ceo of &quot;Esquire&quot; praised Aster for the casting of Lane writing, &quot;There&#x27;s a palpable sense that the director had seasoned character actors such as Nathan Lane in his mind while writing. He milks every dad-ish &#x27;My dude&#x27; the script hands him&quot;.

He co-starred in another A24 film, &quot;&quot;, formerly known as __ &quot;Identical Twins&quot;, directed by Larry Charles and written by Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp based on their Upright Citizens Brigade musical stage show which is a twisted take on &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;. Jackson and Sharp play the twins with Lane and Megan Mullally as the parents. It also features Bowen Yang and Megan Thee Stallion. The film premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews and won the Midnight Madness People&#x27;s Choice Award. Kristy Puchko of &quot;Mashable&quot; wrote, &quot;[Lane] who stole scenes earlier this year as a plucky papa in another A24 movie &quot;Beau is Afraid&quot;—gives his all, committing to bit after bit&quot; adding &quot;In a career of superb comedy, he&#x27;s in top form here&quot;. He was part of the voice cast for &quot;Spellbound&quot;, a new animated film from Skydance for Netflix, with Rachel Zegler, Nicole Kidman, Javier Bardem, Jenifer Lewis and John Lithgow, as well as the Ryan Murphy miniseries, &quot;&quot;, as Dominick Dunne.

==Personal life==
=== Identity and marriage === 
Lane says that when he told his mother at age 21 that he was gay, she said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather you were dead.&quot; He replied, &quot;I knew you&#x27;d understand.&quot; He joked that &quot;once I got her head out of the oven, everything went fine.&quot; He came out publicly in 1999 after the killing of Matthew Shepard and has been a long-time board member of and fundraiser for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.

=== Political beliefs === 
Lane has made several critical statements about Republican Party figures. He jokingly compared Paul Ryan to the Wicked Witch of the West, due to Ryan&#x27;s lack of support for Medicaid. In a 2018 interview about playing Roy Cohn in the Broadway revival of &quot;Angels in America&quot;, Lane portrayed Donald Trump as a liar and said: &quot;Really, what you learn is what [Trump] learned from Roy Cohn: There are certain tactics that are very familiar, that Trump picked up from him. You know, always go on the attack. The counterattack. Hit the accuser ten times harder and deflect. Never admit defeat... outright lying if all else fails.&quot; Lane was an active supporter of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama hosting fundraisers for the Democratic Party.

In a 2005 interview with &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, Lane said &quot;I&#x27;m really an honorary Jew, you know, all the best people are. I really do feel Jewish, even though I&#x27;m a Catholic. The way the Church has been behaving, I&#x27;m happy to be Jewish.&quot;

<text>Terrence McNally (November 3, 1938 – March 24, 2020) was an American playwright, librettist, and screenwriter. Described as &quot;the bard of American theater&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest contemporary playwrights the theater world has yet produced,&quot; McNally was the recipient of five Tony Awards. He won the Tony Award for Best Play for &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot; and &quot;Master Class&quot; and the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical for &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; and &quot;Ragtime,&quot; and received the 2019 Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1996, and he also received the Dramatists Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and the Lucille Lortel Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2018, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the highest recognition of artistic merit in the United States. His other accolades included an Emmy Award, two Guggenheim Fellowships, a Rockefeller Grant, four Drama Desk Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards, two Obie Awards, and three Hull-Warriner Awards.

His career spanned six decades, and his plays, musicals, and operas were routinely performed all over the world. He also wrote screenplays, teleplays, and a memoir. Active in the regional and off-Broadway theatre movements as well as on Broadway, he was one of the few playwrights of his generation to have successfully passed from the avant-garde to mainstream acclaim. His work centered on the difficulties of and urgent need for human connection. He was vice-president of the Council of the Dramatists Guild from 1981 to 2001.

He died of complications from COVID-19 on March 24, 2020, at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida.

==Early life and education==
McNally was born November 3, 1938, in St. Petersburg, Florida, to Hubert Arthur and Dorothy Katharine (Rapp) McNally, two transplanted New Yorkers from Irish Catholic backgrounds. His parents ran a seaside bar and grill called The Pelican Club, but after a hurricane destroyed the establishment, the family briefly relocated to Port Chester, New York, then to Dallas, Texas, and finally to Corpus Christi, Texas. There Hubert McNally purchased and managed a Schlitz beer distributorship, and McNally attended W.B. Ray High School. Despite his distance from New York City, McNally&#x27;s parents enjoyed Broadway musicals. When McNally was eight years old, his parents took him to see &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, starring Ethel Merman, and on a subsequent outing, McNally saw Gertrude Lawrence in &quot;The King and I&quot;. McNally later said: &quot;When I saw &quot;On the Town&quot;, with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin with the Staten Island Ferry and the Empire State Building, I said: &#x27;That&#x27;s where I want to live.&#x27; I&#x27;ve never regretted it.&quot; In high school McNally was encouraged to write by a gifted English teacher, Maurine McElroy (1913–2005).

He enrolled at Columbia College in 1956. There he especially enjoyed Andrew Chiappe&#x27;s two-semester course on Shakespeare in which students read Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in roughly the order of their composition. He joined the Boar&#x27;s Head Society and wrote Columbia&#x27;s annual Varsity Show, which featured music by fellow student Edward L. Kleban and directed by Michael P. Kahn. He graduated in 1960 with a B.A. in English and membership in Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1961, McNally was hired by novelist John Steinbeck to tutor his two teenage sons as the Steinbeck family took a cruise around the world. On the cruise McNally completed a draft of what became the opening act of &quot;And Things That Go Bump in the Night&quot;. Steinbeck asked McNally to write the libretto for &quot;Here&#x27;s Where I Belong&quot;, a musical version of the novel &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduation, McNally moved to Mexico to focus on his writing, completing a one-act play which he submitted to the Actors Studio in New York City for production. While the play was turned down by the acting school, the Studio was impressed with the script, and McNally was invited to serve as the Studio&#x27;s stage manager so that he could gain practical knowledge of theater. His earliest full-length play, &quot;This Side of the Door&quot;, deals with a sensitive boy&#x27;s battle of wills with his overbearing father and was produced in an Actors Studio Workshop in 1962, featuring a young Estelle Parsons. Starting a career that covered both off-Broadway and Broadway, his plays cried out against Vietnam, satirized stale family dynamics, mocked sexual mores and became a part of the social protest movement of the 1960s and early 1970s.

In 1964, his next play &quot;And Things That Go Bump in the Night&quot; put homosexuality squarely on stage which brought him the ire of New York City&#x27;s conservative theatre critics. It opened at the Royale Theatre on Broadway to generally negative reviews. The play explores the psycho-social dynamic of anxiety that leads one to preemptively and defensively accuse others of creating problems that in actuality result from one&#x27;s own insecurity. McNally later said, &quot;My first play, &quot;Things That Go Bump in the Night&quot;, was a big flop. I had to begin all over again.&quot; Nevertheless, the producer, Theodore Mann dropped the price of tickets to $1.00 which allowed the production to run with sold-out houses for three weeks.

&quot;Next&quot; (1968), which brought him his greatest early acclaim and was directed by Elaine May and starred James Coco, follows a married, middle-aged, businessman who has been mistakenly drafted into the armed forces. &quot;Botticelli&quot; (1968) centers on two American soldiers standing guard in the jungle while making a game of the great names in Western Civilization. &quot;¡Cuba Si!&quot; (1968) satirizes the disdain that many Americans feel for the idea of revolution though United States was itself born out of a revolution. It starred Melina Mercouri. In &quot;Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?&quot; (1971) he celebrates while mourning the ineffectiveness of the American youth movement&#x27;s conviction to &quot;blow this country up so we can start all over again.&quot; &quot;Sweet Eros&quot; (1968) is about a young man who professes his love to a naked woman he has gagged and bound to a chair. In &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (1972) a young couple showers and becomes convinced an intruder is lurking on the other side of the shower curtain. These and his other early plays, including &quot;Tour&quot; (1967), &quot;Witness&quot; (1968), and &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; (1970), and &quot;Whiskey&quot; (1973), form a dark satire on American moral complacency.

McNally turned to comedy and farce, beginning with &quot;Noon&quot; (1968), a sexual farce revolving around five strangers who are lured to an apartment in lower Manhattan by a personal advertisement. &quot;Bad Habits&quot;, which satirizes American reliance upon psychotherapy, premiered at the John Drew Theatre in East Hampton, New York, in 1971 starring Linda Lavin. It transferred to the Booth Theatre on Broadway in 1974 and garnered an Obie Award. &quot;The Ritz&quot; is a farce centering on a straight man who inadvertently takes refuge in a Mafia-owned gay bathhouse. It opened at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., and moved to the Longacre Theatre on Broadway in 1975. Robert Drivas, then McNally&#x27;s romantic partner, directed both productions. McNally adapted the play for the motion picture, &quot;The Ritz&quot; (1976), directed by Richard Lester. In 1978, McNally wrote &quot;Broadway, Broadway&quot;, which failed in its Philadelphia try-out starring Geraldine Page. Rewritten and retitled &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot;, it premiered in off-Broadway in 1985 at Manhattan Theatre Club directed by John Tillinger and starring Christine Baranski, Joanna Gleason, and James Coco.

=== Mid-career ===
After the failure of &quot;Broadway, Broadway&quot; and living briefly in Hollywood, he returned to New York City and formed an artistic relationship with Manhattan Theatre Club. The rapid spread of AIDS fundamentally changed his writing. McNally only became truly successful with works such as the off-Broadway production of &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; and its screen adaptation with stars Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. His first Broadway musical was &quot;The Rink&quot; in 1984, a project he joined after the score by composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb had been written. In 1990, McNally won an Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Miniseries or Special for &quot;Andre&#x27;s Mother&quot;, a drama about a woman coping with her son&#x27;s death from AIDS. A year later, in &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot;, two married couples spend the Fourth of July weekend at a summer house on Fire Island. They are all afraid to use the pool given that its owner has just died of AIDS. It was written for Christine Baranski, Anthony Heald, Swoosie Kurtz (taking the place of Kathy Bates), and frequent McNally collaborator Nathan Lane, who had also starred in &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot;.

With &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (based on the novel by Manuel Puig) in 1992, McNally returned to the musical stage, collaborating with Kander and Ebb on a script which explores the complex relationship between two men jailed together in a Latin American prison. &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; won the 1993 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, the first of McNally&#x27;s four Tony Awards. He collaborated with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens on &quot;Ragtime&quot; in 1997, a musical adaptation of the E. L. Doctorow novel, which tells the story of Coalhouse Walker Jr., a black musician who demands retribution when his Model T is destroyed by a mob of white troublemakers. The musical also features such historical figures as Harry Houdini, Booker T. Washington, J. P. Morgan, and Henry Ford. For his libretto, McNally won his third Tony Award. &quot;Ragtime&quot; finished its Broadway run on January 16, 2000. A revival in 2009 closed after only two months.

McNally&#x27;s other plays from this period include 1994&#x27;s &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot;, with Lane and John Glover, which examines the relationships of eight gay men; it won McNally his second Tony Award; and &quot;Master Class&quot; (1995), a character study of legendary opera soprano Maria Callas, which starred Zoe Caldwell and won the Tony Award for Best Play, McNally&#x27;s fourth.

McNally&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; (1997) became the subject of protests. In this retelling of the story of Jesus&#x27; birth, ministry, and death, he and his disciples are portrayed as homosexual. The play was initially canceled because of death threats against the board members of the Manhattan Theatre Club, which produced the play. The board relented after several other playwrights, including Athol Fugard, threatened to withdraw their plays if &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; was not produced. A crowd of almost 2,000 protested the play as blasphemous at its opening. After it opened in London in 1999, a group called the &quot;Defenders of the Messenger Jesus&quot; issued a fatwa sentencing McNally to death. In 2008, the play was revived in New York City at Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre. Reviewing this production for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jason Zinoman wrote that &quot;without the noise of controversy, the play can finally be heard. Staged with admirable delicacy... the work seems more personal than political, a coming-of-age story wrapped in religious sentiment.&quot;

=== Late career ===
In 2000, McNally partnered with composer and lyricist David Yazbek to write the musical &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, which was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell. It had an initial run at The Old Globe Theatre and then transferred to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on Broadway. The opening night cast included Patrick Wilson, Andre De Shields, Jason Danieley, Kathleen Freeman, Emily Skinner, and Annie Golden. It was nominated for 12 Tony Awards including for McNally&#x27;s book. It later transferred to the Prince of Wales Theater in London&#x27;s West End.

McNally collaborated on several new American operas. His voice may be more familiar with opera fans than theater-goers, as for nearly 30 years (1979–2008) he was a member of the Texaco Opera Quiz panel that fielded questions during the weekly &quot;Live from the Met&quot; radio broadcasts. He wrote the libretto for &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, his adaptation of Sister Helen Prejean&#x27;s book, with a score by Jake Heggie. The opera had its world premiere at San Francisco Opera in 2000 and subsequently received two commercial recordings and over 40 productions worldwide, making it &quot;one of the most successful American operas in recent decades.&quot; In 2007, Heggie composed a chamber opera, &quot;Three Decembers&quot;, with a libretto by Gene Scheer based on a text McNally had created in 1999 for a Christmas concert to benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, &quot;Some Christmas Letters (and a Couple of Phone Calls, Too)&quot;. In October 2015, Dallas Opera presented &quot;Great Scott&quot; with an original libretto by McNally and a score by Heggie. The new opera starred Joyce DiDonato and Frederica von Stade and was directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien.

The Kennedy Center presented three of McNally&#x27;s plays that focus on opera under the heading &quot;Nights at the Opera,&quot; in March 2010. It included a new play, &quot;Golden Age&quot;; &quot;Master Class&quot;, starring Tyne Daly; and &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot;, starring John Glover and Malcolm Gets. &quot;Golden Age&quot; subsequently ran Off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theatre Club New York City Center – Stage I from November 2012 to January 2013.

In 2001, McNally started what became a 15-year developmental process towards Broadway with the musical &quot;The Visit&quot;, for which he wrote the book. The music is written by John Kander and the lyrics by Fred Ebb.   Adapted from Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s 1956 satire, &quot;The Visit&quot; is the story of a widow who has amassed enormous sums of wealth and returns to her hometown to seek revenge on the villagers who scorned her in her youth. The project originally starred Angela Lansbury who departed the process to care for her ailing husband. Chita Rivera became the new star and &quot;The Visit&quot; had its first production at The Goodman Theater in Chicago in 2001. The first preview was held just ten days after the September 11 attacks, and the producers were unable to get many investors or critics from New York City to fly to Chicago. In 2004, Fred Ebb, the lyricist, died. Its next regional production occurred in 2008 at The Signature Theatre outside of Washington, D.C. In 2014, under the direction of John Doyle and starring Chita Rivera and Roger Rees, &quot;The Visit&quot; had a new production at Williamstown Theatre and then transferred to Broadway at The Lyceum Theatre in 2015. The musical was nominated for five Tony awards including for McNally&#x27;s book.

Continuing his work on librettos, McNally partnered with his collaborators on &quot;Ragtime&quot;, Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, to write the musical &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; which premiered at Lincoln Center in 2002 and was directed by Joe Mantello. He also wrote the libretto for &quot;Chita Rivera: The Dancer&#x27;s Life,&quot; in 2005, another collaboration with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, which began at The Old Globe and subsequently transferred to Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre.

In 2004, Primary Stages presented McNally&#x27;s &quot;The Stendhal Syndrome,&quot; which according to McNally explores &quot;how art can affect us emotionally, psychologically, and erotically.&quot; The play starred Isabella Rossellini and Richard Thomas and was directed by Leonard Foglia. In 2007, Philadelphia Theatre Company presented &quot;Some Men,&quot; which explores the evolution of gay relationships and same-sex marriage. It went on to Second Stage Theatre in New York and was directed by Trip Cullman. That same year McNally&#x27;s drama &quot;Deuce&quot; ran on Broadway at the Music Box Theater for a limited engagement in 2007 for 121 performances. Directed by Michael Blakemore, the play starred Angela Lansbury, in her return to Broadway after more than 20 years, and Marian Seldes.

&quot;And Away We Go&quot; premiered Off-Broadway at the Pearl Theatre in November 2013, with direction by Jack Cummings III and featured Donna Lynne Champlin, Sean McNall and Dominic Cuskern. The play takes place over several millennia covering the most pivotal moments in dramatic history entwined with a modern-day story of a struggling theatre company. McNally said that &quot;It&#x27;s very much written for the Pearl, the company that has kept the faith for the great classic plays. There are whole seasons in New York when I don&#x27;t think a single classic play would have been performed if it hadn&#x27;t been for the Pearl... I think it&#x27;s really important. I write new plays for a living; I certainly don&#x27;t think theatre should be just revivals, but there has always got to be a place for Chekhov, Ibsen, Shakespeare, Moliere and Aeschylus.&quot;

&quot;Mothers and Sons&quot; starring Tyne Daly and Frederick Weller opened on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre, where &quot;Master Class&quot; had its premiere, on March 24, 2014 (February 23, 2014, in previews). &quot;Mothers and Sons&quot; premiered at the Bucks County Playhouse (Pennsylvania) in June 2013. Vermont Stage opened its production January 27, 2016 at FlynnSpace in Burlington, Vermont. The play is an expansion on his 1988 drama &quot;Andre&#x27;s Mother&quot;, which was set at a memorial service for a victim of the AIDS crisis.  &quot;Mothers and Sons&quot; also marked the first time a legally wed gay couple was portrayed on Broadway. It was nominated for two Tony Awards including for Best Play.

McNally&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Air&quot; premiered Off-Broadway at Classic Stage Company on February 1, 2018. The play explores the history of the Ballets Russes, the Russian ballet company, with a particular focus on Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet impresario, and Vaslav Nijinsky, the dancer and choreographer. It featured the actors Douglas Hodge, Marsha Mason, Marin Mazzie, John Glover, and Jay Armstrong Johnson and was directed by Tony Award-winner John Doyle.

On May 29, 2019, a revival of &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre. The production starred Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, and was directed by Arin Arbus in her Broadway debut.

In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, &quot;Queerty&quot; named him one of the &quot;Pride50&quot; &quot;trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people&quot;.

McNally received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2019.

== Personal life ==

In his early years in New York City, McNally&#x27;s interest in theatre brought him to a party where, departing, he shared a cab with Edward Albee, who had recently written &quot;The Zoo Story&quot; and &quot;The Sandbox&quot;. They functioned as a couple for over four years during which Albee wrote &quot;The American Dream&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; He was frustrated by Albee&#x27;s lack of openness about his sexuality. McNally later said: &quot;I became invisible when press was around or at an opening night. I knew it was wrong. It&#x27;s so much work to live that way.&quot; After his relationship with Albee, McNally entered into a long-term relationship with the actor and director Robert Drivas. Drivas and McNally broke up as a couple in 1976; they remained close friends until Drivas died of AIDS-related complications ten years later.

McNally was partnered to Tom Kirdahy, a Broadway producer and a former civil rights attorney for not-for-profit AIDS organizations, following a civil union ceremony in Vermont on December 20, 2003. They married in Washington, D.C., on April 6, 2010. In celebration of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states, they renewed their vows at New York City Hall with Mayor Bill de Blasio, Kirdahy&#x27;s college roommate, officiating on June 26, 2015.

As a young man, McNally was a heavy drinker. He relates that while attending a party in 1980 he spilled a drink on Lauren Bacall. &quot;Then someone I hardly knew, Angela Lansbury, [said] &#x27;I just want to say, I don&#x27;t know you very well, but every time I see you, you&#x27;re drunk, and it bothers me.&#x27;...She was someone I revered, and she said this with such love and concern. I went to an A.A. meeting, and within a year, I had stopped drinking.&quot;

When given his Tony for Lifetime Achievement in June 2019, he began his acceptance speech saying &quot;Lifetime achievement. Not a moment too soon.&quot; He wore a cannula and appeared short of breath. McNally died at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, on March 24, 2020, at the age of 81, from complications of COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He had previously overcome lung cancer in the late 1990s that cost him portions of both his lungs due to the disease, and he was living with COPD at the time of his death.

==On theater==
For McNally, the most important function of theatre was to create community and bridge rifts opened between people by differences in religion, race, gender, and particularly sexual orientation.

In an address to members of the League of American Theatres and Producers he remarked, &quot;I think theatre teaches us who we are, what our society is, where we are going. I don&#x27;t think theatre can solve the problems of a society, nor should it be expected to ... plays don&#x27;t do that. People do. [But plays can] provide a forum for the ideas and feelings that can lead a society to decide to heal and change itself.&quot;

== Archive ==
McNally donated his papers to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The archive includes all of his major works for stage, screen, and television, as well as correspondence, posters, production photographs, programs, reviews, awards, speeches, and recordings. It is an open archive. He had previously deposited his papers at the University of Michigan. His high school English teacher, Maurine McElroy, who had since become head of freshman English at the University of Texas, influenced his choice of Texas.

== Documentary ==
&quot;Terrence McNally: Every Act of Life,&quot; a documentary about McNally&#x27;s life and career, aired on PBS on June 14, 2019, as part of their American Masters series. The film features new interviews with McNally in addition to conversations with his friends and collaborators, including F. Murray Abraham, Christine Baranski, Tyne Daly, Edie Falco, John Kander, Nathan Lane, Angela Lansbury, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald, Rita Moreno, Billy Porter, Chita Rivera, Doris Roberts, John Slattery and Patrick Wilson, plus the voices of Dan Bucatinsky, Bryan Cranston and Meryl Streep. Charles McNulty, reviewing the film for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, &quot;If you can know a person by the company he keeps, you can judge a playwright by the talent that sticks by him. By this measure, Terrence McNally was one of the most important dramatists of the last 50 years.&quot;

<doc id="271879" wikidata="Q1070192" url="?curid=271879" title="Chequers">
<text>Chequers ( ) is the country house of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. A 16th-century manor house in origin, it is near the village of Ellesborough, halfway between Princes Risborough and Wendover in Buckinghamshire, at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, north-west of central London. Coombe Hill is northeast. Chequers has been the country home of the serving Prime Minister since 1921 after the estate was given to the nation by Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham by a Deed of Settlement, given full effect in the Chequers Estate Act 1917. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England.

==Origin of the name==
The name &quot;Chequers&quot; may derive from an early owner of the manor of Ellesborough in the 12th century, Elias Ostiarius (or de Scaccario). The name &quot;Ostiarius&quot; meant an usher of the Court of the Exchequer and &quot;scacchiera&quot; means a chessboard in Italian. Elias Ostiarius&#x27;s coat of arms included the chequer board of the Exchequer, so the estate may be named after his arms and position at court. The house passed through generations of the Scaccario family (spelt many different ways) until it passed into the D&#x27;Awtrey family, whose name was eventually anglicised to Hawtrey.

Alternatively, the house could have been named after the chequer trees (&quot;Sorbus torminalis&quot;) that grow in its grounds. There is a reference to this in the book &quot;Elizabeth: Apprenticeship&quot; by David Starkey, which describes the early life of Elizabeth I.

==History==
William Hawtrey built the current mansion around 1565, and it may have involved the reconstruction of an earlier building. A reception room in the house bears his name today. Soon after its construction, Hawtrey acted as a custodian at Chequers for Lady Mary Grey, younger sister of Lady Jane Grey and great-granddaughter of King Henry VII. Lady Mary had married without the monarch&#x27;s consent, and as punishment was banished from court by Queen Elizabeth I and kept confined. Lady Mary remained at Chequers for two years. The room where she slept from 1565 to 1567 remains in its original condition.

Through descent in the female line and marriages, the house passed through several families: the Wooleys, the Crokes and the Thurbanes. In 1715, the then owner of the house married John Russell, a grandson of Oliver Cromwell. The house is known for this connection to the Cromwells, and still contains a large collection of Cromwell memorabilia.

In the 19th century, the Russells (by now the Greenhill-Russell family) employed Henry Rhodes to make alterations to the house in the Gothic style. The Tudor panelling and windows were ripped out, and battlements with pinnacles installed. Toward the end of the 19th century, the house passed through marriage to the Astley family. Between 1892 and 1901, Bertram Astley restored the house to its Elizabethan origins, with advice from Reginald Blomfield. The restoration and design work was completed by John Birch, architect.

===20th century===

In 1909, the house was taken on a long lease by Arthur Lee and his wife Ruth (an American heiress). Lee immediately re-engaged Blomfield to undertake a restoration of the interior. At the same time, Henry Avray Tipping undertook the design of several walled gardens from 1911 to 1912. In 1912, after the death of the last of the house&#x27;s ancestral owners Henry Delaval Astley, Ruth Lee and her sister purchased the property and later gave it to Arthur Lee.

During the First World War, the house became a hospital and then a convalescent home for officers. After the war, Chequers became a private home again (now furnished with many 16th-century antiques and tapestries and the Cromwellian antiquities), and the childless Lees formed a plan. While previous Prime Ministers had always belonged to the landed classes, the post-First World War era was bringing in a new breed of politician. These men did not have the spacious country houses of previous prime ministers in which to entertain foreign dignitaries or a tranquil place to relax from the affairs of state. After long discussions with then Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Chequers was given to the nation as a country retreat for the serving Prime Minister under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. 

The Lees, by this time Lord and Lady Lee of Fareham, left Chequers on 8 January 1921 after a final dinner at the house. A political disagreement between the Lees and Lloyd George soured the handover, which went ahead nonetheless.

The property houses one of the largest collections of art and memorabilia pertaining to Oliver Cromwell in the country. It also houses many other national antiques and books, held in the famous &quot;long room&quot;, including a diary of Admiral Lord Nelson and the Chequers Ring, one of the few surviving pieces of jewellery worn by Elizabeth I. The collection is not open to the public.

Nearby Coombe Hill was part of the estate until the 1920s, when it was given to the National Trust. Coombe Hill and the Chequers Estate are part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated in 1965. The landscaped park, woodlands and formal gardens surrounding Chequers are listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

During the early part of the Second World War, it was considered that security at Chequers was inadequate to protect the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Therefore, he used Ditchley in Oxfordshire until late 1942, by which time the approach road, clearly visible from the sky, had been camouflaged and other security measures had been put in place.

Chequers under Neville Chamberlain had one telephone – in the kitchen; but Churchill &quot;at once installed a whole battery on his desk and had them in constant use&quot;, according to Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal of Hungerford, who served as Chief of the Air Staff during the Second World War.

===21st century===

On 1 June 2007, the Chequers estate was designated as a protected site under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This specifically criminalised trespass into the estate.

In July 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May held a Cabinet meeting at Chequers to agree on the UK&#x27;s approach to Brexit, which became known as the proposed &quot;Chequers plan&quot;.

In April 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson chose to recover at Chequers after being hospitalised at St Thomas&#x27;s, London, with respiratory complications from COVID-19 that included a three-night stay in ICU.

<text>, stylized as L&#x27;Arc〜en〜Ciel and abbreviated as Laruku, is a Japanese rock band formed in Osaka in 1991 by bassist Tetsuya and vocalist Hyde. Following the departure of original members Hiro and Pero, guitarist Ken and drummer Sakura were recruited to replace them in 1992 and 1993, respectively. While they first got their start as a visual kei band, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel have not had any association with the movement since their major label debut in 1994. Sakura left the band in 1997 and was replaced by Yukihiro in January 1998, completing the current line-up.

With a reported 40 million records sold, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel are one of the best-selling music artists in Japan. Their 1999 simultaneously-released albums &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot; are each one of the best-selling albums of all time in Japan. L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel have had seven number one studio albums and 21 number one singles. They were ranked number 58 on a 2003 list of the top 100 Japanese pop musicians by HMV Japan, and were the first Japanese act to headline Madison Square Garden in New York City.

==History==

===1991–1997: Formation, major label debut and sakura&#x27;s departure===
In February 1991, bassist Tetsuya (then known as TETSU) recruited vocalist Hyde (then known as HIDE), guitarist Hiro and drummer Pero. Together, they formed a band and named themselves L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. A year later, after gaining popularity in their hometown of Osaka, Hiro left the band on June 12, 1992. Tetsuya then convinced his friend Ken to quit his university studies and join the band as guitarist. However, Pero then left the group on December 30, 1992. The following year, Sakura joined as L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s new drummer.

On April 1, 1993, the band released their debut album &quot;Dune&quot; on the independent, but well-known, record label Danger Crue. The album was a success and ranked number one on the Oricon indies charts. This caught the attention of some major labels. In 1994, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment Japan&#x27;s Ki/oon division. They released their major debut album &quot;Tierra&quot; that same year. Their third album &quot;Heavenly&quot; followed in 1995. In 1996, their fourth album, &quot;True&quot;, became their first to sell over a million copies.

On February 24, 1997, drummer Sakura was arrested for violating the Stimulants Control Law. In May, he received a two year prison sentence suspended for three years. When news of the arrest became public, the group&#x27;s CDs were removed from the shelves in record shops. Their song &quot;The Fourth Avenue Cafe&quot; was replaced as the fourth ending theme of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime after only four episodes and its single release was halted. (It was eventually released in 2006.)

Over the next few months, the group continued to be featured in magazines as a trio. On October 17, the single &quot;Niji&quot; was released without Sakura. Instead, it features former and Die in Cries drummer Yukihiro as a support member. Sakura officially announced his departure from L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel on November 4. The remaining members formed &quot;The Zombies&quot;, which was advertised as a &quot;copy band&quot; singing L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel songs. The end of their hiatus was marked by a concert at the Tokyo Dome on December 23, 1997, entitled Reincarnation. It was the band&#x27;s first performance at the venue and had an attendance of 56,000 people, with the tickets sold out in a record-breaking four minutes.

===1998–2003: Blockbuster success and hiatus===

Yukihiro officially joined L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel as their drummer on January 1, 1998. The single &quot;Winter Fall&quot;, which was released at the end of the month, became the group&#x27;s first number one on the Oricon Singles Chart. They subsequently released their album &quot;Heart&quot; on February 25, 1998. The band was also included in the Japanese and Philippine releases of the official movie soundtrack of Godzilla. It was released on May 19, 1998, through Epic Records and mainly consists of alternative rock songs. They provided the track titled &quot;Lose Control.&quot;

On July 1, 1999, the group released two albums, &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot;, simultaneously. These two albums became the first Japanese albums to be released simultaneously in other Asian countries outside Japan. Both albums topped the Oricon music charts, with &quot;Ark&quot; occupying number one and &quot;Ray&quot; number two and each selling over two million copies. This, along with the 1999 Grand Cross Tour which united over 650,000 people in 12 concerts, marked the commercial high point of the group&#x27;s career.

In 2000, two of the band&#x27;s songs were included in the soundtrack for &quot;Ring 0: Birthday&quot;. Their next album &quot;Real&quot;, released on August 30, 2000, was their last studio album for some time. Its song &quot;Stay Away&quot; was featured in the arcade game &quot;DrumMania 4th Mix&quot;. The compilation album &quot;Clicked Singles Best 13&quot; was released on March 14, 2001. It includes twelve songs chosen online by the group&#x27;s fans. It also includes an additional thirteenth song, &quot;Anemone&quot;. Their album &quot;Real&quot; was re-released as a Super Audio CD on July 4, 2001. &quot;Spirit Dreams Inside (Another Dream)&quot;, released on September 5, 2001, was L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s last single before a long period of inactivity. The English-language version of the single&#x27;s title track was adopted as &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;&#x27;s ending theme song.

During this period of inactivity, the members began working on solo careers and side projects. In 2001, Tetsuya started his solo career under the name Tetsu69 and Yukihiro formed the band Acid Android. The following year, Ken founded Sons of All Pussys with L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s former drummer Sakura. Hyde released two solo albums, &quot;Roentgen&quot; (2002) and &quot;666&quot; (2003), and co-starred in the 2003 movie &quot;Moon Child&quot;. He also played the part of Adam in the film &quot;Kagen no Tsuki&quot; (2004).

Three compilation albums; &quot;The Best of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel 1994–1998&quot;, &quot;The Best of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel 1998–2000&quot; and &quot;The Best of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel C/W&quot;, were released on March 19, 2003. The album series included all of their previous singles, with the exception of &quot;Spirit Dreams Inside (Another Dream)&quot;.

===2003–2006: Comeback and international activities===

After two and a half years, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel performed a series of seven concerts, entitled Shibuya Seven Days, in Tokyo in June 2003. During this event, the group announced that a new album would be released the following year. &quot;Ready Steady Go&quot;, the group&#x27;s first single in more than three years, was released in February 2004. This song was used as an opening theme song for the &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; anime. The single topped the Oricon weekly singles charts. Additionally, a sample of this song was also used in a Nintendo DS game called &quot;Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan&quot;. The group subsequently released another single, &quot;Hitomi no Juunin&quot;, in early March 2004. This was followed by the group&#x27;s album, &quot;Smile&quot;, on March 31. Shortly after, on June 2, the single &quot;Jiyuu e no Shoutai&quot; was the first to feature a song by P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel.

On July 31, 2004, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel made their North American debut at the anime convention Otakon. Approximately 12,000 people attended the concert, which was held at the 1st Mariner Arena. They were the first Japanese band to perform at the arena. On May 31, 2005, Tofu Records, Sony Music Japan&#x27;s U.S. label, released a DVD of their 2004 Otakon concert. On June 25, 2007, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel signed a record deal with HMV America.

In 2005, the band released various singles, including &quot;Killing Me&quot;, &quot;New World&quot; and &quot;Jojoushi&quot;. These were later complied onto the album &quot;Awake&quot;, which was released on June 22, 2005. It features twelve tracks, including &quot;Lost Heaven&quot;, the ending theme song of &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa&quot;. Another of the band&#x27;s single, &quot;Link&quot;, was released on July 20, 2005. This song was also featured in the movie as the opening theme song, and was included on their next album, entitled &quot;Kiss&quot;.

In August 2005, the band went on a nationwide tour for their album &quot;Awake&quot;. It was followed by another tour titled Asia Live 2005, which had the band performing in Seoul and Shanghai and ended at the Tokyo Dome. Following these two tours, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s members turned their attention back to their own solo projects. Tetsuya began recording with Morrie for his solo project Creature Creature. Yukihiro regrouped his band Acid Android and released the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; on April 5, 2006. Acid Android joined Mucc to perform two concerts in Shanghai in April 2006. Hyde composed &quot;Glamorous Sky&quot;, the theme song of the film adaption of the manga &quot;Nana&quot;. The song was sung by pop singer Mika Nakashima, the first time hyde composed music for another vocalist. In addition, his own solo album, &quot;Faith&quot;, was released on April 26, 2006. Hyde also went on a five-month tour throughout Japan to publicize his album. After signing with Tofu Records, he held four small concerts in the United States in July 2006, making his US debut. This was the first of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s solo projects to be held outside Japan. On August 23, 2006, ken released a solo single entitled &quot;Speed&quot;.

===2006–2010: 15th anniversary and concert hiatus===
On November 25 and 26, 2006, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel played two shows at the Tokyo Dome to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The tickets for these concerts sold out in two minutes, breaking the previous record, which was also set by them. A poll was created on their official website, during the weeks before the concert, which allowed fans to pick the songs they would like to hear at the show. The concert was later broadcast on the WOWOW channel on December 23, 2006, and was subsequently broadcast on Korean MTV on February 8, 2007.

L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel recorded the song &quot;Shine&quot;, which was to be used as the opening song for the NHK anime &quot;&quot;. In the spring of 2007, the group kicked off their Mata Heart ni hi wo Tsukero 2007 tour in Japan. They also released the single &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; on May 30, 2007, which topped the Oricon charts. Their song &quot;My Heart Draws a Dream&quot;, which was used in a Subaru commercial, was also released as a single on August 29, 2007. This single also topped the Oricon charts.

L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel subsequently recorded the song &quot;Daybreak&#x27;s Bell&quot;, which was used as the first opening theme for the anime &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot;. This song was released as a single on October 10, 2007, later topping the Oricon weekly charts. From November 14 to December 25, 2007, they released a limited edition single titled &quot;Hurry Xmas&quot;, along with two new DVDs, titled &quot;15th L&#x27;Anniversary Live&quot; and &quot;Chronicle 3&quot;. Their studio album &quot;Kiss&quot; was released on November 21, 2007, and debuted at number one on the Oricon charts.

L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel then performed the Theater of Kiss tour, which was held from December 22, 2007, to February 17, 2008. The song &quot;Drink It Down&quot; was used as the Japanese opening song for the PS3/Xbox 360 game &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;.

The band went on a tour, entitled Tour 2008 L&#x27;7: Trans Asia via Paris, which covered several major Asian cities, as well as Paris, France. On this tour, a live show hiatus until 2011 was announced, although new material would still continue to be released.

Their double A-side single &quot;Nexus 4/Shine&quot; and the DVD &quot;Tour 2007-2008 Theater of Kiss&quot; were released together on August 27, 2008. On May 20, 2009, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released the DVD of their live concert in Paris, titled &quot;Live in Paris&quot;. hyde and K.A.Z formed the hard rock group Vamps and released their self-titled first album, &quot;Vamps&quot;, on June 10, 2009. On December 1, 2009, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel announced the release of a new single named &quot;Bless&quot; on January 27, 2010. This was used as the theme song for NHK&#x27;s broadcast of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.

On March 10, 2010, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel released their fifth &quot;best of&quot; album, entitled &quot;Quadrinity: Member&#x27;s Best Selections&quot;. It contains 4 CDs with 7 tracks per band member, chosen and remastered by each of them. The first press edition of this compilation also came with a DVD that includes a variety quiz show with the band titled &quot;The L&#x27;Arquiz&quot;.

===2011–2013: 20th anniversary and world tour===
Ending their live show hiatus on January 1, 2011, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel celebrated both their 20th anniversary and the New Year with the midnight concert L&#x27;A Happy New Year! at Makuhari Messe. On February 16, they released the compilation album &quot;Twenity&quot;, which consists of three parts: &quot;Twenity 1991-1996&quot;, &quot;Twenity 1997-1999&quot;, and &quot;Twenity 2000-2010&quot;. The albums are an all-around &quot;best of&quot; collection of the band, covering everything from the formation of the group, including their hit singles up to their newest works. A box set entitled &quot;Twenity Box&quot; was later released on March 9 and contains all three of the albums. It also came with a special digest DVD that covered the 20-year history of the band, a deluxe booklet, and a special music box that contained either &quot;Flower&quot;, &quot;Anata&quot;, &quot;New World&quot;, or &quot;My Heart Draws a Dream&quot; at random.

Later, it was announced that L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel would provide the theme song for &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: The Sacred Star of Milos&quot;, entitled &quot;Good Luck My Way&quot;. This is their fourth contribution to the &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; franchise. The song was released as their first 20th L&#x27;Anniversary single on June 29, 2011. To further celebrate their 20 years together, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel put on a 20th L&#x27;Anniversary Concert at Ajinomoto Stadium in Tokyo on May 28–29, 2011, with each day dedicated to one half of their career. All of the proceeds from the concerts were donated to the Great East Japan earthquake relief efforts. Additionally, at the end of the concert, it was announced that there would be a L&#x27;Anniversary Japan Tour in 2011, as well as a world tour in 2012. On October 12, 2011, the second 20th L&#x27;Anniversary single was released, entitled &quot;XXX&quot; . L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel was subsequently approached by the producers of the &quot;Wild 7&quot; live-action film to perform the movie&#x27;s theme song. Entitled &quot;Chase&quot;, the song was released as the group&#x27;s third L&#x27;Anniversary single on December 21.
L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel then announced that they would be releasing their twelfth studio album, and gave fans who bought &quot;Chase&quot; a sneak peek with a live internet broadcast of the band mastering the album on December 26 on Ustream. They also announced that their alter ego band P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel would be releasing their first album, titled &quot;P&#x27;unk is Not Dead&quot;, the same day. The band&#x27;s twelfth album, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, was released on February 8, 2012. It includes all their singles from the single &quot;Drink it Down&quot; onwards and four new songs.

Their show in New York was originally scheduled to be at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on March 23, but was later moved to the main arena, making L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel the first Japanese artist to be the headlining act at the legendary venue. They ended the tour by returning to the US for two nights in Honolulu, Hawaii on May 31 and June 1, the latter being for the group&#x27;s fan club members only. At the first day, the mayor of Honolulu Peter Carlisle made a surprise appearance and declared May 31 &quot;L’Arc~en~Ciel Day&quot;, saying he felt the band &quot;made a great contribution to cultural activities, and built a bridge of friendship between Hawaii and Japan&quot;.

To promote their release, the band recorded a VR music video for the PlayStation 4, which features the band members fighting zombies in the franchise&#x27;s fictional Racoon City.

In 2017, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel celebrated their 25th anniversary with two shows at the Tokyo Dome on April 9 and 10. Only 110,000 seats were available for the almost 600,000 fans who signed up for the ticket lotteries. In December 2018, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s first Christmas live was held at the Tokyo Dome. In late 2019 the band reinforced their presence on social media, opening an official account on Instagram, as well as an official channel in YouTube. They also released most of their music albums across different music streaming services, including Apple Music and Spotify.

On January 9, 2020, the band started a new arena tour, the first one in eight years. A total of twelve live shows were to be held across five cities between January and March, starting with their home town at the Osaka-jō Hall. However, the last four concerts were cancelled due to coronavirus outbreak-related concerns.
For the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2021, a partnership with Japanese TV-broadcasting station WOWOW was made. Starting in February 2021, the station broadcast most of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s past concerts for several months. On May 29 and 30, the band played two concerts named L&#x27;Appy Birthday at Chiba&#x27;s Makuhari Messe. On May 31, the band digitally released &quot;Mirai&quot;, their first new song in almost five years. The single was used as the theme of the Bandai Namco video game &quot;Blue Protocol&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
With 40 million records sold, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel are one of the best-selling music artists in Japan. Their 1999 simultaneously-released albums &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Ray&quot; are each one of the best-selling albums of all time in Japan. In 2003, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel were ranked number 58 on a list of the top 100 Japanese pop musicians by HMV Japan. In 2012, they became the first Japanese act to headline Madison Square Garden in New York City. Hiroki Kamemoto, lead guitarist of Glim Spanky, became interested in music after hearing L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel and Glay. Vocalist Eye and bassist Rio of the heavy metal band Mary&#x27;s Blood both started bands because of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. Masato Hayakawa of Coldrain, D vocalist Asagi, Vistlip vocalist Tomo and guitarist Yuh, and American disc jockey DJ Heavygrinder have all cited L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel as an influence.

==P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel==
P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel (stylized as P&#x27;UNK〜EN〜CIEL) is an alter ego of L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. Introduced in 2004, Hyde takes over the guitar, Ken the drums, Yukihiro plays the bass, while Tetsuya performs the vocals. P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel&#x27;s songs have a more punk sound and their music is usually heavier and faster with a different tone due to Tetsuya&#x27;s vocals. Hyde wears a pirate patch over his left eye in P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel performances. Yukihiro is known to wear a gas mask; however, this has only been seen once at a live concert during their &quot;Smile&quot; tour in 2004.

Each member is called in capital letters; T.E.Z P&#x27;UNK (formerly TETSU P&#x27;UNK), KEN P&#x27;UNK, HYDE P&#x27;UNK and YUKI P&#x27;UNK. Each member produces one song of their choice, and they alternate their productions.

P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel is the re-visitation of D&#x27;ark-en-Ciel (stylized as D&#x27;ARK〜EN〜CIEL), a special event that took place during concerts in the years when Sakura was their drummer. The only material released from D&#x27;ark-en-Ciel is the 18-minute self-titled B-side found on the (then) unreleased &quot;The Fourth Avenue Cafe&quot; single. Each member was called; DARK TETSU, HYDE DARK, Suck・D&#x27;ark・La and Kën D&#x27;Ark.

P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel songs have been recorded and used as B-sides on singles since 2004 and their performances can be found on live DVDs. They also featured television personality Sayaka Aoki (called P&#x27;UNK ) in the song &quot;Round and Round 2005&quot;. On February 8, 2012, P&#x27;unk-en-Ciel released their first album &quot;P&#x27;unk is Not Dead&quot;, which contains all twelve songs they released up to that point.

<text>The ball python (Python regius), also called the royal python, is a python species native to West and Central Africa, where it lives in grasslands, shrublands and open forests. This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of . The name &quot;ball python&quot; refers to its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Boa regia&quot; was the scientific name proposed by George Shaw in 1802 for a pale variegated python from an indistinct place in Africa.
The generic name &quot;Python&quot; was proposed by François Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Between 1830 and 1849, several generic names were proposed for the same zoological specimen described by Shaw, including &quot;Enygrus&quot; by Johann Georg Wagler, &quot;Cenchris&quot; and &quot;Hertulia&quot; by John Edward Gray. Gray also described four specimens that were collected in Gambia and were preserved in spirits and fluid.

==Description==

The ball python is black, or albino and dark brown with light brown blotches on the back and sides. Its white or cream belly is scattered with black markings. It is a stocky snake with a relatively small head and smooth scales. It reaches a maximum adult length of . Males typically measure eight to ten subcaudal scales, and females typically measure two to four subcaudal scales. Females reach an average snout-to-vent length of , a long jaw, an long tail and a maximum weight of . Males are smaller with an average snout-to-vent length of , a long jaw, an long tail and a maximum weight of .
Both sexes have pelvic spurs on both sides of the vent. During copulation, males use these spurs for gripping females. Males tend to have larger spurs, and sex is best determined by manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ball python is native to west Sub Saharan Africa from Senegal through Cameroon to Sudan and Uganda.
It prefers grasslands, savannas, and sparsely wooded areas.

==Behavior and ecology==
Ball pythons are typically nocturnal or crepuscular, meaning that they are active during dusk, dawn, and/or nighttime. This species is known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck tucked away in the middle. This defense behavior is typically employed in lieu of biting, which makes this species easy for humans to handle and has contributed to their popularity as a pet.

In the wild, ball pythons favor mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. Males tend to display more semi-arboreal behaviors, whilst females tend towards terrestrial behaviors.

===Diet===
The diet of the ball python in the wild consists mostly of small mammals and birds. Young ball pythons of less than prey foremost on small birds. Ball pythons longer than prey foremost on small mammals. Males prey more frequently on birds, and females more frequently on mammals. Rodents make up a large percentage of the diet; Gambian pouched rats, black rats, rufous-nosed rats, shaggy rats, and striped grass mice are among the species consumed.

===Reproduction===

Females are oviparous and lay three to 11 rather large, leathery eggs. The eggs hatch after 55 to 60 days. Young male pythons reach sexual maturity at 11–18 months, and females at 20–36 months. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and the ability to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are , although in captivity, some males have been known to begin breeding at . Females breed in the wild at weights as low as though or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than . Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.

Parthenogenetic reproduction was demonstrated in a pet ball python. A genetic comparison of a mother and her early-stage embryos demonstrated the parthenogenetic origin of the latter.

== Threats ==
The ball python is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List; it experiences a high level of exploitation and the population is believed to be in decline in most of West Africa. The ball python is primarily threatened by poaching for the international exotic pet trade. It is also hunted for its skin, meat and use in traditional medicine. Other threats include habitat loss as a result of intensified agriculture and pesticide use. Rural hunters in Togo collect gravid females and egg clutches, which they sell to snake ranches. In 2019 alone, 58 interviewed hunters had collected 3,000 live ball pythons and 5,000 eggs.

==In captivity==
Ball pythons are the most popular pet snake and the second most popular pet reptile after the bearded dragon. According to the IUCN Red List, while captive bred animals are widely available in the pet trade, capture of wild specimens for sale continues to cause significant damage to wild populations. Wild-caught specimens have greater difficulty adapting to a captive environment, which can result in refusal to feed, and they generally carry internal or external parasites. This species can do quite well in captivity, regularly living for 15–30 years with good care. The oldest recorded ball python in captivity is 62 years, 59 of those at the Saint Louis Zoo.

===Breeding===

Captive ball pythons are often bred for specific patterns that do not occur in the wild, called &quot;morphs.&quot; Breeders are continuously creating new designer morphs, and over 7,500 different morphs currently exist. Most morphs are considered solely cosmetic with no harm or benefit to the individual animal. However, the &quot;spider&quot; morph gene has been linked to neurological disease, typically involving symptoms such as head tremors and lack of coordination that are collectively referred to as &quot;wobble syndrome.&quot; Due to the ethical concerns associated with intentionally breeding a color pattern linked to genetic disease, the International Herpetological Society banned the sale of spider morphs at their events beginning in 2018.

==In culture==
The ball python is particularly revered by the Igbo people in southeastern Nigeria, who consider it symbolic of the earth, being an animal that travels so close to the ground. Even Christian Igbos treat ball pythons with great care whenever they come across one in a village or on someone&#x27;s property; they either let them roam or pick them up gently and return them to a forest or field away from houses. If one is accidentally killed, many communities on Igbo land still build a coffin for the snake&#x27;s remains and give it a short funeral. In northwestern Ghana, there is a taboo towards pythons as people consider them a savior and cannot hurt or eat them. According to folklore a python once helped them flee from their enemies by transforming into a log to allow them to cross a river.

<text>John Foster McCreight, (1827 – November 18, 1913) was a jurist and the first premier of British Columbia.

==Early life==
McCreight was born in Caledon, County Tyrone, Ireland, to a well-established and well-connected family. After completing law studies at Trinity College Dublin, he was called to the bar in 1852. Shortly thereafter, McCreight left Ireland to establish a practice in Melbourne, Australia. McCreight left Australia in 1859 and sailed first to San Francisco and then to Victoria, British Columbia.

==Life and career in British Columbia==
At the time of McCreight&#x27;s arrival in Victoria in 1860, it was the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island, which at the time was governed by the powerful and autocratic Chief Factor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Sir James Douglas. In 1862, McCreight was called to the British Columbia bar and opened a practice in Victoria. By all accounts, he led a quiet and solitary life in the city, his main occupations outside of his work being his involvement in the local Masonic Lodge and as an active layperson in the congregation of the local Anglican cathedral.

By 1866, the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia had merged. Although the united colony did not join the Canadian confederation when it was effected in 1867, the worrisome economic and strategic situation soon made such an arrangement attractive. British Columbia joined confederation on July 20, 1871, and McCreight joined the interim transitional cabinet as Attorney General. During the first provincial general election that October, McCreight won a seat for Victoria City in the legislature, and Sir Joseph Trutch, the Lieutenant Governor, chose him to be British Columbia&#x27;s first premier. He continued to hold the attorney-generalship as well.

By all accounts, McCreight was temperamentally ill-suited to public life. His colleague, Henry Pering Pellew Crease, described the Premier as &quot;bad tempered and queer...by fits &amp; turns extremely credulous &amp; extremely suspicious...excessively obstinate in the wrong places...close and reserved in his daily life...[and] utterly ignorant of politics&quot;. Nonetheless, McCreight&#x27;s administration was a productive one, passing three dozen pieces of legislation in less than a year. His inability to form alliances and mollify the sometimes narrow and sectional interests of MLAs led to a loss of support, however, and in 1872, he resigned after losing a motion of no confidence following the Speech from the Throne.

He served as the first Treasurer (chief elected officer) of the incorporated Law Society of British Columbia from 1874 to 1880.

==Supreme Court Justice and retirement==
McCreight remained in the legislature until 1875, after which he returned to his law practice as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Five years later, he was made a justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In that capacity, he served in the Cariboo, Victoria, and finally in 1883 New Westminster before retiring in 1897, at the age of 70. He experienced a crisis of faith, sometime in the 1880s and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1883. McCreight returned to the United Kingdom, dying at Hastings, East Sussex at the age of 86.

==Legacy==
McCreight Lake, north west of Campbell River, British Columbia is named for him.

<text>Pedro Juan Carrasco García (11 July 1943 – 27 January 2001) was a Spanish boxer whose fame transcended the boxing ring. During the 1970s, he was a media darling in Spain.

==Professional career==

Carrasco was crowned European Lightweight champion in 1967. This triumph was followed four years later, in 1971, with a victory over Mando Ramos in Madrid by disqualification in 11 rounds for the WBC&#x27;s world Lightweight title. The victory was marred by controversy because Carrasco won the title while lying on the canvas: he had been hit in the head by Ramos. The fight&#x27;s referee expressed confusion as to whether the blow was legal, but he decided to call it an illegal blow and raised Carrasco&#x27;s hand in signal of victory. Carrasco immediately became a national hero in Spain, as Spain&#x27;s second-ever world boxing champion.

Carrasco, who was a culturally educated fighter, became a sensation with the media, especially with tabloid magazines, and he started to be seen with Spanish show business stars. His picture appeared on the covers of such magazines as ¡Hola! many times. He married the singer Rocío Jurado, with whom he had a daughter, Rocío Carrasco. He was also married to Raquel Mosquera for five years.

In 1971, and because of the controversial nature of his world championship win over Ramos, the WBC ordered a rematch, and it was fought in Los Angeles. There, the fight was controversial again, this time because Carrasco looked to most onlookers and fans to be clearly the winner but the decision was favorable to Ramos and he retook the title. They had another rematch, and Ramos beat Carrasco again.

Carrasco&#x27;s career boxing record was 106–3–2 (66 KOs). After beginning his career 12–1–1, Carrasco had a streak on which he went 92–0–1. The draw came after Carrasco had won 83 consecutive fights. This undefeated streak was longer than Julio César Chávez&#x27;s (90–0–1). Chávez&#x27;s streak, however, was from the beginning of the career, and he was 87–0 before the draw.

==Professional boxing record==


==Death==
Carrasco&#x27;s died of a heart attack in 2001.

<doc id="271903" wikidata="Q471764" url="?curid=271903" title="Thomas Hart Benton (painter)">
<text>Thomas Hart Benton (April 15, 1889 – January 19, 1975) was an American painter, muralist, and printmaker. Along with Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry, he was at the forefront of the Regionalist art movement. The fluid, sculpted figures in his paintings showed everyday people in scenes of life in the United States.

His work is strongly associated with the Midwestern United States, the region in which he was born and which he called home for most of his life. He also studied in Paris, lived in New York City for more than 20 years and painted scores of works there, summered for 50 years on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard off the New England coast, and also painted scenes of the American South and West.

==Early life and education==
Benton was born in Neosho, Missouri, into an influential family of politicians. He had two younger sisters, Mary and Mildred, and a younger brother, Nathaniel. His mother was Elizabeth Wise Benton and his father, Colonel Maecenas Benton, was a lawyer and four times elected as U.S. congressman. Known as the &quot;little giant of the Ozarks&quot;, Maecenas named his son after his own great-uncle, Thomas Hart Benton, one of the first two United States Senators elected from Missouri. 

Given his father&#x27;s political career, Benton spent his childhood shuttling between Washington, D.C., and Missouri. His father sent him to Western Military Academy in 1905–06, hoping to shape him for a political career. Growing up in two different cultures, Benton rebelled against his father&#x27;s plans. He wanted to develop his interest in art, which his mother supported. As a teenager, he worked as a cartoonist for the &quot;Joplin American&quot; newspaper, in Joplin, Missouri.

With his mother&#x27;s encouragement, in 1907 Benton enrolled at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago. Two years later, he moved to Paris in 1909 to continue his art education at the Académie Julian. His mother supported him financially and emotionally to work at art until he married in his early 30s. His sister Mildred said, &quot;My mother was a great power in his growing up.&quot; 

In Paris, Benton met other North American artists, such as the Mexican Diego Rivera and Stanton Macdonald-Wright, an advocate of Synchromism. Influenced by the latter, Benton subsequently adopted a Synchromist style.

==Early career and World War I==
After studying in Europe, Benton moved to New York City in 1912 and resumed painting. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy and was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia. His war-related work had an enduring effect on his style. He was directed to make drawings and illustrations of shipyard work and life, and this requirement for realistic documentation strongly affected his later style. Later in the war, classified as a &quot;camoufleur&quot;, Benton drew the camouflaged ships that entered Norfolk harbor. 

His work was required for several reasons: to ensure that U.S. ship painters were correctly applying the camouflage schemes, to aid in identifying U.S. ships that might later be lost, and to have records of the ship camouflage of other Allied navies. Benton later said that his work for the Navy &quot;was the most important thing, so far, I had ever done for myself as an artist.&quot;
==Marriage and family==
At the age of 33, Benton married Rita Piacenza, an Italian immigrant, in 1922. They met while Benton was teaching art classes for a neighborhood organization in New York City, where she was one of his students. They were married for almost 53 years until Benton&#x27;s death in 1975; Rita died eleven weeks after her husband. The couple had a son, Thomas Piacenza Benton (1926–2010), and a daughter, Jessie Benton, (1939–2023), who became a major figure in the Fort Hill Community founded by Mel Lyman; Benton himself was identified as a &quot;benefactor&quot; to the community, giving them &quot;dozens of paintings&quot;.

==Later career==

===Dedication to Regionalism===


On his return to New York in the early 1920s, Benton declared himself an &quot;enemy of modernism&quot;; he began the naturalistic and representational work known as Regionalism. He toured America, making sketches and ink wash drawings of the things he saw. He would go back to these sketches again and again as reference for future paintings. He expanded the scale of his Regionalist works, culminating in his &quot;America Today&quot; murals at the New School for Social Research in 1930–31. In 1984, the murals were purchased and restored by AXA Equitable to hang in the lobby of the AXA Equitable Tower at 1290 Sixth Avenue in New York City. In December 2012, AXA donated the murals to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Met&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s &#x27;America Today&#x27; Mural Rediscovered&quot; ran until April 19, 2015. The murals were described as showing how Benton absorbed and used the influence of the Greek artist El Greco.

Benton broke through to the mainstream in 1932. A relative unknown, he won a commission to paint the murals of Indiana life planned by the state in the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago. The &quot;Indiana Murals&quot; stirred controversy; Benton painted everyday people, and included a portrayal of events in the state&#x27;s history which some people did not want publicized. Some critics attacked his work for showing Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members in full regalia. The KKK reached its peak membership in 1925. In Indiana, 30% of adult males were estimated to be members of the Klan, and in 1924 KKK members were elected as governor, and to other political offices.

These mural panels are now displayed at Indiana University in Bloomington, with the majority hung in the &quot;Hall of Murals&quot; at the Auditorium. Four additional panels are displayed in the former University Theatre (now the Indiana Cinema) connected to the Auditorium. Two panels, including the one with images of the KKK, are located in a lecture classroom at Woodburn Hall.

In 1932, Benton also painted &quot;The Arts of Life in America&quot;, a set of large murals for an early site of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Major panels include &quot;Arts of the City&quot;, &quot;Arts of the West&quot;, &quot;Arts of the South&quot; and &quot;Indian Arts&quot;. In 1953 five of the panels were purchased by the New Britain Museum of American Art in Connecticut, and have since been displayed there.

On December 24, 1934, Benton was featured on one of the earliest color covers of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Benton&#x27;s work was featured along with that of fellow Midwesterners Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry in an article entitled &quot;The U.S. Scene&quot;. The trio were featured as the new heroes of American art, and Regionalism was described as a significant art movement.

In 1935, after he had &quot;alienated both the left-leaning community of artists with his disregard for politics and the larger New York-Paris art world with what was considered his folksy style&quot;, Benton left the artistic debates of New York for his native Missouri. He was commissioned to create a mural for the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City. A &quot;Social History of Missouri&quot; is perhaps Benton&#x27;s greatest work. In an interview in 1973, he said, &quot;If I have any right to make judgments, I would say that the Missouri mural was my best work&quot;. As with his earlier work, controversy arose over his portrayal of the state&#x27;s history, as he included the subjects of slavery in the history of Missouri, the Missouri outlaw Jesse James, and the political boss Tom Pendergast. With his return to Missouri, Benton embraced the Regionalist art movement.

He settled in Kansas City and accepted a teaching job at the Kansas City Art Institute. This base afforded Benton greater access to rural America, which was changing rapidly. Due to his Populist political upbringing, Benton&#x27;s sympathy was with the working class and the small farmer, unable to gain material advantage despite the Industrial Revolution. 

During the late 1930s he created some of his best-known work, including the allegorical nude &quot;Persephone&quot;. It was considered scandalous by the Kansas City Art Institute, and was borrowed by the showman Billy Rose, who hung it in his New York nightclub, the Diamond Horseshoe. It is now held by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Karal Ann Marling, an art historian, says it is &quot;one of the great works of American pornography.&quot;

In 1937, Benton published his autobiography &quot;An Artist in America&quot;, which was critically acclaimed. The writer Sinclair Lewis said of it: &quot;Here&#x27;s a rare thing, a painter who can write.&quot; During this period Benton also began to produce signed, limited-edition lithographs, which were sold at $5.00 each through the Associated American Artists Galleries based in New York.

===Teaching career===
Benton&#x27;s autobiography indicates that his son was enrolled from age 3 to 9 at the City and Country School in New York in exchange for his teaching art there. He included the school&#x27;s founder, Caroline Pratt, in &quot;City Activities with Dance Hall&quot;, one of the ten panels in &quot;America Today&quot;.

Benton taught at the Art Students League of New York from 1926 to 1935 and at the Kansas City Art Institute from 1935 to 1941. His most famous student, Jackson Pollock, whom he mentored in the Art Students League, founded the Abstract Expressionist movement. Pollock often said that Benton&#x27;s traditional teachings gave him something to rebel against. With another of his students, Glen Rounds, who went on to become a prolific author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books, Benton spent a summer touring the Western United States in the early 1930s. In the 1930s Benton taught at the Ste. Genevieve Art Colony in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.

Benton&#x27;s students in New York and Kansas City included many painters who contributed significantly to American art. They included Pollock&#x27;s brother Charles Pollock, Eric Bransby, Charles Banks Wilson, Frederic James, Lamar Dodd, Reginald Marsh, Charles Green Shaw, Margot Peet, Jackson Lee Nesbitt, Roger Medearis, James Duard Marshall, Glenn Gant, Fuller Potter, William Fredrick Kautzman, Aaron Gunn Pyle, and Delmer J. Yoakum. Benton also briefly taught Dennis Hopper at the Kansas City Art Institute; Hopper later became well known as an independent actor, filmmaker, and photographer.

==Later life==
In 1944, Benton appeared in an episode of &quot;John Nesbit&#x27;s Passing Parade&quot; titled “Grandpa Called It Art,” that showed several contemporary artists at work. Benton demonstrated his process for the camera, from obtaining a farmer&#x27;s permission to sketch his farm through making a three-dimensional model of the scene to the final painting.

During World War II, Benton created a series titled &quot;The Year of Peril&quot;, which portrayed the threat to American ideals by fascism and Nazism. The prints were widely distributed. Following the war, Regionalism fell from favor, eclipsed by the rise of Abstract Expressionism. Benton remained active for another 30 years, but his work included less contemporary social commentary and portrayed pre-industrial farmlands.
Benton was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot;, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plays. Benton was also an accomplished harmonica musician, recording an album for Decca Records in 1942 titled &quot;Saturday Night at Tom Benton&#x27;s&quot;.

He continued to paint murals, including &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1953), for Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri; &quot;Trading At Westport Landing&quot; (1956), for The River Club in Kansas City; &quot;Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls&quot; (1961) for the Power Authority of the State of New York; &quot;Joplin at the Turn of the Century&quot; (1972) in Joplin; and &quot;Independence and the Opening of the West&quot;, for the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence. His commission for the Truman Library mural led to his developing a friendship with Harry S. Truman that lasted until the former U.S. President&#x27;s death.

Benton died in 1975 at work in his studio, as he completed his final mural, &quot;The Sources of Country Music&quot;, for the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Legacy and honors==
Benton was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1954 as an Associate member and became a full member in 1956. In 1961, Benton was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. Honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.

In 1977, Benton&#x27;s 2 story late-Victorian residence and carriage house studio in Kansas City was designated by Missouri as the Thomas Hart Benton Home and Studio State Historic Site. The historic site has been preserved nearly unchanged from the time of his death; clothing, furniture, and paint brushes are still in place. Displaying 13 original works of his art, the house museum is open for guided tours. Benton was the subject of the eponymous 1988 documentary, &quot;Thomas Hart Benton&quot;, directed by Ken Burns and produced by WGBH-TV.

In December 2019, a lawsuit was filed by Benton&#x27;s daughter, Jessie, her son, and her two daughters against the UMB Bank, a trustee of the Benton Trusts and manager of Benton&#x27;s estate since 1979: &quot;More than a hundred paintings gone, priceless works of art stored in subpar conditions, paintings sold for fire sale prices – those are the allegations put forward by a new lawsuit filed by the heirs of famous American artist Thomas Hart Benton.&quot; The bank did not directly respond to the specific allegations in the lawsuit but characterized them as misguided. The bank&#x27;s president, Jim Rine, said that it regrets that the Bentons chose to resolve the issue through litigation and that the bank takes its role as trustee of Benton&#x27;s art very seriously.

<text>Cheddington is a village and civil parish in the Buckinghamshire district of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. The parish has an area of . 

The village is about 6 miles northeast of Aylesbury and three miles north of Tring in Hertfordshire. The hamlet of Cooks Wharf has grown up where the main road into the village from Pitstone crosses the Grand Union Canal.

==Archaeology==
At Southend Hill near the village are the remains of an Iron Age hill fort which has been largely obliterated through arable cultivation.

==History==
The earliest known record of the village is in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which it is called &quot;Cetendone&quot;, which is Old English for &quot;Cetta&#x27;s Hill&quot;. The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles was originally Norman. There is also a Methodist church with a large congregation.

Cheddington manor house is a much gabled and half-timbered red-brick building under a tiled roof, dating from the 16th century.

In 1963 Cheddington featured in the national press as it was near the location of the Great Train Robbery of 1963 at Bridego Railway Bridge in the hamlet of Ledburn.

In 1984, Cheddington received national notoriety as the location of the first assault by Malcolm Fairley, a violent armed rapist, nicknamed &quot;The Fox&quot; because of his cunning nocturnal attacks.

In the last thirty years Cheddington, due to its railway station and easy access to four towns, has more than quadrupled in size.

In 2005 Cheddington won the Buckinghamshire Best Kept Village Competition DeFraine Cup and also the Buckinghamshire Village of the Year Competition. It went on to win the East of England Young People award in the national competition. Cheddington also won the smaller villages category in the 2006 and 2007 Buckinghamshire Village of the Year Competition and received a special community building award.

==Amenities==
The village has two public houses: The Old Swan, a thatched inn, and The Three Horseshoes. A third inn, known as the Rosebery Arms, designed by the Victorian architect George Devey has been converted into houses.

Cheddington Combined School is a mixed community primary school that takes children between the ages of four and 11. The school has about 200 pupils, and its catchment area includes the neighbouring parishes of Horton and Slapton.

Cheddington has various clubs including a tennis club, a bell ringers&#x27; association, a badminton club, a history society, a bowls club, a petanque club and a football team.

==Transport==
Cheddington railway station, located approximately to the north of the village, is served by London Northwestern Railway services between and . The station opened in 1838 as &quot;Aylesbury Junction&quot;. The Cheddington to Aylesbury Line, which formerly ran between Cheddington and , closed in 1963.

<doc id="271937" wikidata="Q6733411" url="?curid=271937" title="Maharishi International University">
<text>Maharishi International University (MIU), formerly Maharishi University of Management, is a private university in Fairfield, Iowa. It was founded in 1971 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and practices a &quot;consciousness-based education&quot; system that includes the Transcendental Meditation technique. Its founding principles are the development of the full potential of the individual, fulfilling economic aspirations while maximizing proper use of the environment and bringing spiritual fulfillment and happiness to humanity.

The university is accredited through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and offers degree programs in art, business, education, communications, mathematical science, literature, physiology &amp; health, regenerative organic agriculture, Vedic Science and sustainable living.

The original campus in Goleta, California, moved in 1974 to a 370-acre campus in Fairfield, Iowa. During the 1990s many older buildings were demolished and replaced with green technology and the principles of ancient Vedic architecture. The university features an academic &quot;block system&quot; (only one subject for four weeks) and a diverse, multinational student body. It is said to offer an organic, vegetarian food program.

==History==

===1971–2004===

The concept for a university came out of a &quot;series of international symposia on Science of Creative Intelligence&quot; (SCI) attended by notable academics. It was established in 1971 by Nat Goldhaber. It was created with the belief that a school that incorporated the &quot;philosophy and techniques of Transcendental Meditation&quot; would create an &quot;unusual contribution to higher education&quot;.

It was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Robert Keith Wallace assumed his position as the first university president in 1973. Its first location was an apartment complex in Goleta, California. The university enrolled 700 students during its first year of operation. In August 1974, the university purchased the campus of the bankrupt Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, for $2.5 million and relocated there.

In 1975, the freshman and sophomore years consisted of interdisciplinary studies, and were organized in a modular format, with each course lasting a few weeks or months. All students, regardless of their previous education, were required to attend 24 interdisciplinary courses, some of which consisted of pre-recorded video tapes of &quot;resident faculty&quot; who were not on campus, while graduate students and teaching assistants played the video tapes and conducted discussions. Nobel Prize winner Melvin Calvin said that, even though he participated in a symposium on SCI, the use of his name in the MIU catalogue was &quot;perilously close to false advertising&quot;. John Lewis, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who created video-taped lectures for MIU, was supportive, saying that TM &quot;unblocks the student&#x27;s pathways to education&quot;. During this period, an open admissions policy was instituted, and transfer students were welcomed regardless of their academic history. In 1976, the accreditation evaluation team from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools said the 19 senior and 20 assistant faculty were &quot;creative in their vision for higher education and eminently qualified&quot;, and the university was granted &quot;candidate for accreditation&quot; status. At that time, faculty and administrators were paid &quot;approximately the same base salary of $275 per month&quot;, with additional compensation &quot;on a sliding scale for those with spouses and children&quot;, plus free housing in university dormitories. On campus, drugs and alcohol were &quot;shunned&quot; and a &quot;strong sense of community&quot; was said to pervade the institution.

Bevan Morris was appointed president and chairman of Maharishi International University&#x27;s board of trustees in 1979. The following year, the university received accreditation through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission, and became a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS). 1981 saw the completion of two 20,000 square foot meditation buildings called Golden Domes, that were built on campus for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs. By this time the Henn Mansion, Trustee Gymnasium and Ballard Hall buildings, built in the early 1900s, showed rapid deterioration. These buildings were scheduled to be demolished but the university spent $500,000 to restore Henn Mansion, starting 1984, and nominated six other buildings for the National Historic Register.

In July 1983, the &quot;Argus-Press&quot; reported that competing meditation seminar teacher, Robin Woodsworth Carlsen, had criticized and ridiculed the university in a full-page advertisement placed in a local newspaper and had filed a lawsuit against the university. As a result, &quot;many students&quot; who were distributing Carlsen&#x27;s literature on campus were asked to leave the campus and several were suspended with their meditation dome admission privileges revoked.

In December 1983, the university hosted a three-week &quot;Taste of Utopia&quot; conference with more than 7,000 participants and practitioners of the TM-Sidhi program &quot;from around the world&quot;. MIU president Morris later reported that research data indicated the conference had reduced violence in war-torn areas and inspired an increase in the Dow Jones stock index via the Maharishi Effect. By 1992, the university had 800 students from more than 70 countries, paying approximately $10,000 a year for their tuition and board.

In 1995, Maharishi International University changed its name to Maharishi University of Management (MUM). As part of its master plan to rebuild and expand the campus using natural materials and Maharishi Vastu Architecture design principles, many of the Parsons College buildings, which had high maintenance costs, were demolished, including Foster Hall. In 2019, the name was changed back to the original Maharishi International University.

In 2000, local preservationists protested the demolition of Parsons Hall, built in 1915, and Barhydt Chapel, designed in 1911 by Henry K. Holsman. University officials said that MIU would donate the buildings to any community group who could raise the $1 million needed to move what the local newspaper described as an &quot;ailing building&quot;. In response to protests the university ensured the survival of the chapel&#x27;s plaques, pipe organ, and stained glass windows, which are now displayed at the Fairfield Arts &amp; Convention Center. Between 2000 and 2005, the university demolished Carnegie Hall, Parsons Hall (1915), Barhydt Chapel (1911), Blum Stadium (1966), Laser Tower, the dining hall, and 38 dormitory-style &quot;pods&quot;. Seven student &quot;residence halls&quot; with single rooms were completed in 2005 using eco-friendly designs, natural materials and geo-thermal heating.

A stabbing incident occurred in 2004, when MIU student Shuvender Sem attacked two other students in separate incidents on the same day. He stabbed the first student with a pen and, hours later, fatally stabbed Levi Butler with a knife. Sem was found not guilty due to insanity and the university settled a lawsuit that charged it with negligence.

===2005–present===
Beginning in 2005, film director David Lynch hosted an annual &quot;David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation&quot; at MIU. The 2008 event included musical performances by Donovan, Moby, and Chrysta Bell. The fourth annual David Lynch Weekend of November 2009 featured Donovan, MIU professor John Hagelin, and the American debut of James McCartney, who performed at the Fairfield Arts &amp; Convention Center. The weekend conference was intended to appeal to those &quot;interested in creativity, film, art, sustainable living, organic agriculture, brain development, consciousness, meditation, natural medicine, renewable living [and] peace&quot;.

By 2007, the university had over 45 campus buildings, including 17 classroom and administrative buildings. Between 1974 and 2008, a total of 43 buildings were demolished and 70 new buildings erected in their place. At that time, MIU had 948 students (813 full time) of whom 78% were foreign students – the third-highest number of foreign students at an Iowa university that year. 71% of these students were enrolled in a graduate degree program. The largest age group was 25–29 years of age (42%). In this same year, MIU awarded 125 Master&#x27;s degrees and 34 Bachelor degrees.

In 2008, the Argiro Student Center was completed, featuring &quot;the most advanced green technologies&quot; and included dining areas, student cafe, book store, interdenominational chapel, auditorium, classrooms, exercise studio and student government offices.

In 2010, there were 1,210 students enrolled – 754 full-time and 456 part-time students, with 928 full- and part-time graduate students.

Enrollment in 2013 included 337 students from 54 countries and the university graduated the largest class in its history. That year the university began offering a program called the David Lynch MA in Film. The program&#x27;s segments include courses called Advanced Narrative, Advanced Screenwriting and Acting for Film. Other features include a three-month film project and question and answer sessions with Lynch both in-person and via Skype. As of August 2013, 826 graduate and undergraduate full-time students and 365 part-time students were enrolled at MIU. The following year, Jim Carrey delivered the university&#x27;s commencement address and received an honorary doctorate for his achievements as a comedian, artist, author, and philanthropist; his address has frequently been described as one of the best in the genre.

In 2016 Bevan Morris retired as president and the board of trustees appointed John Hagelin.

==Administration and faculty==
The board of trustees consists of 37 members and is chaired by Ed Malloy, former mayor of Fairfield. Other members include Bevan Morris, chairman emeritus of MIU, John Hagelin, honorary chairman, and Jeffrey Abramson, a partner in The Tower Companies. Past trustees include Ramani Ayer, former chairman of The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., retired major general and author Franklin M. Davis Jr., Theodore Dreier, an engineer and educator who was one of the founders of Black Mountain College, and Alfred L. Jenkins, a career diplomat who served as chairman of MIU for three years.

Notable past and present faculty at MIU include Arthur Aron and Elaine Aron, David Orme-Johnson, Ashley Deans, and Elaine Ingham.

In 2007 the university had 52 faculty members and average salaries for full-time faculty ranged from $6,678 for some instructors and assistant professors to $19,595 for full professors. In 2011, MIU was one of more than 1,000 corporations which requested a waiver to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#x27;s requirement to offer maximum payouts of $750,000 per employee.

==Campus==

The campus sits on located west of the Mississippi River. The grounds include wooded areas, fields and two small lakes with &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizing the campus setting as &quot;urban&quot;.

The original Parsons College campus included 60-80 buildings before closing due to bankruptcy, standing empty and being purchased by MIU. The Library Building continues to be used and houses the main library, classrooms, administrative offices, multimedia computer lab, Unity Art Gallery, Campus Security and Facilities Management. The library catalog includes 140,000 volumes, 60 reference databases and Internet reference resources, 7,000 electronic books, 12,000 full-text periodicals, special collections including the Science of Creative Intelligence Reserve Collection, &quot;Journal of Modern Science and Vedic Science&quot;, PhD dissertations by university students, and a Vedic literature collection. A campus-wide closed-circuit television network includes 10,000 hours of video- and audio-taped courses, conferences and presentations. Additional facilities include network plug-in ports for laptop users, support for international distance education students, and DVD/video rentals with over 1,500 titles. Inter-library loans include books and articles and access to the University of Iowa Library as well as to libraries worldwide.

Many structures have been replaced since 1974 as part of MIU&#x27;s master plan for reconstruction and expansion which includes careful attention to environmental conservation, incorporating renewable energy, state-of-the-art building technologies, natural building materials and Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles of architecture. Two golden domes were erected between 1980 and 1981 and are used for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and the TM-Sidhi program and have been called &quot;particle accelerators of consciousness&quot; by the university&#x27;s founder. The campus was &quot;thoroughly rebuilt&quot; in the 1990s and seven student residence halls, with single rooms, were completed in 2005 using eco-friendly designs, natural materials and geo-thermal heating. By 2007, the university had over 45 campus buildings, including 17 classroom and administrative buildings. Between 1974 and 2008, a total of 43 buildings had been demolished and 70 new buildings had been erected in their place. The newly-created Dreier Building houses the offices of Admissions, Alumni, Campus Reconstruction, Development, the dean of faculty, the deans of women and men, the Enrollment Center, the executive vice-president, legal counsel, Human Resources, and six classrooms.

The Argiro Student Center was completed in 2008 and houses a large, open reception area, dining rooms, kitchens, student cafe, student book store and shopping area, interdenominational chapel, an auditorium, classrooms, exercise studio, and student government offices. The building incorporates many principles of Vedic architecture such as eastern orientation, specific room placement size and proportions, energy efficiency, day lighting, non-toxic and natural building materials and &quot;higher than normal&quot; energy efficiency.

In 2012, the university completed construction of a Sustainable Learning Center (SLC) building. According to the university, the building sets a &quot;new global standard for green buildings&quot; by incorporating local building materials and being completely energy self-sufficient, even during its construction. It was designed to meet the Living Building Challenge requirements and become one of three buildings in the US to meet that standard as well as LEED Platinum certification. It houses both research and classroom activities and allows students to &quot;interactively monitor performance and energy efficiency&quot;. University officials hope this building proves that the county has the expertise for technological jumps of this kind.

==Academics==

===Accreditation and rankings===
The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The university’s business programs (BA, MBA, and PhD) are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE).

The &quot;Best Colleges 2013&quot; Master&#x27;s Midwest Category of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college and university rankings gave MIU (then called Maharishi University of Management) a tier two rating, which places the school in the bottom 25% of colleges. The report listed its application deadline as rolling, its acceptance rate as 41%, its freshman retention rate as 80%, and its student–faculty ratio as 12:1.

===Class structure===
Maharishi International University operates on a block system. Students take one course at a time during a four-week period.

===Consciousness-Based Education===

MIU is committed to achieving its goals through Consciousness-Based Education (CBE) which aims to unfold &quot;creative potential&quot; and create life in harmony with the laws of nature. CBE includes traditional subjects while simultaneously cultivating the student&#x27;s potential from within. As a component of Consciousness-Based Education, students and faculty practice the Transcendental Meditation technique twice daily. Both Consciousness-Based Education and Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) are said to include the personal experience and intellectual understanding of consciousness. Classes at MIU present subjects such as art, economics, physics, literature, and psychology in the context of these universal principles of consciousness. Before 2009 MIU freshmen and transfer students began their first semester with the 33-lesson SCI course. The university president, Morris, has credited the knowledge and principles of SCI with contributing to the success of its graduates and SCI degrees have been awarded to Morris, Doug Henning, Mike Tompkins, Benjamin Feldman, the finance minister for Global Country of World Peace, and author John Gray.

===Programs===
The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in 13 areas including Vedic science and sustainable living. According to a 2006 report in &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot;, MIU &quot;is establishing itself as a leader in sustainable living architecture&quot; among Iowa&#x27;s colleges and universities and offers a sustainable living program. The program includes a BS in Sustainable Living and an MBA in Sustainable Business. MIU is listed with the Institute for Sustainability as a university that offers eco-curriculums and a Bachelor of Science in &quot;sustainable living/environmental science&quot; which teaches students methods for designing and maintaining environmentally friendly communities. Course content includes sustainable practices for agriculture, technology, architecture, landscape design, business and the ecology of living systems.

MIU is reported to be the only university in the U.S. that offers a PhD degree in the Neuroscience of Human Consciousness. The university participates in a state-sponsored, fast-track license program for school teachers.

MIU also offers undergraduate programs in China.

===Health and ecology===

The university&#x27;s endeavor to create a sustainable campus include the use of green, energy-efficient architecture and community planning that incorporates Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architecture – a system of country, town, village, and home planning that utilizes natural building materials and procedures. The university operates an organic vegetable farm including a , year-round greenhouse, which provides students and faculty with a 100% organic food program. In 2011, the university participated in the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council&#x27;s solar energy project, Sustain Angoon.

===Sports and recreation===
MIU students compete in numerous team and individual sports. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf is an intercollegiate sport; men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer is a club sport. Intramural sports include soccer, archery, badminton, baseball, basketball, fencing, field hockey, football, rock climbing, sailing, swimming, tennis, ultimate Frisbee and weight lifting.

===Residence halls===
Single, furnished rooms are standard for all students to ensure quiet and privacy, and include high-speed Internet connections. Most residence halls are equipped with exercise and TV rooms. Freshmen are required to live on campus. Compared to other colleges, MIU offers dorm rooms to a higher than average percentage of its students.

==Research==
Maharishi International University publishes the &quot;Journal of Modern Science and Vedic Science&quot;. MIU faculty members have published on TM in scientific journals including the American Heart Association&#x27;s journals, &quot;Hypertension&quot; and &quot;Stroke&quot;.

Since the establishment of its research facilities, the university has been awarded over 150 federal, state, and private grants and contracts totaling over $24 million, including funding from the NIH&#x27;s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and its Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. In 2012, the US Department of Defense granted MIU and the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center $2.4 million to research the effectiveness of TM for the treatment of PTSD.

===Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention===
The Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention (INMP) (formerly the Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention) has received grants totaling over $10.5 million for research on prevention-oriented natural medicine. The university had received more than $20 million in funding from different branches of the National Institutes of Health as of 2002 The university&#x27;s Department of Physiology and the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention received $8 million from the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to establish the first research center in the U.S. specializing in &quot;natural&quot; preventive medicine for minorities.

===Views on research===
Lola Williamson, who practiced the TM-Sidhi program until 1981, wrote a book called &quot;Transcendent in America: Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion&quot;. In the book, she cites two former professors who in the late 1980s &quot;testified against the research practices conducted at the university&quot;. In the book, she writes that former MIU professor of economics and business law Anthony DeNaro alleged in 1986 that there was &quot;a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud ... designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science (not a cult), and fraudulently claim and obtain tax exempt status with the IRS&quot;. Williamson writes in her book that Dennis Roark, former dean of faculty and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, was a &quot;witness to routine suppression of negative data&quot; and that Roark wrote in a 1987 letter that it was his &quot;belief that the many scientific claims both to the factual evidence of unique, beneficial effects of T.M. and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but in fact in many ways fraudulent&quot;. Roark said &quot;he had questioned&quot; MIU faculty member Michael Dillbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck confirmed that it was impossible to make EEG measurements while the subjects are moving. Williamson writes in her book that Roark questioned other investigators &quot;regarding the alleged reduction in crime if enough people practice TM or the TM-Sidhi program&quot; and they &quot;confirmed that they had suppressed negative evidence&quot;. The EEG research referred to by Roark, which required researchers to make EEG measurements during the TM-Sidhi program, was subsequently published in two separate studies in the &quot;International Journal of Neuroscience&quot;. The editor-in-chief, Sydney Weinstein, said that the studies published in his journal are reviewed by &quot;a distinguished group of scientists from leading universities,&quot; and added, &quot;Not once have these scientists ever questioned the integrity or scientific validity of the papers on Transcendental Meditation.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;The Gazette&quot; (Cedar Rapids and Iowa City) and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reported that although &quot;a few years ago&quot; many &quot;major medical schools&quot; would have &quot;turned up their noses&quot; at the studies MIU was conducting, &quot;things have changed&quot; and MIU has received so many offers that it has &quot;turned away&quot; collaboration proposals from a few institutions. According to an MIU spokesperson, the university had received almost $18 million in grant support from the National Institutes of Health in the prior 15 years and &quot;its researchers are strict about scientific standards because they work more often with other, larger universities&quot; including the University of Iowa; University of California, Irvine; and University of Hawaii. The article reports that Maharishi University and the University of Iowa were working on a study that looked at the effects of holistic therapy on heart disease.

According to news reports in 2003, MIU&#x27;s Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention (CNMP) was in collaboration with a &quot;growing list of mainstream universities&quot; including Howard University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the University of Pennsylvania, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and the University of California at Irvine. According to the article, &quot;mainstream medical researchers – including many scientists suspicious of spiritualism&quot; no longer believe that MIU&#x27;s research is junk science.

==Reception==
MIU has received both criticism and acclaim. Author Samuel Schuman reports that while many in the higher education community did not take the university seriously when it began in 1974, the college has &quot;persisted cheerfully&quot; for more than three decades and its achievements and results are &quot;incontestably impressive&quot;. Some members of the local community were initially against the university with 540 residents signing a petition protesting the local school board for allowing four MIU students to visit the public schools as observers. However, author William Jefferson reports that by 1976, 200 local people had &quot;taken up Transcendental Meditation themselves&quot; and compared to the &quot;wild and woolly&quot; students of the prior college, &quot;nearly all the residents now agree that they [MIU students] are nice people to have around&quot;.

A 1976 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the campus as a &quot;cheerful, optimistic place where people smile a lot and tend to be considerate and trusting&quot;. In 1992, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the university was a place where all students and faculty meditate, and all the Maharishi&#x27;s teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations, while noting it is &quot;an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students&quot;. The article goes on to say that even as the university gains research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faces controversy. For example, one critic, 1979 alumnus Curtis Mailloux, called the campus a &quot;coercive environment&quot; with a &quot;propensity for fraudulent research&quot;. Accreditation officials say they are aware of these accusations and &quot;have been aggressive in checking Marahishi International&#x27;s academic freedom&quot;. The deputy director of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), Steven D. Crow, says &quot;Every move the university&#x27;s made has been monitored&quot; and MIU&#x27;s library, faculty, academic mission and classroom space have been deemed appropriate. At the same time, John W. Patterson a professor at Iowa State University, has harshly criticized The North Central Association&#x27;s evaluation, saying it &quot;does nothing more than to lend credibility to these crackpots&quot;. The article also reports that many non-students have moved to the city of Fairfield &quot;so they can meditate in the [campus meditation] domes&quot;.

In 1986, seven &quot;former devotees&quot; filed a fraud suit against the Maharishi saying they paid thousands of dollars for lessons at Maharishi International University that were designed to reduce stress, improve memory, reverse aging, and develop clairvoyance and levitation. One plaintiff said that after ten years he had not acquired any of the special abilities that were promised. According to reviews of the 1992 book, &quot;Heaven on Earth – Dispatches from America’s Spiritual Frontier&quot;, author and reporter Michael D&#x27;Antonio wrote that the MIU physics department was teaching theories that he believed were &quot;dead wrong&quot; and alleged that the university had taken Transcendental Meditation &quot;into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightenment&quot;.

MIU is listed in Peterson&#x27;s &quot;440 Great Colleges for Top Students 2010&quot;. According to the National Survey of Student Engagement MIU scored in the top 3% for &quot;active and collaborative learning,&quot; in the top 4% for &quot;enriching educational experience,&quot; in the top 7% for &quot;student/faculty interaction,&quot; in the top 8% for &quot;supportive campus environment,&quot; and in the top 26% for &quot;level of academic challenge.&quot; MIU graduates also gave their college experience a &quot;higher than average satisfaction&quot; rating as recorded in the &quot;annual ACT alumni survey.&quot; Specifically, 73% said they would choose MIU again, more than twice the national average of 32%.

The university has been categorized as a &quot;Sierra Club Cool School&quot; and in 2014 was ranked as the fourth best environmental science school by career guide website, Environmental Science.

==In popular culture==
The Beach Boys recorded their 1978 album &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; on the campus, and named it after the university.
&quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, a biopic of entertainer Andy Kaufman, includes a scene at Maharishi International University in which Kaufman is asked to leave a retreat because his behavior was unbecoming an enlightened individual. In October 2011, Oprah Winfrey visited MIU, toured the campus and attended a group meditation in the golden dome for women. Video footage of her visit to the MIU campus was shown on an episode of her show.

==Notable alumni and faculty==

In 1994, the son of Mozambique&#x27;s president, Joaquim Chissano, and several children of the country&#x27;s Cabinet members, attended the university on scholarships.

<text>Virkon is a multi-purpose disinfectant. It contains potassium peroxymonosulfate (an oxidizing agent), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (a detergent), sulfamic acid (a cleaning agent), and inorganic buffers. It is typically used for cleaning up hazardous spills, disinfecting surfaces and soaking equipment. The solution is used in many areas, including hospitals, laboratories, nursing homes, funeral homes, dental and veterinary facilities, and anywhere else where control of pathogens is required.

1% Virkon has a wide spectrum of activity against viruses, some fungi, and bacteria. This includes at least 300 strains/clinical isolates from 76 bacteria, 47 strains/clinical isolates from 35 viruses, and 45 strains/clinical isolates from 17 fungi.

It has been proven effective against SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is less effective against spores and fungi than some alternative disinfectants.

<doc id="271942" wikidata="Q380484" url="?curid=271942" title="David Packard">
<text>David Packard ( ; September 7, 1912 – March 26, 1996) was an American electrical engineer and co-founder, with Bill Hewlett, of Hewlett-Packard (1939), serving as president (1947–64), CEO (1964–68), and chairman of the board (1964–68, 1972–93) of HP. He served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1969 to 1971 during the Nixon administration. Packard served as president of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) from 1976 to 1981 and chairman of its board of regents from 1973 to 1982.
He was a member of the Trilateral Commission. Packard was the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988 and is noted for many technological innovations and philanthropic endeavors.

==Personal life==
Packard was born in Pueblo, Colorado, the son of Ella (Graber) and Sperry Sidney Packard, an attorney. He attended Centennial High School, where early on he showed an interest in science, engineering, sports, and leadership. Packard earned his B.A. from Stanford University in 1934, where he earned letters in football and basketball and attained membership in Phi Beta Kappa society and was a Brother of the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Fraternity. Stanford is where he met two people who were important to his life, Lucile Salter and Bill Hewlett. Packard briefly attended the University of Colorado at Boulder before taking a position with the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York. In 1938, he returned to Stanford, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering later that year. In the same year, he married Lucile Salter, with whom he had four children: David, Nancy, Susan, and Julie. Lucile Packard died in 1987 (age 72).

== Hewlett-Packard ==
In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard&#x27;s garage with an initial capital investment of $538 (). Packard mentions in his book &quot;The HP Way&quot; that the name Hewlett-Packard was determined by the flip of a coin: HP, rather than PH. Their first product was an audio frequency oscillator, 8 of which were sold to Walt Disney Studios for testing sound equipment used to produce &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

The company grew into the world&#x27;s largest producer of electronic testing and measurement devices. It also became a major producer of calculators, computers, and laser and ink jet printers.

HP incorporated in 1947, with Packard becoming its first president, serving in that role until 1964. He was then elected chief executive officer and chairman of the board, holding those positions through 1968. Packard left HP in 1969 to serve in the Nixon administration until 1971, at which time he returned to HP and was re-elected chairman of the board, serving from 1972 to 1993. In 1991, Packard oversaw a major reorganization at HP. He retired from HP in 1993. At the time of his death in 1996, Packard&#x27;s stake in the company was worth more than $1 billion.

Packard was criticized for expanding into South Africa, where HP equipment was used to implement apartheid. In 1980, he presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for HP&#x27;s headquarters in Johannesburg. When Nebraska became the first US state government to divest from South Africa, Packard remarked &quot;I&#x27;d rather lose business in Nebraska than with South Africa.&quot;

At Packard&#x27;s instruction, the domain name &quot;HP.com&quot; was registered on March 3, 1986, and as such was one of the earliest to be registered.

== Department of Defense ==
Upon assuming the US presidency in 1969, Richard Nixon appointed Packard United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. Packard resigned in December 1971 and returned to Hewlett-Packard in 1972 as chairman of the board.

While serving in the Department of Defense (DoD), he brought concepts of resource management used in business to the military, as well as establishing the Defense Systems Management College. In 1970, Packard issued a memorandum that contained a number of major reforms designed to address &quot;the real mess we have on our hands.&quot; A key reform was elimination of Robert MacNamara&#x27;s Total Package Procurement except in rare situations.

Near the end of his time at DoD, Packard wrote the &quot;Packard Memo&quot; or &quot;Employment of Military Resources in the Event of Civil Disturbances&quot;. Enacted in February 1972, the act describes exceptions to the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limited the powers of the federal government to use the U.S. military for law enforcement, except where expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress — noting that the Constitution provides an exception when needed &quot;to prevent loss of life or wanton destruction of property and to restore governmental functioning and public order when sudden and unexpected civil disturbances, disasters, or calamities seriously endanger life and property and disrupt normal governmental functions to such an extent that duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situations&quot; and &quot;to protect Federal property and Federal governmental functions when the need for protection exists and duly constituted local authorities are unable or decline to provide adequate protection&quot;. § 214.5 states that &quot;employment of DoD military resources for assistance to civil authorities in controlling civil disturbances will normally be predicated upon the issuance of a Presidential Executive order or Presidential directive authorizing&quot;, with exceptions &quot;limited to:
#Cases of sudden and unexpected emergencies as described in §215.4(c)(1)(i), which require that immediate military action be taken.
#Providing military resources to civil authorities as prescribed in §215.9 of this part.&quot;
According to Lindorff, these exceptions reinstate the possibility of martial law in the U.S., prohibited since 1878.

In the 1970s and 1980s Packard was a prominent advisor to the White House on defense procurement and management. He served as chairman of The Business Council in 1973 and 1974. From 1985 to 1986, he served as chairman of The Packard Commission.

== Philanthropy ==
From the early 1980s until his death in 1996, Packard dedicated much of his time and money to philanthropic projects. In 1964, Packard and his wife had established the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. In 1986, they donated $40 million toward building what became the Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital at Stanford University; the new hospital opened in June 1991. Prompted by his daughters Nancy and Julie, in 1978 David and Lucile had created the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation. The couple eventually donated $55 million to build the new aquarium, which opened in 1984 with Julie Packard as its executive director. In 1987, Packard gave $13 million to create the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Packard and Hewlett made a combined donation of $77 million to Stanford in 1994, for which the university named the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building in his honor.

Packard was a member of the American Enterprise Institute&#x27;s board of trustees. He died on March 26, 1996, at age 83 in Stanford, California, leaving approximately $4 billion (the bulk of his estate) to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, including large amounts of valuable real property in Los Altos Hills. All three Packard daughters sit on the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees. David Woodley Packard, his son, serves as president of the Packard Humanities Institute.

Packard&#x27;s old home and garage in Palo Alto, California were placed on the California registry of historic places as &quot;The Birthplace of Silicon Valley&quot;. He also had an oil tanker named for him. The &quot;David Packard&quot;, built in 1977, was operated for Chevron, had a capacity and was registered under the Bahamian flag. In 2021, MBARI built a new research vessel named &quot;R/V David Packard&quot; in honor of him as their founder.

<text>The Simpson chain or Simpson lever chain was an English-made bicycle chain invented by William Spiers Simpson (died 1917) in 1895. The design departed from the standard roller bicycle chain: it was composed of linked triangles forming two levels. The inner level was driven by the chainring and the outer drove the rear cog. Instead of teeth, the chainring and cog had grooves into which the rollers of the chain engaged. The chain was known in the German as &quot;die&quot; &quot;Simpson-Hebelkette&quot;, and in French as &quot;la&quot; &quot;chaîne à levier Simpson&quot;.

Simpson made claims, widely discredited, that the levers of this chain provided a mechanical advantage that could amplify energy produced by the cyclist. Simpson hired top cyclists such as Constant Huret, Lisette Marton, and Tom Linton (of &quot;Paris-Bordeaux&quot; fame), and the &quot;Gladiator Pacing Team&quot; from France to race for high stakes in England for the &quot;Chain Matches&quot;. His teams were largely successful.

Jimmy Michael (depicted in the first draft of the Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s advertisement) attended the so-called Chain Race at Catford track in 1896. Simpson was so insistent that it was an improvement over conventional chains that he staked part of his fortune on it.

Pryor Dodge wrote:
In the fall of 1895, Simpson offered ten-to-one odds that riders with his chain would beat cyclists with regular chains. Later known as the chain matches, these races at the Catford track in London attracted huge crowds estimated between twelve and twenty thousand in June 1896. Simpson&#x27;s team not only included the top racers – Tom Linton, Jimmy Michael, and Constant Huret – but also the Gladiator pacing team brought over from Paris. Pacers enabled a racer to ride faster by shielding him from air resistance. Although Simpson won the chain matches, they only proved that the Gladiator pacers were superior to their English rivals.

Crowds up to 20 000 attended the chain races and &quot;Simpson &quot;v&quot; was an argument to be heard where cyclists foregathered.&quot;

Bill Mills of &quot;The Bicycle&quot; recalled: &quot;All the events were distance races, with multi-cycle pacing. This was the heyday of pacing, when the famous Dunlop team of quads and triplets was available. Dunlops arranged the pacing for the plain chain men, and turned out some 80 riders and £2 000-worth of pacing machines. Simpson&#x27;s brought over the Gladiator team of pacemakers from Paris, consisting of 12 assorted quads and quints [five-man bicycles] and several triplets.&quot;

When the 1890s cycling boom ended, the Simpson Lever Chain company collapsed spectacularly, under the stewardship of the notorious entrepreneur and financier Ernest Terah Hooley, who had earlier acquired the rights to the chain from Simpson. The company was ultimately wound up in 1898, prompting the first of Hooley&#x27;s four bankruptcies.

This invention would probably have been long forgotten except that:
* The Simpson Chain is portrayed in a work of the French Post-Impressionist artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.
* The Simpson Lever Chain Racing Team employed the Belgian cyclist Hélène Dutrieu who became a stunt cyclist and pioneering aviator.
* Simpson&#x27;s promotions were so widespread and effective that much of his promotional material is collected today.

<doc id="271945" wikidata="Q6733417" url="?curid=271945" title="Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health">
<text>Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH) (also known as Maharishi Ayurveda or Maharishi Vedic Medicine) is a form of alternative medicine founded in the mid-1980s by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who developed the Transcendental Meditation technique (TM). Distinct from traditional ayurveda, it emphasizes the role of consciousness, and gives importance to positive emotions. Maharishi Ayur-Veda has been variously characterized as emerging from, and consistently reflecting, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, representing the entirety of the ayurvedic tradition.

A 1991 article in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (JAMA) found that promoters of MVAH failed to disclose financial incentives when they submitted a letter for publication and that their marketing practices were misleading. A 2008 study published in JAMA reported that two of the 19 Maharishi Ayurveda products tested contained heavy metals. A 1991 British case found two physicians guilty of &quot;serious professional misconduct&quot; for using MVAH in the unsuccessful treatment of HIV.

==Theoretical basis==

Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health uses a model for understanding health and disease that is fundamentally different from that of modern medicine. According to MVAH researcher Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence whereas he feels modern medicine views the body as a machine. He says that the world view of MVAH is closer to the reality described by 20th century physics, which challenged the reductionist materialist world view by finding that quantum mechanical phenomena contradict the idea of solid matter, that causality is less definite, that material existence is connected in unexpected and nonlocal ways, and that a reductionist view is untenable at the quantum level. Sharma says that &quot;Vedic thought discusses a unified field of pure, non-material intelligence and consciousness whose modes of vibration manifest as the material universe.&quot; Disease results from losing connection with this underlying field of intelligence.

==Components==
The approach does not use modern medicine or biology. According to Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence. Proponents claim that through MVAH, the Maharishi revived the ancient Vedic system of health care. MVAH identifies 40 approaches, each said to be based on one of the 40 branches of Vedic literature.

In &quot;Alternative Medicine and Ethics&quot;, Stephen Barrett describes 20 components to Maharishi Ayurveda:
The full range of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda program &#x27;for creating healthy individuals and a disease free society&#x27; has 20 components: development of higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use of primordial sounds, correction of the &quot;mistake of the intellect&#x27;, strengthening of the emotions, vedic structuring of language, music therapy, enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psychophysiological integration, neuromuscular integration, neurorespiratory integration, purification (to remove &#x27;impurities due to faulty diet or behavioral patterns&#x27;), dietary measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, nourishing the environment and promoting world health and peace. Most of these cost several hundred dollars but some cost thousands and require the service of an ayurvedic practitioner.

A traditional vaidya treats patients individually, diagnosing them and then individually preparing or instructing the patient how to prepare treatments for the entire complexity of their individual symptoms, whereas Maharishi Ayur-Veda takes a mass-market approach.

===Technique===

The TM technique is the main modality which proponents say improves mental health and promotes &quot;collective health&quot; in MVAH. A 2007 review of meditative practices that included Transcendental Meditation concluded that the definitive health effects of meditation cannot be determined as the scientific evidence was of poor quality, though the review has been criticized for using an inappropriate method for assessing quality. The review found that TM &quot;had no advantage over health education to improve measures of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, stress, anger, self-efficacy, cholesterol, dietary intake, and level of physical activity in hypertensive patients&quot;. Another review did find a reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in those who practiced TM compared to controls. The review and its primary author were partially funded by Howard Settle, a proponent of TM.

===Pulse diagnosis===
Practitioners utilize pulse diagnosis (known in Sanskrit as &quot;nadi vigyan&quot;), which they say is like &quot;plugging into the inner intelligence of the body&quot;. Based on &quot;imbalances&quot;, recommendations related to herbal preparations, diet, daily and seasonal routines, exercise, and physiological purification are offered. Proponents say that the pulse can be used to detect &quot;imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice&quot;. According to Deepak Chopra and Sharma, pulse diagnosis can detect a variety of diseases, including those unrelated to the cardiovascular system, including asthma, cancer, and diabetes. William Jarvis, president of The National Council Against Health Fraud, described pulse diagnosis as a variety of palm reading and that Chopra refused to have pulse diagnosis tested by JAMA in a blinded protocol &quot;on the grounds that a blinded experiment would &#x27;eliminate the most crucial component of the experiment, which is consciousness.&#x27;&quot;
===Multimodal therapies===
MVAH health centers and spas offer a series of multimodal therapies including a purification therapy called panchakarma. Panchakarma means &quot;five actions&quot;, and is intended to clear impurities from the body and to balance the doṣas. The first preparatory step is called &quot;snehana&quot;, involving the ingestion of prescribed quantities of ghee over several days, followed by a purgative. The actual panchakarma then begins with &quot;abhyanga&quot;, a herbalized full-body oil massage and continues with one or more additional treatments, including &quot;svedana&quot;, a herbalized steam bath; &quot;shirodhara&quot;, in which warm sesame oil is poured on the forehead; &quot;nasya&quot;, an oil massage of head, neck and shoulders combined with steam inhalation and nasal drops; and &quot;basti&quot;, a herbal enema. Additional therapies generally undertaken in association with panchakarma are &quot;Maharishi Gandharva Veda&quot; music therapy and aromatherapy. Typical panchakarma treatments take 2 hours per day, over the course of 3 to 14 days, and are recommended several times per year as ideal, usually in conjunction with the change of seasons.

===Products===

Herbal products are manufactured and distributed by several Maharishi Ayurveda companies, including: Maharishi Ayurveda Products Pvt. Ltd. (MAPPL) in New Delhi, Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Europe B.V., in the Netherlands. Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) of Colorado Springs sells more than 400 products and in 2000, was said to be the largest ayurvedic company in North America, with reported sales of $20 million in 1999. Some ayurvedic herbal formulas are called rasayanas that use whole plants in various combinations.

====Maharishi Amrit Kalash====
The original Maharishi Ayurveda product is Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK), a two-part ancient formula introduced by Balraj Maharishi based on classical ayurvedic texts and referred to as &quot;nectar&quot; and &quot;ambrosia&quot; or &quot;MAK-4&quot; and &quot;MAK-5&quot;. It uses a combination of dozens of different herbs and fruits. Ingredients include herbs such as white musali, liquorice, giant potato, aswagandha, gum arabic tree, Indian asparagus, caper, aloe, &quot;Curculigo orchioides&quot;, amla, &quot;Tinospora cordifolia&quot;, simpleleaf chastetree and elephant creeper.

====Heavy metals====
A 2008 study by Robert B. Saper, published in JAMA, found that one-fifth of 213 ayurvedic samples manufactured in either the U.S. or India and obtained via the Internet contained detectable levels of heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury or lead. Two of 19 MAPI products tested, &quot;Vital Lady&quot; and &quot;Worry Free&quot; were found to have detectable levels of lead, while the others had no detectable levels of lead, mercury, or arsenic. Ted Wallace, president of MAPI, stated that the company tests its products before and after shipment from India to the US, and that its products are examined for purity, heavy metals, residual pesticides, and biological contaminants.

Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association said that eliminating every trace of arsenic, mercury or lead from products would require &quot;an entirely new food supply&quot;. According to McGuffin, the government and professional agencies set widely different safety standards for lead, mercury and arsenic and that while most of the products in Saper&#x27;s article have lead levels that exceed California&#x27;s standard, only two violate the World Health Organization&#x27;s standard. A 2008 review has stated that &quot;adverse health outcomes at blood lead levels below this threshold have been well demonstrated&quot;, and concluded that &quot;it is increasingly acknowledged there is no threshold for the adverse consequences of lead exposure&quot;.

In 2008, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court against Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation (&quot;MVED&quot;), Maharishi Ayurveda Foundation and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Ltd. (&quot;MAP Ltd&quot;). The Plaintiff claims that she contracted lead poisoning from &quot;Garbhapal Ras,&quot; an herbo-mineral product she purchased in India. According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, Garbhapal Ras contained nearly 3% lead. The product was manufactured by MAP Ltd. in India, and prescribed for her by a physician at the Maharishi Ayurveda Arogyadham clinic in Delhi. A spokesperson said that MVED is not involved in the manufacturing, prescribing, or sale of products from the Indian clinic where the product was prescribed and purchased. The spokesperson said that products sold in the U.S. are subject to inspection, testing, and quality control.

David Whitley, director of &quot;Ayurveda Limited&quot; in the United Kingdom, writes that the Maharishi Ayurveda Council of Vaidyas approves of the use of arsenic, lead, and mercury under the supervision of trained and certified vaidyas, in accordance with ancient Ayurvedic texts. He claims that the benefits of heavy metals are increased and the side effects are minimized when used properly. Whitley acknowledges that these compounds cannot be licensed for sale in the UK.

===Maharishi Sthapatya Veda===
 Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV), is a system of Vedic architecture. Maharishi Global Construction in Fairfield, Iowa designs buildings which &quot;connect the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe&quot;, saying that homes with entrances facing west invite &quot;poverty, lack of creativity and vitality&quot; and &quot;anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies&quot;. In Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, the architect takes into account three major factors: the orientation of the structure, room placement and the proportion of the rooms, windows, doors, walls etc. and their dimensions.

===Maharishi Vedic Astrology===
Maharishi Vedic Astrology (also known as Maharishi Jyotish) premises that planets influence individual health. Jotyish is a vedanga within the field of vedic literature. Maharishi Jyotish is premised on the ability to precisely calculate mathematically the unfolding pattern of life, and to locate the trends and tendencies of an individual life within that pattern, making it possible to determine in advance whether a difficult period was coming, and to take action in the present to amend a future difficulty. Maharishi Jyotish asserts that the solar system has an influence on the human brain, cells and DNA. According to the Maharishi and his successor, Tony Nader, there is a correspondence between the nine Grahas of Vedic Astrology and the structure of DNA, the brain and the structure of cells. Each graha is associated with a gemstone: Maharishi Vedic Astrology associates the planets with the basal ganglia, thalmus and hypothalamus; the 12 Bhavas (astrological houses) with cortical areas; the 12 Rashis (zodiac signs) with the cranial nerves; and the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions) with groups of the brainstem.

====Yagyas====
Correction of imbalances discovered through Maharishi Jyotish is possible, the Maharishi said, through the performance of &quot;yagyas&quot; by vedic pandits in India. Yagyas are ceremonies designed to restore the balance between the individual and the environment. Yagyas performed on Maha Shivaratri, (the day of Shiva), are said to enliven spiritual and material aspects of one&#x27;s consciousness, and to promote progress in all areas of life; those performed on Maha Lakshmi are said to bring prosperity, growth and good fortune; while those performed on Akshaya Tritiya are said to enhance lasting success in one&#x27;s activities.

Andrew Skolnick describes Maharishi Yagyas as Hindu ceremonies to appease the gods and beseech their help on behalf of afflicted followers that can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and which the patient neither takes part in nor witnesses. He wrote that, while Chopra and Nancy Lonsdorf, medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Center in Washington, D.C. denied that they prescribed yagyas or that yagyas were part of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, Chopra&#x27;s Lancaster Center did recommend yagyas for its patients, and a TM-Movement fundraising letter states that Lonsdorf prescribed an $11,500 yagya for a seriously ill patient of hers.

According to Skolnick, patients with serious illnesses often paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers. The movement&#x27;s company called &quot;Jyotish Gems&quot; sells gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers to ward off the effects of bad influences in one&#x27;s horoscope.

Nader writes that various gemstones correspond to the planets of Maharisi Jyotish, and also correspond to parts of the body. The Maharishi described Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems (MLG) as a vedic technology. According to Rainer Picha, Minister of Health for the Global Country of World Peace, training in the therapeutic use of gemstones is conducted at the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Holland.

====Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology====
According to its website, Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology (MVVT), &quot;utilizes a refined impulse of Vedic sound, or Vedic vibration, to enliven the inner intelligence of the body and restore proper functioning&quot;. According to author Cynthia Ann Humes MVVT consists of the recitation of mantras from Vedic or other orthodox texts by the MVVT expert, while blowing on or touching the afflicted body part. &quot;Frontiers in Bioscience&quot; published two studies online in 2001, including one by Tony Nader, the Lebanese neuro-scientist and researcher, who succeeded the Maharishi.

====Sound therapy====
A form of classical Indian music called Maharishi Gandharva Veda is purported to integrate and harmonize the cycles and rhythms of the listener&#x27;s body. Gandharva Veda is an upaveda and is codified in a number of texts that came to be known collectively at Gandharva Veda, an auxiliary text attached to Sama Veda. Mukund Lath writes that Gandharva Veda is a sacred corpus of music, derived from the still more ancient sama, a sacred Vedic form of music. Compact discs of the music are published by the Maharishi University of Management Press.

Listening to recitation in Sanskrit from a specific branch of the vedic literature that corresponds to the appropriate area of the body as determined by a MVAH expert.

==Health Centers==

According to the movement&#x27;s Global Good News website, there are 23 Maharishi Vedic Health Centres in 15 countries. In 2011, the Maharishi Ayurveda Hospital in New Delhi, India became the first ayurvedic hospital in Northern India to receive accreditation from the National Hospital Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH). The Raj is a health spa in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa. Deepak Chopra founded the spa in 1987 and was its medical director. Ayurvedic spas have also been established in two locations in Germany: Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bissendorf in Lower Saxony.

==Training==
Courses to train physicians, nurses and health professionals in the principles and practices of Maharishi Ayurveda are offered by the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Association of America (MAAA) in various locations in the USA. These courses include Continuing Medical Education credit. The faculty and curriculum committee of the MAAA include: Stuart Rothenberg, Robert Schneider, Walter Moelk, Nancy Lonsdorf, Richard Averbach, Gary Kaplan, and Vaidya Manohar Palakurthi. Courses are offered in conjunction with the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, California.

Courses in Maharishi Ayur-Veda for health professionals are also conducted at the Maharishi College of Perfect Health, International Maharishi Ayur-Veda Training Centre at MERU, Holland. These courses include: post graduate training, Maharishi Aroma Therapy, Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems, Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Educator, Vedic Mind-Body program and Presentation of Medical Research. The faculty includes Rainer Picha, Walter Mölk, Robert Keith Wallace, Roswitha Margarete Geelvink-Tradel, and Bob Apon.

The Maharishi College of Vedic Medicine was located at 2721 Arizona Street, NE Albuquerque, New Mexico in the 1990s and 2000s. There is now a campus in San Diego.

==Origin of Ayurveda and its relationship to Maharishi Ayurveda==
Maharishi Ayur-Veda is described as a modern restoration of the holistic perspective of the original texts of Ayurveda found in the Vedas. In MVAH, the Veda is said to be an &quot;abstract blueprint of creation&quot;. The knowledge and technologies of MVAH are based on the understanding that the order displayed throughout the entire universe, including within the human physiology, is governed by a fundamental underlying intelligence. According to the Maharishi, illness comes about when there is a lack of coordination between the body&#x27;s inner intelligence and its outer expression.

As with traditional Ayurveda, Maharishi Ayur Veda describes material creation according to panchamahābhūtas theory, in which the five elements of earth, air, fire, water and ether combine to form three doṣas: vāta, pitta and kapha. The theory of both traditional and Maharishi Ayurveda is that the body&#x27;s function is governed by the three doṣas, which designate body types and the physical and mental traits they typify. An individual&#x27;s doṣa contains various combinations of vāta, pitta and kapha, which can vary with the seasons and time of day. Disease symptoms are attributed to imbalances in one&#x27;s doṣa, which can be detected through pulse diagnosis or a questionnaire. Balance is achieved through a variety of products and procedures, many of which are specific to one&#x27;s doṣa. Maharishi Ayur-Veda does not stray from these traditional common interpretations of doṣa.

Maharishi Ayur Veda emerges from and consistently reflects the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, and is the upaveda of Atharva Veda. Maharishi Ayur Veda represents itself as representing the entirety of the Ayurvedic tradition.

The practices of Maharishi Ayur-Veda are said to be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward gentleness, avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India. He also says that Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories. In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers. The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one&#x27;s life to the natural rhythms of the body.

Maharishi Ayur Veda also holds that perfect health is a state present within every person, that can be chosen by the individual, and that the physical body is a portal to a &quot;quantum mechanical body&quot; that exists at the subatomic level where matter and energy are one, and that every organ and process in the body has a quantum equivalent. Tony Nader, called Maharajadhiraj Raja Ram, who is the Sovereign Ruler of the Global Country of World Peace, identifies this concept of &quot;quantum healing&quot; with the Maharishi&#x27;s theories of Vedic Science.

Individual metabolic differences and seasonal variations as described in MAV are an important part of a healthy diet. MAV considers taste and quality to be central features in the classification of foods, and seasonal factors as crucial in determining nutritional needs. MAV also advises use of certain herbal nutritional supplements to maintain optimum health.

Deepak Chopra, founding president of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, Inc (MAPI), the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine and former medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine, says, according to Stephen Barrett in an article in the journal &quot;Alternative Medicine and Ethics&quot;, that &quot;If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease.&quot; Barrett goes on to say that, while the TM technique and other relaxation techniques may temporarily relieve stress, claims made by Chopra that happy or sad thought may affect the molecular levels of the body and the immune system have no scientific basis.

==Reception==
According to the book &quot;Global and Modern Ayurveda&quot;, while Maharishi Ayur-Veda was instrumental in the popularization of Ayurveda in the 1980s and early 1990s, its role in global Ayurveda has now been marginalized. Authors Smith and Wujastyk attribute the virtual disappearance of MAV as an influence in global Ayurveda to the following factors: (i) isolating and describing itself as being authentic, thereby inferring that other forms of Ayurveda are &quot;disbarred from legitimacy&quot;; (ii) raising &quot;its prices stratospherically&quot; for its medicines and treatments, which placed it beyond the means of all but &quot;the most committed and enthusiastic (and wealthy) followers&quot;; and (iii) &quot;become stridently opposed to allopathic medicine&quot;. In the same volume, Suzanne Newcombe cites criticism of the commercial nature of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, but says that &quot;Maharishi Ayur-Veda is an important part of the practice of Ayurveda in contemporary society, despite the ideological claims of those who oppose the system.&quot; Smith and Wujastyk write that previously it was a requirement that MAV practitioners have a medical degree, but in 2005, all medical doctors with MAV training were replaced by Maharishi Ayurveda practitioners from India.

Author Philip Goldberg writes that Maharishi Ayurveda &quot;attracted attention&quot; due to the &quot;TM movement&#x27;s aggressive promotion&quot;. Author Frederick M. Smith writes that in the UK &quot;the Maharishi organization had a clear marketing plan and a full-time public relations officer up until at least 1992.&quot; In 1991, journalist Andrew Skolnick wrote that the TM movement&#x27;s marketing of Maharishi Ayurveda was a &quot;widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media.&quot; These were seen as efforts to gain &quot;scientific respectability&quot;. According to an article by Ralph Smith, a similar concern was raised in the 1980 book &quot;TM and Cult Mania&quot;.

===Chalmers and Davis===
In October 1991, the Professional Conduct Committee of the British General Medical Council found Roger Chalmers, Dean of Medicine of the unrecognized Maharishi University of Natural Law, Mentmore and Leslie Davis, Dean of Physiology at that institution, guilty of &quot;Serious Professional Misconduct&quot; in connection with their use of Maharishi Ayur-Veda for the treatment of AIDS and HIV, and ordered them erased from the List of Registered Medical Practitioners. (Chalmers was subsequently reinstated.) The Committee found, among other things, that there were no proper and approved clinical trials for the treatments, there was inadequate scientific evidence to support the treatments, that they were prescribing and that they had made false and misleading statements on the value of MAV in the treatment of HIV and AIDS and about the TM-affiliated &quot;World Medical Association for Perfect Health&quot;.

Independent tests of the pills prescribed by Chalmers and Davis showed that they had, at best, a negligible effect on HIV, but were 100,000 times more toxic than AZT. According to a 1990 report in &quot;The Independent&quot; regarding the accusations, the claim that Maharishi Ayurvedic has no side effects &quot;appears to be inaccurate.&quot; The article says that separate warnings had been issued in the past on side-effects of both Transcendental Meditation and the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet, such as a warning by the British Dietetic Association on the potential dangers of the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet to AIDS patients.
According to Suzanne Newcombe, alternative treatments often receive little attention in the U.K. and MAV was the focus of GMC only because the treatments involved AIDS patients, which she characterized as a vulnerable and controversial group at the time.

===Sharma and Chopra===
In 1991, the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) published an article on the benefits of Maharishi Ayur-Veda titled &quot;Letter from New Delhi: Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern Insights into Ancient Medicine,&quot; authored by Hari Sharma, then of The Ohio State University College of Medicine and now of The Ohio State University College of Medicine&#x27;s Center for Integrative Medicine, Brihaspati Dev Triguna, of the All India Ayur-Veda Congress, and Deepak Chopra, of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine 

A subsequent article in &quot;JAMA&quot; by Andrew A. Skolnick alleged that the authors of the first article had not disclosed their financial ties with organizations that sell the products and services about which they wrote. The article also investigated the marketing practices surrounding Ayur-Veda products and services. It was alleged there was a &quot;widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media&quot;. It challenged the Sharma et al. claim that Maharishi Ayur-Veda was more cost effective than standard medical care. Additionally, the article reported that in the late 1980s, herbal researcher Tony Nader, at the time a PhD candidate in neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been criticized for misrepresenting his research promoting Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) herbal products as being sponsored by MIT and Harvard. The article reported that Nader and David Orme-Johnson were criticized by the organizers of the Annual Meeting of the Society for Economic Botany, which was held at the University of Illinois in Chicago in June 1987. According to the organizers, Nader and Orme-Johnson submitted research abstracts for the conference, but the presentation that they made had little to do with the abstracts. Instead it was a promotion for the herbal remedies of MAPI and for Transcendental Meditation. The &quot;JAMA&quot; article quotes a former TM teacher and chair of the TM center in Washington, D.C., as saying that he had been told to deceive the media.

A letter to the editor by Chopra and Sharma was published in &quot;JAMA&quot; in October 1991. Chopra and Sharma wrote that many of the criticisms they had received in letters to the editor were inflammatory and had depended heavily on emotional and unfounded charges, without sound scientific backing and few references. They went on to say that the criticisms were directed largely at the TM organization, rather than to the approaches of Maharishi Ayur-Veda. Andrew Skolnick, in a letter to the editor of &quot;JAMA&quot;, says Chopra and Sharma did not deny and made no apology that they had concealed from &quot;JAMA&quot; their financial ties to organizations selling and marketing the products and services about which they wrote, and claimed to have no such conflicts of interest on their signed author&#x27;s form. Skolnick later published an account of how &quot;JAMA&quot; was deceived. The journal &quot;Science&quot; summarized the issue as &quot;an ugly episode that has implications for all scientific journals and for scientists who could possibly be construed as having a conflict of interest&quot;.
In response, two TM organizations then headed by Deepak Chopra sued Skolnick, &quot;JAMA&quot; editor George Lundberg, and the AMA in 1992, seeking an injunction and $194 million in damages. The suit alleged Skolnick&#x27;s news report on TM&#x27;s health care products and services was libelous and that it tortuously interfered with their business interests. In August 1992, in a noted decision, the trial court rejected the plaintiff&#x27;s motion to enjoin &quot;JAMA&quot; and Skolnick under the Illinois Deceptive Practices Act from publishing statements about them and Maharishi Ayurveda, observing that the plaintiffs did not allege that the statements about them had been false or misleading, and holding that &quot;plaintiffs have little likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their disparagement claim&quot;, and that &quot;JAMA&quot; and Skolnick&#x27;s alleged defamatory statements were protected as &quot;fair comment and criticism&quot; on an issue of public concern. Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed without prejudice in March 1993. In 1997, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that according to Chopra&#x27;s lawyer the suit was &quot;settled for an undisclosed amount.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; later published a correction and clarified that there was no monetary settlement. Philip Goldberg&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;American Veda&quot; says that the lawsuit was settled in 1993.

===Flint===

In 1994, Jonie Flint sued Chopra, the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Palo Alto California and Brihaspati Dev Triguna over her husband David&#x27;s death from leukemia. Two months following a visit to the center at which a primordial sound treatment was prescribed by Chopra, Triguna declared Flint cured of leukemia. Flint followed other Maharishi Ayur-Veda treatments at Triguna&#x27;s directions over a period of nine months, at a cost of more than $10,000, but died of leukemia. Flint was assisted in filing her lawsuit by the National Council Against Health Fraud. Chopra&#x27;s attorneys said that the suit against him would be dismissed before trial. They said that David Flint was desperate and that Chopra saw him for 45 minutes for spiritual counsel and gave him a primordial sound technique. They also said that Flint signed a form saying that he understood that sound therapy wasn&#x27;t a substitute for conventional therapies, and that the form Flint signed also absolved Chopra and his organization of responsibility in the event the treatment was unsuccessful.

<text>Jonathan Peter Culshaw (born 2 June 1968) is an English actor, comedian and impressionist. He is best known for his work on the radio comedy &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; since 2000.

Culshaw has voiced a number of characters for ITV shows including &quot;2DTV&quot; (2001), &quot;Spitting Image&quot; (1994–96) and &quot;Newzoids&quot; (2015–2016), as well as appearing in &quot;The Impressions Show&quot; alongside Debra Stephenson from 2009 until 2011.

==Early life and career==
Culshaw was born on 2 June 1968 in Ormskirk, Lancashire, and educated at St Bede&#x27;s RC High School and St John Rigby College, Wigan.

Culshaw&#x27;s radio career began in hospital radio in Ormskirk. His first job was at Red Rose Radio (now Rock FM) in Preston in 1987, where, even then, he used to occasionally read the weather in the voice of Frank Bruno. He did voice-over work, then was catapulted to prominence with &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, where he voiced around forty characters, including John Major in the 1990s, who was then the Prime Minister.

For around four years in the late 1980s, Culshaw was a DJ on commercial radio station Viking FM, based in Hull, and also had a breakfast show on Pennine Radio (now the Pulse of West Yorkshire) and Radio Wave in Blackpool. It was a receptionist at Viking FM who persuaded Culshaw that he should go onstage with his impressions and make it his living. Culshaw later appeared on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Bad Week&quot;, appeared as a guest on the BBC Two &quot;Star Trek Night&quot; quiz in August 1996, and was also a regular guest on the Chris Moyles afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 from 1998 to 2002, where he would phone up commercial organisations such as a Kwik-Fit garage in the voice of Patrick Moore or Obi-Wan Kenobi politely requesting whether they could service his X-wing fighter and how much time it would take.

==Career==
===Radio===
Culshaw rose to fame in January 1998 while working with Steve Penk on Capital Radio, by impersonating William Hague and succeeding in contacting Number 10 Downing Street. He was put through to Tony Blair who, despite instantly discovering the ruse, had a lengthy conversation with him until a member of Blair&#x27;s staff ended the call.

Culshaw was one of the stars of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, which ran from 2000 to 2007 as well as the BBC Two television series of the same name, from 2002 until 2007. The radio series of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; made a return to BBC Radio 4 in 2014.

In 2018, Culshaw gave a rare dramatic performance as David Bowie in the BBC radio play &quot;The Final Take: Bowie in the Studio&quot;, an imagined account of Bowie as he works on his final album and looks back over his life.

===Television===
Between 2001 and 2002, Culshaw hosted a programme on ITV called &quot;Alter Ego&quot;, where he interviewed male celebrities in their own style of speaking, a form of simultaneous translation. Culshaw also appeared on &quot;2DTV&quot;, a cartoon version of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. In early 2004, using the same production team, he had his own programme, &quot;The Impressionable Jon Culshaw&quot; commissioned for ITV.

In 2005, Culshaw was a celebrity contestant on &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; and was the fourth person to become eliminated. In the same year, he also appeared in the BBC General Election coverage, in the guises of Tony Blair and George W. Bush. In January 2006, Culshaw presented one series of the BBC programme &quot;Jon Culshaw&#x27;s Commercial Breakdown&quot;. In November 2007 and December 2008, Culshaw, a keen amateur astronomer, appeared on &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; impersonating a young Sir Patrick Moore. In March 2011, he appeared again on the 700th episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;, reading viewer questions to the panel of experts. Culshaw later appeared two months later reporting on the Northern Lights.

In January 2008, he appeared on &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot;, as part of a pub-quiz team with Chris Moyles. In May 2008, Culshaw appeared in the BBC documentary series &quot;Comedy Map of Britain&quot;.

Since 2009, Culshaw has starred in the BBC One comedy sketch show &quot;The Impressions Show&quot; alongside Debra Stephenson.

On 13 March 2010, Jon was a guest judge on the BBC One charity programme &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot;. In 2013, he appeared as a contestant on the show, where he performed a routine to &quot;Praise You&quot; by Fatboy Slim. However, he was eliminated by the public vote.

In 2010, Culshaw appeared in the television series, &quot;Missing&quot; as Des Martin. In November 2013, Culshaw appeared in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

Since 2015, he has voiced a number of characters alongside Debra Stephenson for the ITV sketch show &quot;Newzoids&quot;. A second series aired in 2016.

In 2017, Jon was one of the minor hosts of the Channel 5 documentary series &quot;Secrets of the National Trust&quot;. In February 2021, Culshaw appeared on Celebrity Mastermind, doing &quot;Doctor Who – the Jon Pertwee Years&quot; for his specialist subject.

In 2021, Jon appeared as a guest on Celebrity Yorkshire Auction House, series 1 episode 2. He entertained the auction company&#x27;s staff when they collected his sale items, and the buyers that attended the auction. He also donated all of the proceeds of the sale to charity.

Until 2023, Culshaw narrated the Channel 4 property series &#x27;Sun, Sea, and Selling Houses&#x27;.

===Film===
In film, Culshaw appeared as Tony Blair in the 2004 film &quot;&quot; and voiced Piston Pete in the 2008 film &quot;Agent Crush&quot;.

===Impressions===
Some of Culshaw&#x27;s most famous impressions include former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson, Obi-Wan Kenobi (as portrayed by Alec Guinness), Russell Crowe, Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, Ozzy Osbourne, comedian Michael McIntyre, presenter Dale Winton, newsreader Brian Perkins, Sir Patrick Moore, Tom Baker and Les Dawson.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

Culshaw has appeared in numerous &quot;Doctor Who&quot; related productions in various roles. This first came to fruition with his impersonation of Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor for both the TV and radio versions of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;.

He has also appeared in the webcast &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot; and audio drama &quot;The Kingmaker&quot;. In the latter, he got to perform his Tom Baker impression &quot;for real&quot; (voicing tape recordings of the fourth Doctor), although his nominal part was that of Earl Rivers. In 2019, he appeared in a trilogy of Doctor Who audio dramas alongside Fifth Doctor Peter Davison, playing the shape-shifting android Kamelion. He later started playing Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart alongside Tim Treloar as the Third Doctor.

==Awards and honours==
In 2006, Culshaw received an honorary fellowship from the University of Central Lancashire in Preston. In December 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Edge Hill University. In July 2013 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Leicester. In March 2019, Culshaw sat for British impressionist artist Sherree Valentine-Daines for a portrait painted to mark the opening of the Clarendon Fine Art Gallery in Hampstead, London.

==Charity==
Culshaw is a celebrity ambassador for the charity Trekstock.

Culshaw also supports the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation.

Culshaw regularly presents Gold Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Awards as part of his support for the charity.

In 2016 he participated in the Great North Run to raise funds for the Jon Egging Trust, a charity set up in memory of the Red Arrows flight lieutenant who died while flying at the Red Arrows Display at the Bournemouth Air Festival.

<text>Paparazzi are independent photographers who take pictures of high-profile people, such as actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, and other celebrities who go about their daily life routines. Paparazzi are known for their relentless pursuit of celebrities, often using long lenses and speedlite flashes or even following them in vehicles to capture personal, unflattering, or private moments. The photographs taken by paparazzi are commonly sold to tabloids, gossip magazines, and websites, where they are published to attract attention and increase sales. This type of invasive photography is often controversial because it can violate the privacy of the subjects involved.

==Description==
Paparazzi tend to be independent contractors, unaffiliated with mainstream media organizations, who track high-profile people and take pictures of them opportunistically. Some journalists have described the behavior of paparazzi as stalking, and anti-stalking laws in many countries address the issue by seeking to reduce harassment of public figures and celebrities, especially when they are with their children. Some public figures and celebrities, such as Adele, Prince Harry, and Kristen Stewart, have expressed concern at the extent to which paparazzi go to invade their personal space. The filing and receiving of judicial support for restraining orders against paparazzi has increased, as have lawsuits with judgments against them.

Paparazzi are often a problem for celebrities, as the latter have become increasingly objectified and worshipped by fans (see: Celebrity worship syndrome), especially through social and mass media. This happens because constant exposure to and coverage of these figures leads people to treat celebrities like they are their social intimates, whom they admire, gossip about, or copy habits from. A 2009 study which anonymously interviewed a number of celebrities showed that it was a common sentiment that being pursued by paparazzi causes a loss of personal life, lack of anonymity, and a feeling of constantly being watched. This causes them to compensate by forming separate identities, one an image offered to the public, and one reserved for moments of privacy and intimacy.

It is also a common practice for celebrities to willingly invite paparazzi to take photographs of them, the main reason being to maintain or increase their relevance and exposure.

==Famous paparazzi==
Walter Santesso portrays Paparazzo in the 1960 film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, marking the character as the eponym of the word &quot;paparazzi&quot;.

Ron Galella was well known for his obsessive stalking of several celebrities, most notably Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Galella has been defined &quot;the Godfather of the U.S. paparazzi culture&quot;.

Rino Barillari is an Italian paparazzo known as &quot;The King of Paparazzi&quot; in Italy. He was awarded the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1998.

==History==

===Precursors===
Intrusive photojournalism has existed since the nineteenth century. The invention of quicker and more portable cameras facilitated the process of capturing unauthorized celebrity photographs and publishing them in illustrated newspapers, which started appearing in the 1890s. One of the first instances of a &quot;snatched photograph&quot; was in 1898, when two photographers were able to capture a photograph of Otto von Bismarck on his deathbed through bribery.

===Etymology===
A news photographer named Paparazzo (played by Walter Santesso in the 1960 film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; directed by Federico Fellini) is the eponym of the word &quot;paparazzi&quot;. In his book &quot;The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins&quot;, Robert Hendrickson writes that Fellini named the &quot;hyperactive photographer ... after Italian slang for &#x27;mosquito&#x27;&quot;. As Fellini said in his interview to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;&quot;Paparazzo&quot; ... suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging.&quot; Those versions of the word&#x27;s origin are sometimes contested. For example, in the Abruzzo dialect spoken by Ennio Flaiano, co-scriptwriter of &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, the term &quot;paparazzo&quot; refers to the local clam, &quot;Venerupis decussata&quot;, and is also used as a metaphor for the shutter of a camera lens.

Further, in an interview with Fellini&#x27;s screenwriter Flaiano, he said the name came from the book &quot;Sulla riva dello Jonio&quot; (1957), a translation by Italian poet Margherita Guidacci of &quot;By the Ionian Sea&quot;, a 1901 travel narrative in southern Italy by Victorian writer George Gissing. He further states that either Fellini or Flaiano opened the book at random, saw the name of a restaurant owner, Coriolano Paparazzo, and decided to use it for the photographer. This story is further documented by a variety of Gissing scholars and in the book &quot;A Sweet and Glorious Land. Revisiting the Ionian Sea&quot;.
By the late 1960s, the word, usually in the Italian plural form &quot;paparazzi&quot;, had entered English as a generic term for intrusive photographers. A person who has been photographed by the paparazzi is said to have been &quot;papped&quot;.

====In other languages====
A transliteration of &quot;paparazzi&quot; is used in several languages that do not use the Latin alphabet, including Japanese (), Korean (), Ukrainian (), Russian (), Bulgarian (папараци), Thai () and Hebrew (). Chinese uses , meaning &quot;puppy squad&quot;. Khmer uses (anak bramanh roub).

===Social media era===
For the majority of the history of paparazzi from the 1950s–2000s, paparazzi have been viewed as &quot;invasive, aggressive, and greedy men&quot; who would commonly clash with public figures, but they have since become calmer and less combative. Social media grew in size during the 2010s, which made shooting sensational photos more accessible to the public and allowed celebrities to better control what pictures of them were publicized. This in turn cheapened the value of sensational photos, and made the paparazzi industry riskier and less profitable. Although tensions still remain and paparazzi are commonly viewed negatively by the public and many celebrities, more celebrities have begun to regularly (or during a setback) invite, befriend, or ask paparazzi to take photos of them to sustain their careers, such as Kim Kardashian and Rihanna. (However, since the mid-2000s, social media has contributed to the industry&#x27;s growth in Hindi cinema and more invasion of privacy there.) Public distrust has also increased around staged paparazzi photos.

==Legality==

Due to the reputation of paparazzi as a nuisance, several countries and states restrict their activities by passing laws and curfews, and by staging events in which paparazzi are specifically not allowed to take photographs. In the United States, celebrity news organizations are protected by the First Amendment. In other words, generally speaking, taking photos or videos of people in public areas without their consent is considered to be an acceptable act. This standard extends to even potentially embarrassing situations. For example, in July 2012, when Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr leaned over to buckle her son into a car seat, her thong underwear peeked over her jeans to create a whale tail. Because she was in a public location, the streets of New York City, the photographer not only had the right to take photos but also circulate them publicly. However, to protect the children of celebrities, California passed Senate Bill No. 606 in September 2013. The purpose of the bill is to stop paparazzi from taking pictures of children or wards in a harassing manner because of their parent&#x27;s occupation. This law increased the penalty for harassment of children. California Civil Code sections 1708.7 and 1708.8 explicitly address stalking and invasion of physical privacy.

===Injunctions===

In 1972, paparazzo photographer Ron Galella sued Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the former First Lady ordered her Secret Service agents to destroy Galella&#x27;s camera and film following an encounter in New York City&#x27;s Central Park. Kennedy counter-sued claiming harassment. The trial lasted three weeks and became a groundbreaking case regarding photojournalism and the role of paparazzi. In &quot;Galella v. Onassis&quot;, Kennedy obtained a restraining order to keep Galella away from her and her children. The restriction was later reduced to . The trial is a focal point in &quot;Smash His Camera&quot;, a 2010 documentary film by director Leon Gast.

In 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and partner Dodi Fayed were killed in a limousine crash as their driver was speeding, trying to escape paparazzi. Another person, Trevor Jones, survived. An inquest jury investigated the role of paparazzi in the incident, but no one was convicted. The official inquests into the accident attributed the causes to the speed and manner of driving of the Mercedes, as well as the following vehicles, and the impairment of the judgment of the Mercedes driver, Henri Paul, through alcohol.

In 1999, the &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; of Hong Kong was found guilty of &quot;scandalizing the court&quot;, an extremely rare charge where the judiciary find that the newspaper&#x27;s conduct undermines confidence in the administration of justice. The charge was brought after the newspaper had published abusive articles challenging the judiciary&#x27;s integrity and accusing it of bias in a lawsuit the paper had instigated over a photo of a pregnant Faye Wong. The paper had also arranged for a &quot;dog team&quot; (slang for paparazzi in the Chinese language) to track a judge for 72 hours, to provide the judge with first-hand experience of what paparazzi do.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Style &amp; Design special issue in 2005 ran a story entitled &quot;Shooting Star&quot;, in which Mel Bouzad, one of the top paparazzi in Los Angeles at the time, claimed to have made US$150,000 for a picture of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Georgia after their breakup. &quot;If I get a picture of Britney and her baby,&quot; Bouzad claimed, &quot;I&#x27;ll be able to buy a house in those hills (above Sunset Boulevard).&quot; &quot;Paparazzi&quot; author Peter Howe told &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;celebrities need a higher level of exposure than the rest of us so it is a two-way street. The celebrities manipulate.&quot;

In 2006, Former Brazilian Model Daniella Cicarelli went through a scandal when a paparazzi caught video footage of her having sex with her boyfriend on a beach in Spain, which was posted on YouTube. After fighting in the court, it was decided in her favor, causing YouTube to be blocked in Brazil. This caused major havoc among Brazilians, including threatening a boycott against MTV Brasil, where Cicarelli worked, unless she was fired. The block only lasted a few days, and Cicarelli was not dismissed. The legal action backfired as the court decided she had no expectation of privacy by having sex in a public location. Cicarelli appealed the decision, and the case was finally settled in 2015 with the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil awarding Cicarelli and her boyfriend in the video damages of R$250,000 (US$64,000) from Google.

Following the publication of photographs showing Catherine, Princess of Wales sunbathing whilst topless at the French holiday home of her husband&#x27;s cousin Viscount Linley, it was announced on September 14, 2012, that the royal couple were to launch legal action against the French edition of &quot;Closer&quot; magazine. It was the first time that a senior British royal has sued in a court outside the UK. The reason cited for the legal action is that the Duchess had a right of privacy whilst at the home—the magazine responded that the pictures had been taken from the public highway. The injunction was granted on September 18, 2012, and the publishers of the magazine were ordered not to publish the photographs in France and not to sell the images. The publishers were also ordered to hand over the original material of the published pictures under threat of a €10,000 fine for every day of delay in doing so. In 2017, the magazine was ordered to pay €100,000 in damages to Catherine and William, and another €90,000 fine to two staffers.

In the United Kingdom, Sienna Miller, Amy Winehouse, and Lily Allen have won injunctions that prevent the paparazzi from following them and gathering outside their houses. Miller was awarded £53,000.

In 2013, rapper Kanye West faced assault charges after attacking a photojournalist. He stated that he would fight to get the law changed, so celebrities can profit from paparazzi&#x27;s work.
===Other measures===
In addition to legal action, celebrities have taken other measures to avoid paparazzi. When Daniel Radcliffe was performing in the play &quot;Equus&quot; in London, he wore the same hat and jacket every day for six months, to make the photos look old and therefore &quot;unpublishable&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The E! network program &quot;Celebrities Uncensored&quot; used footage of celebrities made by paparazzi.

Lady Gaga released the single &quot;Paparazzi&quot; in 2009 for the album &quot;The Fame&quot;, which she described to be &quot;about wooing the paparazzi to fall in love with me&quot;. It received critical acclaim and charted in the top ten in the United States and the United Kingdom.

<text>Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation (more commonly known as the Iraq Dossier, the February Dossier or the Dodgy Dossier) was a 2003 briefing document for the British prime minister Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party government. It was issued to journalists on 3 February 2003 by Alastair Campbell, Blair&#x27;s Director of Communications and Strategy, and concerned Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Along with the earlier &quot;September Dossier&quot;, these documents were ultimately used by the British government to justify its involvement in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

==Dossier==
The term &quot;Dodgy Dossier&quot; was first coined by online polemical magazine &quot;Spiked&quot; in relation to the &quot;September Dossier&quot;. The term was later employed by &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; when its reporter, Julian Rush, was made aware of Glen Rangwala&#x27;s discovery that much of the work in the &quot;Iraq Dossier&quot; had been plagiarised from various unattributed sources including a thesis produced by a student at California State University. The most notable source was an article by then graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi, entitled &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Security and Intelligence Network: A Guide and Analysis&quot;.

Whole sections of Marashi&#x27;s writings on &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Special Security Organisation&quot; were repeated verbatim including typographical errors, while certain amendments were made to strengthen the tone of the alleged findings (e.g., &quot;monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq&quot; became &quot;spying on foreign embassies in Iraq&quot;, and &quot;aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes&quot; became &quot;supporting terrorist organisations in hostile regimes&quot;).

In its opening paragraph the briefing document claimed that it drew &quot;upon a number of sources, including intelligence material&quot;. Before the document&#x27;s release it had been praised by Tony Blair and United States Secretary of State Colin Powell as further intelligence and quality research. The day after Channel 4&#x27;s exposé, Blair&#x27;s office issued a statement admitting that a mistake was made in not crediting its sources, but did not concede that the quality of the document&#x27;s text was affected.

The claims contained in the &quot;September&quot; and &#x27;Iraq&#x27; Dossiers were called into question when weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were not found in Iraq, and the dossiers were encompassed by House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee inquiry. The Committee subsequently reported that the sources should have been credited, and that the dossier should have been checked by ministers before being released. The dossier had only been reviewed by a group of civil servants operating under Alastair Campbell. The committee stated that the publication was &quot;almost wholly counter-productive&quot; and in the event only served to undermine the credibility of the government&#x27;s case.

The controversy over the &quot;Iraq Dossier&quot; was mentioned frequently in the government&#x27;s conflict with the BBC over the claim in the September Dossier that Iraq could deploy biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so, and the controversy surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly. Andrew Gilligan, the BBC journalist who wrote a report which claimed that the September Dossier had been deliberately exaggerated, stated before the Hutton Inquiry that recalling the February Dossier had led him to file his report based on his interview with Dr. Kelly without seeking confirmation from other sources. Whether or not the September Dossier was inconsistent with the original intelligence, it was altered in ways that made it inconsistent with itself.

The dossier became a point of amusement in British politics. During one Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Michael Howard (then leader of the Opposition), informed Blair, &quot;I have got a great big dossier on his past and I haven&#x27;t even had to sex it up.&quot; The term &quot;Dodgy Dossier&quot; was used again in January 2017, in reference to the &quot;Steele dossier&quot; on a supposed sex scandal involving US President Donald Trump.
